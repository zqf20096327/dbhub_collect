# COORD-Harness

<p align="center">
  <strong>Two different AI coding agents. One codebase. One database that keeps them honest.</strong><br>
  COORD-Harness lets a Claude Code session and a Codex session — plus any other MCP client,

## What this is, in plain words

Two AI coding agents — say a **Claude Code** session and a **Codex** session — are both
working on your repository. Each is a separate process with its own context window, its own
idea of what it is doing, and no way to see the other one. Left to themselves they edit the
same file at the same time, redo work the other already finished, both report the same task
as complete, and each marks its own output as reviewed.

COORD-Harness is the layer that makes that stop. It is **one SQLite file on your machine**
that every agent reads and writes through a small typed vocabulary:

- An agent that wants work **claims** a row. The claim carries a **lease**, so if that agent
  dies the work returns to circulation instead of sitting "in progress" forever.
- An agent that wants to give work away performs a **handoff**. The row's assignee changes,
  and the previous owner's next claim attempt **fails with an error** instead of quietly
  succeeding.
- An agent that wants to finish must point at the artifact it **declared up front**. The file
  has to exist, be non-empty, and be tracked in Git's index. Saying "done" is not enough.
- An agent **cannot pass its own review**. A verdict written by the same lane that authored
  the work is recorded and then does not count — `classify_verdict_status()` returns
  `self_verdict` and the row stays unreviewed.

The two agents never talk to each other. There is no chat channel between them, no message
bus, no sync protocol. Everything either one knows about the other, it learned by reading the
same database. That sounds austere, and it is the entire trick: a message can be missed,
contradicted, or quietly ignored, but a row is either claimed or it is not, and the claim
names who holds it and when the lease expires.

Around that file sit surfaces so a human can watch without joining in — a terminal board, a
loopback web console, a macOS menu-bar glance, a native Cockpit window, an iOS client. None
of them can mutate a claim.

A single agent in a chat window needs none of this. A **fleet** does — several
agents, of different kinds, working the same large repository across days, where
no one process lives long enough to remember what happened and no human is
watching every minute.

`coordharness` is the local-first machinery that makes that fleet durable. Claude
Code, Codex, generic MCP clients, shell automation, and local CPU/GPU jobs share
one typed operating vocabulary without making any individual client the
authority.

**Nothing here is a hosted service.** It is one database, one machine, one trusted
user account, and a handful of processes that agree to write through the same
door.

> **Distribution:** this repository is the public source for COORD-Harness. It does not claim a hosted service, package-index publication, App Store availability, or signed binary distribution.

## What you can actually do with it

Everything below is implemented in this repository. Maturity per capability is in
[Maturity at a glance](#maturity-at-a-glance) and machine-readable in
[`docs/feature-status.json`](docs/feature-status.json); nothing here is a roadmap item.

**Run two agents on one repository without them colliding.**
Each agent takes a `lane` (`claude` and `codex` by default) and a stable session identity.
`coord claim` gives one agent exclusive ownership of a row; a second lane trying the same row
is refused by name. Before writing, an agent can declare *which parts of the tree it intends
to touch* with `coord claim --write-scope` or `coord declare-write-set`, and any agent can ask
`coord conflicts` which currently-held claims have overlapping scopes — so two agents editing
the same directory is a question you can answer before the edit, not after the merge.

**Add more than two agents.** The lane vocabulary is configuration, not a fixed pair:
`COORD_LANES=claude,codex,gemini` makes `gemini` a first-class lane that registers sessions,
claims rows, receives handoffs, and reviews the others' work. Two invariants hold at any lane
count: a lane cannot hand work to itself, and a lane cannot pass its own work.

**Keep a backlog agents pull from on their own.** `coord create` adds proof-gated work items;
rows persist for the life of the project and nothing is deleted on completion, so a board
accumulates. An agent starting cold does not need to be told what to do — it asks
(`coord board`, or MCP `preflight` / `next_work`) and picks up the next eligible row itself.

**Survive agents dying.** Claims are leased, not permanent — one hour by default
(`LEASE_DEFAULT_S = 3600`), renewed by a heartbeat. Status is never stored: it is derived at
read time from declared intent, lease validity, and whether the recorded pid is still alive,
so nothing can sit at "running" because a process crashed under it. Claiming or
conflict-checking a specific row also releases *that row's* expired claim inline. Sweeping the
whole board is a separate, explicit command — `coord-reaper` releases expired claims, reaps
zombie sessions, and finalises dead runs; it is **not** wired into any `coord` subcommand and
is yours to schedule. Run it with `--dry-run` first: the preview executes the real reaper
logic against a disposable snapshot, so it cannot drift from what a real run would do.

**Move work between agents deliberately.** `coord handoff` is a typed, fenced transfer that
demands the exact row version, owner, and event heads; `coord reassign` is the one-command
twin that snapshots those fences for you and still fails closed if another writer changes them
first. The handoff carries the task, why it matters, evidence refs, acceptance criteria, and
the artifact path that must exist before the work can be called done.

**Let agents talk mid-run without taking each other's work.** `coord note` posts an
append-only message to another lane, attached to a row, carrying *no authority at all* — it
cannot change ownership, status, or verdict. `coord inbox` reads what arrived, newest first,
and reports what it did not show.

**Make agents review each other, and make the review mean something.** `coord request-audit`
asks the other lane to look at a row you authored; `coord verdict` records `PASS`, `FLAG`, or
`BLOCKED` on the *other* lane's work. Reviewedness is computed, never stored — see
[Independent review](#independent-review-why-you-want-your-agents-to-disagree). `coord sign-off`
is the human override, recorded as such.

**Refuse completion that has no proof.** Every work item declares a `done_signal` when it is
created. `coord done` succeeds only when that exact artifact exists, is non-empty, resolves
under the project root, and is tracked in Git's index — with a narrow exemption for artifact
kinds that structurally cannot live in Git.

**Supervise long local processes instead of babysitting an LLM loop.** `coord-jobs launch`
runs a command in its own process group under an RSS cap, re-validating the claim fence inside
a transaction immediately before it starts, writing a compact JSON progress sidecar
(`state`, `pct`, `step`, `rate`, `eta_s`, …) and an authoritative `runs` row carrying the real
pid and pgid. `coord-jobs status` prints the read-only snapshot.

**Run local models under a real lock.** `coord-models list | check | run` drives a declared
model catalog with a hardware-readiness probe and a bounded generation request; GPU-requiring
models execute under a process-held `fcntl` lock, because one machine has one GPU.

**Carry context between sessions without dragging a transcript along.** A fresh session boots
from a small capsule and expands only the source-bound context it needs. Behind that: a
bitemporal fact ledger with supersession chains, a full-text index over your docs, an
append-only accepted-memory store with immutable generations, and a federator that fans one
query across all of them and returns a byte-bounded, deduplicated, provenance-carrying result.
Agents *propose* memory; proposals are rate-limited, require an evidence pointer, and — like
verdicts — **cannot be accepted by their own author**.

**Watch the whole fleet.** `coord board` in the terminal, `coord-board` on
`http://127.0.0.1:7870` with Board / Mesh / Map / Atlas, a macOS menu-bar app with a progress
ring, a native Cockpit window, and an iOS client. `tools/export_static_board.py` writes a
self-contained `index.html` you can open from disk with no server at all.

**Route work by measured usage.** A local hash-chained ledger records token and cost metrics;
`coord route` reports which provider has headroom. It is advice — it reads the ledger and
writes nothing.

**Check your own install.** `coord doctor` is a read-only health report that opens nothing it
does not have to, writes nothing at all, and exits 0 only when every finding passes.
`coord onboard` verifies agent instructions, configs, database, and MCP wiring.

**Drop it into your agents as a package.** This repository ships a Claude Code plugin manifest
(`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`), one skill (`operating-coordharness`), and five slash commands —
`coord-start`, `coord-claim`, `coord-close`, `coord-handoff`, `coord-recover` — mirrored
**byte-identically** under `.claude/` for Claude Code and `.agents/` for Codex, so neither
vendor gets a better-maintained copy than the other.

## Install

Requires Python 3.11 or newer and Git. Nothing below configures a provider account
or a background service.

**One command**, on any OS with Python 3.11+ (no Xcode or XcodeGen required for
this base path):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0marm0/COORD-Harness.git && cd COORD-Harness && ./scripts/setup.sh
```

It creates `.venv`, installs the package with MCP support, and owns the clone's
`.coordharness/coord.db`. By default it does **not** touch anything outside the
clone: Claude Code/Codex client registration is opt-in via `--register-clients`,
and the native macOS/iOS app lane is opt-in via `--native` (macOS + Xcode
command-line tools + [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) only — a
no-op notice on other OSes). `./scripts/setup-macos.sh` — kept only as a 2-line
shim to this script for existing doc references — used to default both flags on;
see [Native projections](#native-projections).

**Manual, five commands** — no Xcode required, works on Linux too:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0marm0/COORD-Harness.git
cd COORD-Harness
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e '.[mcp,dev]'
```

Core CLI and library use only the Python standard library. The `[mcp]` extra installs
the MCP runtime; `[dev]` installs the test and lint toolchain — install `-e .` alone
for just the core.

Verify entry points (either path leaves a `.venv` at the repo root):

```bash
.venv/bin/coord --help
.venv/bin/coord-board --help
.venv/bin/coord-jobs --help
.venv/bin/coord-models --help
.venv/bin/coord-reaper --help
```

Installing the package puts six executables on the path — those five plus `coord-mcp`, which
an MCP client launches rather than a human. See
[The complete verb surface](#the-complete-verb-surface) for what each one is for.

### Connect an MCP client

Point each client at the same project root and database:

**Claude Code**, from the repository you want to coordinate:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope project --transport stdio \
  -e COORD_PROJECT_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/project \
  -e COORD_DB=/absolute/path/to/project/.coordharness/coord.db \
  -e COORD_DEPLOYMENT_PROFILE=generic \
  coordharness -- /absolute/path/to/COORD-Harness/.venv/bin/coord-mcp
```

**Codex**, registering the same executable and authority:

```bash
codex mcp add coordharness \
  --env COORD_PROJECT_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/project \
  --env COORD_DB=/absolute/path/to/project/.coordharness/coord.db \
  --env COORD_DEPLOYMENT_PROFILE=generic \
  -- /absolute/path/to/COORD-Harness/.venv/bin/coord-mcp
```

**Generic MCP client:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "coordharness": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/COORD-Harness/.venv/bin/coord-mcp",
      "env": {
        "COORD_PROJECT_ROOT": "/absolute/path/to/project",
        "COORD_DB": "/absolute/path/to/project/.coordharness/coord.db"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

These registrations use absolute paths because they point a client at a repository it
does not necessarily run in. The repository's own checked-in `.mcp.json` and
`.codex/config.toml` are the other case: a project-scoped client launched *in* this
repository, where `./.venv/bin/python`, `COORD_PROJECT_ROOT="."`, and
`COORD_DB=".coordharness/coord.db"` resolve against that working directory and stay
free of any developer's absolute path. Use relative paths in-repo and absolute paths
whenever the MCP process does not inherit the coordinated repository as its working
directory — see [agent onboarding](docs/agent-onboarding.md). Full client setup, tool
groups, and a complete session sequence live in
[MCP integration](docs/mcp-integration.md) and
[MCP server reference](docs/mcp-server.md).

### Try it: claim a row, produce proof, complete it

Run this in a disposable clone. The demo data is synthetic; set `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`
when a fixed capture clock is required (`python -m coordharness.demo` still works too,
if you prefer invoking the module directly).

```bash
coord demo
coord board --group-by module

# ML-204 is a planned Codex row in the synthetic board. COORD_ACTOR and
# COORD_SESSION_ID outrank every ambient identity, so this works even inside
# a Claude Code shell, where CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID would otherwise win.
export COORD_ACTOR=codex COORD_SESSION_ID=codex:demo
coord claim ML-204 --step "documenting the quantisation pass"

mkdir -p docs/reports
printf '%s\n' '# Quantisation for the local runtime' '' 'Synthetic demo proof.' \
  > docs/reports/ml-204.md
git add docs/reports/ml-204.md

coord done ML-204 --artifact docs/reports/ml-204.md
coord board --group-by module
coord doctor    # still PASS, exit 0, with the completion recorded
```

`coord` creates `.coordharness/coord.db` and applies migrations on first use. The
`done` command succeeds because `ML-204` declares `docs/reports/ml-204.md` as its
`done_signal`, the non-empty proof exists, and Git's current index tracks
it. Staging is sufficient; no commit is required — but an untracked proof of any
type, or a project that is not a Git repository at all, is refused with
`artifact proof does not exist or is incomplete`. The only artifacts exempt from
tracking are the kinds that structurally cannot live in Git — databases, dataset
dumps, serialized models, archives — listed in `DEFAULT_CUSTODY_EXEMPT_SUFFIXES`
in `src/coordharness/jobs/status.py` and rebindable with
`COORD_COMPLETION_CUSTODY_EXEMPT`. Exempt kinds still have to exist; the
exemption is about custody, not about proof. For a clean reset, remove only the
disposable clone's `.coordharness/` directory; never point cleanup commands at a
broad directory or an unresolved variable.

**Everything at once:**

```bash
./scripts/demo.sh --native
```

Seeds a synthetic board under `var/demo/`, serves it on `http://127.0.0.1:7870`, builds
both macOS apps and launches them against that board. Nothing touches a real database:
the clients are started with `COORD_DB` pointed at the demo, and they are launched as
binaries rather than through `open`, because `open` does not pass environment through.
Add `--reset` to rebuild the board from scratch. `Ctrl-C` stops the server; the apps
are separate processes and are quit from the menu bar and the window.

**Tracked local jobs:**

```bash
# OPS-501 is a planned Codex row in the synthetic demo.
coord claim OPS-501 --step "launching the synthetic telemetry check"

# Copy claim_id and claim_fence exactly from that JSON response.
coord-jobs launch \
  --job-id DEMO-JOB \
  --roadmap-id OPS-501 \
  --session-id codex:demo \
  --claim-id CLAIM_ID_FROM_CLAIM \
  --claim-fence CLAIM_FENCE_FROM_CLAIM \
  -- python -c "import time; [time.sleep(1) for _ in range(5)]"
```

Runnable, narrower walkthroughs live in [`examples/`](examples/). For client wiring,
local data locations, capability boundaries, uninstall, and a clean-machine checklist,
use the [standalone setup guide](docs/standalone-setup.md).

## Point your agent at this repo

Once a client is wired up (above), the fastest orientation is to let the agent read
its own contract instead of paraphrasing it by hand. Paste this into Claude Code or
Codex from the repository you want it to coordinate:

> Read AGENTS.md and set this repository up for yourself. Then run
> `.venv/bin/coord onboard` and show me the receipt.

[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) is the machine-readable operating contract every agent in
this repository follows. `coord onboard` is the command that actually detects the
caller's identity, checks lifecycle policy, and — asked for explicitly — registers
this clone with the MCP clients installed on the machine; the JSON receipt it prints
is the same one [getting started](docs/getting-started.md) and
[agent onboarding](docs/agent-onboarding.md) walk through by hand.

---

## Two agents, one file

This is the part that is easy to overcomplicate, so here it is plainly.

**Claude and Codex never talk to each other directly.** There is no chat channel
between them, no shared queue, no sync protocol. Both read and write **one SQLite
file**, and everything either one knows about the other, it learned by reading it.

That sounds austere, and it is the entire trick. A message can be missed,
contradicted, or quietly ignored. A row in a database cannot: it is either claimed
or it is not, and the claim names who holds it and when the lease expires.

<!-- D2 -->
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/single-authority-flow.svg" alt="Three request shapes — the coord CLI, an MCP tool call, and the Python API — normalize into one identity and lifecycle intent, pass ordered policy checks and a single transaction layer, and land in one coord.db history. There is no client-to-client sync and no mirrored status store." width="100%">
</p>

<p align="center"><sub>Three ways in, one way through. A claim made by <code>coord claim</code>, by <code>claim_work(...)</code> over MCP, and by the Python API are the same row written by the same code. <b>No client-to-client sync. No mirrored status store.</b></sub></p>

### How each agent knows what the other is doing

An agent starts by asking the board, not its colleague. One call returns what is
running, what is blocked, who holds which claim, and what recently changed.
**Awareness is a read, not a broadcast** — which is why it survives an agent
crashing, restarting, or being a different agent than it was last time.

Status is never stored. It is *derived* at read time from the claim lease and
whether the process holding it is still alive. Nothing can be marked "running" by
a process that has died, because nothing marks it running at all.

### Handing work over

A handoff is an **ownership transaction, not a request**. When one agent hands a
row to the other, the row's assignee changes in the database, and the previous
owner's next attempt to claim it **fails with an error** rather than succeeding
quietly.

<!-- D3 -->
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/handoff-sequence.svg" alt="A typed handoff in five steps: Codex owns the row with a stored assignee, version and event heads; a Claude claim is refused with an explicit error; the typed handoff fences on that version and those event heads; the reassignment commits; and Claude's claim then succeeds." width="100%">
</p>

<p align="center"><sub>The refusal is the point. Two agents cannot both believe they own the same work, because the second one to try is told <code>cannot claim work assigned to 'codex'</code>. The fence &mdash; the row's version and its event heads &mdash; makes the transfer atomic against a board that is still moving.</sub></p>

The handoff carries what the receiver actually needs: the task, why it matters,
pointers to the evidence, the acceptance criteria, and a concrete artifact path
that must exist before the work can be called done.

### Talking mid-run without taking the work

Sometimes an agent needs to tell the other something *while it is still working* —
a number moved, an assumption broke, a file is being edited. That is a **note**:
an append-only message attached to a row, addressed to the other lane, carrying
**no authority at all**. It cannot change ownership, status, or verdict.

That is exactly why it is safe. One agent can warn another mid-run without
reaching into its work.

```bash
# Claude, mid-run, tells Codex something it needs before it quotes a number
coord note ML-204 \
  --body "The denominator moved from 8,642 to 8,648 while you were running. Re-read before quoting a rate." \
  --ref docs/coordination-model.md

# Codex, on its next check — newest first, and it says what it did not show
coord inbox
{"count": 20, "unread_total": 46, "not_shown": 26, "order": "newest_first", ...}
```

The inbox reads **newest first**, because the question an agent asks mid-run is
"did anything arrive while I was working", not "let me drain the queue in order".
`--backlog` restores queue order for the case that wants it. It also reports
`unread_total` and `not_shown`, so *"nothing new arrived"* is a fact rather than an
artefact of a limit.

### Why a swarm still shows as one row

When an agent fans out to a dozen subagents, the board does not sprout a dozen
rows. The orchestrator holds **one claim**; the subagents roll up beneath it. The
operator sees one piece of work with one owner, which is the only reading that
stays legible once several agents are working at once.

<!-- D4 -->
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/multi-agent-jobs.svg" alt="One orchestrator session owns a durable work item and its claim; bounded subagents take narrow, non-overlapping packets and return refs and conclusions that roll up to that owner; local CPU and GPU jobs run in tracked lanes with the GPU lane serialized." width="100%">
</p>

<p align="center"><sub>Bounded subagents return refs and conclusions to their owner instead of impersonating peer sessions. Local jobs run as tracked processes in their own lanes &mdash; the GPU lane serialized, because one machine has one GPU.</sub></p>

---

## Independent review: why you want your agents to disagree

Two agents on one problem is not redundancy. It is the only cheap way to find the class of
mistake a single agent cannot find in itself — a plan that is internally consistent and wrong,
a number carried forward from the wrong denominator, a test that passes because it asserts
what the code does rather than what the code should do. An agent that wrote something is the
worst available reviewer of it, and it is worst in a specific way: it will re-derive the same
error from the same premises and report agreement.

So the harness makes independence **structural rather than procedural**. It is not a
convention that the other lane reviews your work; it is a property of the row that a same-lane
verdict cannot satisfy.

<!-- M2 -->
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber

    participant DB as coord.db

    Note over DB: refused. The row is T0, so completion<br/>raises until an independent lane has passed it
    A->>DB: request-audit WORK-1 --task … --why … --ref …
    DB-->>B: the row surfaces in the reviewer lane's queue
    A->>DB: verdict WORK-1 --verdict PASS
    Note over DB: recorded, and it does NOT count.<br/>classify_verdict_status returns self_verdict<br/>and the row stays unreviewed
    B->>DB: verdict WORK-1 --verdict FLAG --ref …
    Note over DB: a negative verdict blocks completion<br/>at any review tier, not just T0
    A->>DB: fix the work, re-stage the artifact

    Note over DB: reviewed — the verdict came from<br/>a lane other than the author's
    A->>DB: done WORK-1 --artifact docs/report.md
    Note over DB: accepted. The declared artifact exists,<br/>is non-empty, and git's index tracks it
```

**Reviewedness is computed, not stored.** There is no boolean anyone can flip. Whether a row
counts as reviewed is derived at read time by `classify_verdict_status()`, and its two
load-bearing rejections are the two ways a fleet fakes a review by accident:

- **`self_verdict`** — the most recent verdict was written by the same lane that authored the
  work. The verdict exists in the event log; it simply does not make the row reviewed.
- **`cross_row_verdict`** — a verdict recorded on some *other* row that merely mentions this
  one in its refs or body. That is the shape a hurried fleet produces on its own: one
  subagent's review pointed at as if it covered a sibling's output. Rejected the same way.

**Independence is lane-level, not call-level.** This is the part that catches people. An
orchestrator that spawns the subagent doing the work *and* the subagent grading it has not
produced independent review, however the two calls are labelled — the schema's notion of
independence is which actor authored the claim, not which prompt issued the verdict. Getting a
real second opinion means routing the review through a different lane's claim.

Because the lane set is configuration, "who may review whom" is a deployment decision:

```bash
export COORD_LANES=claude,codex,gemini
```

Name only agents you would accept as independent eyes on the others' work. Two invariants hold
at any lane count: a lane cannot hand work to itself, and a lane's verdict on its own work
never counts — independence is defined as *inequality with the author*, never membership in a
privileged pair.

### How much review a row needs

Review is tiered, so routine work is not blocked behind ceremony it does not need. Tiers are
declared, but a declared tier is **escalated automatically** when the row's title, acceptance
criteria, or paths match a T0 predicate — irreversible, externally published, ground-truth,
verified-output. You cannot quietly self-certify a dangerous row as routine.

| Tier | What it is for | What the completion gate does |
|---|---|---|
| **T2** | declared docs, analysis, reversible tooling | gates only; no review event required |
| **T1** | the default for code and data | completes now; review is batched, not blocking |
| **T0** | irreversible, external-facing, served numbers, ground truth, cross-lane config | **blocking** — `coord done` raises until an independent lane's verdict passes |

Two things bind at every tier. A **negative** verdict (`FLAG` or `BLOCKED`) blocks completion
regardless of tier, and `coord sign-off` — the human override of the review gate — is recorded
on the row as exactly that, an override, not a pass.

The same no-self-approval rule governs memory: an agent may *propose* a durable memory entry,
but `review_proposal()` refuses a reviewer whose identity equals the proposal's source actor.
Proposals also require an evidence pointer and are rate-limited, so a chatty session cannot
flood the ledger.

[review tiers](docs/review-tiers.md).

## Five-minute start

Already installed (see [Install](#install) above)? This is a second, wider demo —
a fictional multi-row board to look around in, rather than the single claimed row
above. It configures no provider account or background service, and every file it
writes lands in a disposable clone's own gitignored `.coordharness/` directory:

```bash
coord demo                     # seeds .coordharness/coord.db with 37 synthetic rows
coord doctor                   # read-only health report; prints PASS and exits 0
coord board --group-by module  # at a terminal: the grouped human table; add --json for the board as JSON
coord-board                    # read-only web board on http://127.0.0.1:7870
```

`coord doctor` is the answer to *"did that work?"*. It opens nothing it does not
have to, writes nothing at all, prints one JSON document, and **exits 0 only when
every finding passes** — so it is worth running again after anything surprising.

Then open [`/`](http://127.0.0.1:7870/) for triage,
[`/mesh`](http://127.0.0.1:7870/mesh) for the spatial control room,
[`/map`](http://127.0.0.1:7870/map) for analytical lenses, or
[`/ops`](http://127.0.0.1:7870/ops) for the joined operational document.

Keep the database and the state directory together. `coord` and `coord doctor` both
default to `.coordharness/coord.db` under the project root; pointing `--db` somewhere
outside `.coordharness/` still works for the CLI and the board, but `coord doctor`
will report `database_outside_state_root` rather than silently trusting it.

To throw it away, delete that one clone. Never point a cleanup command at a broad
directory or an unresolved variable.

[Getting started](docs/getting-started.md) continues from here: claim a row, satisfy
its declared proof, and complete it.

---

## What an operator actually sees

Everything in this section reads the deterministic, entirely fictional board
created by `python -m coordharness.demo`.

The **Board** is where an operator lives. A destination rail separates *Attention* —
grouped by the plane that raised each row — from overview, work, jobs, graph and
activity. Selecting a row opens one canonical detail plane beside the list rather
than navigating away from it.

(The work table above is this same Board — the destination rail just adds
*Attention*, jobs, graph and activity around it.)

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">
<!-- S3 -->
<a href="docs/assets/screens/board-overview.png"><img src="docs/assets/screens/board-overview.png" alt="Board overview with a quiet destination rail, coherent-generation receipt, lifecycle metrics, running work, and status-based attention rows." width="100%"></a>
<p><sub><b>Overview &middot; decide what needs attention.</b> Live claims and reported steps sit beside blocked, failed, and flagged rows. Progress and ETA appear only when a tracked job reported them.</sub></p>
</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">
<!-- S4 -->
<a href="docs/assets/screens/operations-atlas-overview.png"><img src="docs/assets/screens/operations-atlas-overview.png" alt="Operations Atlas with a one-generation document rail, graph questions, topology, health, and source receipts." width="100%"></a>
<p><sub><b>Atlas &middot; inspect one coherent generation.</b> Snapshot, graph, context, timeline, operations, and read health meet in one source-accounted document.</sub></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Semantic filters are evaluated by the server and carry a complete matched-ID
receipt; saved views store the query token, never a frozen row list. Display
choices — density, grouping — are personal and stored locally, so a link you send
shows the recipient your *population*, never your row height. The command palette
unifies destinations, rows, and non-mutating actions under one keyboard vocabulary,
and shows refused actions **with the reason they were refused**.

A selected row travels between Board, Mesh, Map, and Atlas in the canonical `#sel=`
URL capsule. Each destination either focuses the admitted node or states that this
bounded projection omitted it; none silently turns "not rendered here" into "does
not exist."

### Choose the surface by question

The four areas share one navigation bar, one palette and one typeface contract. The
macOS Cockpit hosts the same four in the same order, so a Windows or Linux operator
on the web build and a Mac operator in the native window see the same product.

| Question | Area | Why |
|---|---|---|
| What is running or needs attention? | **Board** `/` | compact row state and tracked-job telemetry |
| How is the fleet connected in this coherent read? | **Swarm Mesh** `/mesh` | clustered actor-lane/module/dependency layouts, typed motion, traversal, receipts |
| What does the estate look like through one analytical lens? | **Coordination Map** `/map` | dependencies, shape, subjects, order, crossings, context, recorded parallelism |
| What is structurally actionable in this generation? | **Operations Atlas** `/ops` | joined graph envelope, operational metrics, health, bounded questions |
| What can I glance at away from the browser? | **macOS, menu bar, iOS** | native projections of the same read contract |

Every area is a read-only projection of the same lifecycle authority. Job telemetry
contributes process evidence; graph context and accepted memory improve navigation
and recall; neither can mutate a claim or complete work.

### The analytical lens gallery — six Map views and the exact question each answers

The same rows, asked different questions. Each view states in its own copy what its
geometry does *not* mean: where position or order is arbitrary it says so, and where
a shape would have to imply a measurement the data does not carry, it prints a
sentence instead of drawing the shape.

**Motion is evidence, not ambience.** Every moving mark passes through one audited
engine: an arrival pulse fires only for an event genuinely absent from the previous
poll, a marching dash rides only a path drawn in a recorded dependency's direction,
a breathing mark sits only on a row that derives to running. `prefers-reduced-motion`
stills all of it with every fact intact.

The remaining lenses — Shape, Subjects, Orbit, Crossings, Context, Stations — and the
full geometry and motion contract live in the [visual atlas](docs/visual-atlas.md)
and the [Operations Atlas contract](docs/operations-atlas.md).

## How work moves

The key separation is between **declared intent** and **observed state**. A work item
may say it is running, but readers only show it as running when a live claim backs
that declaration.

<!-- D5 -->
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/lifecycle.svg" alt="A work item moves planned or queued to running under a claim, then to done only through a gate that refuses completion unless done_signal names an artifact Git's index tracks; an expired lease requeues an unattended running claim, but a deliberate park or block keeps its disposition." width="100%">
</p>

<p align="center"><sub>Watch the asymmetry: a bare running claim with no live successor is requeued automatically, but a blocked or paused row keeps its disposition even after its claim releases &mdash; that stop was deliberate, not a dropped lease.</sub></p>

Mechanical work becomes a tracked local process instead of an LLM loop. A wrapper
forks the child into its own process group and writes two channels: a fast local
sidecar and an authoritative `runs` row carrying the real pid and pgid.

<!-- D6 -->
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/jobs.svg" alt="A launched job writes a progress sidecar and an authoritative runs row with pid and pgid; the board re-derives liveness against the live process, and a dead process is reconciled by an expired lease or by every recorded process identity being proven absent." width="100%">
</p>

<p align="center"><sub>The board never trusts a stored status string &mdash; it re-derives liveness by matching the recorded pid against the live process. Two independent paths catch a dead one: an expired lease releases the claim, and a sidecar is marked failed only after every process identity is proven absent, never assumed.</sub></p>

### What it refuses to do

Most of the design is a refusal. Each of these is enforced in code, not by convention:

- **No duplicate ownership.** One held claim per work item, enforced transactionally.
- **No immortal "running" rows.** Status is derived from intent, lease validity, and process evidence at read time — never stored and trusted.
- **No completion by assertion.** A claim completes only when its controller-declared `done_signal` is satisfied.
- **No client lock-in.** The CLI, Python API, and MCP server converge on the same lifecycle functions.
- **No giant cold-start dump.** Preflight, work context, event context, facts, and knowledge queries are bounded.
- **No hidden local work.** Long-running processes report through run records and compact JSON sidecars.
- **No accidental second authority.** Web and native clients consume read-only projections.

### The database

One SQLite database in WAL mode, `.coordharness/coord.db` (WAL keeps `-wal` and
`-shm` working files beside it). WAL is the whole reason a fleet can share it:
readers never block the writer and the writer never blocks readers, so a menu-bar
app polling four times a minute cannot stall an agent mid-claim.

Two writers sharing one file is the whole premise, so the concurrency contract is worth
stating rather than assuming. Every connection opens with `journal_mode=WAL`,
`busy_timeout=5000` and `foreign_keys=ON`; read-only clients additionally get `query_only=ON`.
Write transactions open `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, taking the write lock up front instead of
discovering the conflict on first write — the deferred-transaction upgrade deadlock two
concurrent writers would otherwise hit. Above that sits application-level compare-and-swap: a
row carries a `version`, and the typed operations that move ownership update
`WHERE version = ?`, so a transfer fenced on stale state fails closed instead of overwriting
whatever the other agent just did. There is no OS-level advisory locking anywhere in the
coordination path.

Six lifecycle tables carry the operating core:

| Table | What it is |
|---|---|
| `agent_sessions` | who is present — one row per orchestrator session, with its runner type and identity |
| `work_items` | the work itself — id, title, module, declared intent, priority, and the `done_signal` it must satisfy |
| `claims` | ownership — who holds what, since when, and until when the lease expires |
| `runs` | tracked local processes — the real pid and pgid, so liveness is checked against the OS rather than believed |
| `events` | the append-only history — claims, notes, decisions, handoffs, audit requests and verdicts |
| `artifacts` | the proof — what a completion pointed at, recorded with the transition in one transaction |

The generated schema also contains migration metadata, display titles,
request/inbox cursors, exact-authority and provenance records, and native
projection tables. Those support audit and bounded read models; they do not replace
the six lifecycle tables as the writer authority.

Two properties matter more than the shape. **Nothing is deleted on completion** — a
done row keeps its whole history, which is why "did we already do this?" is a query
rather than a memory. And **status is not a column.** It is computed at read time
from declared intent, lease validity, and process evidence, through views like
`v_work_owner` and `v_runs_read_model`. A row cannot sit at `running` because a
crashed process left it there.

Migrations are ordered SQL under `coord/migrations/`, applied on first use.

Read [architecture](docs/architecture.md), [coordination model](docs/coordination-model.md), [data model](docs/schema.md), and [context architecture](docs/context-architecture.md) for the full treatment.

## What the harness remembers

Coordination state and memory are different problems, and this project keeps them
apart on purpose. The section above is the board. This one is everything an agent is
allowed to carry between sessions.

The problem it exists to solve is that a conversation transcript grows without a
ceiling and every call re-reads all of it. A fresh session instead boots from a
bounded capsule, then expands only the source-bound context its work requires.

So memory lives in three stores, and they are not interchangeable:

| Store | Holds | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|
| **Coordination database** | work rows, sessions, claims, runs, events, artifacts | the project's whole history; nothing is deleted on completion |
| **Knowledge store** | the fact ledger, the full-text index, the memory-proposal queue | rebuildable — the index is derived, the facts and proposals are not |
| **Accepted-memory store** | content-addressed accepted notes and a compiled boot kernel | append-only; generations are immutable once built |

Everything else an agent knows is transient. **There is no transcript store, no
conversation archive, no vector database, and no per-agent scratch memory.** A
session that ends leaves rows, events, artifacts and possibly a memory proposal —
nothing else survives it.

<!-- D7 -->
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/context-retrieval.svg" alt="Authority, bounded context, derived retrieval and recall planes, showing which reads are bounded and where each answer's authority comes from." width="100%">
</p>

<p align="center"><sub>Exact board state stays authoritative. Bounded capsules and source-bound graph views help retrieval; accepted memory is a derived recall aid, never a writer and never a lifecycle authority.</sub></p>

The knowledge store is reachable through read-only MCP tools — fact queries, index
status, and the proposal queue — each capped, each carrying provenance, and each
covered by a test that fingerprints the store to prove a read wrote nothing.

The MCP server creates that store on startup, and a fact read **names the store it
read**. If the ledger is missing or has no schema, `facts_lookup` refuses with that
condition and `knowledge_search` records it as an error on the facts provider. It
does not return `count: 0`, because a zero from a store that does not exist is
indistinguishable from a store that genuinely holds no match.

Two things stated plainly rather than implied. **The proposal queue has a narrow,
fenced producer**: a successful session closeout offers only typed decisions
explicitly marked `memory_candidate=true`; ordinary decisions, notes, summaries and
empty sessions emit nothing. And the board's own context endpoint carries
**structure, not prose** — parents, dependencies, dependents and siblings — because
the browser board is read-only and unauthenticated, and decisions and notes are not public.

[Context and memory](docs/context-and-memory.md) is the full chapter — every store,
every module, what each is for, and what is deliberately never written down.

## Lifecycle clients: CLI, Python, and MCP

The table names equivalent operations, not separate authorities. They call the same
core against the same file.

| Task | CLI | MCP | Python |
|---|---|---|---|
| Orient | `coord board` | `preflight`, `next_work` | `coord_db.board_rows(...)` |
| Claim | `coord claim WORK --step "…"` | `claim_work(...)` | `coord_db.claim_work(...)` |
| Renew | `coord heartbeat-claim CLAIM --step "…"` | `heartbeat(...)` | `coord_db.heartbeat_claim(...)` |
| Pause/block | `coord release CLAIM --status paused\|blocked ...` | `park(...)`, `block(...)` | typed lifecycle functions |
| Message mid-run | `coord note WORK --body "…"` | `note(...)` | `coord_db.post_note(...)` |
| Reassign work | `coord reassign WORK --owner-lane …` | `handoff_existing(...)` | `coord_db.post_existing_work_handoff(...)` |
| Read messages | `coord inbox` | `inbox`, `inbox_recent` | `coord_db.read_inbox(...)` |
| Complete | `coord done WORK --artifact PATH` | `complete(...)` | `coord_db.complete_claim(...)` |
| Read board | `coord board --group-by module` | `board(...)` | read-only board queries |

### The complete verb surface

The table above is the common path. This is everything, so nothing useful stays hidden behind
a `--help` a reader never runs. `coord --help` prints the same list.

**The six installed executables:**

| Executable | What it is for |
|---|---|
| `coord` | the lifecycle CLI — the 21 verbs below |
| `coord-mcp` | the MCP stdio server an agent client launches |
| `coord-board` | the loopback web console (`127.0.0.1:7870` by default) |
| `coord-jobs` | `launch` a supervised local process, or print its `status` |
| `coord-models` | `list`, `check`, or `run` a declared local model under a GPU lock |
| `coord-reaper` | **writes** — sweep expired claims, zombie sessions and dead runs; `--dry-run` first |

**`coord` verbs, grouped by what you are trying to do:**

| Group | Verbs | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Presence | `session start\|heartbeat\|end` | registers who is here and renews the session lease |
| Orient | `board`, `work-context`, `inbox` | bounded reads; `work-context` also returns a row's handoff fences |
| Create work | `create` | refuses a row without a concrete repository-relative `done_signal` |
| Own work | `claim`, `heartbeat-claim`, `release` | `release --status paused\|blocked` is the CLI form of park/block |
| Collision control | `declare-write-set`, `conflicts` | declare the scopes a claim intends to write; list overlapping live claims |
| Move work | `handoff`, `reassign` | `handoff` takes the fences by hand; `reassign` snapshots them for you |
| Talk | `note` | append-only, addressed to a lane or one live session, carries no authority |
| Review | `request-audit`, `verdict`, `sign-off` | ask for review · record the other lane's verdict · human override |
| Finish | `done` | proof-gated; refuses without the declared, staged artifact |
| Operate | `doctor`, `onboard`, `route`, `usage-scan`, `demo` | read-only health · setup verification · usage-based routing advice · parse local CLI transcripts into the usage scan store · seed a fictional board |

`park` and `block` are **MCP-only** tool names; on the CLI they are
`coord release --status paused|blocked`. A park additionally requires a non-empty `next_step`
and `resume_when`, so a paused row always carries the contract for resuming it.

### What MCP is doing here

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is how an agent gets
tools it did not ship with: the client launches a server process, they speak
JSON-RPC over stdin and stdout, and the server advertises a catalog the model can
call. No network, no port, no daemon.

`coord-mcp` is that server for this harness. It exposes the same lifecycle functions
the CLI calls — a claim made through `claim_work` and a claim made through
`coord claim` are the same row, written by the same code, because the MCP layer is a
transport rather than a second implementation.

It declares 37 tools and exposes 36 by default; `handoff_existing` is withheld from
the default profile and promoted deliberately, because handing a row to another
agent is the one operation that moves ownership out from under a live holder.

> **Current boundary:** the default generic profile is the one to use. All 36 default tools
> register against a fresh local database, and the ones a first session needs answer there:
> `preflight`, `board`, `next_work`, `work_context`, `event_context`, `inbox`, `inbox_recent`,
> `runs`, `knowledge_search`, `facts_query`, `facts_lookup`, `knowledge_index_status`, the
> memory-proposal reads, and the `claim_work`/`heartbeat`/`note`/`audit`/`decision`/`park`/`release`
> writers. The MCP server creates its backing knowledge store at process startup, before the first
> tool call runs, so on the standard install path (`scripts/setup.sh`, whose onboarding self-test
> starts that same stdio process) the store already exists by the time a session begins.
> `facts_lookup`'s `FactStoreUnavailable` refusal is a defensive guard for a store that was deleted
> or never went through that startup path — for example a caller that invokes the tool function
> directly rather than through the running server — not a boundary a stranger following the setup
> docs will hit. Only `orient` fails closed on a fresh checkout: it
> requires an enforced exact-authority policy that a fresh checkout does not activate. The
> remaining lifecycle writers refuse by contract until their preconditions hold: `complete`
> demands the declared artifact in Git's index — every artifact type, with a narrow
> exemption for kinds that structurally cannot live there (see `docs/comparison.md`),
> `verdict` refuses a same-lane pass, and
> `request_audit` refuses T2/T1 rows that self-verify. The strict deployment profile adds
> repository-custody and exact-authority gates that a public checkout cannot satisfy — it is for
> a deployment that has done its own authority activation, and its refusals there are working as
> designed. Typed handoff over MCP stays behind the promotion contract; the CLI `coord handoff`
> reaches the same fenced operation and demands the exact row version, owner, and event heads by
> hand. `coord reassign` is the concise twin: it snapshots those same fences once and still fails
> closed if another writer changes them before commit.

Client wiring commands, the claim-and-complete walkthrough, and the tracked-jobs
demo all moved to [Install](#install) so a new reader hits them before any
conceptual prose — see

## Native projections

**COORD Cockpit** is the same Board — the exact work table shown at the top of
this page — inside a native window, plus the whole Board, Mesh, Map, and Atlas
navigation alongside it. It is a client of the harness, not another lifecycle
authority; the pixels differ, the data does not.

| App | What it is | Where it appears |
|---|---|---|
| **COORD** | Status-bar panel: a progress ring in the menu bar, running work and local jobs in the popover, with pause and mode controls | The system menu bar — no Dock icon by design |
| **COORD Cockpit** | Full window: the Board plus embedded Mesh, Map, and Atlas views under one navigation | The Dock |

Both read the database directly through a read-only SQLite connection
(`SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY` plus `PRAGMA query_only=ON`) and fall back to the HTTP
snapshot. By default neither can write to the board. An explicit
`apps/install.sh --enable-native-operator-writes` opt-in enables only native task
reassignment over a fixed loopback endpoint, with an owner-only bearer,
confirmation, exact row/version/assignment-head fences, idempotent receipts, and
refusal while a claim or run is live. Browser actions remain read-only; the native
client never writes SQLite directly. Reading the
file directly couples these two apps to the SQLite schema; the iOS client and the
snapshot-only `CoordCockpitMac` target take `/api/v1/snapshot` over HTTP instead and
stay independent of it. See [compatibility](docs/compatibility.md).
`COORD_DB` chooses the board, `COORD_BOARD_URL` the map to embed, and
`COORD_MENUBAR_CONFIG` the panel's appearance. Exact targets and the iOS client are
documented in [native clients](docs/native-clients.md).

### Web control room

The board server binds loopback only and serves read-only projections of the same
lifecycle authority. The Content-Security-Policy admits no inline script or style.
**This is not safe to expose to a LAN or the internet.**

Precisely: no HTTP route can create, claim, complete, or review work. Three `POST` endpoints
exist and none of them touch lifecycle state — two manage local usage/provider settings and are
gated on a loopback bind plus a matching `Origin`, and the third is the opt-in native
reassignment endpoint described above, disabled unless `COORD_NATIVE_OPERATOR_WRITES=1` and
additionally guarded by a bearer token compared in constant time. `GET` reads are
unauthenticated, which is the other reason loopback is not a formality.

## Maturity at a glance

The machine-readable source for this table is [`docs/feature-status.json`](docs/feature-status.json). "Preview" means source exists in this branch but its public contract can still change.

| Capability | Status | Public contract |
|---|---|---|
| SQLite-WAL lifecycle, claims, leases, proof, events | **Shipped** | Stable local core |
| `coord` CLI and Python API | **Shipped** | Stable core surface |
| MCP stdio server | **Preview** | 37 tools declared, 36 exposed by default; fresh generic preflight, board, and lifecycle writes answer, while `facts_lookup` and `orient` fail closed until a knowledge store and an enforced exact-authority policy exist; strict-profile custody remains deployment-specific |
| `coord-mcp` executable | **Preview** | Packaged stdio launcher; the checked-in project-scoped configs use paths relative to the project root, and absolute paths are required whenever the client does not launch the server there |
| Local jobs and run telemetry | **Shipped** | Library surface; CLI is preview |
| Bounded context, facts, and full-text retrieval | **Preview** | The capsule, digest, skeleton, focus, search, and curation lenses render on a fresh generic `coord.db`; the MCP server names the fact ledger on every read but does not create it, and knowledge indexing and accepted-memory bootstrap remain library workflows |
| `coord doctor` safety report | **Shipped** | Read-only stable v1 PASS/BLOCKED contract; exits 0 on a freshly seeded board and after a completed claim |
| Codex and Claude project skill packages | **Shipped** | Byte-identical repository integration |
| Local MLX model orchestration | **Preview** | Explicit catalog, preflight, and process-held resource lock |
| Source-bound graph views (Board, Mesh, Map, Atlas) | **Preview** | Read models over one bounded authority; never a freeform whiteboard or writer |
| Freeform shared whiteboard | **Planned** | No authoritative standalone implementation |
| Rich private-product operations console | **Excluded** | Product modules, branded actions, and hosted operations stay private |
| Loopback read-only web board | **Preview** | Branch surface; localhost only |
| macOS and iOS clients | **Preview** | Clean-room read-only clients by default; opt-in macOS task reassignment is loopback-only, authenticated, confirmed, and CAS-fenced |
| Distributed, hosted, or multi-tenant coordination | **Excluded** | Single-machine trust model |

## Security boundary

`coordharness` assumes trusted processes under one local user account. Actor and session labels are coordination identity, not cryptographic authentication. The database can contain work titles, event text, and local metadata; keep it out of source control and protect it with filesystem permissions.

- Do not bind the board beyond loopback.
- Do not share `coord.db` over a network filesystem.
- Do not put secrets, prompts, source bodies, argv, or stdout in events or sidecars.
- Do not treat read-only clients as authorization boundaries.
- Run the publication gate before any external release.

Read the full [security and privacy model](docs/security-and-privacy.md) and [security policy](.github/SECURITY.md).

## Platform support

macOS has the full path: CLI, MCP, board, and the native menu-bar/Cockpit/iOS
clients. Linux has the CLI and MCP path — core coordination, the web board, and
local jobs — without the native Xcode-built clients, which are macOS-only by
toolchain. Windows process-liveness support is planned, not a current claim; see
[compatibility](docs/compatibility.md) for the full runtime matrix and promises.

## Versioning

`main` is the release channel until `v0.1.0` tags land — no numbered releases exist
yet, and compatibility promises attach to shipped surfaces (see
[compatibility](docs/compatibility.md)), not to a version number.

## Troubleshooting

Full list of nine, with fixes, in
[getting started → Troubleshooting](docs/getting-started.md#troubleshooting). The
six most likely on a first run:

**`coord: could not prepare the database`** — the parent directory is not
writable, or the path is a zero-byte or foreign SQLite file. The loader fails
closed rather than writing coordination tables into an unrelated database.

**`ValueError: ambiguous agent identity`** — both a Claude Code and a Codex
session variable are set, so the CLI refuses to guess which lane owns the work.
Set `COORD_ACTOR=claude` or `COORD_ACTOR=codex` with a matching
`COORD_SESSION_ID` and re-run.

**`claim` says the row belongs to another actor** — use the correct
actor/session identity or a typed handoff. Never overwrite the assignee or reuse
another process's session ID.

**`done` says proof is missing or incomplete** — the artifact path must exactly
match the row's declared `done_signal`, resolve beneath `COORD_PROJECT_ROOT`,
exist, and be non-empty. It must also be tracked in Git's index — `git add` it;
staging is enough, no commit needed. This applies to a proof of **any** type: up
to 0.1.0 only `.md` proofs were custody-checked and everything else completed on
existence alone, so a `.json`, `.txt` or `.html` completion that used to succeed
untracked is now refused. The exceptions are artifact kinds that structurally
cannot live in Git — `.parquet`, `.duckdb`, `.db`, `.joblib`, `.bz2`, `.backup` —
which must still exist but need not be tracked. Set
`COORD_COMPLETION_CUSTODY_EXEMPT` to a comma-separated suffix list to rebind that
set for an unusual artifact kind, or to `*` to turn the custody requirement off
entirely.

**`coord doctor` reports `database_outside_state_root`** — the database exists
but sits outside the state root doctor was given. Pass a matching `--state-root`,
or keep the database at the default `.coordharness/coord.db`.

**The board viewer cannot open the database** — create it first with any `coord`
command or the demo seeder, and confirm the viewer and CLI point to the same
absolute `COORD_DB`.
