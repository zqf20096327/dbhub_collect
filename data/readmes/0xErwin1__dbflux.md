# DBFlux

**English** · [Español](README.es.md) · [한국어](README.ko.md) · [简体中文](README.zh_Hans.md)

An extensible, keyboard-first data platform delivered as a Rust + GPUI desktop client.

**[dbflux.dev](https://dbflux.dev)** &middot; [Documentation](https://docs.dbflux.dev/) &middot; [Install](https://docs.dbflux.dev/install/)

## Overview

DBFlux is an open-source desktop client with built-in drivers for relational and non-relational databases. Its core contracts are driver-neutral, and external drivers can integrate over RPC.

The client focuses on performance, a clean UX, and keyboard-first workflows. The long-term goal is one fully open-source client for every database you work with.

### User Interface

- Document-based workspace with multiple result tabs (like DBeaver/VS Code)
- Collapsible, resizable sidebar with ToggleSidebar command (Ctrl+B)
- Schema tree browser with lazy loading for large databases
- Schema-level metadata: indexes, foreign keys, constraints, custom types (PostgreSQL)
- Stored procedures / routines folder per schema (drivers that expose them)
- Multi-tab SQL editor with syntax highlighting and multi-statement execution (one result set per statement, where the driver supports it)
- Virtualized data table with column resizing, horizontal scrolling, and sorting
- Table browser with WHERE filters, custom LIMIT, and pagination
- Workspace inspector rail for row/document details
- "Copy as Query" context menu to copy INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE as SQL, MongoDB shell, or Redis commands
- Query preview modal with language-specific syntax highlighting
- Command palette with fuzzy search
- Custom toast notification system with auto-dismiss
- Background task panel
- Session restore: open tabs are restored on startup, and a recovered draft that differs from its file is never written over it

### Visual Query Builder

- Right-rail SELECT builder: projection, joins, a nested WHERE predicate tree, ORDER BY, and LIMIT/OFFSET, with a live parameterized SQL preview
- GROUP BY with aggregates (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX) and HAVING
- Visual UPDATE / DELETE builder with mutation policies (read-only / approval-required) and chunked, cancellable execution
- Schema-aware autocomplete on builder inputs and the results WHERE filter
- Relational filters in the results filter bar via dotted foreign-key paths (e.g. `created_by.email LIKE '%@acme.com'`)
- Inline cell edit and row delete on builder-generated results when they map 1:1 to a single table
- Saved visual queries per connection
- SQL drivers only (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, SQL Server); driver-agnostic by construction

### Charts & Visualization

- Chart any query or collection result: Line, Bar, Scatter, Area, Stacked Bar, and Pie
- Automatic axis detection from column kinds (timestamp X axis, numeric Y series) — no per-driver heuristics
- Saved charts that reopen as their own document tab
- Dashboards: arrange saved charts, dividers, and inspector panels on a 12-column grid with a shared time range
- Read-only Instance Overview per connection — live server metrics and tabular inspectors, with "Save as editable"; PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, Redis, and SQL Server ship instance catalogs
- Browse and import upstream provider dashboards (CloudWatch)
- See [docs/CHARTS.md](docs/CHARTS.md) and [docs/DASHBOARDS.md](docs/DASHBOARDS.md) for details

### Connectivity & Access

- SSH tunnels with key, password, and agent authentication; reusable SSH tunnel profiles
- SOCKS5 / HTTP CONNECT proxy tunnels with reusable proxy profiles
- Managed access providers (AWS SSM) for connecting without exposing ports
- Provider-driven auth profiles (e.g. AWS SSO/shared/static), with import from `~/.aws/config`
- Connection hooks at PreConnect/PostConnect/PreDisconnect/PostDisconnect, runnable as a command, a script, or in-process Lua

### AI & MCP Integration

- Built-in Model Context Protocol (MCP) server (`dbflux mcp`) for AI clients
- Governance layer: operation classification, role/policy engine, trusted clients, and human approval flow for write/destructive operations
- See [docs/MCP_AI_INTEGRATION.md](docs/MCP_AI_INTEGRATION.md)

### Audit & Scripting

- SQLite-backed audit log for queries, connections, hooks, scripts, MCP, governance, and config events, with redaction and query fingerprinting — see [docs/AUDIT.md](docs/AUDIT.md)
- Centralized user-facing error reporting: failures surface as a toast with a correlation id and a "View in Audit" action, drive a status-bar error badge, and are correlated with their audit row
- Lua, Python, and Bash scripts run as documents with live streamed output — see [docs/LUA.md](docs/LUA.md)

### Keyboard Navigation

- Vim-style navigation (`j`/`k`/`h`/`l`) throughout the app
- Context-aware keybindings (Document, Sidebar, BackgroundTasks)
- Document focus with internal editor/results navigation
- Results toolbar: `f` to focus, `h`/`l` to navigate, `Enter` to edit/execute, `Esc` to exit
- Toggle sidebar with `Ctrl+B`
- Tab switching (MRU order) with `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`

### Query Management

- Query history with timestamps
- Saved queries with favorites
- Search across history and saved queries

### Export

- Shape-based export: CSV, JSON (pretty/compact), Text, Binary (raw/hex/base64)
- Export format determined by result type (table, JSON, text, binary)

## Development

### Prerequisites

On Linux, the `mold` linker is **required** for local builds: the repo's
`.cargo/config.toml` links the `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` target with
`-fuse-ld=mold` to cut link time and memory across the 60+ workspace crates.
The Nix dev shell provides it automatically; for non-Nix setups install it via
your package manager (included below). Windows and macOS use their default
linker and are unaffected.

**Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt install pkg-config libssl-dev libdbus-1-dev libxkbcommon-dev mold
```

**Fedora:**

```bash
sudo dnf install pkg-config openssl-devel dbus-devel libxkbcommon-devel mold
```

**Arch:**

```bash
sudo pacman -S pkg-config openssl dbus libxkbcommon mold
```

**macOS:**

```bash
# Xcode Command Line Tools (required)
xcode-select --install
```

**Windows:**

```powershell
# Visual Studio Build Tools with C++ workload (required)
# Download from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
```

### Building

```bash
cargo build -p dbflux --release
```

### Running

```bash
cargo run -p dbflux
```

### Commands

```bash
cargo check --workspace                    # Type checking
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings    # Lint
cargo fmt --all                            # Format
cargo test --workspace                     # Tests
```

### Faster tests with nextest

[`cargo-nextest`](https://nexte.st) is the recommended test runner for this
workspace: it runs each test in its own process across a global pool, which is
noticeably faster than `cargo test` on a workspace this size. The Nix dev shell
provides it; otherwise install it from <https://nexte.st/docs/installation>.

```bash
cargo nextest run --workspace              # unit + integration tests
cargo test --doc --workspace               # doctests (nextest does not run these)
```

Live integration tests (normally `#[ignore]`d) use a different flag under nextest:

```bash
cargo nextest run -p dbflux_driver_sqlite --run-ignored all
```

### Website

The site under `web/` is an Astro static build. It reads `docs/`, the driver READMEs,
`ARCHITECTURE.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` out of git, one set per published version, so editing a
document is all that is needed to change what the site shows.

```bash
cd web
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # local server
pnpm build        # static output in web/dist
pnpm check        # types
pnpm format       # prettier
```

Which versions are published is declared in `web/versions.json`. Each entry names a git ref; the
product version shown for it is read from that ref's `Cargo.toml`.

`DOCS_MODE` decides where the documentation is served: `embedded` (the default, everything on one
origin under `/docs/`), or `site` and `docs` for a split deployment across two hosts. Local
development uses the default, so one command still brings up the whole site.

### Nix Development Shell

If you use Nix, you can enter a development shell with all dependencies:

```bash
# With flakes
nix develop

# Traditional
nix-shell
```
