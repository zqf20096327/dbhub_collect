An [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that lets your coding agent build and query a graph of concepts, architecture, and decisions — so it **remembers across sessions**.

The LLM is the indexer. No AST parsing. No static analysis. Your agent reads code, writes concepts in its own words, and queries them before future tasks. The graph stores **concepts** — features, modules, patterns, decisions — not code symbols.

### The Loop

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/how-it-works.svg" alt="How MegaMemory works" width="800" />
</p>

`understand → work → update`

1. **Session start** — agent calls `list_roots` to orient itself
2. **Before a task** — agent calls `understand` with a natural language query (or `get_concept` for exact ID lookup)
3. **After a task** — agent calls `create_concept` or `update_concept` to record what it built

Everything persists in a per-project SQLite database at `.megamemory/knowledge.db`.

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g megamemory
```

> [!NOTE]
> Requires Node.js >= 18. The embedding model (~23MB) downloads automatically on first use.

### Quick Start

```bash
megamemory install
```

Run the interactive installer and choose your editor:

> [!NOTE]
> The installer only updates config files after a successful read/merge, and it will not overwrite existing plugin/command files unless they are already marked as MegaMemory-managed.

#### With [opencode](https://opencode.ai)

```bash
megamemory install --target opencode
```

One command configures:
- MCP server in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`
- Workflow instructions in `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`
- Skill tool plugin at `~/.config/opencode/tool/megamemory.ts`
- Bootstrap command `/user:bootstrap-memory` for initial graph population
- Save command `/user:save-memory` to persist session knowledge

Restart opencode after running install.

#### With [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com)

```bash
megamemory install --target claudecode
```

Configures:
- MCP server in `~/.claude.json`
- Workflow instructions in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Commands in `~/.claude/commands/`

#### With [Antigravity](https://idx.google.com)

```bash
megamemory install --target antigravity
```

Configures:
- MCP server in `./mcp_config.json` (workspace-level)

#### With [Codex](https://openai.com/codex)

```bash
megamemory install --target codex
```

Configures:
- MCP server in `~/.codex/config.toml`
- Workflow instructions in `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`

#### With other MCP clients

Add megamemory as a stdio MCP server. The command is just `megamemory` (no arguments). It reads/writes `.megamemory/knowledge.db` relative to the working directory, or set `MEGAMEMORY_DB_PATH` to override.

```json
{
  "megamemory": {
    "type": "local",
    "command": ["megamemory"],
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

### MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `understand` | Semantic search over the knowledge graph. Returns matched concepts with children, edges, and parent context. |
| `get_concept` | Look up a concept by its exact ID. Returns full context including children, edges, incoming edges, and parent. |
| `create_concept` | Add a new concept with optional edges and file references. |
| `update_concept` | Update fields on an existing concept. Regenerates embeddings automatically. |
| `link` | Create a typed relationship between two concepts. |
| `remove_concept` | Soft-delete a concept with a reason. History preserved. |
| `list_roots` | List all top-level concepts with direct children. |
| `list_conflicts` | List unresolved merge conflicts grouped by merge group. |
| `resolve_conflict` | Resolve a merge conflict by providing verified, correct content based on the current codebase. |

**Concept kinds:** `feature` · `module` · `pattern` · `config` · `decision` · `component`

**Relationship types:** `connects_to` · `depends_on` · `implements` · `calls` · `configured_by`

### Knowledge Graph

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/knowledge-graph.svg" alt="MegaMemory knowledge graph example" width="800" />
</p>

---

### Web Explorer

Visualize the knowledge graph in your browser:

```bash
megamemory serve
```

- Nodes are colored by kind and sized by edge count
- Dashed edges show parent-child links; solid edges show relationships
- Click any node to inspect summary, files, and edges
- Search supports highlight/dim filtering
- If port `4321` is taken, you'll be prompted to pick another

```bash
megamemory serve --port 8080   # custom port
```

  index.ts       CLI entry + MCP server (9 tools)

  types.ts       TypeScript types

```

- **Embeddings** — In-process via [Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) (ONNX, quantized). No API keys, and no network calls after the first model download.
- **Storage** — SQLite with WAL mode, soft-delete history, and schema migrations (currently v3).
- **Search** — Brute-force cosine similarity over node embeddings; fast enough for graphs with <10k nodes.
- **Merge** — Two-way merge with conflict detection by concept ID, with AI-assisted conflict resolution via MCP tools.

### Merging Knowledge Graphs

When branches diverge, each may update `.megamemory/knowledge.db` independently. Since SQLite files cannot be auto-merged by git, megamemory provides dedicated merge commands.

#### Merge two databases

```bash
megamemory merge main.db feature.db --into merged.db
```

Concepts are compared by ID: identical nodes are deduplicated, and conflicting nodes are kept as `::left`/`::right` variants under one merge group UUID. Use `--left-label` and `--right-label` to replace default side labels with branch names.

```bash
megamemory merge main.db feature.db --into merged.db --left-label main --right-label feature-xyz
```

#### View conflicts

```bash
megamemory conflicts            # human-readable summary
megamemory conflicts --json     # machine-readable output
megamemory conflicts --db path  # specify database path
```

#### Resolve conflicts manually

```bash
megamemory resolve <merge-group-uuid> --keep left    # keep the left version
megamemory resolve <merge-group-uuid> --keep right   # keep the right version
megamemory resolve <merge-group-uuid> --keep both    # keep both as separate concepts
```

#### AI-assisted resolution

When an AI agent runs `/merge`, it calls `list_conflicts`, verifies both versions against current source files, then calls `resolve_conflict` with `resolved: {summary, why?, file_refs?}` plus a verification `reason`. It does not pick a side blindly; it resolves to what the codebase currently reflects.
