## Overview

Inventarium is designed for small laboratory teams who need a simple, fast, and reliable way to track consumables, reagents, and supplies. No complex setup, no web server, no cloud dependencies - just a straightforward desktop application with a local SQLite database.

### Key Features

- **Product Hierarchy**: Products → Packages (SKUs) → Batches (Lots) → Labels (individual units)
- **Barcode Support**: Generate and scan barcodes for quick stock operations
- **Expiration Tracking**: FEFO (First Expired, First Out) management with alerts
- **Reorder Alerts**: Automatic notifications when stock falls below threshold
- **Request Workflow**: Create purchase requests and track deliveries
- **Memos Board**: Quick notes for items to order ("bulletin board")
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Consumption analysis, rotation index, ABC classification
- **Multi-language**: Italian, English, Spanish, German, and French UI

## Installation

### Development Platform

Inventarium is developed and tested on **Linux Debian 12 (Bookworm)** with Python 3.11+.

### Production Environment

In our laboratory (Mass Spectrometry Lab, Sant'Andrea University Hospital, Rome), Inventarium runs on **4 Windows 10 workstations** as a standalone executable compiled with **Nuitka** and **Python 3.7**. The database is shared via network path on a folder called *"Spettri"* (Italian for both "spectra" and "ghosts" - fitting for a mass spec lab where inventory items occasionally... vanish 👻).

### Requirements

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Tkinter (usually included with Python on Linux)
- Virtual environment (venv)

On Debian/Ubuntu, ensure you have the required packages:
```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-tk
```

### Quick Install (Debian/Ubuntu)

Download the `.deb` package from [Releases](https://github.com/1966bc/inventarium/releases/latest) and install:

```bash
sudo apt install ./inventarium_0.1.1-1_all.deb
```

This installs Inventarium system-wide with all dependencies. Launch from the application menu (Science → Inventarium) or run `inventarium` from terminal.

### Setup from Source (Linux Debian 12)

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/1966bc/inventarium.git
cd inventarium
```

2. **Create the virtual environment:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
Your prompt should now show `(venv)` at the beginning.

4. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Run the application:**
```bash
python3 inventarium.py
```

### Quick Start (after first setup)

Every time you want to run Inventarium:
```bash
cd inventarium
source venv/bin/activate
python3 inventarium.py
```

### Setup (Windows)

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open Command Prompt in the project folder
3. Install dependencies and run:
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
python inventarium.py
```

**Optional**: If you prefer to use a virtual environment:
```cmd
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python inventarium.py
```

**Note**: For production use, we recommend the standalone executable (see [Build Standalone Executable](#build-standalone-executable-windows)) which requires no Python installation.

## Database

Inventarium uses SQLite - a single file database that requires no server setup.

### First Run

On first run, if no database is found, a dialog will appear with options:
- **Find existing database**: Browse for an existing `.db` file
- **Create new database**: Creates a fresh database with demo data from `sql/init.sql`

### Demo Data

The `sql/init.sql` file contains the complete schema plus sample data:
- 18 products (solvents, standards, columns, consumables)
- 8 suppliers (Sigma-Aldrich, Thermo Fisher, ChromSystems, etc.)
- Sample batches, labels, requests, and deliveries

To reset an existing database to demo data:
```bash
sqlite3 inventarium.db ".read sql/init.sql"
```

### Database CLI Access

The database can be accessed directly via SQLite command line for queries, maintenance, and troubleshooting. A `setconsole` file in the `sql/` folder provides pre-configured console settings.

**Linux:**
```bash
cd sql
sqlite3 -init setconsole ../inventarium.db
```

**Windows:**

Download `sqlite3.exe` from [sqlite.org/download.html](https://sqlite.org/download.html) (Precompiled Binaries for Windows) and place it in the `sql/` folder, then:
```cmd
cd sql
.\sqlite3 -init setconsole ..\inventarium.db
```

For network databases, use the path from `config.ini`:
```cmd
.\sqlite3 -init setconsole "\\server\share\inventarium.db"
```

The `sql/` folder is organized by SQL statement type:
- `ddl/` - Schema changes (ALTER, CREATE)
- `dml/` - Data manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- `dql/` - Queries (SELECT)

Run utility scripts with:
```sql
.read dql/check_pending.sql
.read dml/fix_pending.sql
```

For a complete reference of SQLite CLI commands and useful queries, see [SQLITE_CLI.md](SQLITE_CLI.md).

## Configuration

On first run, if the database is not found, a dialog offers options to find an existing database or create a new one. The path is then saved to `config.ini`.

You can also edit `config.ini` manually:

```ini
[database]
path = sql/inventarium.db

[printer]
enabled = 1
name = BARCODE
```

- `path`: Database location. For shared network access use `//server/share/inventarium.db`
- `enabled`: Set to `0` to disable label printing on this workstation
- `name`: Label printer name (leave empty for system default)

## Usage

### Main Workflow

1. **Add Products**: Define base products (e.g., "Acetonitrile HPLC Grade")
2. **Create Packages**: Link products to suppliers with specific packaging (e.g., "2.5L bottle from Sigma")
3. **Register Batches**: Add lot numbers with expiration dates
4. **Load Labels**: Create individual stock units (each gets a unique barcode)
5. **Unload Labels**: Scan or click to mark items as used

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Alt+N` - New
- `Alt+S` - Save
- `Alt+C` - Close/Cancel
- `Escape` - Close window

## Architecture

The application uses a **mixin-based architecture** where the Engine class combines:

- `DBMS` - Database connection and query execution
- `Controller` - Domain-specific queries
- `Tools` - Tkinter widget factories
- `Launcher` - Cross-platform file opener

All views access the engine via `self.engine = self.nametowidget(".").engine`.

### Design Patterns

Inventarium implements several classic design patterns, making it a useful reference for learning software architecture:

| Pattern | Where | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Singleton** | `Engine` (`_EngineMeta`), `ParentView` | Ensures single instance per window/engine |
| **Mixin** | `Engine` | Composition over inheritance |
| **Template Method** | `ParentView`, `ChildView` | Common structure for windows and dialogs |
| **Registry** | `dict_instances` | Global access to open windows |
| **Builder** | `build_sql()` | Dynamic SQL query construction |
| **Observer** | `Engine` (`subscribe`, `notify`) | Decoupled view communication |

#### Observer Pattern Example

Views communicate without knowing each other:

```python
# In delivery.py (publisher)
self.engine.notify("stock_changed")

# In warehouse.py (subscriber)
self.engine.subscribe("stock_changed", self.on_stock_changed)

def on_stock_changed(self, data=None):
    self.refresh_batches()
```

#### Singleton via Metaclass

Engine uses a metaclass to guarantee a single instance. This is not strictly necessary since Engine is already instantiated once in `App`, but it's implemented for educational purposes:

```python
class _EngineMeta(type):
    _instance = None

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instance

class Engine(..., metaclass=_EngineMeta):
    ...
```

## Build Standalone Executable (Windows)

To create a standalone `.exe` that runs without Python installed:

1. Install dependencies:
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install nuitka
```

2. Run the build script:
```cmd
build_on_windows.cmd
```

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.7+
- MinGW64 (downloaded automatically by Nuitka if missing)

The executable is created in `dist\inventarium.dist\`. Copy the entire folder to distribute - no Python installation needed on target machines.
