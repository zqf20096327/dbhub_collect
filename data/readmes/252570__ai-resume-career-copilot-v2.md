> ⚠️ **Deterministic by design — no LLM.** Every recommendation, match score, and piece of feedback comes from explicit rules and templates over evidence in your own documents. Nothing here calls a language model or fabricates resume or job content. See the method boundary below.

AI Resume & Career Copilot is a production-oriented final-year project for building an **evidence-first career workspace**. A signed-in user can upload and parse a resume, capture a target role, inspect a deterministic and explainable comparison, turn visible gaps into a learning sequence and portfolio prompts, rehearse structured interview answers, and track applications in an owner-scoped dashboard.

> **Method boundary:** The implemented recommendation, matching, ATS-style, roadmap, project, and interview-feedback features are deterministic rules and templates. They do not call an LLM, do not fabricate resume or job evidence, and do not claim to predict a hiring outcome or judge an interview.

## Current implementation

| Area | Status | Implemented behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | Complete | Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, responsive owner-scoped workspace, login/signup, navigation, and workflow states. |
| API | Complete | FastAPI REST API with Pydantic contracts, request validation, controlled errors, and configured CORS. |
| Persistence | Complete | PostgreSQL-ready SQLAlchemy models and Alembic migrations `20260820_0001` through `20260822_0007`. |
| Resume evidence | Complete | Validated PDF, DOCX, and TXT upload up to 5 MB; UUID local storage; deterministic text/contact/skills/education/experience/project/certification/link extraction. |
| Job intelligence | Complete | Pasted or uploaded job descriptions with deterministic title, company, required/preferred skills, experience, education, and keyword extraction. |
| Matching and ATS-style gaps | Complete | Explainable score breakdown, matched and missing skills, source-evidence snippets, deterministic ATS coverage notes, and prioritized gaps. |
| Learning and projects | Complete | Persisted skill-gap roadmap steps and portfolio project prompts generated from the saved analysis. |
| Accounts and isolation | Complete | Bcrypt password hashing, JWT bearer tokens, owner-scoped records, and cross-account access tests. |
| Interview practice | Complete | Job-aware question sets and transparent structure feedback based on length, STAR terms, measurements, and focus-skill mention. |
| Application tracker | Complete | Private application ledger, supported status transitions, dashboard counts, and recent application summary. |
| Future scope | Deliberately deferred | OCR fallback, LLM provider abstraction, RAG assistant, semantic embeddings, and resume-version editing. Container packaging and Render deployment configuration are included; live database provisioning and deployment remain environment-specific operator steps. |

```

The frontend remains a static Next.js export. It communicates with FastAPI through the build-time public `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` value. The backend remains independently runnable on port `8001` during local development, with PostgreSQL configured only from an untracked runtime environment.

## Data model and migration chain

| Migration | Tables or changes |
| --- | --- |
| `20260820_0001` | Core `users`, `resumes`, `jobs`, `skills`, `resume_skills`, `job_skills`, and `match_results` schema. |
| `20260822_0002` | Resume extracted text and deterministic parsed-data persistence. |
| `20260822_0003` | Job parsing status and structured requirement data. |
| `20260822_0004` | `roadmap_items` and `project_recommendations` linked to an explainable match result. |
| `20260822_0005` | Password hash and active-account fields for local authentication. |
| `20260822_0006` | Owner-scoped interview sessions and response feedback. |
| `20260822_0007` | Owner-scoped job application tracking. |

## Secure local setup

Use Node.js 20+ and Python 3.11+. Install PostgreSQL locally, create a private role/database, and follow the Windows-specific walkthrough in [Windows 11 PostgreSQL Setup Guide](./WINDOWS_11_POSTGRESQL_SETUP.md) when applicable.

```bash
# 1. Install frontend dependencies at the repository root.
pnpm install

# 2. Create an untracked frontend/.env.local using frontend/env.example.
# It must contain this local API endpoint:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1

# 3. Create an untracked backend/.env using backend/env.example.
# Set DATABASE_URL to your own PostgreSQL credentials and set a strong JWT_SECRET.
# JWT_SECRET must be at least 32 characters; never commit it.

# 4. Install backend dependencies and apply all PostgreSQL migrations.
cd backend
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m alembic upgrade head

# 5. Start FastAPI in one terminal.
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001

# 6. Start the frontend in a second terminal from the project root.
pnpm dev
```

The local frontend is served at `http://localhost:3000`; FastAPI is served at `http://127.0.0.1:8001`, including `/api/v1/health` and interactive documentation at `/docs`.

## API surface

All routes below are prefixed with `/api/v1`. Protected routes require `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`. Anonymous legacy resume/job records are supported for prior Phase 3 continuity, but new signed-in writes are bound to the bearer-token subject and cannot be retrieved by another account.

| Area | Routes | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Health | `GET /health`, `GET /health/ready` | Liveness is always `200` and reports observed database state; readiness returns `503` when the database is unusable. Neither returns credentials or connection details. |
| Authentication | `POST /auth/signup`, `POST /auth/login`, `GET /auth/me` | Passwords are hashed with bcrypt; JWT signing uses `JWT_SECRET`. |
| Resumes | `POST /resumes/upload`, `GET /resumes`, `GET /resumes/{id}` | PDF/DOCX/TXT only; 5 MB maximum; no binary file or local path is returned. |
| Jobs | `POST /jobs`, `POST /jobs/upload`, `GET /jobs`, `GET /jobs/{id}` | Deterministically parses supplied job content. |
| Analysis | `POST /analyses/match`, `GET /analyses/{id}` | Returns score criteria, match evidence, ATS-style notes, and gaps. |
| Plans | `POST /plans/{analysis_id}/generate`, `GET /plans/{analysis_id}` | Persisted roadmap and portfolio prompts derived from saved gaps. |
| Practice | `POST /interviews`, `GET /interviews`, `GET /interviews/{id}`, `POST /interviews/{id}/responses` | Feedback contains an explicit deterministic-method disclaimer. |
| Applications | `POST /applications`, `GET /applications`, `PATCH /applications/{id}` | Supported statuses: saved, applied, screening, interviewing, offer, rejected, withdrawn. |
| Dashboard | `GET /dashboard` | Returns only the authenticated user’s counts and recent ledger entries. |

## Verification

The test suite uses isolated SQLite metadata fixtures to verify route contracts and model relationships without substituting a local PostgreSQL database. PostgreSQL migration SQL is additionally checked offline when a server is unavailable.

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
python -m pytest

# PostgreSQL migration SQL check; this does not connect to a server.
DATABASE_URL='postgresql+psycopg://career_copilot:placeholder@localhost:5432/career_copilot' \
  python -m alembic upgrade head --sql

# Frontend type check and static export build from repository root
cd ..
pnpm --filter career-copilot-frontend check
pnpm build
```

## Security and product boundaries

The project does not hard-code database credentials, API keys, password hashes, or JWT secrets. The browser stores only the bearer token needed for the active local session; the API never returns password hashes, upload storage paths, or source file bytes. User-owned resumes, jobs, analyses, plans, practice sessions, and application entries are checked against the authenticated account before retrieval or modification.

This repository intentionally stops before OCR, third-party AI providers, and RAG. Those features require separate threat modeling, provider configuration, and evaluation standards rather than being represented as incomplete or simulated controls.

To report a vulnerability, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Deployment

[`render.yaml`](render.yaml) is a Render Blueprint describing both services, so the deployment is reviewable in version control rather than reconstructed from dashboard state. It declares the FastAPI web service and the static frontend export; the database is deliberately external, because Render's free PostgreSQL instance is deleted 30 days after creation.

Two secrets are never stored in this repository. `DATABASE_URL` is marked `sync: false` and entered once when the blueprint is created; `JWT_SECRET` uses `generateValue: true` so Render generates a strong value that no one needs to handle.

Operational notes worth knowing before deploying:

- **Any PostgreSQL URL works.** Managed providers hand out driver-less `postgresql://` URLs, which SQLAlchemy maps to psycopg2 — a driver this project does not install. `normalize_database_url` rewrites the scheme to psycopg 3 for both the API and Alembic, so a provider URL can be pasted verbatim.
- **Migrations run in the build command,** not a pre-deploy hook, because pre-deploy is a paid Render feature. A failed migration fails the build and the previous version keeps serving.
- **The platform health check points at liveness, not readiness,** on purpose. A readiness check there would make Render restart a healthy process during a database blip and turn a recoverable fault into an outage.
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is inlined at build time,** so changing the API origin requires a rebuild rather than a restart. `CORS_ORIGINS` on the API must list the frontend origin exactly; a trailing slash or an `http://` scheme fails the browser preflight while the API itself still reports healthy.

After a deploy, `GET /api/v1/health/ready` is the single check that confirms the service can actually serve traffic.
