**The next agent starts wiser.**

Persistent memory for AI agents that need to carry work forward, recover original evidence, and stop following a lesson when its source changes.

Mnemosyne connects memory to its consequences: a corrected requirement can retire a dependent procedure, a failed trial can withhold a skill, and a new agent can resume from an explicit handoff. Run the local engine in one SQLite file; connect your host through TypeScript, MCP, CLI, or authenticated HTTP with a Python client and live inspector.

**2.0.0-rc.9 · Release candidate · MIT · Node.js ≥22.16**

[Website](https://mnemosy.ai) · [Quickstart](docs/quickstart.md) · [Documentation](docs/README.md) · [Examples](examples/README.md) · [Migration](docs/BRIDGE.md) · [Measured results](docs/evaluation/BENCHMARKS.md) · [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mnemosy-ai/v/2.0.0-rc.9) · [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Choose your engine

**Both engines ship in 2.0.0-rc.9.** Choose the storage and runtime that fit your application:

| Engine | Best starting point | SDK entry point | Guide |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Vector Engine** | An application using the existing service-backed memory architecture. Requires configured external services. | `createMnemosyne` from `mnemosy-ai` | [Working example](examples/basic-usage.ts) · [Version 2 changes](docs/MIGRATION-v2.md) |
| **Local Engine** | A self-contained SQLite memory store with evidence, corrections and agent lifecycle tools. | `createLocalMemory` from `mnemosy-ai/local` | [Local API](docs/api.md) · [Agent lifecycle](docs/AGENT.md) |

The `MemoryAgent` adapter uses the Local Engine's runtime. These engines have separate schemas and do not automatically migrate or synchronize data. To transition gradually, explicitly connect your existing store through the [read-only migration bridge](docs/BRIDGE.md); it leaves that store unchanged.

Engine choice is separate from release channel: stable `mnemosy-ai@latest` remains on version 1.x, while `mnemosy-ai@next` selects the version 2 candidate containing **both** engines. Review the [migration notes](docs/MIGRATION-v2.md) before upgrading an existing Vector Engine application.

## Start with a working demonstration

Install the exact release candidate in your project. Node 24 is recommended; the local memory engine needs no model API key, database server, or Docker.

```sh
npm install mnemosy-ai@2.0.0-rc.9
npx --no-install mnemosy demo
npx --no-install mnemosy learning-demo
```

The prerelease channel is `mnemosy-ai@next`. Pin the exact version for reproducible deployments; unqualified `npm install mnemosy-ai` follows the stable `latest` channel and still selects version 1.x. Evaluate this candidate on your own workload before production. Python registry publication is separate; the bundled Python client can be installed from the checkout.

To build and run the same candidate from source:

```sh
git clone --branch v2.0.0-rc.9 --depth 1 https://github.com/28naem-del/mnemosyne.git
cd mnemosyne
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run build
npm run demo
npm run demo:learning
```

The first demo uses a temporary database to show a handoff, correction, private scope and forgetting. The learning demo exercises capture, a scripted observation job, skill trials, explicit sharing and correction-driven retirement. Both run real local APIs with deterministic fixtures and no model calls. [Choose your next example](examples/README.md).

For full contributor validation, run `npm run check`, `npm run check:docs` and `npm run check:public`. RC9 refreshes packaging, contact details and release guidance over the RC8 engine; the recorded evaluation reports remain historical measurements of the versions and conditions they name.

To consume your built checkout from another project, run `npm install /absolute/path/to/mnemosyne` in that project. Keep the checkout and its `dist` directory available. The older [RC8 GitHub release and checksummed downloads](https://github.com/28naem-del/mnemosyne/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.8) remain unchanged.

## A correction should change what the next agent does

```js
import { createLocalMemory } from 'mnemosy-ai/local';

const memory = createLocalMemory({
  path: './agent-memory.sqlite',
  workspaceId: 'catalogue',
  agentId: 'designer',
});

const brief = memory.store({
  text: 'Product images must be 1200 by 900 pixels.',
  kind: 'fact',
  key: 'catalogue.image-size',
  source: { uri: 'brief://catalogue/v1' },
  trust: 'observed',
  visibility: 'workspace',
});

const procedure = memory.store({
  text: 'Export catalogue product images at 1200 by 900 pixels.',
  kind: 'procedure',
  source: { uri: 'run://designer/export' },
  trust: 'observed',
  dependencies: [brief.id],
  visibility: 'workspace',
});

memory.correct(brief.id, {
  text: 'Product images must be 1600 by 1200 pixels.',
  source: { uri: 'brief://catalogue/v2' },
  reason: 'The delivery specification changed.',
});

console.log(memory.get(procedure.id)?.status); // invalidated
const context = memory.compile({
  query: 'catalogue product images',
  maxTokens: 2048,
});
console.log(context.text); // Send eligible context to your responder.
// Inspect context.citations and context.uncertainty alongside the text.
memory.close();
```

The old procedure remains inspectable but is no longer eligible as current guidance. Dependencies must be declared by the controller. `observed` means the host recorded the source; it does not certify its truth. The default context counter measures UTF-8 bytes conservatively, not a model's tokenizer. [Context contract](docs/CONTEXT.md).

## Local Engine, several entry points

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Host[Your agent or application] --> Interfaces[TypeScript · MCP · CLI · HTTP / Python]
  Interfaces --> Runtime[Capture · Context · Trials · Action checks]
  Runtime --> Store[(Local SQLite memory)]
  Store --- Evidence[Sources · History · Dependencies · Outcomes]
  Runtime -. explicit configuration .-> Models[Optional model providers]
  Runtime -. read-only adapter .-> Previous[Previous memory system]
```

The host chooses identities, trust assertions, providers and execution budgets. Construction starts no worker or model download. `MemoryAgent` can prepare context before a turn and capture supplied visible input/output afterward; background work runs only when the host starts it. [Host loop](docs/AGENT.md).

The local database holds memories, vectors and runtime state. Optional local CPU providers run cached inference in separate processes after explicit provisioning. Their dependency requirements, model identities and licenses are documented in the [local model guide](docs/LOCAL-MODELS.md). The existing backend integration remains available through `createMnemosyne`; it does not automatically synchronize with the local engine. [Version 1 migration notes](docs/MIGRATION-v2.md).

### Connect through MCP

After building, add a server entry to your MCP client. Replace the example path and choose an existing parent directory for the database.

```json
{
  "command": "node",
  "args": [
    "/absolute/path/mnemosyne/dist/cli/index.js", "mcp",
    "--db", "/absolute/path/data/memory.sqlite",
    "--workspace", "my-project", "--agent", "assistant"
  ]
}
```

Use `--read-only` to omit mutation tools. Forgetting requires an explicit `--allow-destructive` launch. Models cannot choose another workspace, promote their own trust, or report successful trials through MCP. For an authenticated service, Python access and a live inspector, see [HTTP and Python](docs/RUNTIME.md#http-inspector-and-python). Native provider tool protocols are documented in the [adapter guide](docs/PROVIDER-TOOLS.md).

### Require stronger skill evidence

```js
import { createLocalMemory } from 'mnemosy-ai/local';
import {
  MemoryRuntime,
  RECOMMENDED_SKILL_PROMOTION_POLICY,
} from 'mnemosy-ai/runtime';

const memory = createLocalMemory({
  path: './skills-memory.sqlite', workspaceId: 'my-project', agentId: 'assistant',
});
const runtime = new MemoryRuntime(memory, {
  skillPromotionPolicy: RECOMMENDED_SKILL_PROMOTION_POLICY,
});
// Use runtime to create candidates and record controller trials.
memory.close(); // Close after your host finishes using the runtime.
```

The recommended policy requires successful trials across two distinct tasks and two verifier identities. Candidates stay outside advisory context until their stored requirements are satisfied; a weaker configuration cannot lower an existing candidate's requirements. The compatibility default remains one task and one verifier. Identities and trial outcomes are controller assertions, so your host must provide real tests and independent evidence. [Trial contract](docs/RUNTIME.md#project-models-skill-trials-and-traces).

## Migrate while your agent keeps working

The optional `mnemosy-ai/bridge` wraps your explicitly supplied legacy search adapter. It copies used records with stable origins, compares paired retrieval results, and moves from shadow to assist to preferred routing as observed coverage meets configured thresholds. Missing legacy matches remain available, and routing can return to the previous system.

The bridge keeps querying the original store for reconciliation and never writes or deletes there. Progress measures observed queries, not complete-store migration or answer quality. Host credentials, source selection and eventual cutover stay under your control. [Bridge contract](docs/BRIDGE.md).

For a full export migration, choose one of the eleven supported profiles, preview the exact source bytes, then apply the reviewed plan atomically. Imports are private and untrusted by default; retry recognition, source inspection, guarded undo and erasure replay protection are included. Foreign embeddings and unsupported policy semantics are not silently converted. [Full migration](docs/MIGRATION.md).

```sh
node --experimental-strip-types examples/gradual-migration.ts
node --experimental-strip-types examples/migration.ts
node --experimental-strip-types examples/maintenance.ts
```

These examples use isolated synthetic data. They do not connect to your existing accounts or memory stores.

## Measured, with the limits visible

The paired LongMemEval S retrieval run includes all **500 questions**, with positive evidence metrics on **470 annotated answerable questions**. Both retrieval conditions use 20 chunks and the same 8,192-byte context budget.

| Complete annotated-session coverage | Earlier overlap scorer | Current BM25 default |
|---|---:|---:|
| Before context packing | 386 / 470 (82.13%) | 425 / 470 (90.43%) |
| After context packing | 367 / 470 (78.09%) | 382 / 470 (81.28%) |

The 30 abstention questions remain in attempt counts without a positive retrieval score. All 500 full-history controls exceeded the context budget and are reported as overflows. The run uses same-day timestamp compatibility, including 1,475 sessions later than the stated question instant. A session hit can come from any of its chunks; it does not prove that the answer-bearing sentence reached the model. No embedding, generation or judge calls were made.

These results measure retrieval coverage against the earlier local scorer. They do not establish generated-answer accuracy or superiority over other systems. [Raw reports and fingerprints](docs/evaluation/BENCHMARKS.md) · [Reproduction protocol](docs/evaluation/CORPUS_PROTOCOL.md).

A separate [evidence lifecycle diagnostic](docs/evaluation/EVIDENCE-PROTOCOL.md) tests correction, time, conflicts, failure, erasure and scope behavior. It deliberately retains a failing case: changing an unrelated field can retire a still-valid dependent rule. The [engineering review](docs/EXTERNAL-REVIEW.md) and [release status](docs/UPGRADE-STATUS.md) track this and other remaining work.

## Operational boundaries

Workspace and agent IDs are trusted controller selectors, not tenant authentication. The HTTP service supplies scope-bound bearer authentication; remote TLS and enterprise identity require application deployment work. Databases and backups are plaintext. Forgetting removes covered live content and blocks known source replays, but cannot erase an older backup or a prompt already sent to a model.

Local semantic search scans the eligible indexed corpus with bounded retained candidates and a deadline; it is not an approximate-nearest-neighbor index. Generated observations and trial results remain fallible assertions. Action checks validate declared local dependencies before dispatch, not external transactions. Managed synchronization, model training and six validated native framework integrations are not included.
