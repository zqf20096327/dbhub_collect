**Git-like versioning for AI workflows, organized as books and chapters.**

Every AI action gets logged as an immutable "chapter." Chapters bundle into "books" (versioned features). Books live on a "shelf" grouped by feature. Edit a feature? A new edition is created — the old one stays as a permanent audit trail.

## Why

AI workflows are opaque. Prompts go in, results come out, and nobody can trace what happened. AI Audit gives you:

- **Visual semantic diffing (v0.2.0)** — side-by-side line-by-line prompt & result diff comparison in both the Web Dashboard and Terminal CLI.
- **Validation gate telemetry (v0.2.0)** — real-time validation gate pass rates tracked directly on the bookshelf dashboard.
- **Full audit trail** — every prompt, result, actor, and timestamp is immutable.
- **Feature-level versioning** — edits create new editions, old ones are preserved.
- **Human-readable exports** — JSON for machines, Markdown for auditors.
- **Works everywhere** — CLI, REST API, web dashboard, or one-line SDK calls.

## Operator Guide

If you are introducing AI Audit Shelf to a founder, operator, or non-technical teammate, start with the audit problem before the book/chapter metaphor:

- [Audit UX for operators](docs/audit-ux-for-operators.md)

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- No external dependencies for CLI (stdlib only)
- `fastapi` and `uvicorn` for the API server

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

---

### 1. CLI

Log actions, bundle into books, browse the shelf.

```bash
# Log chapters
python cli.py add-chapter "Summarize Q1 sales" "Revenue up 15%" --actor alice --source claude
python cli.py add-chapter "Email report to team" "Sent to 5 managers" --actor bob --source copilot

# Bundle into a book
python cli.py create-book "Q1 Reporting" c_001 c_002 --feature "Reporting"

# Browse
python cli.py shelf
python cli.py show-book b_001
python cli.py list-chapters

# Create a new edition when requirements change
python cli.py add-chapter "Add regional breakdown" "APAC +22%, EMEA +8%" --actor alice --source claude
python cli.py new-edition b_001 --chapter-ids c_001 c_002 c_003

# Diff editions
python cli.py diff-books b_001 b_002

# Export for auditors
python cli.py export-book b_001 --format markdown
python cli.py export-book b_001 --format json

# Search
python cli.py search-chapters --actor alice
python cli.py search-chapters --keyword "sales"
python cli.py search-chapters --after "2026-05-01"
```

---

### 2. API Server

Start the server, then call it from any tool or language.

```bash
python api.py
```

Server runs at `http://localhost:8000`. Interactive docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

```bash
# Log a chapter
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chapter?prompt=Analyze+reviews&result=85%25+positive&actor=agent&source=langchain"

# Create a book (title/feature as query params, chapter_ids as JSON body)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/book?title=Review%20Analysis&feature=Reviews" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '["c_001", "c_002"]'

# Browse
curl http://localhost:8000/shelf
curl http://localhost:8000/books
curl http://localhost:8000/chapters

# Diff two editions
curl "http://localhost:8000/diff/books?id_a=b_001&id_b=b_002"

# Export
curl "http://localhost:8000/export/book/b_001?format=markdown"
```

**Auth (optional):** Set `AUDIT_API_KEY` env var to require `X-API-Key` header on write endpoints.

```bash
export AUDIT_API_KEY=secret123
# Now POST requests need: -H "X-API-Key: secret123"
```

---

### 3. Web Dashboard

Visual interface for browsing, searching, and diffing.

```bash
# Start the API server
python api.py

# Open the dashboard
open dashboard.html    # macOS
start dashboard.html   # Windows
xdg-open dashboard.html  # Linux
```

The dashboard connects to `http://localhost:8000` and provides:

- **Library** — bookshelf grouped by feature
- **Books** — table view with export buttons
- **Chapters** — full audit log with detail view
- **Search** — filter by actor, keyword, date
- **Diff** — compare two editions side-by-side

> **API URL config:** If your API server runs on a different port or host, type the URL into the input at the bottom of the sidebar. The value is saved in your browser and persists across reloads.

---

### 4. Agent Demo

See how any AI workflow plugs into the audit system.

```bash
# Terminal 1: start the server
python api.py

# Terminal 2: run the demo
python demo_agent.py
```

The demo simulates a "Product Review Automation" workflow — 4 steps, each logged as a chapter, then bundled into a book. The pattern is the same for any agent.

* 🦙 **[LlamaIndex Callback Handler](docs/integration-recipes.md#llamaindex--callback-handler)** — Track retrieval, query pipelines, and response synthesis without indexing noise.
* 🤖 **[OpenAI Function Calls](docs/integration-recipes.md#openai--function-calls)** — Log direct completions and function calls cleanly.
* ⚡ **[Vercel AI SDK (Next.js)](docs/integration-recipes.md#vercel-ai-sdk--nextjs-app-router)** — A streaming Next.js App Router API endpoint with a background `onFinish` logging callback.
* 🐚 **[Shell Command Wrapper](docs/integration-recipes.md#shell-script--command-wrapper)** — Audit terminal commands, python scripts, and deployment steps.
* 🌐 **[curl / REST Reference](docs/integration-recipes.md#curl-any-language)** — Quick API examples for any other language.

## Roadmap

We are actively developing the next version of AI Audit Shelf, focusing heavily on **reproducibility** and **agent pipeline safety**. Here is what we are building next (inspired directly by community feedback!):

* 🧪 **First-Class Reproducibility Parameters:** First-class database support for tracking generation metadata (`model_version`, `temperature`, `seed`, `top_p`) so prompt differences are deterministic.
* 🛑 **Verification & Validation Gates:** Integration of synchronous and asynchronous validation callbacks (hooks) to halt execution flows and flag errors before prompt drift propagates downstream.
* 🔗 **Contextual Session Tracking:** Automatic linking of prompt versions directly to the originating user `session_id` or failing execution context.
* 📦 **Docker Support:** Containerized deployment templates for single-command self-hosting.

Want to help shape these features? Join the discussion on our [Issues tracker](https://github.com/ATHARVA262005/ai-audit-shelf/issues)!
