The iOS Cache Analysis for Tracking Coordinates History (iCatch) is a utility to process the iOS Cache.sqlite database and create a timelined KML map for use in Google Earth.


This utility allows you to export GPS data from the iOS Cache.SQLite database, generate CSV and KMZ files, and log details for analysis.

A processing log, csv file containing records of processed files (within time/date filter considerations), and KMZ file are output to a new directory at the user-selected location.

    
************* 
*All times are processed and output in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC-0)*
*Due to their size, multiple KMZ files may be generated and are limited to 10,000 records each.*

## Requirements

To install the required Python libraries, use the command: pip install -r requirements.txt

**This tool is intended to be run using Python. A Windows executable with the latest updates will be distributed from time to time.**

## Usage
This tool was designed with Python and can be run as a windowless Python file or as a Windows executable file. The executable file will be updated from time to time and may not be the latest release.

To open GUI, from the CLI run 

    py iCatch_v1.X.pyw
or double-click the .pyw file from your file explorer.
1.	Input case information.
2.	Select the path of the exported **Cache.sqlite** database which is found at: *private/var/mobile/Library/Caches/com.apple.routined/Cache.sqlite* (please ensure the shm and wal files are included in the same directory so all records are processed).
3.	Select the desired color for the pin and accuracy ring.
4.	Select a radius filter to limit the maximum radius of horizontal accuracy.
5.	Select the Date/Time filter options. This option is enabled by default.

   
     a.	It is highly recommended to use this option as the database contains tens of thousands of points, and can have thousands of points in a short timeframe.
6.	Select Include Speed and Direction if these datapoints are of interest. These values include reported device speed, output in MPH, and reported "Course" direction, output with degrees and cardinal direction. Reported values that fall in a negative range are considered invalid and are noted as such.  	

*The **Triage Dates** function will quickly display the dates that are stored within the database, along with the number of records for those dates.*

### Google Earth Pro Usage:
•	The KMZ file should be used with the Google Earth Pro desktop version. The file is loaded into temporary places. Each point has two items: the "Pin" and the horizontal accuracy overlay. Only the pin is loaded automatically to save system resources.

•	The timeline slider should be adjusted to a smaller timeframe before loading (full-checking) the loaded KMZ folder. This will ensure that not all (up to) 10,000 points and overlays are loaded at once.

•	To adjust the visible timeframe, use the slider points on the timeline bar, as well as the settings option.

•	All records are processed in UTC-0 and the settings options will allow for timezone display adjustments.

## Issues
I'm still trying to figure out GitHub, so if you come across an issue or have suggestions on a better way to do things, please let me know!
