SkillCraft is a modern, full-stack application designed to be a personal guide for mastering new skills. It provides users with structured, interactive learning paths called "Roadmaps." Built with a powerful .NET backend and a dynamic React frontend, SkillCraft uses a role-based architecture and integrates AI to automate and enhance content creation.

**Frontend Repository:** [**AbSamrah/skillcraft-frontend**](https://github.com/AbSamrah/skillcraft-frontend)

## About The Project

This project is a comprehensive learning platform built on a clean, modular architecture to ensure maintainability and scalability. The API exposes a set of well-defined endpoints to support a decoupled frontend application, creating a robust system for both learners and content creators.

The core functionalities include:
* **Structured Learning:** A complete system for creating and managing learning "Roadmaps" composed of milestones and steps.
* **AI-Powered Content Generation:** Integrates with the Gemini API to automatically generate entire roadmaps and quizzes based on a single topic.
* **Interactive Knowledge Checks:** A module for creating and taking two types of quizzes (Multiple Choice and True/False) to test user knowledge.
* **Personalized User Profiles:** Allows users to track their progress, save roadmaps, and manage their learning journey.

## Key Features

-   **RESTful API:** A well-structured set of endpoints for all application features.
-   **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
-   **Role-Based Access Control:**
    -   **Learner (User):** Can browse content, follow roadmaps, track progress, take quizzes, and generate content using AI.
    -   **Editor:** Can perform all Learner actions, plus has full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) access to all educational content.
    -   **Admin:** Has full access, including all Editor permissions plus user and role management.
-   **Advanced Content:** Filtering: All content lists in the editor dashboard are searchable and paginated.
-   **Dynamic Frontend:** A responsive React SPA with a dark theme, providing a seamless user experience.

## Technology Stack & Architecture

* **High-Level Architecture:** Client-Server
* The application follows a classic Client-Server Architecture.

**Client (React):** A Single Page Application (SPA) that runs in the user's browser.

**Server (.NET):** A centralized backend that handles business logic, data persistence, and security.

## Backend Architecture: Modular Monolith

The backend is designed as a Modular Monolith, divided internally into distinct modules:
* **Users Management:** Handles authentication, authorization, and user data.
* **Roadmap Management:** Manages the creation and structure of learning roadmaps.
* **Quizzes Management:** Manages all types of quizzes and their content.
* **Profiles Management:** Manages user-specific data, like their progress and saved roadmaps.

## Database Architecture: Hybrid Model

* **SQL Server:** Used for the Users Management module (via Entity Framework Core).
* **MongoDB:** Used for the Roadmap, Quizzes, and Profiles modules.

## Key Design Patterns

* **Repository & Unit of Work Pattern:** Used in the Data Access Layer to abstract database logic.
* **Strategy Pattern:** Used for content creation, allowing for both Manual and AI creation strategies.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* .NET 8.0 SDK
* Node.js and npm
* Microsoft SQL Server
* MongoDB
* A code editor like Visual Studio or VS Code

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repositories**
   ```sh
    # Clone the backend (this repo)
    git clone [https://github.com/AbSamrah/SkillCraft.git]

    # Clone the frontend
    git clone [https://github.com/AbSamrah/skillcraft-frontend.git]
    ```

2. **Configure Backend Secrets**
It's recommended to use the .NET Secret Manager for your connection strings and API keys.

Navigate to the SkillCraft.Api project directory and set up your secrets:
```sh
    dotnet user-secrets init
    dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection" "Your_SQL_Server_Connection_String"
    dotnet user-secrets set "MongoDbConnection:ConnectionString" "Your_MongoDB_Connection_String"
    dotnet user-secrets set "MongoDbConnection:DatabaseName" "SkillCraftDb"
    dotnet user-secrets set "Jwt:Key" "Your_Super_Secret_JWT_Key"
    dotnet user-secrets set "Jwt:Issuer" "Your_Issuer"
```
Alternatively, you can add these values to your `appsettings.Development.json` file.

3. **Setup the Databases**
Navigate to the DataAccessLayer project directory and run the following command to apply migrations for the identity database:

# Apply migrations for the identity database
```sh
    dotnet ef database update
```
The application will automatically seed the databases with initial data for roles on the first run.

4. **Run the Backend API**
Navigate back to the SkillCraft.Api project directory and run the application:
```sh
    dotnet run
```
The API will be available at `http://localhost:5093` by default.
5. **Setup and Run the Frontend**
Navigate to your frontend project directory and run:
```sh
    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    
    # Run the application
    npm start
```
The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
