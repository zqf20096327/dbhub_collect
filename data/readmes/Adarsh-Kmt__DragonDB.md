# DragonDB
A B+ Tree based database storage engine, written in Go.

Check out my [substack](https://adarshkmt.substack.com/s/building-a-database), where I'll be explaining how I built it, layer by layer.

## Features
- Create multiple B+ trees.
- Allows multiple concurrent readers or single exclusive writer per B+ tree.
- Uses a slotted page format to represent B+ Tree nodes with support for variable-size records and compaction.
- Uses a buffer pool manager with an LRU eviction policy to cache database pages in memory.
- Direct I/O is used to bypass the kernel page cache and read/write data directly to disk, improving memory
efficiency and giving the database full control over caching.
- Integrated a [Write Ahead Log](https://github.com/Adarsh-Kmt/Lucario). Page level modifications are logged before persistence and replayed
during crash recovery.

## Architecture
Checkout [architecture.md](https://github.com/Adarsh-Kmt/DragonDB/blob/master/architecture.md) for an overview.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.19 or higher
- POSIX-compliant operating system (Linux, macOS)

### Clone and Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adarsh-Kmt/DragonDB.git
cd DragonDB
go mod tidy
go build ./...
```

## Technical Challenges Solved

### 1. Duplicate Page Fetching
**Problem**: When multiple threads simultaneously try to read the same page from disk, duplicate copies of the page are created in memory.

</p>

**Solution**: Use a double-checked locking pattern:
- Acquire read lock and check if page exists in memory.
- If not, release read lock and acquire write lock.
- Re-check condition under write lock to make sure another thread didn't make a copy of the page before write lock could be acquired.
- Only one copy of the page exists in memory.

</p>

### 2. Resource Leaks in Error Paths
**Problem**: Page allocation followed by I/O error left allocated page unused, causing memory leaks.

**Solution**: Comprehensive cleanup patterns:
- Immediate cleanup on I/O failure.

### 3. Direct I/O Performance Optimization
**Problem**: Buffered I/O operations suffered from double-buffering and unpredictable kernel cache behavior.

</p>

**Solution**: Custom Direct I/O implementation:
- Data from disk is transferred directly to user space memory using Direct I/O, bypassing the kernel page cache.
