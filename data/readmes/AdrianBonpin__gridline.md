## What is Gridline?

Gridline is a modern, open-source database GUI client built with [Tauri 2.0](https://tauri.app), Rust, and React. It is lightweight by design (~40 MB baseline), powerful by default, and free from the paywalls that limit commercial alternatives.

- **No caps** on connections, tabs, or saved queries.
- **Deep PostgreSQL tooling** — visual `pg_dump`, `pg_restore`, and DB-to-DB sync.
- **Backup, restore & sync for every database** — PostgreSQL, MySQL (`mysqldump` / bundled MariaDB clients), and SQLite (`.dump`), with direct DB-to-DB sync between live connections.
- **Excel export** — CSV, JSON, SQL, Markdown, and `.xlsx` from any data grid.
- **Cancel long-running queries** — a per-connection cancel button instead of waiting it out or killing the app.
- **SQLite table editor** — the visual Create Table / Edit Table flow now works on SQLite too (`INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` instead of `serial`).
- **Full MySQL + SQLite browsing** — connect, browse, query, and edit MySQL and SQLite the same way you do PostgreSQL.
- **Full object explorer** — not just tables, but functions, triggers, sequences, enums, extensions, materialized views, and procedures.
- **Interactive ER diagram** — explore relationships visually with crow's-foot cardinality notation.
- **Production-safe editing** — stage INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE changes, review the generated SQL, then commit all at once.

The app ships with a built-in **Gridline Demo (SQLite)** database, so you can explore every feature immediately without setting up a server.

## Who is it for?

Gridline is built for developers and small teams who manage multiple database environments:

- **Full-stack developers** switching between local, staging, and production databases.
- **Platform / DBAs** who need `pg_dump`, `pg_restore`, and sync tooling in a native UI.
- **Teams that want native speed** without Electron bloat or seat licenses.

## Recent Changes

<details>
<summary>View the full changelog</summary>

- **v0.8.3** — **Your installed database tools are found again** ([issue #44](https://github.com/AdrianBonpin/gridline/issues/44)): Gridline reported *"mysqldump not found"* even when the tools were installed, for three separate reasons — the bundled binaries were looked up one directory too high (`<resource_dir>/mysql_tools` instead of the `<resource_dir>/resources/mysql_tools` the installer actually bundles, which silently disabled the bundled fallback for PostgreSQL too), a macOS GUI app inherits launchd's minimal `PATH` rather than your shell's, and only `mariadb-dump`/`mariadb` were ever probed — never `mysqldump`/`mysql`, which is what `brew install mysql-client` installs. Both engines now resolve through one ordered chain (trusted absolute directories → your `PATH` → bundled), a candidate counts only if it is a real file that runs `--version`, and an explicit **Check again** re-detects on demand. **The bundled MySQL client now actually runs**: backup and sync were passing MySQL-only options (`--databases=<db>`, `--skip-column-statistics`, `--ssl-mode=…`) to the bundled MariaDB binary, so the job died at option parsing before connecting; options are now tailored per client. **Backup, Restore, DB Sync and Schema Diff say which tool they use and where it came from** (`Using system mysqldump`, `Using bundled mariadb-dump`), explain a bundled copy that is present but cannot run, offer one-click copy of the install command, warn non-blockingly when the dump client's major version is older than the server's, and share the Objects view's form layout. **The app icon is back to its previous rendering** — the macOS "legacy plate" strip from #40 was reverted at the maintainer's request.

- **v0.8.2** — **MySQL values actually show up**: every non-string MySQL column — ids and other integers, `DECIMAL`, `BIT`, `YEAR`, `DATE`/`TIME`/`DATETIME`/`TIMESTAMP`, `FLOAT`/`DOUBLE` — was rendering as `NULL`, so primary-key columns looked empty; all 30 column types now decode by their declared type, with 64-bit integers and `DECIMAL` carried as strings so no digits are lost and `DATETIME(6)` keeping its microseconds. **MySQL restore works against MySQL 8** — it no longer shells out to a bundled MariaDB client (which cannot authenticate with `caching_sha2_password`), running in-process over the same driver browsing uses, stopping at the first error with the failing statement's position, cancellable, and `DELIMITER`-aware so dumps with triggers and stored routines apply. **The `Clean` toggle is now real**: it drops only the objects the dump recreates, so an unrelated table in the target survives — and since MySQL DDL auto-commits, the Restore form warns a failed restore cannot be rolled back. **`.sql` files open with Gridline**: right-click → Open With loads the script into a query tab named after the file; it never runs on open (Run still confirms anything destructive), and with no connection open the file is held with a prompt until you pick one.

- **v0.8.1** — **Neon / Supabase / PlanetScale connections fixed**: a pasted connection string's `?sslmode=` is now carried into the saved connection (it was silently dropped, so TLS stayed off and Neon replied *"connection is insecure (try using `sslmode=require`)"*); the SSH / SSL tab's mode and certificate paths persist on create *and* edit, managed presets pre-select their TLS mode, and `*.neon.tech` / `*.supabase.co` / `*.psdb.cloud` hosts default to `require` when no mode is stored — so previously-saved connections keep working. Pasting a URI also fills every setting it can and suggests a name, so a URL can be tested and saved with no retyping. **macOS keychain prompts self-heal**: items whose ACL still points at an older binary path made macOS ask for the keychain password on *every* access, once per secret — the app now checks the ACL (silently, before reading) and repairs it when needed, so you authorize a secret once. Version bump.

- **v0.7.15** — **Support channel on the landing page**: optional coffee via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/adrianbonpin), never gates a feature. Landing copy refreshed (em dashes dropped, OSS section simplified, funding FAQ); version bump.

- **v0.7.14** — **No more repeated macOS keychain prompts**: saved connection passwords and SSH secrets are now ACL-pinned to the app's code signature on every save (`keychain_acl`), so app upgrades never re-trigger the macOS keychain access dialog (users upgrading from pre-signing builds see one final prompt — choose **Always Allow**). **Install via Homebrew**: `brew tap AdrianBonpin/gridline https://github.com/AdrianBonpin/homebrew-gridline.git` then `brew install --cask gridline`; version bump.

- **v0.7.13** — **macOS is now Developer-ID signed and notarized**: the app is properly code-signed with a Developer ID Application certificate and notarized by Apple, so macOS opens it without the Gatekeeper "Open Anyway" prompt or the `xattr` quarantine workaround. The release script (`scripts/release-mac.sh`) auto-detects the signing identity from the keychain, notarizes + staples both architectures, and verifies the result before uploading; version bump.

- **v0.7.12** — **Reliable cell editing for non-text columns**: editing a PostgreSQL cell whose type isn't `text` (integers, booleans, UUIDs, `json`/`jsonb`, timestamps, enums, numerics, …) previously failed with a Rust serialization error; edited values are now sent to PostgreSQL in text wire format so the server parses them into the column's own type. **Recent connections fix**: the Recent strip no longer renders empty on first launch when the connections list hadn't loaded yet. **Full CI release pipeline for Windows**: self-hosted Windows runner builds the `.exe`/`.msi` installers (bundled `pg_dump`/`pg_restore`/`psql` + MariaDB clients) and uploads them to the release alongside Linux; version bump.

- **v0.7.10** — **Copy connection URL**: from a connection card's ⋮ menu, copy the connection string for use in env vars / other tools — **Copy connection URL** (includes the password, fetched from the OS keychain on demand) and **Copy connection URL (no password)** (safe to share). Builds `postgresql://` / `mysql://` / `sqlite://` / `redis://` strings with percent-encoded credentials and the PG `sslmode` appended; version bump.

- **v0.7.9** — **macOS install/launch fixes**: the app's local store now opens under the OS app-data directory (a cwd-relative `gridline.db` made Finder-launched copies silently exit with a Rust panic before the UI started); macOS bundles are **ad-hoc signed at build time** (`signingIdentity "-"`), replacing the Xcode linker-only signature that macOS treated as unsigned ("damaged and can't be opened", silent Finder refusals) — users now get a standard one-time Gatekeeper prompt (see the [install notes](#installers-are-unsigned-for-now), incl. the `xattr` workaround); **OpenSSL is vendored** into the `ssh2` build so the release no longer depends on a Homebrew OpenSSL path; version bump.

- **v0.7.8** — **SQLite `.dump` backup/restore** plus **backup / restore / sync for MySQL & SQLite** (mysqldump-based, system-first); **Excel (.xlsx) export** in the grid toolbar alongside CSV/JSON/SQL/Markdown; **cancel long-running queries** per connection; **settings export/import** (JSON); **Windows/Linux title bar fix** (macOS-only overlay drag strip); **SQLite table editor** (Create/Edit Table with SQLite-aware type mapping); version bump.

- **v0.7.7** — PostgreSQL **roles & grants** management (create/edit/drop roles with attributes + a per-role privilege explorer across tables/sequences/routines/schemas/databases — collapsible grouped lists with GRANT/REVOKE staging) and **table maintenance** (VACUUM / ANALYZE / REINDEX from the table menu). **Create Table / Edit Table** visual editor: columns grid with type dropdowns and drag-to-reorder, single + composite primary keys, column-diff staging (ADD / DROP / RENAME COLUMN, ALTER TYPE, SET | DROP DEFAULT, SET | DROP NOT NULL — one statement per queue item), atomic column-reorder table rebuild (single transaction, preserves constraints/indexes/FKs/grants/sequences, fail-closed for triggers/RLS/inheritance/partitioning). **FK management** — multi-column composer with cross-schema references and ON DELETE/UPDATE, inlined into CREATE TABLE; **table options** (tablespace, row-level security); changes queue auto-refreshes the object tree after schema-modifying commits; version bump.

- **v0.7.6** — Full PostgreSQL object management (create/edit/drop for enums, functions, procedures, triggers, sequences, extensions, views, materialized views, indexes, constraints) staged through the changes queue with generated-SQL previews; Enable Keychain toggle wired (default ON, opt-out; OFF = session-only); Objects view upgraded to the shared tabbed workspace (object detail tabs with per-type icons, inline manual query + changes queue); ⌘K object search fixes; version bump.

- **2026-08-05:** v0.7.5 — bundled `pg_dump`/`pg_restore`/`psql` (system-first, bundled fallback) so admin features work with no separate install; schema CRUD (create/rename/drop with CASCADE + dependency warning); Cmd+K object search (current schema, all object types); copy-as-DDL for every browsable object type; `pg_depend` object-dependency view shown before destructive drops.
- **2026-08-04:** v0.7.5 — revamped the New Connection screen into a two-stage flow with a 6-provider grid (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Redis, Supabase, NeonDB; managed presets ship with setup guides + SSL hints) and added full MySQL DB viewer support (connect, browse, query, inline cell editing + changes queue, DDL copy).
- **2026-08-04:** Revamped the built-in SQLite demo database with realistic e-commerce data (20 users, 24 products, 50 orders, 100 page views, 500 audit rows) and renamed it to **Gridline Demo (SQLite)**.
- **2026-07-XX:** Added inline cell editing with a stage-first changes queue, row-detail drawer, keyboard navigation, and cell-level copy.
- **2026-07-XX:** Added visual filter builder with drag-and-drop column palette and type-aware operators.
- **2026-07-XX:** Added schema visualizer with React Flow + dagre, crow's-foot notation, and cross-schema FK support.
- **2026-07-XX:** Added query history dropdown, saved queries, and a two-pane Queries view.
- **2026-06-XX:** Added settings redesign with live theme, accent color, font size, editor options, and tag reorder.
- **2026-06-XX:** Added SSH tunneling (password + key auth) and full PostgreSQL TLS runtime for production connections.

_Notes: DB Pro is an Electron app (launched Nov 2025) whose marketing copy overclaims — its free plan caps connections/tabs/saved queries (FAQ inconsistently claims "unlimited local connections") and gates data imports + SSH tunneling to paid, though CSV/JSON export does work on the free tier; Beekeeper's free Community edition genuinely offers unlimited tabs/connections/queries but gates backup/restore, file import, multi-table export, ERD, AI, and premium DB connectors behind paid tiers; TablePlus's free tier includes every feature but caps you at 2 open tabs / 2 windows / 2 advanced filters._

## Getting Started

### Download a release

Pre-built installers for macOS, Windows, and Linux are published on the [Releases](https://github.com/AdrianBonpin/gridline/releases) page.

> ⚠️ Gridline is under active development. Expect rough edges and please [open issues](https://github.com/AdrianBonpin/gridline/issues/new) when you hit them.

#### macOS signing & notarization

Gridline's macOS builds are **Developer-ID signed and notarized by GitHub Actions**, so macOS opens them without a Gatekeeper prompt. Both the `.app` and the `.dmg` it ships inside are notarized and carry a stapled ticket — notarizing only the `.app` is not enough, because Gatekeeper assesses the downloaded DMG itself and rejects it as "Unnotarized Developer ID" even when the app within is fine.

**One-time setup** (only the repo owner needs to do this):

1. **Create a Developer ID Application certificate** — [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com) → Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles → **+** → **Developer ID Application**. Generate a Certificate Signing Request from Keychain Access (Certificate Assistant → *Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority*), upload it, download the `.cer`, and double-click to install into your login keychain. Verify with `security find-identity -v -p codesigning`.
2. **Create an App Store Connect API key** for notarization — [appstoreconnect.apple.com](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) → Users and Access → **Integrations** → **App Store Connect API** → **+** (name it, *Developer* access). Download the `.p8` (shown once) and note the **Key ID** and **Issuer ID**.
3. **Add the signing secrets** to the repository (**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**):

   | Secret                       | Value                                                                                              |
   | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`          | base64 of the exported Developer ID `.p12` — `base64 -i DeveloperID.p12 \| pbcopy`                  |
   | `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | the password you set when exporting the `.p12`                                                     |
   | `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`     | e.g. `Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)` — from `security find-identity -v -p codesigning` |
   | `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`          | any throwaway password for the temporary CI keychain                                                |
   | `APPLE_API_KEY`              | App Store Connect **Key ID**                                                                        |
   | `APPLE_API_ISSUER`           | App Store Connect **Issuer ID**                                                                     |
   | `APPLE_API_KEY_CONTENT`      | contents of the downloaded `AuthKey_<KeyID>.p8`                                                     |

   When these secrets are absent the macOS jobs still build, but the DMGs are ad-hoc signed and **not** notarized (users get the “Open Anyway” prompt). The CI re-signs the bundled PostgreSQL/MariaDB client binaries with the same Developer ID identity, because Apple rejects ad-hoc-signed nested executables during notarization.

`scripts/release-mac.sh` is the **local fallback** path (handy for a signed build without burning CI minutes, or when Actions is unavailable). It auto-detects the Developer ID identity from your keychain, reads notarization credentials from `~/.config/gridline/notarize.env` (`APPLE_API_KEY`, `APPLE_API_ISSUER`, `APPLE_API_KEY_PATH`), signs both architectures, notarizes + staples them, verifies the result, then uploads the DMGs to the **GitHub** release for the tag (`gh release upload --clobber`, so a locally signed pair supersedes the CI-built ones — publish the draft afterwards). If the certificate or credentials are missing it fails with instructions (set `GRIDLINE_SKIP_NOTARIZE=1` to build signed-but-unnotarized for testing only).

**Windows** still shows a SmartScreen prompt (no Windows signing cert yet); **Linux** installs without a warning.

#### Which file should I download?

Each release contains **one file per platform** — you only need the one that matches your computer. The links below point at the current release (**v0.8.3**):

| Your system                            | Download this                                                                                                                                | Notes                                                            |
| :------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS **Apple Silicon** (M1/M2/M3/M4…) | [Gridline_0.8.3_aarch64.dmg](https://github.com/AdrianBonpin/gridline/releases/download/v0.8.3/Gridline_0.8.3_aarch64.dmg)                 | `aarch64` = Apple's own chip                                     |
| macOS **Intel**                        | [Gridline_0.8.3_x64.dmg](https://github.com/AdrianBonpin/gridline/releases/download/v0.8.3/Gridline_0.8.3_x64.dmg)                         | `x64` = Intel/AMD                                                |
| **Windows** (most PCs)                 | [Gridline_0.8.3_x64-setup.exe](https://github.com/AdrianBonpin/gridline/releases/download/v0.8.3/Gridline_0.8.3_x64-setup.exe)             | The `.msi` is an alternate installer (for enterprises/IT admins) |
| **Debian / Ubuntu**                    | [Gridline_0.8.3_amd64.deb](https://github.com/AdrianBonpin/gridline/releases/download/v0.8.3/Gridline_0.8.3_amd64.deb)                     | Install: `sudo apt install ./Gridline_0.8.3_amd64.deb`           |
| **Fedora / RHEL / openSUSE**           | [Gridline-0.8.3-1.x86_64.rpm](https://github.com/AdrianBonpin/gridline/releases/download/v0.8.3/Gridline-0.8.3-1.x86_64.rpm)               | Install: `sudo dnf install Gridline-0.8.3-1.x86_64.rpm`          |
| **Any other Linux**                    | [Gridline_0.8.3_amd64.AppImage](https://github.com/AdrianBonpin/gridline/releases/download/v0.8.3/Gridline_0.8.3_amd64.AppImage)           | Works on every distro: `chmod +x` the file, then double-click it |

**Not sure if your Mac is Intel or Apple Silicon?** Click the **Apple menu** → **About This Mac**. If it shows "Apple M1/M2/M3/M4…" download the `aarch64` file; if it shows an Intel chip, download `x64`. Downloading the wrong one won't run.

#### How releases are made

Cutting a release is one command — CI builds everything. **Releases are cut from `prod`, which is the production branch** — only push release tags from `prod`, never from feature branches:

```bash
git checkout prod && git pull
git tag v0.7.15
git push origin v0.7.15
```

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) builds the **macOS (Apple Silicon + Intel), Windows, and Linux** installers in parallel and opens a **draft release** on the [Releases](https://github.com/AdrianBonpin/gridline/releases) page. Review the draft and hit **Publish release** — publishing triggers a follow-up job that bumps the Homebrew cask in [`AdrianBonpin/homebrew-gridline`](https://github.com/AdrianBonpin/homebrew-gridline) (pushed via a write-enabled deploy key on the tap, `HOMEBREW_TAP_DEPLOY_KEY`; skipped when unset).

The self-hosted Gitea mirror (`.gitea/workflows/release.yml`) still builds Linux and Windows for the Gitea release, and `scripts/release-mac.sh` can build macOS locally — both are kept as a fallback if GitHub is unavailable.

Before tagging, make sure the version number is in sync across `desktop/package.json`, `desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and `desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, and update the **README download tables** (Download + Which file should I download?) to the new version's asset names.

### Build from source

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AdrianBonpin/gridline.git
cd gridline

# 2. Install all workspace dependencies
bun install

# 3. Run in development mode with hot-reload (from desktop/)
cd desktop
bun run tauri dev

# 4. Build for production
bun run tauri build
```

### System requirements

- **macOS:** 13 (Ventura) or newer
- **Windows:** 10 or newer
- **Linux:** Ubuntu 22.04+ or equivalent modern distribution
- **RAM:** 8 GB recommended
- **PostgreSQL client tools:** `pg_dump`/`pg_restore`/`psql` are **bundled** with Gridline — no separate install required for backup/restore/sync. (System tools, if installed, are preferred.)
