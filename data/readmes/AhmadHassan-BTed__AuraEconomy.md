##  Key Features

*   ** Dynamic Ranking**: 10 distinct tiers from "Wood" to the prestigious "Eternal" rank.
*   ** Legacy Aura**: A permanent visual badge of honor. Viewers keep a colored glow based on their *highest-ever* rank, regardless of monthly resets.
*   ** Integrated Betting**: Advanced escrow-based betting system (Win/Loss) with rank-based wager caps.
*   ** !annuncio System**: Premium point-sink command that broadcasts beautiful, animated messages on-screen.
*   ** Seasonal Resets**: Monthly resets that clear seasonal points but preserve lifetime stats and "Aura" status.
*   ** Robust Accrual**: Verified 1-point-per-minute watch time system using Streamer.bot's native 'Present Viewers' engine for 100% reliability.
*   ** High Performance**: SQLite database configured with WAL mode to allow simultaneous access by your bot and external tools (like Minecraft plugins).
