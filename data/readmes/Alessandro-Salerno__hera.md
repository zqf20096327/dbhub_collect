Create SVG Entity-Relationship diagrams using a simple text-based formal language

## Why Hera?
ER diagrams are often used in database implementation during the initial design phases, particularly as part of a [Conceptual Design](https://mariadb.com/docs/general-resources/database-theory/database-design/database-design-phase-2-conceptual-design). 
Such diagrams are also widely used in academia, being employed by introductory and advanced DB courses alike. 

Their dominance, however, is curiously not accompanied by easy-to-use, accessible design tools. In fact, the use of rudimentary or otherwise non-application-specific software such as [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) is frequently encouraged.
While sufficient, these programs and websites typically rely on visual design rather than formal, text-based descriptions, making the process both _slower_ and _harder_, especially for people with visual disabilities. 

Hera (backronym for _Hierarchical Entity-Relationship Autogenerator_) aims to provide an accessible, stable, and portable, text-based solution. The project is currently intended for academic use, though its scope and structure may allow for more advanced use cases in the future.

## Features
- Custom ER description language
- Standard SVG output
- Relationships as first-class constructs (i.e., with support for attributes)
- Support for specialization hierarchies with both total and exclusive modifiers
- Visual Studio Code (TextMate) extension and Treesitter parser
- Helpful command-line error messages
- Designed to be portable and (mostly) freestanding
- UNIX-like behavior: SVG source is printed to Standard Output, allowing for piping or other forms of straightforward redirection

## Portability
While not strictly related to database design, portability is one of Hera's core philosophies. An often overlooked aspect of so called _free software_ is the freedom to choose the host platform.
Most projects, in fact, have large dependency graphs which de-facto force users to use one of a handful of popular platforms.

Given its scope, Hera strives for easy portability, thus letting users _choose_ their operating system, compiler, and standard library without any special considerations for Hera.

## Examples
```
// University Management System
// Demonstrates specialization, inheritance, and cardinality constraints

entity Person total exclusive alias p {
    attribute "ID Number" key;
    attribute Name;
    attribute "Birth Date";
}

entity Student specifies Person {
    attribute "Enrollment Year";
    attribute Major;

    relation Enrolls (1, N);
}

entity Professor specifies Person {
    attribute Department;
    attribute "Office Number";

    relation Teaches (1, N);
}

entity Course {
    attribute Code key;
    attribute Title;
    attribute Credits;

    relation Enrolls (0, N);
    relation Teaches (1, 1);
    relation Requirements (0, N);
}

relation Enrolls {
    attribute Grade;
    attribute Semester;
}

relation Teaches {
}

relation Requirements {
}
```
