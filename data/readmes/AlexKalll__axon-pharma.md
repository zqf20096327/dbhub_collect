#### Key Insights and Ouptuts
- **Streamlit:** Streamlit is a Python library for building interactive web applications.
- **Firebase:** Firebase is a platform for building and deploying apps, databases, and other cloud services.
- **Gemini AI:** Gemini AI is a platform for building and deploying LLMs.
- **Telegram:** Telegram is a messaging and voice communication platform.

This is a demo for How LLMs are powerful in automating pharmacy services. Take a look at in the sample output below that the model has done for the Pharmacy Admin...

![Sample Output-1](assets/parallel_calling.jpg)
- Here was the prompt given to the model 
```
write a telegram announcement regarding this that a new medicine 
using telegram_post function called paracetamol is arrived and 
record this medicine, and add 200 stock to the aspirin medicine, 
and delete the asprin medicine since it is prohibited by the 
government, and update the order status of order 
0b527cd538844e7ab93c4f656f314cd7 to delivered.
```

It has been be able to call multiple functions at the same time.

CI pipline & Dockerfile:
- GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that sets up Python 3.11 and installs `requirements.txt`.
- Simple `Dockerfile` to run the Streamlit app on port 8501.

Usage
- CI: push or open a PR against `main`; it will install dependencies.
- Docker:
  - Build: `docker build -t axon-pharma .`
  - Run: `docker run -p 8501:8501 axon-pharma`

Note: For local Docker runs, you’ll need to pass secrets via environment or mount a .streamlit/secrets.toml/.env if required.
