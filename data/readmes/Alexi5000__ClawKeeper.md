# ClawKeeper

**Auditable SMB finance-agent control plane.**<br/>
Agents can propose finance work; deterministic policy, tenant boundaries, approval gates, and evidence logs decide what can run.

## Research anchor

In benchmark testing against open-source baselines ([arXiv:2603.24414](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.24414)), the ClawKeeper architecture demonstrated superior mitigation of autonomous LLM agent threats in financial execution contexts. The threat model targets prompt injection, cross-tenant data leakage, and unsanctioned money movement -- failure modes that remain under active research and are not considered solved.

Agent security is continuous, not absolute. The benchmark results reflect a specific test harness against a specific set of baselines at a point in time. New attack vectors against autonomous financial agents emerge regularly. The architecture is designed to reduce the blast radius of agent misbehavior, not to eliminate it.

## v2.0 proof status

ClawKeeper v2.0 is packaged around an inspectable proof spine:

- Backend quality gate: `npm run quality`
- Dashboard production build: `cd dashboard && npm run build`
- Dependency audit: `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`
- FDE benchmark: `npm run fde:benchmark`
- Proof bundle validation: `npm run proof:v2:validate`
- Docker build gate: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

See [`docs/proof/v2.0/README.md`](docs/proof/v2.0/README.md) for the v2 proof bundle and verification commands. The proof bundle is deterministic, offline, synthetic, and redacted.

<br/>

## Agent architecture

ClawKeeper models a finance department as a three-layer agent hierarchy: one CEO orchestrator, nine domain leads, and 100 specialized workers. Every agent inherits from `BaseAgent`, which evaluates the OpenClaw policy engine before task execution. No agent touches a high-risk financial workflow without passing deterministic policy checks in code -- not in prompts.

                    ── APPROVAL GATE ──
     Every high-risk action (payment, writeback, tax filing,
     cross-tenant operation) requires approval metadata before
     the policy engine permits execution. The gate is
     deterministic code in src/openclaw/policy.ts, not an
     LLM judgment call.
```

### Approval gate logic

The policy layer is deliberately deterministic. It does not ask an LLM whether a payment, writeback, or tenant-crossing action is safe.

<br/>

## What ClawKeeper deliberately does NOT do

Naming the failure modes matters more than naming the features.

| Boundary | Why it exists |
|----------|--------------|
| **No autonomous financial execution without human approval** | Payment processing, accounting-system writes, tax filings, and high-risk operations require explicit approval metadata. The policy engine will deny execution if approval is missing -- even if the agent has the technical capability. This is the most important architectural constraint. |
| **No cross-tenant data sharing** | Agents are tenant-scoped. The policy engine denies any request where the agent's tenant context does not match the target resource. RLS enforcement in PostgreSQL provides a second boundary at the data layer. |
| **No LLM-based security decisions** | The policy engine is deterministic TypeScript code, not a prompt. Prompt-injection detection, capability checks, and approval gates are evaluated in `src/openclaw/policy.ts` before any LLM is invoked. This does not make the system injection-proof -- it reduces the attack surface by removing the LLM from the security decision path. |
| **No unredacted audit logging** | PII and secrets are redacted from audit events before database persistence. Audit records use PostgreSQL append-only triggers -- once written, they cannot be modified or deleted through the application layer. |
| **No unbounded LLM spending** | Cost-sensitive LLM client configuration and rate-limit backoff prevent runaway API costs during concurrent multi-agent runs. This mitigates but does not eliminate cost risk in high-volume scenarios. |

<br/>

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alexi5000/ClawKeeper.git
cd ClawKeeper
bun install
cp .env.example .env
```

### Minimum environment variables

```bash
# Required
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://clawkeeper:password@localhost:5432/clawkeeper
JWT_SECRET=<random-string-minimum-32-chars>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>        # or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Optional integrations
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=                 # bank feeds
STRIPE_API_KEY=                  # payment processing
QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_ID=            # accounting sync
XERO_CLIENT_ID=                  # accounting sync
```

### Start services

```bash
bun run setup:full          # schema, RLS, RBAC, seed data
bun run dev                 # Hono API server + agent control plane
bun run dashboard:dev       # React command center
```

### Validate

```bash
npm run quality             # typecheck + lint + test suite
```

## Verify v2 locally

Use the offline proof path when you want a no-database verification run:

```bash
npm ci
npm run quality
cd dashboard && npm install && npm run build
cd ..
npm run fde:benchmark
npm run proof:v2
npm run proof:v2:validate
npm run demo:offline
```

Use the database-backed demo path when Docker is available:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://clawkeeper:clawkeeper_local_password@localhost:5432/clawkeeper
npm run demo:db
docker build -t clawkeeper:v2 .
```

The demo data is synthetic. The v2 proof path does not call Plaid, Stripe, QuickBooks, Xero, or live payment rails.

<br/>

## Usage examples

### Evaluate a policy decision (dry run)

Check whether a proposed agent action would be allowed, approval-gated, or denied -- without executing anything.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4004/api/agents/openclaw/policy/evaluate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "agentId": "payment-processor",
    "capability": "process_payment",
    "tenantId": "tenant_001",
    "amount": 15000,
    "approvalMetadata": null
  }'

# Response: { "decision": "approval_required", "reason": "amount exceeds threshold", ... }
```

### Inspect the OpenClaw manifest

```bash
curl http://localhost:4004/api/agents/openclaw/manifest \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Returns: full agent registry, capabilities, risk tiers, approval rules
```

### Upload and process an invoice

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4004/api/invoices/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@invoice.pdf"

# Triggers: OCR extraction → line-item validation → duplicate check
#           → expense categorization → approval routing
# Failure mode: OCR sum-matching guardrail will reject the invoice
# if line-item totals do not match the stated total.
```

<br/>

## Security posture

Agent security is a continuous practice, not a shipped feature. The ClawKeeper threat model focuses on the attack surfaces specific to autonomous financial agents: prompt injection, cross-tenant leakage, unsanctioned money movement, and audit tampering.

| Guardrail | Implementation | Known limitation |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Tenant isolation** | Policy engine + PostgreSQL RLS | RLS bypass is possible if raw SQL access is granted outside the application layer |
| **Approval gates** | Deterministic policy checks in `src/openclaw/policy.ts` | Approval metadata is trusted once provided -- the approval workflow UI is roadmap v1.6 |
| **Prompt-injection denial** | Pattern-matching guardrails evaluated before LLM invocation | Pattern-based detection does not catch novel injection techniques; this is an active research area |
| **Audit immutability** | PostgreSQL append-only triggers; PII/secret redaction before write | Database-level bypass (direct SQL) can circumvent triggers; mitigated by network access controls |
| **OCR validation** | Programmatic sum-matching of line items vs. stated totals | Adversarial invoices designed to pass sum checks while containing incorrect individual line items are a known gap |
| **Rate-limit resilience** | Exponential backoff retry on 429/transient errors | Backoff caps exist but sustained rate limiting during peak concurrency can degrade agent throughput |

## Testing & quality gates

The test suite validates the parts of the system that matter for a finance-agent release: manifest correctness, policy decisions, approval requirements, tenant isolation, prompt-injection denial, and audit redaction. Dashboard behavior tests are secondary.

```bash
npm run typecheck          # TypeScript strict mode
npm run lint               # ESLint
npm test                   # OpenClaw manifest + policy tests
npm run quality            # all three, sequential
npm run fde:benchmark      # deterministic finance-agent benchmark
npm run proof:v2:validate  # proof bundle validation
```

| Test file | What it validates |
|-----------|------------------|
| `test/openclaw.manifest.test.ts` | App identity, agent registration, high-risk capability policy, runtime adapter health |
| `test/openclaw.policy.test.ts` | Autonomous reporting, approval-required payment flows, tenant isolation denial, missing capability denial, prompt-injection denial, audit redaction |
