## Install

```bash
npm install -g altimate-code
```

Or via curl on macOS/Linux (installs the `altimate` binary to `~/.altimate/bin`):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://www.altimate.sh/install | bash
```

On Windows, install the same self-contained binary (to `%USERPROFILE%\.altimate\bin`) from PowerShell — no Node required:

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://www.altimate.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
```

The standalone install drops a single self-contained binary named `altimate`. The npm install exposes both `altimate` and `altimate-code` on PATH; the standalone install only exposes `altimate`. Alpine Linux (musl) and Windows on ARM64 are not currently supported by the standalone binary — use `apk add gcompat` on Alpine, or use WSL on Windows-on-ARM.

For GitHub, [install the Altimate Code App](https://github.com/apps/altimate-code-agent/installations/new)
to select repositories for interactive agent tasks. Automatic dbt pull-request
reviews use the deterministic GitHub Action documented below; see the
[public demo PRs](https://github.com/AltimateAI/dbt-pr-review-demo/pulls) before
installing it in your own repository.

Then — in order:

**Step 1: Choose an LLM provider** (optional — Altimate Base is used automatically if you skip this):
```bash
altimate        # Launch the TUI
/connect        # Interactive setup — choose Altimate Base, sign in, or bring an API key
```

Altimate Base is the free, no-signup option. It is rate limited, and its requests and responses
are logged and may be used to improve Altimate products and services; do not send secrets or
confidential code. If you don't pick another provider, a fresh install registers it automatically
— no dialog to accept — and prints this notice once. Opt out with `ALTIMATE_BASE_AUTO_REGISTER=0`,
`altimate providers logout altimate-base`, or `disabled_providers` in config.

Or set an environment variable directly:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key   # Anthropic Claude
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key      # OpenAI
```

**Step 2 (optional): Auto-detect your data stack** (read-only, safe for production connections):
```bash
altimate /discover
```

`/discover` auto-detects dbt projects, warehouse connections (from `profiles.yml` — checks `DBT_PROFILES_DIR`, project directory, then `<home>/.dbt/`; plus Docker and environment variables), and installed tools (dbt, sqlfluff, airflow, dagster, and more). Skip this and start building — you can always run it later.

> **Headless / scripted usage:** `altimate --yolo` auto-approves all permission prompts. Not recommended with live warehouse connections.

> **Zero additional setup.** One command install.

## Why a specialized harness?

General AI coding agents can edit SQL files. They cannot *understand* your data stack.
altimate gives any LLM a deterministic data engineering intelligence layer —
no hallucinated SQL advice, no guessing at schema, no missed PII.

| Capability | General coding agents | altimate |
|---|---|---|
| SQL anti-pattern detection | None | 19 rules, confidence-scored |
| Column-level lineage | None | Automatic from SQL, any dialect |
| Schema-aware autocomplete | None | Live-indexed warehouse metadata |
| Cross-dialect SQL translation | None | Snowflake ↔ BigQuery ↔ Databricks ↔ Redshift |
| Cross-dialect data validation | None | Row-by-row diff across 12 warehouses, 5 algorithms |
| FinOps & cost analysis | None | Credits, expensive queries, right-sizing |
| PII detection | None | 30+ regex patterns, 15 categories |
| dbt integration | Basic file editing | Manifest parsing, test gen, model scaffolding, lineage |
| Data visualization | None | Auto-generated charts from SQL results |
| Observability | None | Local-first tracing of AI sessions and tool calls |

> **Benchmarked precision:** 100% F1 on SQL anti-pattern detection (1,077 queries, 19 rules, 0 false positives).
> 100% edge-match on column-level lineage (500 queries, 13 categories).
> [See methodology →](experiments/BENCHMARKS.md)

**What the harness provides:**
- **SQL Intelligence Engine** — deterministic SQL parsing and analysis (not LLM pattern matching). 19 rules, 100% F1, 0 false positives. Built for data engineers who've been burned by hallucinated SQL advice.
- **Column-Level Lineage** — automatic extraction from SQL across dialects. 100% edge-match on 500 benchmark queries.
- **Live Warehouse Intelligence** — indexed schemas, query history, and cost data from your actual warehouse. Not guesses.
- **dbt Native** — manifest parsing, test generation, model scaffolding, medallion patterns, impact analysis
- **FinOps** — credit consumption, expensive query detection, warehouse right-sizing, idle resource cleanup
- **PII Detection** — 15 categories, 30+ regex patterns, enforced pre-execution

**Works seamlessly with Claude Code and Codex.** Use `/configure-claude` or `/configure-codex` to set up integration in one step. altimate is the data engineering tool layer — use it standalone in your terminal, or mount it as the harness underneath whatever AI agent you already run. The two are complementary.

altimate-code is a fork of [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) rebuilt for data teams. Model-agnostic — bring your own LLM or run locally with Ollama.

## Quick demo

```bash
# Auto-detect your data stack (dbt projects, warehouse connections, installed tools)
> /discover

# Analyze a query for anti-patterns and optimization opportunities
> Analyze this query for issues: SELECT * FROM orders JOIN customers ON orders.id = customers.order_id

# Translate SQL across dialects
> /sql-translate this Snowflake query to BigQuery: SELECT DATEADD(day, 7, current_date())

# Generate dbt tests for a model
> /generate-tests for models/staging/stg_orders.sql

# Get a cost report for your Snowflake account
> /cost-report

# Compare a Snowflake table to a BigQuery copy, row-by-row, without moving data
> /data-parity prod.orders (Snowflake) vs. analytics.orders (BigQuery), id key

# Generate dbt 1.8 unit tests for a model with CASE/WHEN and JOINs
> /dbt-unit-tests for models/marts/fct_revenue.sql
```

## Key Features

All features are deterministic — they parse, trace, and measure. Not LLM pattern matching.

### SQL Anti-Pattern Detection
19 rules with confidence scoring — catches SELECT *, cartesian joins, non-sargable predicates, correlated subqueries, and more. **100% accuracy** on 1,077 benchmark queries.

### Column-Level Lineage
Automatic lineage extraction from SQL. Trace any column back through joins, CTEs, and subqueries to its source. Works standalone or with dbt manifests for project-wide lineage. **100% edge match** on 500 benchmark queries.

### FinOps & Cost Analysis
Credit analysis, expensive query detection, warehouse right-sizing, unused resource cleanup, and RBAC auditing.

### Cross-Dialect Translation
Transpile SQL between Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, Redshift, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and DuckDB.

### PII Detection & Safety
Automatic column scanning for PII across 15 categories with 30+ regex patterns. Safety checks and policy enforcement before query execution.

### dbt Native
Manifest parsing, test generation, model scaffolding, incremental model detection, and lineage-aware refactoring. 12 purpose-built skills including medallion patterns, yaml config generation, and dbt docs.

### Data Visualization
Interactive charts and dashboards from SQL results. The data-viz skill generates publication-ready visualizations with automatic chart type selection based on your data.

### Local-First Tracing
Built-in observability for AI interactions — trace tool calls, token usage, and session activity locally. No external services required. View session recordings with `altimate trace`. Features include loop detection, post-session summary, and shareable HTML exports.

### AI Teammate Training
Teach your AI teammate project-specific patterns, naming conventions, and best practices. The training system learns from examples and applies rules automatically across sessions.

### Cross-Dialect Data Parity
Compare tables or query results row-by-row across 12 warehouses with the `/data-parity` skill or `data_diff` tool. Five algorithms — `auto`, `joindiff`, `hashdiff` (any-scale, no data egress), `profile` (column-stats only), and `cascade`. Date / numeric / categorical partitioning so 100M+ row tables diff in independent batches. Auto-discovers comparable columns and excludes audit/timestamp columns by name and catalog default.

### Automated dbt Unit Tests
Generate dbt 1.8+ unit tests from your terminal with `/dbt-unit-tests` or the `dbt_unit_test_gen` tool. Detects testable SQL constructs (CASE/WHEN, JOINs, NULLs, window functions, division, incremental models) and assembles complete YAML with type-correct mock data across 7 dialects.

### GitLab MR Review
Review merge requests directly from your terminal with `altimate gitlab review <MR_URL>`. Self-hosted GitLab instances and nested group paths supported. Comment deduplication updates an existing review instead of posting duplicates. Companion to the existing GitHub PR review flow.

## Agent Modes

Each mode has scoped permissions, tool access, and SQL write-access control.

| Mode | Role | Access |
|---|---|---|
| **Builder** | Create dbt models, SQL pipelines, and data transformations | Full read/write (write SQL prompts for approval; `DROP DATABASE`/`DROP SCHEMA`/`TRUNCATE` hard-blocked) |
| **Analyst** | Explore data, run SELECT queries, FinOps analysis, and generate insights | Read-only enforced (SELECT only, no file writes) |
| **Plan** | Outline an approach before acting | Minimal (read files only, no SQL or bash) |

> **New to altimate?** Start with **Analyst mode** — it's read-only and safe to run against production connections. Need specialized workflows (validation, migration, research)? Create [custom agent modes](https://help.altimate.ai/code).
