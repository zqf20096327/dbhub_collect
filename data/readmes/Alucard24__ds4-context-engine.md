DS4 Context Engine is a non-destructive, provider-independent context management layer for [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). It keeps Pi's native JSONL session as the canonical history and builds a smaller, inspectable, model-aware working context for each model call.

> **Project status:** The coordinated `0.4.0` release adds `storage.scope: "agent" | "project"`, now defaulting to per-project SQLite projections with shared token calibration in the agent database (opt out with `storage.scope: "agent"`). The opt-in BPE estimation and bounded auto-tuning from `0.3.10` keep `chars-v1` and disabled auto-tuning as their defaults. The bounded compaction controls from `0.3.9` remain in place; canonical history, SQLite schema 16 and runtime contracts are unchanged. Pi remains pinned to `0.84.3`. Patch `0.4.1` states the contiguous-span rule for compaction summaries in the summarizer prompt while leaving validation strictness, the eight-bullet repair bound and every provider-facing default unchanged. Patch `0.4.2` adds class-only diagnostics for rejected exact-value spans: the existing `custom_fallback` warning carries `unsupportedSpanClasses` as class names and counters, never span text, with validation, repair bounds and provider-facing defaults unchanged. Patch `0.4.3` makes those diagnostics interpretable: every distinct span receives the cheap transformed-form lookups before the bounded near-miss analysis starts, each near-miss candidate may spend only an equal share of what remains, and spans that were not analysed report `not-classified-length`, `not-classified-partial` or `not-classified-budget` instead of `no-near-miss`. Patch `0.4.4` accepts a backticked exact value whose canonical JSON-escaped rendering is literally present in the evidence — the decoded rendering a summarizer produces when it quotes serialized JSON — while absent values, the reverse escape direction, span composition and single-character variants stay rejected; the diagnostics probe budget rises from 4000 to 24000 evidence-source scans. Patch `0.4.5` grades the summarizer quoting fallback: the prompt requires one contiguous excerpt per backticked span, tells the model to backtick only the fragments that are themselves contiguous or to keep the fact as ordinary text without backticks instead of composing a span, and reserves bullet omission for facts with no support in the evidence; diagnostics split composition into `composed-adjacent-present` (both parts next to each other in one source, so the span may be a re-rendering of a contiguous region) and `composed-two-present-parts` (parts found at unrelated positions), with validation strictness, the eight-bullet and 25% repair bounds and every provider-facing default unchanged. Patch `0.4.6` makes an engine/core artifact mismatch visible instead of a missing function: the core exports `CORE_VERSION` and the engine verifies at session start and at every compaction attempt that the loaded core matches its own version and exposes the entry points it calls, so a core rebuilt under a running Pi — which a `/reload` does not pick up — reports one actionable line, keeps the DS4 compaction layer inert instead of failing mid-generation, and never blocks Pi; validation strictness, repair bounds and every provider-facing default stay unchanged. Patch `0.4.7` stops the recurrent fail-closed fallback at its source: when the summarizer re-renders a value the evidence holds in another form — JSON-escaped or unescaped, collapsed whitespace, stripped typographic characters, or two parts adjacent in one source — the repair retracts only the backticks and keeps the fact, so those spans no longer consume the eight-bullet bound; invented values, unrelated compositions, one-character deviations, case changes and unanalysed spans keep the existing fail-closed bullet removal, validation strictness is unchanged, and both effects are recorded as counters (`unsupported-exact-bullets-pruned`, `unsupported-exact-spans-unquoted`). Patch `0.4.8` ends the recurrent exact-value fallback at its root: an unsupported backticked value no longer costs its bullet or the whole compaction — the repair retracts the quoting of every rejected span, keeps the text as prose and re-validates, so exact-value failures cannot end a compaction while every surviving backticked value is still verified literally or as its canonical JSON-escaped rendering; the eight-bullet and 25% removal bounds no longer apply to this path, structural, transport and budget failures still fall back to Pi, and the class report remains class-only diagnostics. See the [0.4.8 release record](docs/releases/0.4.8.md), the [0.4.7 release record](docs/releases/0.4.7.md), the [0.4.6 release record](docs/releases/0.4.6.md), the [0.4.5 release record](docs/releases/0.4.5.md), the [0.4.4 release record](docs/releases/0.4.4.md), the [0.4.3 release record](docs/releases/0.4.3.md), the [0.4.2 release record](docs/releases/0.4.2.md), the [0.4.1 release record](docs/releases/0.4.1.md) and the [0.4.0 release record](docs/releases/0.4.0.md), [ADR 069](docs/ADR/069-retract-quoting-of-every-unsupported-exact-value.md), [ADR 068](docs/ADR/068-downgrade-rendering-equivalent-spans.md), [ADR 067](docs/ADR/067-core-version-guard.md), [ADR 066](docs/ADR/066-quoting-downgrade-and-span-adjacency.md), [ADR 065](docs/ADR/065-exact-value-escaped-equivalence.md), [ADR 064](docs/ADR/064-per-project-databases-with-shared-calibration.md) and [model-awareness validation](docs/MODEL_AWARENESS.md).

**Current compaction defaults:** `compaction.directUpdate=true`, `compaction.inputBudget="context"`, `compaction.segmentTargetTokens=30000`, `compaction.maxRequestInputTokens=64000`, `compaction.maxOperationInputTokens=2000000`, `compaction.maxConcurrentSegments=2`. Every DS4 provider attempt is bounded by the effective request limit, and the operation limit includes retries; `inputBudget="summary"` remains an explicit throughput-oriented opt-in. Existing compaction/master switches still apply. See [latency controls and compatibility](docs/COMPACTION.md#latency-controls). No real-provider speedup is claimed from mock tests. The five optional editing/reading/artifact/job features introduced in `0.3.4` remain default-off.

## Why DS4

Long coding sessions accumulate old decisions, repeated context, large tool outputs and project state faster than any model context window can hold them. DS4 separates durable history from the model's current working set.

It provides:

- deterministic token budgeting with soft and hard input limits;
- preservation of the current request, recent turns and atomic tool call/result groups;
- exact and FTS5 historical retrieval with source provenance;
- opt-in hybrid semantic retrieval with a deterministic local embedding and lexical fallback;
- trust-gated structural project indexing, Git-aware invalidation and bounded source snippets;
- hierarchical, validated, non-destructive compaction summaries with overflow-safe multi-request fan-out/fan-in;
- persistent pins and append-only durable memory stored canonically in Pi JSONL;
- a bounded, metadata-only `context_persistence` tool with local confirmation for every model-callable write;
- opt-in checkpointed project-memory replay across exact trusted Pi project sessions;
- content-addressed storage and bounded references for large tool results;
- privacy classifications, secret redaction and provider-specific allow rules;
- model-specific calibration and adaptive context allocation;
- optional verified continuation for eligible OpenAI Responses profiles;
- opt-in metadata-only context-quality metrics and deterministic replay comparisons;
- checksummed metadata-only learned ranking with shadow mode, canonical classified feedback and static fallback;
- a versioned runtime adapter contract, reusable conformance kit and non-Pi callback/JSONL reference adapter;
- opt-in exact-prefix local KV reuse for capable local runtime adapters, with volatile handles and full-replay fallback;
- an inspectable Context Manifest explaining included and excluded material;
- fail-open recovery to Pi's native context path for operational failures.

## Architectural guarantees

1. **Pi JSONL remains canonical.** DS4 never replaces Pi's session format.
2. **SQLite is disposable.** It contains derived projections and can be rebuilt from canonical sources.
3. **Compaction is non-destructive.** Raw history is not deleted or rewritten.
4. **Provenance is preserved.** Retrieved and summarized context identifies its source.
5. **Tool groups remain atomic.** Tool calls are not separated from their results.
6. **Provider state is optional.** Continuation handles and cache state are never canonical.
7. **Operational failures fail open.** Pi can continue with its native context behavior.
8. **Enabled privacy enforcement fails closed.** Restricted content is replaced or the provider payload is rejected instead of being leaked.

## Requirements

- [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) `0.84.3`
- Node.js `22.19.0` or newer
- SQLite support provided by Node's built-in `node:sqlite`

Pi is intentionally pinned until extension contract tests validate a newer release.

## Installation

Pi packages execute with the user's full permissions. Review and trust the source before installing this or any other extension.

### From GitHub

```bash
pi install git:github.com/Alucard24/ds4-context-engine
```

To try it for one run without adding it to settings:

```bash
pi -e git:github.com/Alucard24/ds4-context-engine
```

### From npm

Install the latest stable public npm package with:

```bash
pi install npm:ds4-context-engine
```

The three packages (`ds4-context-engine`, `ds4-context-core`, and `ds4-context-reference-adapter`) are released together with the same exact version. Both adapters require the matching core version. See [0.3.5](docs/releases/0.3.5.md) for this release's changes and compatibility.

To dogfood the beta without replacing a global stable installation, pin the exact version in a disposable project:

```bash
pi install -l npm:ds4-context-engine@0.3.0-beta.3
```

Follow the [0.3 beta dogfooding runbook](docs/DOGFOODING_0.3.0_BETA.md); use synthetic data and a dedicated session directory.

### Local checkout

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alucard24/ds4-context-engine.git
cd ds4-context-engine
npm ci
npm run check
pi install -l .
```

For extension development without installing the package:

```bash
pi -e ./src/extension/index.ts
```

Restart Pi or run `/reload` after installing or changing the extension.

## Quick start

DS4 starts in managed mode with conservative defaults. No configuration file is required.

After loading the extension, inspect its state:

```text
/context status
/context adapter
/context tokens
/context health
```

Global configuration is loaded from:

```text
~/.pi/agent/ds4-context.json
```

A trusted project can override it with:

```text
.pi/ds4-context.json
```

Use observer mode as a pass-through rollback while retaining diagnostics:

```json
{
  "context": {
    "mode": "observer"
  }
}
```

Disable the extension's behavior without uninstalling it:

```json
{
  "enabled": false
}
```

Project configuration and project source indexing are disabled when Pi reports the project as untrusted.

### Pins and durable memory

```text
/context pins
/context pin [--scope session|branch|project] [--classification LEVEL] <content>
/context unpin PIN_ID [reason]

/context memory
/context memory list
/context memory add [--scope session|project] [--key KEY] [--classification LEVEL] <claim>
/context memory supersede MEMORY_ID [--source ID,ID] <new claim>
/context memory invalidate MEMORY_ID [reason]
/context memory expire MEMORY_ID [reason]
/context memory sources
/context memory exclude SESSION_ID [reason]
/context memory include SESSION_ID
```

Valid privacy classifications are `normal`, `internal`, `sensitive` and `local-only`.

### LLM-callable tools

DS4 registers two model-callable tools by default:

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `context_artifact_search` | Search a known DS4 artifact reference with bounded quoted excerpts |
| `context_persistence` | Inspect Pins, Memory, and project-memory sources; perform explicitly requested persistence mutations |

`context_persistence` read actions return bounded metadata and sanitized find previews. Every write requires a fresh local `ctx.ui.confirm()` decision. In print/JSON or any other no-UI mode, reads remain available and writes fail closed with `confirmation-required`. Sessions without a persistent Pi JSONL destination (for example `--no-session`) fail closed with `runtime-unavailable` before confirmation. Destructive writes require an exact ID or volatile source reference plus the `targetRevision` returned by a prior read; fuzzy writes are not supported.

Canonical Pin and Memory changes append Pi custom entries and reconcile disposable SQLite projections. Project-memory source include/exclude is derived local SQLite policy and never appends a fake canonical entry. See [`docs/CONTEXT_PERSISTENCE_TOOL.md`](docs/CONTEXT_PERSISTENCE_TOOL.md).

**Optional anchored editing:** `/context config set editing.anchored true`, then
`/reload`, enables a same-name `edit` wrapper. Use `head[upto]tail` in `oldText` to
replace an inclusive range without repeating its intermediate old content. Exact
anchors are validated inside Pi's native mutation queue; ordinary calls and diff
feedback remain native. All edits in a batch containing anchors must match exactly.
Use per-edit `literal: true` for real marker text.
Disabled by default; no inference-time forcer or provider change is involved.
See [`docs/ANCHORED_EDITING.md`](docs/ANCHORED_EDITING.md) for semantics and limits.

**Other optional agent tools:** `editing.postEditReport` adds bounded old/new line
ranges and updated context; `reading.adaptive` chooses model-window-aware default
read limits; `artifacts.adaptiveBudget` lowers inline/excerpt caps under context
pressure; `jobs.enabled` exposes confirmed, session-owned local `bash_job`
start/status/stop/list operations. All default off and require session reload after
configuration changes. Jobs are a separate module, not a replacement for `bash`.
See [`docs/PORTABLE_AGENT_TOOLS.md`](docs/PORTABLE_AGENT_TOOLS.md) for activation,
limits, privacy and lifecycle behavior.

Learned-ranking feedback and local training are explicit:

```text
/context ranking feedback useful|irrelevant CANDIDATE_ID [--classification LEVEL]
/context ranking train
```

See [`docs/LEARNED_RANKING.md`](docs/LEARNED_RANKING.md).

```

Invalid or unknown values are ignored with a warning. Model overrides merge deterministically from `*` to `provider/*` to an exact `provider/model` profile. Routine session open/close, database, rebuild, and project-index summaries are emitted only at `debug`, so the default `info` level keeps session changes quiet while preserving actionable warnings. The 0.2 release line freezes this additive surface as `ds4-context-config-v1`; existing keys, validation, and defaults are pinned by the compatibility golden.

## Privacy and provider storage

Privacy enforcement is disabled by default and must be configured for the providers you use. Unknown providers are treated as remote unless explicitly listed as local. `local-only` content is never permitted by a remote allow rule.

Native continuation is also disabled by default. Enabling it requires both explicit storage consent and an exact or provider-scoped profile:

```json
{
  "nativeContinuation": {
    "enabled": true,
    "allowProviderStorage": true,
    "profiles": ["openai/*"]
  }
}
```

Eligible OpenAI Responses requests then set `store: true`. Review the provider's retention policy before enabling this option. DS4 keeps response handles only in volatile memory, verifies exact managed prefixes before reuse and retries once with a full managed replay when recognized continuation state is stale.

Local KV reuse is separately disabled by default through `localKvReuse.enabled`. It also requires a local runtime adapter with a versioned `local-kv-reuse` capability and a volatile runtime port. Pi exposes no such handles and remains unsupported even if configuration is enabled.

See [`docs/PRIVACY.md`](docs/PRIVACY.md), [`docs/NATIVE_CONTINUATION.md`](docs/NATIVE_CONTINUATION.md), and [`docs/LOCAL_KV_REUSE.md`](docs/LOCAL_KV_REUSE.md).

## Storage and recovery

By default, derived state is stored below Pi's agent directory:

```text
~/.pi/agent/ds4-context/
├── context.db
├── ranking-model.json
└── artifacts/
```

The database contains rebuildable indexes, summary metadata, manifests, project projections and calibration data. The optional checksummed learned-ranking model is also derived local state; its classified metadata-only labels remain canonical Pi custom entries. All Pi sessions share this WAL database: writes use bounded busy-aware transaction replay, and a renewable project lease prevents multiple Pi processes from indexing the same project concurrently. `busyTimeoutMs` controls each SQLite lock wait, while `writeRetryTimeoutMs` bounds the total replay window. Exhausted lock retries identify only the coordinator operation and categorical SQLite metadata. Diagnostic storage keeps the latest 128 manifests globally and 200 calibration samples per exact profile. Online manifest pruning is bounded to 32 rows and 8 MiB per related write. Manifests above the 256 KiB preferred bound retain complete included provenance and use an explicit deterministic excluded-only rollup; projected payloads above 1 MiB are skipped. Current readers label rollups explicitly; earlier schema-15 readers may parse them but mislabel sampled excluded details, so that historical rendering is not downgrade-supported after rollups are written. Provider usage updates existing scalar columns without rewriting the JSON payload. Canonical memory and pin mutations remain append-only entries in Pi JSONL. Project files remain canonical for project knowledge. Complete tool results remain in Pi JSONL while the artifact store keeps verified, content-addressed copies for bounded retrieval.

To inspect, validate, or rebuild derived state:

```text
/context health
/context storage
/context rebuild-index
```

Physical size recovery is deliberately offline and interactive:

```text
ds4-context-storage inspect --database <exact-path>
ds4-context-storage compact --database <exact-path>
ds4-context-storage recover --database <exact-path>
```

Close every Pi process before `compact` or `recover`. New runtimes create cooperative client leases and refuse to open SQLite while the maintenance lock exists; the CLI also refuses active or ambiguous clients, validates a standalone backup and candidate, and keeps one fixed pre-compaction backup. See [`docs/STORAGE_MAINTENANCE.md`](docs/STORAGE_MAINTENANCE.md). Deleting DS4's database must not alter a Pi session or project, although derived indexes and calibration data will be regenerated. When `memory.crossSession` is enabled for a trusted project, DS4 discovers bounded sibling Pi JSONL files by exact canonical header identity, incrementally replays their explicit project mutations, and excludes missing or unverifiable sources.

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm run build:core
npm run build:adapters
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run check
npm run quality:compare
npm run schema:context-persistence
npm run latency:check -- /path/to/exact/ds4-context-core@0.1.2
npm run pack:check
# Post-publication, with an exact version rather than a dist-tag:
npm run registry:check -- 0.3.0-beta.2
npm pack --dry-run
npm pack --dry-run --workspace ds4-context-core
npm pack --dry-run --workspace ds4-context-reference-adapter
```

The test suite covers configuration, migrations, canonical JSONL projection, planning, atomic tool groups, retrieval, compaction, project knowledge, artifacts, memory, privacy, model awareness, continuation, local-KV eligibility/replay, runtime-adapter conformance, the portable-core dependency boundary and Pi extension lifecycle behavior. The latency comparison times 50 planner calls per sample to reduce sub-millisecond timer and scheduler noise while preserving the 1.10 p95 rejection threshold. The package check builds all three tarballs, installs them in a clean temporary consumer, reruns compiled reference-adapter conformance and starts the packaged Pi extension with isolated RPC state.

### Portable core

`ds4-context-core` is a compiled ESM package with no runtime SDK dependency. It owns runtime-neutral policy, storage, adapter contracts and projections; agent adapters translate native sessions and lifecycle hooks at the boundary. The root `ds4-context-engine` package is the Pi adapter. `ds4-context-reference-adapter` is a separately compiled non-Pi callback/JSONL implementation. Both depend one-way and exactly on matching core.

## Roadmap

The original M0–M13 roadmap is complete. `ds4-context-core` contains the compiled runtime-neutral implementation. M14 context-quality metrics, M15 rich symbol indexing, M16 hybrid semantic retrieval, M17 cross-session project memory, M18 learned-ranking shadow evaluation, M19's runtime adapter/conformance kit, and M20 opt-in local KV eligibility/replay are implemented on `main`. Learned active ranking remains promotion-gated, Pi reports local KV as unsupported, and static ranking/native completion stay authoritative on every failure.

The [0.2.0 roadmap](docs/ROADMAP_0.2.0.md) is complete. The stable 0.3 line carries forward the [context persistence tool](docs/CONTEXT_PERSISTENCE_TOOL.md), privacy-safe [compaction](docs/COMPACTION.md), bounded persisted manifests, cooperative client leases and recoverable offline maintenance. Version 0.4.0 introduces `storage.scope` (`"agent" | "project"`, default `"project"`): one rebuildable SQLite projection per trusted canonical project root, with token calibration shared in the agent database; `storage.scope: "agent"` restores the previous single-file layout. Version 0.4.1 states the contiguous-span rule for compaction summaries in the summarizer prompt without changing deterministic validation or the repair bounds. Version 0.4.2 adds class-only diagnostics to the same fail-closed path: the `custom_fallback` warning reports `unsupportedSpanClasses` as class names and counters only, never span text, without changing validation strictness, repair bounds or defaults. Version 0.3.10 adds opt-in BPE estimation and bounded model-budget auto-tuning while retaining the `chars-v1` default. Version 0.3.9 extends the bounded compaction updates, summary input headroom, concurrent segments and phase timings introduced in 0.3.5 with per-request and cumulative operation input limits; 0.3.8 adds indexed FTS key deletion without changing search results. The opt-in [anchored editing](docs/ANCHORED_EDITING.md) and [portable agent tools](docs/PORTABLE_AGENT_TOOLS.md) from 0.3.4 remain default-off, without backend rewind, forced sampling or operational KV integration. Confirmation, provenance, Pi fallback and canonical/configuration/SQLite/runtime contracts remain unchanged. The [0.2 readiness record](docs/RELEASE_READINESS_0.2.0.md) remains the compatibility baseline; the lexical planner stays available as the deterministic fallback.

## Contributing

Issues and focused pull requests are welcome. Before submitting a change:

1. preserve Pi JSONL as canonical history;
2. keep SQLite and artifacts rebuildable;
3. preserve provenance and atomic tool groups;
4. retain strict compaction validation and safe fallback behavior;
5. add or update tests;
6. run `npm run check`, `npm run pack:check` and `git diff --check`.

Please include reproduction steps for bugs and avoid attaching real session files, credentials or private provider payloads.
