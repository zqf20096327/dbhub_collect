# Semantic Video Search Engine

> High-performance semantic search across videos using natural language.
> Powered by **Google SigLIP**, **ONNX Runtime**, and **Qdrant**.  optimized for CPU execution.

---

## Overview

This project is a resource efficient video search engine that enables users to search video content using natural language queries such as:

* *"A cat playing with red ball in swimming pool"*
* *"A young girl cooking pasta"*
* *"A man in black Suit walking on road"*


The system extracts semantic embeddings from video frames using **SigLIP**, stores them in **Qdrant**, and retrieves matching timestamps in milliseconds.

Designed for low resource environments, the entire pipeline runs efficiently on commodity CPUs with **zero GPU dependency** while maintaining high ingestion throughput.

# Architectural Pillars

## 1. Asynchronous Bounded Pipeline

A concurrent producer-consumer architecture decouples:

* frame decoding (FFmpeg / CPU)
* embedding generation (ONNX inference)

A bounded queue (`64 frames`) ensures:

* low memory overhead
* stable throughput
* controlled backpressure

---

## 2. Single-Pass Smart Frame Extraction

Frames are decoded exactly once using FFmpeg.

Scene change filtering:

```bash
select='gt(scene,0.12)'
```

eliminates redundant frames before inference, resulting in:

* significantly lower compute usage
* improved semantic diversity
* ~6–8× higher throughput compared to uniform frame sampling

---

## 3. Split ONNX Inference + INT8 Quantization

The SigLIP model is:

* quantized to INT8
* split into dedicated vision and text encoders

### Vision Encoder

Used only during ingestion.

### Text Encoder (~26 MB)

Loaded only during search requests.

### Result

* ~50% faster execution
* reduced memory usage
* lower startup overhead

---

## 4. Memory-Mapped Vector Storage

Qdrant stores FP32 vectors using memory-mapped storage (MMAP), while keeping only the quantized INT8 index in RAM.

Benefits:

* minimal RAM usage
* scalable indexing
* high recall retention
