**TL;DR:** Nekyia searches local histories from several agent CLIs and helps you resume the
right session. It indexes transcript metadata in SQLite, ranks matches with full-text search,
and either launches a verified session or builds a deterministic handover for a fresh one.

It can also show which files a session touched, in what order, and whether git currently tracks
them. Everything stays local, with no model-written summaries or tool-output indexing.

---

## Features

- **One Search Surface**: query Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot CLI, opencode, Kilo Code, Codebuff, Freebuff, goose, and Antigravity histories together
- **Verified Resume**: attach to the selected session by ID only where that exact command was tested
- **Deterministic Handovers**: start search-tier clients with every indexed user prompt, each message kept whole and in order, touched files, branch context, bounded assistant prose, and a note of whatever had to be left out
- **Two-Phase Indexing**: discover cheap fingerprints first, then hydrate only sessions that changed
- **Fast Local Search**: SQLite FTS5 combines weighted prompt relevance with recency decay
- **Exact File History**: ask which sessions touched one file, resolved against each session's own directory
- **Directory Timelines**: see every file operation recorded under a directory, grouped by session, with each path marked against what git already has
- **Interactive and Scriptable**: use the virtualized Ink picker or plain, JSON-capable CLI commands
- **Privacy Controls**: forget one session, prune deleted sources, or exclude a directory and everything under it
- **Extensible Manifests**: describe another client locally and use the conservative sniffer to scaffold a draft
- **Local by Design**: no network service, API key, telemetry, model-written summary, or tool-output indexing

## Installation

Nekyia requires [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.1 or newer. It runs on Bun, not on Node, and the
command says so plainly if Bun is missing rather than failing on an import.

### From npm

```bash
bun install -g nekyia
```

### From a release

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->
```bash
bun install -g github:AraneaDev/Nekyia#v1.2.0
```
<!-- x-release-please-end -->

Every published version is listed on the
[releases page](https://github.com/AraneaDev/Nekyia/releases).

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AraneaDev/Nekyia.git
cd Nekyia
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun link
```

All three install paths expose `nekyia` and the shorter `nek`, which do the same thing. The
examples below use `nek`.

## Quick start

### 1. Build the local index

```bash
nek index
```

The first run shows what Nekyia plans to inspect and asks for consent before it
opens a transcript store or creates the index. Use `nek index --yes` only when
you have already reviewed that boundary and need a non-interactive run.

### 2. Find a session

```bash
nek                         # interactive picker
nek search reconnect race   # table output
nek search reconnect --json # machine-readable output
nek blame src/sse.ts        # recent sessions that touched this file
nek last                    # newest session under this directory
```

Search defaults to the current directory. Pass `--all` to search everywhere,
`--client <id>` for one client, or `--file <path>` for sessions that touched a file.
`nek blame <path>` resolves the path from the current directory, then searches
globally and newest-first for that exact normalized file. "Touched" means the path
appeared in indexed tool input; it does not prove that the session modified the file.
`--json` returns a versioned agent contract with `sourcePaths`, launch capability,
quality state, and explicit limitation codes, so an agent can decide whether to
trust the indexed summary or inspect the source itself.

`nek timeline` covers a directory rather than one file. Ordering inside a session is
exact; between sessions it is by end time, which the index knows coarsely, so events stay
grouped by session rather than merged into one stream. A session whose own directory sits
elsewhere and which named these files relatively is not found, the same limit `blame` has.

```
$ nek timeline --dir . --since 7d --limit 2

/home/dev/work/api-gateway · 2 sessions · 12 events · git was not consulted

      3  edit    src/gateway/logging.ts
```

The number beside each operation is the turn it happened on, so it points back into the
session's own history. Where the directory is a git repository, each path git does not
track is marked `untracked`; you should inspect both tracked and untracked
paths when recovering session changes, because tracking only means git knows the path,
not that it has your latest edits. The header says outright when git could not be asked,
as it does above, since a missing marker would otherwise read as "git tracks this".

File operations are recorded from the next hydration onward, so sessions already in the
index list their files without any operations until you run `nek index --rebuild`. A
plain `nek index` will not fill them in: it hydrates only sessions whose transcript
changed, and an old session's transcript has not. Timeline output says which sessions are
in that state rather than showing them as though nothing happened.

The picker opens on the project you are standing in. Started from your home
directory, from a filesystem root, or from somewhere nothing has been indexed under,
it opens on the whole index instead, because a scoped list there would be empty.
`tab` widens to every directory, and pressing it again narrows to the project of the
row under the cursor, so you can start anywhere and end up in one project. The count
beside the search line always names what is being searched.

![The Nekyia picker: a list of sessions from several agent CLIs, and beneath it the selected session's directory, branch, prompts and touched files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AraneaDev/Nekyia/main/docs/media/picker.svg)

Typing filters as you go, and the matching span is lit in every title, so the list
answers each keystroke rather than only shortening.

![Searching: the query is lit inside each matching title, and the row under the cursor is marked in the gutter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AraneaDev/Nekyia/main/docs/media/search.svg)

Narrowing to one project names it, so you always know what is being searched:

![The picker narrowed to a single project, named beside the session count](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AraneaDev/Nekyia/main/docs/media/scoped.svg)

A query that matches nothing says what to try rather than leaving an empty screen:

![A search that matched nothing, reading "Nothing came up. Try fewer words."](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AraneaDev/Nekyia/main/docs/media/empty.svg)

### 3. Read the history before you commit to it

`ctrl+o` opens the session under the cursor and gives it the screen: what you asked
and what came back, in the order it was said, and which files moved. A long reply
wraps rather than running off the right edge. Arrow keys scroll a line, the page keys
scroll a screen, and `esc` closes it again.

![Reading a session's history: the pane fills the screen with the conversation in the order it happened, scrolled past the header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AraneaDev/Nekyia/main/docs/media/inspect.svg)

### 4. Resume or hand over

Press Enter in the picker, or run `nek last`. A resume-tier row launches the
verified exact-session command. A search-tier row asks for confirmation, builds a
deterministic handover, and starts a new client session with that context.

## Keys in the picker

| Key | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| type | Filter as you go; the match is lit in each title |
| `up` / `down` | Move the cursor, or scroll the history while it is open |
| `enter` | Resume the session, or start a briefed one once you confirm it; on a row for a store two clients share, the first Enter asks which client instead, when both are installed |
| `ctrl+o` | Open the session's history, and close it again |
| `ctrl+t` | Choose another client and confirm a fresh session with this session's context (`r` for a review framing, `n` for a custom note) |
| `ctrl+l` | Choose which client opens a store that Codebuff and Freebuff share |
| `tab` | Widen to everywhere, or narrow to the project under the cursor |
| `ctrl+f` | Cycle the clients your index actually holds |
| `ctrl+p` / `ctrl+y` | Copy the opening prompt, or the command that would run |
| `ctrl+r` | Reindex now; offered once the index has gone stale |
| `esc` | Back out of a confirmation, or close the history, or quit |

The status line always names the index's age, colored green, yellow, or red as it
goes from fresh to stale to very stale. `ctrl+r` appears in the key hints, and works,
only once it has gone stale: it exits the picker, reindexes on the normal screen where
its progress can print, and reopens the picker on the result. Set `autoReindexAfterHours`
in the config file to have this happen on its own once the index crosses that age;
`0` reindexes on every open.

The picker lays itself out against the terminal it is drawn in, so a narrow window
gets the same interface rather than a broken one:

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `nek` | Open the interactive picker |
| `nek search <query>` | Search from the terminal, with optional JSON or id-only output |
| `nek blame <path>` | List recent sessions that touched this exact file |
| `nek timeline [--dir <path>]` | What happened to files in a directory, in the order it happened |
| `nek last` | Launch the newest visible session in this directory |
| `nek index [--rebuild]` | Refresh fingerprints and changed session content |
| `nek show <uid>` | Print a deterministic handover as Markdown |
| `nek handoff <uid> --to <client>` | Start a fresh target client with the source session's indexed context |
| `nek doctor [--sniff]` | Report clients, paths, size caps, unreadable transcripts, and unsupported stores |
| `nek forget <uid>` | Remove one session and every searchable facet from the index |
| `nek prune --missing` | Remove indexed sessions whose sources disappeared |
| `nek exclude <glob>` | Add an index-time directory exclusion |

`--ids` prints only the session ids, one per line, so a session you picked out by eye
can be handed straight to another command:

```bash
nek search "sse reconnect" --ids | head -1 | xargs nek show
```

Run `nek --help` for search filters, sort modes, limits, and command-specific options.

To continue work in another client:

```bash
nek handoff claude:<session-id> --to codex
nek handoff claude:<session-id> --to codex --dry-run
nek handoff claude:<session-id> --to codex --dry-run --json
nek handoff claude:<session-id> --to codex --intent review
nek handoff claude:<session-id> --to codex --note "focus on the retry logic"
```

Agents can export structured indexed context without parsing Markdown:

```bash
nek show claude:<session-id> --json --max-chars 12000
```

See [agent integration notes](docs/agent-integration.md) for the versioned JSON contract,
quality signals, bounded errors, and privacy boundary.

Handoff starts a fresh session using the target's brief command and the source's
recorded directory (unless a custom manifest overrides it). It uses the last indexed
context; run `nek index` first if the source conversation has changed. It transfers
no native conversation state, tool state, or file snapshots, and does not restore a
historical branch. Treat the brief as historical context: current instructions and
the current repository take precedence. Same-client handoff is also allowed.

`--max-chars <n>` follows `show`'s character budget (default 40,000). User prompts are
preserved even when the budget is zero or too small. Launching refuses a brief whose
command or argument text alone would exceed a conservative 128 KiB allowance,
measured in UTF-8 bytes; it never truncates prompts to make them fit. If this happens,
export with `nek show <uid>` and transfer the relevant context manually.

By default the target is told this is a handover to continue, the same framing
`show` produces on its own. `--intent review` asks the target to critique the
session's changes instead of extending them: look for bugs, missed edge cases, and
better approaches. `--note <text>` replaces that framing with your own instruction
(up to 2,000 characters) and cannot be combined with `--intent`. Either framing is
prepended to the brief and, like the rest of the mandatory header, is never dropped
to fit the character budget. The `ctrl+t` picker offers the same choice interactively:
`r` for review, `n` to type a note, plain `enter` to continue as before.

`--dry-run` prints the planned shell command without checking whether the target is
installed. `--dry-run --json` prints `{ cmd, args, cwd, briefChars }`; `--json` requires
`--dry-run`. Both outputs include the brief in the arguments and are content exports,
which may contain private information or secrets retained in user prompts. Execution
also passes the brief through process arguments, visible where OS permissions permit.
The target client may send this context to its configured model provider and incur
token costs. Repeated handoffs can retain earlier briefs inside later prompts.

## Supported clients

Support means the store format was exercised against real or fidelity-matched local
data, not guessed from a likely path. Resume means the selected ID can be passed to a
verified resume command. Search means Nekyia starts a fresh briefed session because
exact attachment was not confirmed.

| Client | Tier | Command Nekyia runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Resume | `claude --resume <id>` |
| Codex | Resume | `codex resume <id>` |
| Antigravity CLI, agy | Resume | `agy --conversation <id>` |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | Resume | `copilot --resume=<id>` |
| Cursor | Resume | `cursor-agent --resume <id>` |
| opencode | Search | `opencode --prompt <brief>` |
| Kilo Code | Search | `kilo --prompt <brief>` |
| Codebuff / Freebuff | Freebuff: Resume, Codebuff: Search | `freebuff --continue <id> --cwd <cwd>` or `codebuff --cwd <cwd> <brief>` |
| goose | Search | `goose run -t <brief> -s` |

Cursor and Freebuff were both verified against a real install: `cursor-agent --resume <id>`
and `freebuff --continue <id> --cwd <cwd>` each reopened the session they were given.
Freebuff and Codebuff share one store and nothing in it records which of the two wrote a
chat, so Nekyia lists each chat once and lets you choose the client that opens the store.
With one of them installed it uses that one. With both, the first Enter on one of their
chats asks, and ctrl+l flips the choice afterwards. Freebuff takes no prompt argument, so
it cannot receive a handover; Codebuff can.

The goose adapter was written from goose's published source and CLI reference rather
than from a local install, so it is derived rather than observed. Its documented resume
flag, `goose session --resume --session-id <id>`, is deliberately not wired up: this
project claims the resume tier only where attachment was verified against a real client.

Kilo shares opencode's tested store format, but its executable was not installed during
command verification. opencode and Codebuff were exercised against real local IDs, but
the result did not prove attachment to the requested context. I do not call any of those
three resumable. Search-tier clients always start fresh briefed sessions. They never claim
to recover tool state or file snapshots, and sending a handover can cost tokens.

## How it works

Nekyia separates indexing into two phases. Discovery reads bounded metadata and stable
fingerprints. Hydration runs only for new or changed sessions, streams or projects the
relevant content, and commits metadata plus search facets atomically to SQLite.

Search weights titles, user prompts, and selected assistant prose differently, then can
blend relevance with recency. Fork chains collapse to one visible result. Tool output is
excluded because command results and file dumps are noisy, large, and likely to contain
private material that does not belong in search.

The index normally lives at `~/.local/share/nekyia/index.db`; configuration lives at
`~/.config/nekyia/config.json`. Nekyia honours `XDG_DATA_HOME` and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.

## Privacy and data retention

Nekyia makes no network requests. There is no network service, no API key, and no telemetry.
The handover is deterministic and makes no model call.

The index reads transcripts already on your disk and stores selected paths and text
locally. That indexed copy can survive deletion of the original transcript. You control
that retention explicitly:

- `nek forget <uid>` purges one indexed session
- `nek prune --missing` purges sessions whose source files disappeared
- `nek exclude '/work/private'` adds an exclusion covering that directory and everything
  under it, expanding a leading `~` and resolving a relative directory against the one you
  ran it in, and the next `nek index` then deletes what was already indexed there,
  including sessions whose transcripts have since been deleted

`exclude` and `hiddenClients` are instructions rather than preferences, and the values
they fall back to are the permissive ones, so a config file Nekyia cannot read would
otherwise widen what it holds. Indexing refuses outright on a config whose exclusions
could not be honoured, before it writes anything, and names the file. Searching still
answers, because a typo should not cost you your history, but it says on stderr that the
config was not honoured. A malformed preference, such as `halfLifeDays`, is still just
ignored for that run.

Nekyia does not promise secret redaction or index encryption. Review `show`, `doctor`,
and JSON output before pasting it into a public issue.

## Adding a client

User manifests live in `~/.config/nekyia/clients/*.json`. Schema version 1 describes the
client roots, storage format, support tier, and optional launch templates. A minimal flat
JSONL manifest looks like this:

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "id": "my-client",
  "name": "My client",
  "roots": ["~/.local/share/my-client"],
  "format": "jsonl-transcript",
  "tier": "search",
  "jsonl": {
    "glob": "sessions/*.jsonl",
    "variant": "generic",
    "generic": {
      "idFrom": "filename",
      "cwdPath": "cwd",
      "tsPath": "timestamp",
      "rolePath": "role",
      "textPath": "text",
      "userRoles": ["user"],
      "assistantRoles": ["assistant"]
    }
  },
  "brief": {
    "cmd": "my-client",
    "args": ["{prompt}"],
    "cwd": "{cwd}"
  }
}
```

A SQLite manifest can add `"revision"` to its `sqlite` block, naming a projected column
that moves whenever its session does, usually the one already aliased to `ended_at`. With
it each session is fingerprinted from its own row, so editing one session re-reads only
that session. Without it the whole database shares one fingerprint and any change re-reads
every session in it, which is slower and is the right default: declaring a revision the
store does not honour means edits nobody notices.

`nek doctor --sniff` looks for session-shaped stores without declaring them supported.
`nek doctor --sniff --emit-manifest ./my-client.json` writes a non-overwriting draft
for the first store it can describe. Inspect and test that draft before moving it into the
user manifest directory or contributing it.

## Development

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run lint
bun run typecheck
bun run test
bun pm pack --dry-run
```

CI runs the frozen install, lint, typecheck, full suite, and package check on Linux and macOS.
Releases use Conventional Commits and Release Please.

## Roadmap

These clients still need hands-on testing before I ship a built-in manifest: Aider,
Crush, Qwen Code, Continue CLI, Droid, Amazon Q Developer CLI,
Plandex, OpenHands, Amp, Warp Agent, Grok CLI, Rovo Dev, Auggie, Trae, Cline CLI,
and Zed.

I also plan compiled standalone binaries through `bun build --compile` for Linux and
macOS on x64 and arm64. Those do not exist yet, so Bun is required for now.
