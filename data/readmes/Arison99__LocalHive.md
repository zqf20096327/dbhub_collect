**LocalHive** is a powerful development tool designed to streamline local application development. It provides a fully functional local S3 bucket and versatile database connectors, empowering developers to manage and analyze their data with ease. Written in C++, LocalHive is robust, efficient, and future-focused, enabling seamless integration with your projects.

## Features

- **Local S3 Bucket**: Access and manage a fully functional local S3 bucket for your development needs.
- **Database Connectors**: Seamlessly connect to multiple databases including:
  - MongoDB
  - SQLite
  - Redis
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL
  - Cassandra
  - MariaDB
- **Data Operations**:
  - Store images and Videos in Buckets
  - Search, create, and edit database tables.
  - Visualize database processes through interactive graphical analytics.
- **Future Plans**: UI-based frontend-backend integration without requiring manual Models, Views, and Controllers.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Dependencies**:
  - C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
  - MongoDB, SQLite, Redis (optional: other database clients)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arison99/LocalHive.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd LocalHive
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cmake .
   make
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./LocalHive
   ```

## Usage

### Local S3 Bucket
- Start LocalHive to create a local S3 bucket.
- Access the bucket for storing and retrieving files during development.

### Database Connectors
- Use LocalHive to connect to supported databases.
- Execute operations like table creation, search, and edits.

### Graphical Analytics
- Monitor database processes via built-in graphical analytics.
- Gain insights into queries, transactions, and more.

## Example
Here’s a quick example to connect to MongoDB and create a table:
```cpp
#include "LocalHive.h"

int main() {
    LocalHive hive;
    hive.connectToDatabase("MongoDB", "localhost", 27017);
    hive.createTable("users", {"id", "name", "email"});
    return 0;
}
```
