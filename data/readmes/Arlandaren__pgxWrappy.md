### PostgreSQL Wrapper Library for Convenient Scanning of Nested Structures

This library provides a convenient wrapper around the [pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) library developed by [Jack Christensen](https://github.com/jackc). It simplifies database interactions with PostgreSQL by allowing easy scanning of query results into nested Go structures and slices.

If you've ever encountered the inconvenience of scanning and retrieving lists with `pgx`, this tool allows you to fully enjoy the `pgx` library by simplifying these operations.

## Key Features

- **Easy Scanning into Nested Structures**: Automatically maps SQL query results to Go structs, including nested structs.
- **Convenient Handling of Slices**: Supports scanning multiple rows into slices of structs or pointers to structs.
- **Transaction Support**: Provides wrappers for transactional operations with methods for beginning, committing, and rolling back transactions.
- **Integration with pgx**: Built on top of the high-performance [pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) PostgreSQL driver, leveraging its robust features and reliability.

And even Jacks has mentioned this lib [here](https://github.com/jackc/pgx?tab=readme-ov-file#httpsgithubcomarlandarenpgxwrappy:~:text=jackc/pgx%20driver.-,https%3A//github.com/Arlandaren/pgxWrappy,working%20with%20the%20pgx%20library%2C%20providing%20convenient%20scanning%20of%20nested%20structures.,-About).

## Installation

To use this library, you need to have Go installed and set up. Import the package into your project:

```bash
go get -u github.com/Arlandaren/pgxWrappy
```

---

## Usage

### import package
```go
import "github.com/Arlandaren/pgxWrappy/pkg/postgres"
```

### Initializing the Wrapper

First, you need to initialize a connection pool using `pgxpool` and then create a new wrapper instance.

```go
import (
    "context"
    "github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/pgxpool"
    pgxwrappy "github.com/Arlandaren/pgxWrappy/pkg/postgres"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    pool, err := pgxpool.New(ctx, "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/database")
    if err != nil {
        // Handle error
    }
    dbWrapper := pgxwrappy.NewWrapper(pool)
    // Use dbWrapper for database operations
}
```

---

### Executing Queries

You can execute queries using the `QueryRow`, `Query`, and `Exec` methods, which are wrappers around the corresponding `pgx` methods.

```go
// Executing a query that returns a single row
row := dbWrapper.QueryRow(ctx, "SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id=$1", userID)

// Executing a query that returns multiple rows
rows, err := dbWrapper.Query(ctx, "SELECT id, name FROM users")

// Executing a command that doesn't return rows
_, err := dbWrapper.Exec(ctx, "UPDATE users SET name=$1 WHERE id=$2", newName, userID)
```

---

### Scanning into Structs

#### Get Method

The `Get` method executes a query that is expected to return a single row and scans the result into a struct.

```go
type User struct {
    ID   int    `db:"id"`
    Name string `db:"name"`
}

var user User
err := dbWrapper.Get(ctx, &user, "SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id=$1", userID)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
// Use the 'user' struct
```

#### Select Method

The `Select` method executes a query that returns multiple rows and scans the results into a slice of structs.

```go
var users []User
err := dbWrapper.Select(ctx, &users, "SELECT id, name FROM users")
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
// Use the 'users' slice
```

---

### Transactions

You can perform transactional operations using the `Begin`, `BeginTx`, `Commit`, and `Rollback` methods.

```go
txWrapper, err := dbWrapper.Begin(ctx)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}

defer func() {
    if err != nil {
        txWrapper.Rollback(ctx)
    } else {
        txWrapper.Commit(ctx)
    }
}()

// Perform transactional operations using txWrapper
err = txWrapper.Exec(ctx, "UPDATE accounts SET balance=balance-$1 WHERE id=$2", amount, fromAccountID)
if err != nil {
    return err
}

err = txWrapper.Exec(ctx, "UPDATE accounts SET balance=balance+$1 WHERE id=$2", amount, toAccountID)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
```

---

## Field Tag Naming

**Note**: To ensure correct scanning of query results into your structs, it's important to use the `db` struct tags to match the column names in your database. The tags should correspond exactly to the column names or use appropriate mapping if the names differ.

```go
type User struct {
    ID        int    `db:"id"`
    FirstName string `db:"first_name"`
    LastName  string `db:"last_name"`
    Email     string `db:"email"`
}
```

For nested structs, the field tags are used to flatten the structure during scanning.

```go
type Address struct {
    Street  string `db:"street"`
    City    string `db:"city"`
    ZipCode string `db:"zip_code"`
}

type User struct {
    ID      int     `db:"id"`
    Name    string  `db:"name"`
    Address Address `db:"-"`
}
```

In your SQL query, you should alias the columns appropriately:

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    name,
    street,
    city,
    zip_code
FROM users
```

This ensures that the scanning process correctly maps the SQL result columns to the fields in your nested structs.


- It is also possible to give a tag `db:"address"`, then the expected columns in the query would be: `address_street`, `address_city`, `address_zip_code`

Use the way that suits your situation.

## Why Choose `pgx` and `pgxWrappy`

When working with PostgreSQL in Go, developers have several driver options to choose from. **`pgx`** stands out among other drivers for several reasons, and **`pgxWrappy`** addresses some of the common inconveniences developers face.

### Brief Comparison with Other PostgreSQL Drivers

#### `database/sql` Standard Library

- **Description**: Go's standard library interface for SQL databases.
- **Pros**:
  - Familiar interface for Go developers.
  - Supports multiple database backends.
- **Cons**:
  - Requires driver-specific implementations for full PostgreSQL features.
  - Less performant due to generalized abstractions.
  - Limited support for PostgreSQL-specific data types and features.
  - **Inconvenient Scanning**: Requires manual scanning of rows into variables, leading to verbose and repetitive code.

#### `pq` Driver

- **Description**: Pure Go driver for PostgreSQL, compatible with `database/sql`.
- **Pros**:
  - Simple and reliable for basic operations.
  - Widely used and tested.
- **Cons**:
  - No longer actively developed with new features.
  - Limited performance optimizations.
  - Doesn't support advanced PostgreSQL features out of the box.
  - **Inefficient Scanning**: Similar to `database/sql`, scanning rows can be cumbersome and boilerplate-heavy.

#### `pgx` Driver

- **Description**: High-performance PostgreSQL driver and toolkit for Go, developed by [Jack Christensen](https://github.com/jackc).
- **Pros**:
  - **Best-in-Class Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency.
  - **Full PostgreSQL Feature Support**: Access to advanced data types and protocols.
  - **Active Development**: Regular updates and community support.
  - **Flexibility**: Can be used with or without `database/sql`.
- **Cons**:
  - Slightly steeper learning curve due to extensive features.
  - **Inconvenient Scanning of Nested Structures**: While `pgx` is powerful, scanning query results into complex nested structs or slices requires manual code and can be cumbersome.

### Conclusion

**`pgx` is the best option for Go developers working with PostgreSQL**, offering superior performance, comprehensive feature support, and active maintenance.

By using **`pgx`** in conjunction with **`pgxWrappy`**, you further enhance your development experience:

- **Ease of Development**: Simplified scanning of query results into nested structures without boilerplate code.
- **Enhanced Productivity**: Focus on application logic rather than handling complex data mappings.
- **High Performance**: Leverage `pgx`'s speed while enjoying a more convenient API.
- **Seamless Transactions**: Intuitive methods for managing database transactions.

**Example Usage with `pgxWrappy`:**

```go
import (
    "context"
    "github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/pgxpool"
    "github.com/Arlandaren/pgxWrappy/pkg/postgres"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    pool, err := pgxpool.New(ctx, "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/database")
    if err != nil {
        // Handle error
    }
    dbWrapper := pgxwrappy.NewWrapper(pool)
    // Use dbWrapper for database operations

    // And other methods see above.
}
```
