## 📌 Overview

Healthcare journeys are often fragmented across disparate clinics, physical paper prescriptions, lost lab reports, and siloed communication. In emergency situations, first responders frequently lack immediate access to critical patient health data such as blood group, chronic conditions, and emergency contacts.

**SehatPass** solves this challenge by unifying patient health management into a cohesive, secure digital ecosystem. It seamlessly connects **patients**, **doctors**, **diagnostic records**, **medication schedules**, **context-aware AI health assistance**, and **lifesaving lock-screen emergency QR access**.

## 🚨 Emergency QR & Lock-Screen Access

SehatPass features a dedicated emergency access mechanism designed for high-stress, rapid-response situations:

```
[ Locked Smartphone ]
         │
         ▼ (Tap Lock-Screen Notification)
[ Emergency QR Display ] ──(Paramedic Scans)──► [ Secure Web Viewer ]
                                                        │
                                                        ▼
                                           • Blood Group & Demographics
                                           • Critical Allergies & Conditions
                                           • Emergency Contact (1-Tap Call)
                                           • Active Emergency Medications
                                           • Emergency Diagnostic Reports
```

### Privacy & Security Model
- **Tokenized Access:** The QR code does **not** store raw medical records. Instead, it embeds a secure, opaque UUID token pointing to an authenticated Supabase Edge Function (`/emergency-access`).
- **Scoped Data Retrieval:** The emergency endpoint returns only emergency-permitted fields (blood group, allergies, emergency contacts, vital medicines) and redacts all non-emergency records.
- **Revocable & Ephemeral:** Patients can deactivate or regenerate their emergency token at any time. Attached medical reports are delivered via short-lived signed URLs (10-minute expiry).
- **Android Native Integration:** Implemented via Android `NotificationChannel` with `VISIBILITY_PUBLIC` and a dedicated `EmergencyQrActivity` configured to show over the lock screen (`showWhenLocked`).

---

## 🤖 Sehat AI: Context-Aware Intelligence

**Sehat AI** delivers intelligent, clinically grounded assistance powered by Google Gemini and Supabase:

- **Patient Health Context Injection:** Automatically infers and injects verified patient health data (demographics, active medicines, known allergies, recent lab reports, doctor consultation notes) into the LLM context for personalized answers.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** General medical inquiries query an indexed medical knowledge base stored in PostgreSQL with `pgvector` embeddings (`gemini-embedding-001`).
- **Clinical Safety Boundaries:** Hardened system instructions enforce non-diagnostic disclaimers, recognize emergency red-flag symptoms (directing users to emergency services), and defend against prompt injection.
- **Zero Secrets in Mobile Client:** The mobile app communicates exclusively with a hardened Supabase Edge Function (`sehat-ai`), keeping API keys and service credentials securely on the server.

---

## 🔔 Notification Architecture

SehatPass utilizes a multi-tiered notification system:

1. **Local Medicine Reminders (`flutter_local_notifications`):**
   - Precise minute-level daily scheduling using the device's local timezone (`timezone` package).
   - Operates completely offline without requiring persistent background server connections.
   - Privacy-conscious notification text prevents disclosure of sensitive medical details on lock-screen previews.
2. **Event-Driven Database Triggers:**
   - PostgreSQL triggers automatically generate notifications when appointments change status (e.g., requested, confirmed, cancelled).
   - Notifies patients when a doctor publishes new consultation notes.
3. **In-App Notification Center:**
   - Dedicated notification feed in the app with unread badges, timestamps, and deep linking to relevant screens.

---

## 🔒 Security & Data Privacy

- **Supabase Authentication:** Secure email/password authentication with JWT validation on all client and server requests.
- **PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS):** Every database table is protected by strict RLS policies. Patients can only access their own records; doctors can only access records of patients with confirmed appointments.
- **Private Storage Buckets:** Medical reports, profile pictures, and clinic images are stored in private Supabase Storage buckets.
- **Signed URL Access:** Images and PDF documents are never publicly exposed; they are accessed exclusively through time-limited cryptographic signed URLs.
- **Role Isolation:** Enforced separation between patient and doctor roles prevents unauthorized privilege escalation.
