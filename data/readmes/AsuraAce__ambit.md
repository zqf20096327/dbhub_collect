# Ambit
### High-Performance Local AI Image Manager
</div>

Ambit is a local-first desktop app for organizing large AI-generated image libraries. It helps you import folders, browse fast, search by generation metadata, resolve model references, and keep library maintenance work on your own machine.

## Key Features

*   **Local library management**: Catalog image folders without moving your source files, then review, remove, recover, and maintain records from one desktop workspace.
*   **Video library support**: Import supported local videos individually or through monitored folders, browse static posters, inspect ComfyUI metadata, and play or export originals. Playback depends on the Windows media runtime.
*   **Generation-aware metadata**: Parse prompts, workflows, resources, dimensions, hashes, and model references from common AI image outputs.
*   **Fast search and filtering**: Use SQLite-backed queries, facets, collections, and saved search state to stay responsive across large libraries.
*   **Performance-focused browsing**: Virtualized grids, thumbnail handling, and minimized IPC keep day-to-day browsing usable as collections grow.
*   **Optional intelligence tools**: Gemini-backed actions are available only when you configure your own key and explicitly run an AI feature.
*   **Privacy-conscious by default**: Core browsing, search, metadata parsing, thumbnails, and settings work locally without telemetry.

## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, React Query
*   **Backend**: Rust with Tauri v2 and SQLite (`rusqlite`)
*   **Desktop distribution**: GitHub Releases with Tauri updater artifacts

## Privacy and Network Behavior

Ambit is local-first. Core library management, browsing, search, metadata parsing, thumbnails, maintenance, and settings work on local files without telemetry.

The public beta has a small set of disclosed network paths:

*   Automatic update checks contact GitHub Releases when enabled. Updates are downloaded and installed only after you confirm the prompt.
*   Gemini features are optional. Requests are sent only when you configure a key and run an AI action or key verification.
*   CivitAI model-hash resolution is optional. It runs only after you confirm Resolve Online and sends unresolved model hash strings, not image files.
*   GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, and project links open only when clicked.

## Getting Started

### Public Beta Builds

Ambit is currently in public beta. Current builds are published on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/AsuraAce/ambit/releases).

Official public beta builds are currently available for **Windows only** while macOS and Linux support is being validated.

Maintainer-triggered Linux and macOS artifacts may appear separately as experimental community test builds.

1.  Download the Windows setup installer (`-setup.exe`) from the release assets.
2.  Install and launch the app.
3.  Report bugs or feedback through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AsuraAce/ambit/issues).

The Windows installer includes the packaged app. You do not need Node.js, pnpm, Rust, or VS Code unless you want to build Ambit from source.

For a step-by-step product guide, see the [Ambit User Manual](docs/manual/index.md).

### Development

For local development, Ambit requires Node.js 24 or newer, pnpm 11.5.3, and Rust 1.96.0 as pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AsuraAce/ambit.git
cd ambit
pnpm install
pnpm run app:dev
```

For clean feature-video capture while retaining the development profile and tools, start the app in capture mode from PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:VITE_CAPTURE_MODE='true'
pnpm run app:dev
```

Capture mode hides the React Query control and title-bar `DEV` badge without disabling developer features. Clear the flag before returning to the normal development UI:

```powershell
$env:VITE_CAPTURE_MODE=$null
```

For checks, branch expectations, and maintainer workflow notes, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Contributing

Ambit is currently maintainer-led. Bug reports, documentation corrections, and feature requests are welcome, but code contributions and pull requests are not being accepted during the public beta.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the current contribution policy.

For security-sensitive reports, follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead of opening a public issue.

## Support

Ambit is free and open source. Support is optional and there are currently no paid-only features or priority-support tiers.

*   Report bugs and feature requests through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AsuraAce/ambit/issues).
*   Follow packaged builds and release notes on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/AsuraAce/ambit/releases).
*   Support development through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/AsuraAce).
*   Leave a one-time tip on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/astraoriondev).
