Open, SQL-native time-series database for telemetry you need to keep. Arc ingests 34M+ records/sec, stores data as standard Parquet on infrastructure you own, and lets you query recent and historical data together. InfluxDB Line Protocol and Telegraf compatible. Single binary. AGPL-3.0.

> **Prefer a UI?** [**Arc Launchpad**](https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/launchpad) is a self-hosted web console for the Arc instances you run — SQL console, schema explorer, logs, monitoring, and management for tokens, retention, alerts, continuous queries, and MQTT ingestion. Deploy it alongside Arc with Docker Compose. [Docs](https://docs.basekick.net/launchpad).
>
> **Prefer a terminal?** [**arcli**](https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arcli) is the Arc command line — named connections, SQL queries with table, JSON, CSV or Arrow output, line-protocol and MessagePack writes, bulk imports, and admin for tokens, retention, continuous queries, backups and compaction. `brew install basekick-labs/tap/arcli`, or deb, rpm, Arch and Docker. [Docs](https://docs.basekick.net/arcli).

## Telemetry is easy to collect and expensive to keep

Machines, services, vehicles, and devices produce data continuously. The operational problem is not only ingesting the latest readings — it is keeping the full-resolution history available for debugging, analysis, compliance, and the next question nobody has asked yet.

Teams evaluating a time-series database usually run into the same trade-offs:

- **Retention cliffs**: Older data is downsampled, exported, or deleted because storage costs grow too quickly.
- **Split hot and cold paths**: Recent data is queryable in one system while historical data waits in a warehouse or object store.
- **Operational overhead**: A simple workload turns into a PostgreSQL extension stack or a multi-service cluster.
- **Migration friction**: Existing agents, dashboards, and Line Protocol writers make changing databases risky.
- **Vendor lock-in**: Proprietary storage makes it difficult to use your data elsewhere or leave later.

Arc is built for teams that want to keep the data, query the whole history, and start with a small deployment. It combines high-throughput ingestion, automatic Parquet storage and compaction, analytical SQL, retention policies, and continuous queries in one binary.

**Built for aerospace telemetry. Useful anywhere machines never stop producing data.**

---

## What Arc is (and isn't)

Arc is a complete time-series analytical database: ingestion pipeline, Parquet storage engine, compaction system, SQL query layer, retention policy manager, continuous query scheduler, and telemetry integrations — in one binary. It uses DuckDB as its query engine, while Arc adds the pieces needed to run a durable ingestion and analytics service: high-throughput writes with automatic Parquet flushing, background compaction, scheduled compute, data lifecycle management, authentication, backup and restore, and enterprise clustering.

Arc is **not a wrapper**. You don't bring your own ingestion, compaction, or retention policies. Arc provides the full stack.

### Why teams evaluate Arc

- **Keep full-resolution history** instead of choosing between retention and cost.
- **Use standard SQL** with window functions, CTEs, joins, and analytical aggregations.
- **Own the files**: Arc stores data as open Apache Parquet on local disk, S3, Azure, or any S3-compatible store (SeaweedFS, R2, MinIO, ...).
- **Start small**: run one binary on a laptop, edge box, or server before adding enterprise clustering.
- **Migrate gradually**: use InfluxDB Line Protocol and Telegraf-compatible ingestion to dual-write and validate before cutover.

### When Arc may not be the right choice

- If your workload is primarily transactional relational data and already fits comfortably in PostgreSQL, start by evaluating TimescaleDB.
- If you need a mature metrics-only replacement for Prometheus and depend on PromQL, evaluate VictoriaMetrics.
- If your organization cannot approve AGPL-3.0 software, use Arc Enterprise's commercial license or choose an Apache-licensed alternative.
- If you need the largest established community and the lowest adoption risk, Arc is newer than TimescaleDB, VictoriaMetrics, and QuestDB.

```sql
-- Telemetry: hourly sensor summary across a full history
SELECT
  device_id,
  DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp) AS hour,
  AVG(value) AS average_value,
  MIN(value) AS minimum_value,
  MAX(value) AS maximum_value
FROM telemetry.sensor_readings
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY device_id, hour
ORDER BY hour DESC;

-- Telemetry: correlate readings with device metadata
SELECT
  d.site,
  r.device_id,
  AVG(r.value) AS average_value
FROM telemetry.sensor_readings AS r
JOIN telemetry.devices AS d ON d.device_id = r.device_id
WHERE r.timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY d.site, r.device_id;
```

**Standard SQL. Window functions, CTEs, joins, aggregations. No proprietary query language.**

## Start with the workload you already have

Arc accepts **InfluxDB Line Protocol** directly, so existing Telegraf inputs can write to Arc without changing the collection layer. A low-risk migration usually looks like this:

1. Point a small slice of ingestion at Arc, or dual-write to both systems.
2. Compare the data and query results over an overlapping time window.
3. Move one dashboard or workload at a time.
4. Decommission the old database only after a full retention cycle has passed.

See the [InfluxDB migration guide](https://basekick.net/migrate/influxdb), or compare Arc with [TimescaleDB](https://basekick.net/compare/timescaledb), [InfluxDB](https://basekick.net/compare/influxdb), [ClickHouse](https://basekick.net/compare/clickhouse), and [Elasticsearch](https://basekick.net/compare/elasticsearch).

## Performance

Benchmarked on Apple MacBook Pro M3 Max (14 cores, 36GB RAM, 1TB NVMe).
Test config: 12 concurrent workers, 1000-record batches, columnar data.

### Ingestion (August 2026)

| Protocol | Throughput | p50 Latency | p99 Latency |
|----------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| MessagePack Columnar | **34.0M rec/s** | 0.29ms | 1.40ms |
| MessagePack + Zstd | 24.9M rec/s | 0.42ms | 1.53ms |
| MessagePack + GZIP | 24.6M rec/s | 0.42ms | 1.53ms |
| Line Protocol | 4.7M rec/s | 2.19ms | 6.61ms |

All rows measured over a 60-second sustained run. The MessagePack Columnar row is
**2,043,451,000 records ingested in 60 seconds** — and that's not rows streamed into
a memory buffer: every record was received over HTTP, decoded, time-sorted, and
durably written to disk as queryable Parquet, at 0.29ms median latency, on a laptop.

These numbers ship in **26.09.1**: ingest no longer dictionary-encodes Parquet
(compaction re-encodes files anyway) and the msgpack columnar path now decodes
payloads directly into typed column arrays, eliminating per-value allocations —
see the 26.09.1 release notes.

### Compaction

Automatic background compaction merges small Parquet files into optimized larger files:

| Metric | Before | After | Reduction |
|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Files | 43 | 1 | 97.7% |
| Size | 372 MB | 36 MB | **90.4%** |

Benefits:
- **10x storage reduction** via better compression and encoding
- **Faster queries** - scan 1 file vs 43 files
- **Lower cloud costs** - less storage, fewer API calls

### Query (May 2026)

Arc speaks three wire formats from the same query engine. **Arrow IPC** is the throughput leader for analytical clients (Grafana, pyarrow, polars) that can take an Arrow dependency — zero-copy from the engine's internal columnar buffers. **MessagePack** (columnar, stable as of 26.09.1) is the choice for clients that don't speak Arrow but want smaller bytes and faster decode than JSON — same envelope shape as JSON, native binary types for timestamps and binary columns. **JSON** stays the default for ergonomic compatibility.

Benchmark: 393.7M-row `cpu` measurement, 5 iterations per query, M3 Max. Latency is p50 in milliseconds. The five SELECT-LIMIT rows were measured back-to-back in the same session so the three columns are apples-to-apples; the DuckDB-bound rows (Time Bucket, Date Trunc, GROUP BY) are dominated by query execution and converge across wire formats.

| Query | JSON (ms) | MessagePack (ms) | Arrow IPC (ms) | msgpack vs JSON | Arrow vs JSON |
|-------|----------:|-----------------:|---------------:|----------------:|--------------:|
| COUNT(*) — 393.7M rows | 1.03 | 1.03 | 0.86 | 1.00x | 1.20x |
| SELECT LIMIT 10K | 18.4 | 16.6 | 14.7 | 1.11x | 1.25x |
| SELECT LIMIT 100K | 48.1 | 33.2 | 31.0 | **1.45x** | **1.55x** |
| SELECT LIMIT 500K | 173.2 | 81.1 | 61.1 | **2.14x** | **2.84x** |
| SELECT LIMIT 1M | 334.2 | **133.6** | **105.4** | **2.49x** | **3.17x** |
| Time Range (7d) LIMIT 10K | 15.0 | 15.5 | 15.5 | 0.97x | 0.97x |
| Time Bucket (1h, 7d) | 4.7 | 4.8 | 4.7 | 0.98x | 1.00x |
| Date Trunc (day, 30d) | 416 | 415 | 413 | 1.00x | 1.01x |
| GROUP BY host | 452 | 450 | 450 | 1.00x | 1.00x |
| GROUP BY host + hour | 645 | 660 | 672 | 0.98x | 0.96x |

**Best throughput on LIMIT 1M (1M-row payload, single connection):**
- Arrow IPC: **9.49M rows/sec** (105.4ms)
- MessagePack: **7.49M rows/sec** (133.6ms)
- JSON: **2.99M rows/sec** (334.2ms)
- COUNT(*): **~382B rows/sec equivalent** (393.7M rows in 1.03ms — parquet footer reads, not a row scan)

**Notes on the table:** the wire-format speedups manifest on response-heavy queries (≥100k rows) where encoding dominates the per-request wall time. For aggregations (Time Bucket, Date Trunc, GROUP BY) the response is tiny — a few rows — and DuckDB execution is 99%+ of the wall time; all three formats converge. The Arrow IPC win comes from a memcpy of the column buffer; the MessagePack endpoint walks each cell through a typed columnar encoder (one type-switch per column, not per row) and lands at ~78% of Arrow IPC's throughput while remaining decodable by any msgpack client without an Arrow dependency.

The MessagePack endpoint is **stable** as of 26.09.1: its response shape and type vocabulary are a published contract pinned by a golden test, so clients can bind to them. It's the best general-purpose format for a client not using Arrow directly — columnar, typed, and it accepts SHOW statements, which the Arrow endpoint doesn't. See the 26.09.1 release notes for the wire-format contract.

## Single binary. Zero dependencies.

Arc deploys as one statically-linked executable. No JVM, no Python environment, no PostgreSQL cluster to manage, no ZooKeeper ensemble to babysit. Run it on a laptop, a factory edge box, an on-premises server, or a Kubernetes cluster. Same binary, same config surface.

- **Air-gap ready**: No external services required at runtime. No license server, no cloud dependency.
- **Edge to cloud**: Deploy at the tactical edge, in a sovereign cloud, or on-premises.
- **Minimal footprint**: One process. Memory usage proportional to active workload, not fleet size.

sudo systemctl enable arc && sudo systemctl start arc
```

### Kubernetes (Helm)

```bash
helm install arc https://github.com/basekick-labs/arc/releases/download/v26.09.1/arc-26.09.1.tgz
```

### Build from Source

```bash
# Prerequisites: Go 1.26+

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/basekick-labs/arc.git
cd arc
make build

# Or build directly with Go (the duckdb_arrow tag is required)
go build -tags=duckdb_arrow ./cmd/arc

# Run
./arc
```

### FIPS 140-3 Build

For US defense/federal and other regulated environments, Arc ships an optional
**`arc-fips`** build: the same source at the same version, compiled against the
CMVP-certified Go Cryptographic Module and run in FIPS-only mode. Pick the
`-fips` artifact instead of the standard one.

```bash
# Binary — download arc-fips-linux-amd64 (or -arm64) from the release
# Container — same repos, -fips tag suffix:
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -v arc-data:/app/data ghcr.io/basekick-labs/arc:VERSION-fips
# or basekicklabs/arc:VERSION-fips

# Build from source:
make build-fips      # -> arc-fips (GOFIPS140=v1.0.0, -tags=duckdb_arrow,fips)
```

The FIPS build reports the same version as the standard build and logs
`"fips_mode":true` at startup. **Cutover note:** existing bcrypt-hashed API
tokens must be rotated when moving to the FIPS build (it stores new tokens with
PBKDF2 and fails bcrypt verification closed). The Go Cryptographic Module is
CMVP-certified; Arc itself is not a CMVP-listed module. See the
[FIPS 140-3 mode guide](https://docs.basekick.net/docs/configuration/fips).

## Configuration

Arc uses TOML configuration with environment variable overrides.

```toml
[server]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8000

[storage]
backend = "local"        # local, s3, minio
local_path = "./data/arc"

[ingest]
flush_interval = "5s"
max_buffer_size = 50000

[auth]
enabled = true
```

Environment variables use `ARC_` prefix:

```bash
export ARC_SERVER_PORT=8000

- [@alexeymoskalev-devops](https://github.com/alexeymoskalev-devops) — compaction candidates preview lists each measurement once and hands the listing to every tier, after finding and documenting why the scheduled cycle must not share listings across tiers (#789)
- [@TayfurYldz](https://github.com/TayfurYldz) — DECIMAL query results stay JSON numbers on the JSON output path: aggregates such as SUM and AVG over integer columns are cast to int64 or double before encoding instead of being stringified (#831)
- [@jallegri](https://github.com/jallegri) — hourly-compaction minimum-files rationale corrected to the actual ingest flush triggers (#838)

And a thank-you to community members whose bug reports drove fixes:

- [@bjarneksat](https://github.com/bjarneksat) — reported the line-protocol null-field handling bug fixed in 26.03.1
- [@rexpository](https://github.com/rexpository) — reported the edge-sync spoke-ID namespace collision fixed in 26.09.2 (#737), and ongoing security research across the cluster, auth and edge-sync boundaries
