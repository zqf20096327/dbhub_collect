Welcome to **MusicAPI** – a **free, fast, and easy-to-use API** that lets you fetch detailed song data, including song names, YouTube & Spotify URLs, audio files, thumbnails, and more! It's like having your very own personal music assistant, all wrapped up in a neat API package. 🚀

### **Features:**

- 🔗 **YouTube & Spotify Integration**: Direct links to song videos on YouTube and audio streaming on Spotify.
