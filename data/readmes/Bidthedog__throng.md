throng is a modern **project-first, terminal-second, agent-third** desktop app for running many
independent command-line terminals across cleanly isolated projects. Each project binds to a
root folder and a colour; you lay its workspace out as a VS Code-style dock of tabs and split
panels, browse and edit its files in a live tree, and run real installed shells inline as **Terminal
panels** whose processes are owned by a detached background daemon — so they keep running when
the UI closes and reattach when you reopen.

throng was born out of a life-long frustration of having to manage dozens of windows during complex 
development workflows - IDEs, terminals (including multi-terminal emulators) and folders -
recently exacerbated by the adoption of modern, multi-tasking agentic workflows.

This project was made possible in an incredibly short amount of time by harnessing the power of AI.

## Who it's for

throng is built for **power users** — developers who want full command-line control of a
project *and* a visual representation of it, with everything in one place and easy to reach.
If you routinely run half a dozen terminals in different shells for a single project, alongside
a scatter of (often tabbed) folders, VS Code, and a handful of other apps, throng's
goal is to pull all of that into a single, simple customisable workspace.

## Platform support

> **Windows only today** (Windows 11 is the first-class target). **macOS
> ([#22](https://github.com/Bidthedog/throng/issues/22)) and Linux
> ([#23](https://github.com/Bidthedog/throng/issues/23)) are planned.** The OS boundary is
> abstracted so they can be added without reworking the core, but no macOS/Linux build ships yet.

## Highlights

- **Projects** — isolated per-project contexts, each bound to an exclusive root folder and a colour;
  create, edit, switch and reorder them, stored locally per user.
- **Dockable workspace** — three collapsible panes, unlimited tabs and drag-to-split panels; the full
  per-project layout is saved and restored every session.
- **Multi-window sub-workspaces** — tear tabs or panels off into separate OS windows that stay in
  sync and move as one focus group.
- **Terminal panels** — PowerShell, Git Bash, CMD and custom shell flavours run inline on **detached,
  daemon-owned PTYs**, so they survive a UI restart and reattach with their scrollback.
- **Editor panels** — a CodeMirror editor that preserves encoding and line endings, shares one buffer
  per file across every window, and recovers in-progress edits *and their undo history* after a crash.
- **Code editing** — syntax highlighting for 31 languages, rectangular selection, whole-line cut and
  paste, and indentation that follows the file's own style rather than a house one. A status bar
  reports the caret's line and column and the size of the selection and the document, and the
  line-number gutter can be turned off to give that width back.
- **File explorer** — a live, project-scoped file tree with rename, move, copy, Recycle-Bin delete and
  per-project hiding, all undoable with Ctrl+Z and persisted across restarts.
- **In-panel search** — one find bar that adapts to the active panel: find and replace in an editor,
  and a read-only scrollback search in a terminal that never types at the shell.
- **Find across files** — `Ctrl+Shift+F` searches every file in the project from a panel of its own,
  scoped to the root, to any folder under it, or to a single file — typed as a project-relative path
  or a full one. The explorer toolbar searches the whole project, and any file or folder's
  **Open In → Search → Find** (or **Find & Replace**) opens the panel cleared and pointed at what you
  clicked, ready for a term. It searches **as you type** by default, results stream
  in as they are found up to 20,000 matches, grouped by file or by folder and file together, and a
  double-click opens a match where you were already reading. A result's own menu offers **Open In**
  when you want it somewhere else — the last active editor, a new one, or another tab, the same three
  targets the file tree offers, each taking you straight to the match rather than to the top of the
  file.
  The panel's header says whether replace is showing: **Find in Files** while it is hidden, **Find &
  Replace in Files** while it is disclosed, each followed by the term once you have typed one.
  `Ctrl+Shift+H` opens the same panel with replace showing: every match previews its replacement in
  place, and you commit one match, one file, or all of them. A row you have committed drops the
  preview and reads as the file now does; **Replace All** greys out once nothing is left to commit.
  Files that changed since the search say so, and a write into files that are not open — the one
  throng cannot undo for you — states how many and asks first. A file whose editor had **no unsaved
  changes** is saved for you and ends clean; one you had already edited is left dirty, with the
  replacement pending alongside your own work, so a commit never writes out something you had not
  saved. Either way the change is a single Ctrl+Z.
- **Getting there without walking** — Quick Open ranks every file in the project by name or path from
  one chord and says in words where it will open it; Go To Line jumps by number; and the tree's own
  menu opens a terminal in any folder or tidies one branch of the subtree.
- **Focus and zoom** — one visible active panel per window, movable from the keyboard, with text zoom
  set independently per panel and panel names that are unique across the whole application.
- **Preferences** — a single window with visual Settings, Key Bindings and Themes editors: typeahead
  search, immediate apply, a raw-JSON toggle that applies when you leave it, and reset scopes from
  one item up to everything.
- **Themes and icon packs** — 14 bundled themes plus hot-reloading, user-editable theme, keybinding
  and icon-pack files that re-skin the whole application live, with contrast guarded automatically.
- **Failures that name their cause** — errors say what is actually holding a locked file, raise one
  message per underlying problem, and leave a daemon-restart control in the status bar if it stops.
- **File previews** — a read-only, rendered view of a file beside its editor: opened from the
  editor's status bar, its right-click menu, or Files & Folders' **Open In → Preview**. It follows
  the editor's buffer live as you type — no save needed — and the file on disk when opened on its
  own, with scrolling **synchronised both ways** between a parented preview and its editor —
  whichever side you scroll drives the other — and at the same block granularity either way:
  whatever block (heading, paragraph, list item, table row) sits at the top of one's view is what
  the other keeps at its own top, not headings alone. The sync can be switched off from either
  panel's body or header right-click menu, a status-bar button next to each panel's Preview/Editor
  button, or the bindable `preview.toggleSyncScroll` command (unbound by default). Markdown
  ships as the first provider: headings, tables, task lists, fenced and syntax-highlighted code,
  YAML front matter as a table, and Ctrl+click-able links, sanitised and themed throughout — body
  text is selectable and copyable, and hovering or focusing a link shows its target at the left of
  the preview's status bar. Following a heading link is a Back/Forward step, the same as opening
  another file. Built as a provider seam, so the next file type is one provider to add, not a new
  feature.
- **Back and Forward, per panel** — every editor and preview panel keeps its own history of the
  files it has shown, with Back/Forward buttons at the top left of its title bar, `Alt+Left` /
  `Alt+Right`, and the mouse's own back/forward buttons. History persists across restarts.
- **Clickable links, the same in terminals, editors and previews** — a path printed by a compiler
  or a test runner, a hyperlink a program emits, a web address and a `mailto:` are all followable
  with Ctrl+click, `Ctrl+Enter` (editors and previews) or the one **Link menu**. A link is recognised
  by its **text alone** — throng never checks that a path exists before underlining it, so a broken
  link is underlined like any other — in whatever spelling it was printed: Git Bash's `/usr`, `/etc`
  and `/tmp`, any `file:` URL, a network share, and a `foo.ts:42:7` that lands on line 42, column 7.
  What a Ctrl+click does depends on what the link names: a web or `localhost` address opens in your
  browser; a file in the project opens in throng (one that is not there raises one "not found"
  notice); a network path, a `file:` URL or anything else on disk opens in OS Explorer — a folder as
  itself, a file's folder with the file selected; and an allowed protocol (`mailto`, `tel`, `slack`
  as shipped) goes to its handler. **A click never runs anything and never opens a default program**,
  and schemes that run code are always refused. Every link shows a hand pointer, wears one look — a
  dashed underline at rest, solid under the pointer — on every row of a link the terminal wrapped, and
  shows its full target in the panel's status bar; terminal links are marked as the screen draws,
  full-screen programs such as Claude Code included. Terminals throng starts **advertise hyperlink
  support** (`FORCE_HYPERLINK=1`) so programs print real links, without ever overriding a value you
  set yourself.

This list is throng as it exists today. **What's planned lives in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/Bidthedog/throng/issues)**, grouped by
[milestone](https://github.com/Bidthedog/throng/milestones) — there is no separate roadmap
document to fall out of date.

## Architecture

An npm-workspaces monorepo whose packages map to the constitution's boundaries:

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| `@throng/core` | Platform & process-agnostic core: the OS-abstraction interfaces (shell detection, PTY host, directory lock, filesystem, platform/user/display info), typed settings, and the pure domain (projects, docking model, panel types, terminal logic). No OS/Electron/process calls. |
| `@throng/platform-windows` | Windows implementations of the core seams (shell detection, node-pty/ConPTY PTY host, directory lock, …), verified against `core`'s contract suites. |
| `@throng/persistence` | Embedded SQLite (better-sqlite3) with a `user_version` migration runner and drift repair — projects, per-project layouts, sub-workspaces. |
| `@throng/ipc-contract` | Shared JSON-RPC message types (`health.*`, `projects.*`, `workspace.*`, `subworkspaces.*`, `terminal.*`, `files.*`). |
| `@throng/daemon` | The headless, long-lived background process; single SQLite writer and owner of all terminal PTYs. Hosts the named-pipe JSON-RPC router and a streaming events socket. |
| `@throng/ui` | The Electron client. The renderer is a React 19 + Vite docking app (xterm.js, react-arborist, `@dnd-kit`); the main process owns windowing and bridges the renderer to the daemon. |

The renderer never touches SQLite or the OS directly: renderer → preload `contextBridge` → UI
main → daemon over a Windows named pipe (newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0), with terminal output
streamed back over the daemon's events socket. Terminals live in the daemon so closing the UI
never kills them.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20 LTS.** `better-sqlite3` and `node-pty` ship prebuilt binaries (no native
  toolchain), and the daemon builds against host Node 24 — no `electron-rebuild`.
- **Windows 11** (see [Platform support](#platform-support)).

## Commands

Root npm scripts, run from the repository root:

| Goal | Command |
|------|---------|
| Install / build | `npm install` · `npm run build` |
| Run everything (daemon + UI) | `npm start` |
| Run daemon / UI alone | `npm run start:daemon` · `npm run start:ui` |
| All tests | `npm test` |
| One layer | `npm run test:unit` · `test:integration` · `test:contract` · `test:e2e` |

Quick start:

```bash
npm install && npm run build && npm start
```

The UI opens to the docking workspace in a few seconds. Create a project, add tabs, split
panels, browse the file tree, and confirm a **Terminal** panel to get a live shell at the
project root. Stop the daemon with `Ctrl+C` (graceful shutdown releases the pipe and reaps
its terminals).

**New to the app?** [`docs/quick-start.md`](docs/quick-start.md) walks through it properly —
first launch to a working project, with the default key bindings.

### Installing a packaged build

throng ships as **three self-contained Windows downloads** (no admin, no prerequisites): a per-user
installer, a portable executable that runs without installing, and a zip archive to extract wherever you
like. See [`docs/installation.md`](docs/installation.md) to choose one, verify its checksum, install,
upgrade and uninstall, and [`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md) for how a build becomes a versioned,
verified, published release. The running app shows its version, build id and licence in **Help → About throng**
(reached from the title-bar cog menu).

## Configuration

No value is hardcoded in business logic; all are injected typed settings with documented
defaults, overridable via environment variables:

| Setting | Env var | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Daemon/UI pipe name | `THRONG_PIPE_NAME` | `\\.\pipe\throng.daemon` |
| Database path | `THRONG_DATABASE_PATH` | `%APPDATA%\throng\throng.db` |
| Window size | `THRONG_WINDOW_WIDTH` / `THRONG_WINDOW_HEIGHT` | `1280` × `800` |
| UI ping timeout (ms) | `THRONG_PING_TIMEOUT_MS` | `2000` |

User settings, keybindings, and themes are human-editable files under `%USERPROFILE%\.throng\`
(`settings.json`, `keybindings.json`, `themes\<name>.json`, and `icon-packs\<pack>\`) and
hot-reload. Everything is also editable from the visual **preferences window** (title-bar cog),
which writes those same files and applies changes immediately. The installed-font cache and the
bundled default-theme source live under `%APPDATA%\throng\`. The config directory is overridable
via `THRONG_CONFIG_ROOT`.

**Find in Files** is tuned by eight settings under `search.inFiles`, all on the
**Search · Find in Files** section of the preferences window — the find bar's own settings sit
beside it under **Search · Find Bar**. They are: `openTarget` (reuse the panel that ran the last
search, or open a fresh one each time), `trigger` (search once you stop typing, which is what ships,
or wait for **Run**), `settleMs` (how long that quiet period is — 500 ms as shipped),
`defaultGrouping` (`file` or `fileAndFolder`), `rememberGrouping` (whether a grouping you switch to
survives the next search in that panel), `warnIrreversibleCommit` (whether a replace into files
with no open editor confirms first), and the two that govern the notice reporting what a replace
changed: `summaryNoticeMode` (*Never display* / *Display for* / *Dismiss only* — **Dismiss only** as
shipped) and `summaryNoticeTimeoutMs` (how long *Display for* shows it — 5000 ms as shipped, and
greyed out while the mode is anything else).

**That pair governs the replace summary whether the replace succeeded, partly succeeded or failed**,
and for that one notice the application-wide **Notifications** settings are not consulted at all — so
a global preference that errors stay until dismissed does not reach it. The trade is deliberate: a
control that overrides a global setting sits beside the thing it overrides it for. Choosing *Never
display* asks you to confirm first, because that notice is also how a failed write reports itself;
whatever the mode says, the outcome is still written to the log.

**Previews** are tuned by settings under **Editor · Previews**: `editor.previews.updateDelayMs`
(how long after your last keystroke a parented preview catches up — 300 ms as shipped),
`editor.previews.maxWaitMs` (the ceiling on that wait while you keep typing — 1000 ms as shipped),
`editor.previews.syncScroll` (**Synchronise preview and editor scrolling** — on as shipped and
works both directions: scrolling a parented preview scrolls its editor to match, and scrolling the
editor scrolls the preview; turning it off leaves each where it is. Also switchable from either
panel's right-click menu, a status-bar button beside each panel's Preview/Editor button, or the
bindable `preview.toggleSyncScroll` command, which ships with no chord), and
`editor.previews.copyFormat` (Rich text or Plain text for what Copy puts
on the clipboard), and, per provider, whether it is enabled and its **default open action** —
Editor or Preview — plus any settings of its own, such as Markdown's **Load remote images** and
**Show front matter** (on as shipped; off hides the front-matter table entirely rather than
rendering it as Markdown). Turning a provider off closes its
open previews and greys its other settings rather than hiding them. **`editor.navigation.historySize`**
(under **Editor · Navigation**, 10 as shipped, 1–100) caps how many files each editor or preview
panel's Back/Forward history remembers.

**Clickable file links** are tuned by settings under **Editor · Links**, and by one key binding.
The **Open Link** command (`preview.followLink`, `Ctrl+Enter` as shipped, rebindable in the Key
Bindings editor) was a preview's; it is now live in **editors** as well, on the same id and the same
chord, so a rebinding saved before this release still works. It stays dead in a **terminal**, where
`Ctrl+Enter` reaches the shell — which is also why the terminal's Open Link menu item shows no
shortcut.

Where a Ctrl+click, that chord and the Link menu's **Open Link** go is fixed rather than a setting,
and depends on what the link names: a web or loopback address opens in the system browser; a file in
the project opens in throng — a preview or an editor, by that file type's **default open action**
under Editor · Previews, and always an editor when the link names a line and column; a folder, a
network path, a `file:` URL and anything else on disk is shown in OS Explorer; and an allowed protocol
goes to its own handler. A click **never runs a file and never opens one in its default program**;
that is only ever reached by choosing *Open in OS Default Program* or, for an executable, *Open
Program* from the Link menu. (An `editor.links.defaultAction` left in `settings.json` by a pre-release
build is ignored, and left out the next time throng writes the file.)

Nothing checks that a link exists before it is drawn. `editor.links.existenceCheckTimeoutMs` (2,000 as
shipped, 250 – 25,000) bounds the one check throng does make — when a link is Ctrl+clicked, or its
Link menu opens, to find the file and tell a file from a folder — in total however many places it
looks; raise it for a slow network share. It applies to the next check with no restart.
`editor.links.protocolAllowlist` (`mailto`, `tel`, `slack` as shipped) names the schemes besides the
web that are links and go to their OS handler; schemes that run code — `javascript`, `data`,
`vbscript`, `ms-msdt`, `search-ms` and the like — are refused whatever it says. An email address
written on its own is a `mailto:` link while that scheme is listed, and plain text when it is not —
never a file either way. `editor.links.knownFileExtensions` is the list of extensions that let an
unquoted path run across spaces; it arrives holding the ones throng ships with, and you add to and
remove from it directly, so an empty list means none of them do. Two switches live there too,
`editor.links.detectInEditors` and `editor.links.detectInTerminals`, both on as shipped: each turns
off links entirely in that panel type — detected paths, web addresses, allowed protocols and the
hyperlinks a program declares for itself alike. The link underline's two colours are the
theme tokens **Link Underline** and **Link Hover Underline**, and the plain-click hint's are **Link
Hint Background**, **Link Hint Text** and **Link Hint Border**, all in the theme editor's General
area. `terminals.advertiseHyperlinks` (under
**Terminal**, on as shipped) starts each terminal with `FORCE_HYPERLINK=1` so programs know they may
print hyperlinks; a `FORCE_HYPERLINK` the launching environment already carries is never overridden
in either direction, the setting applies to terminals started afterwards rather than to one already
running, and throng never sets `WT_SESSION` or a borrowed `TERM_PROGRAM`.

**Logs and crash reports** are written to a `logs` folder under the user-data directory (`throng`
when installed, `throng-dev` for a dev run), so a crash that closes the window leaves evidence
behind instead of vanishing. `diagnostics.logLevel`, `diagnostics.maxFileSizeKb` and
`diagnostics.keepFiles` control how much is kept and for how long; the **Logging** section of the
preferences window edits those same values. At `debug`, terminals also write `[renderer-terminal]`
lines to `main.log` — what each view was handed when it attached, screen and mouse mode changes,
wheel routing, selections, menu copies and redraws — for diagnosing a terminal that misbehaves on
one machine only.

### Running a dev build beside an installed throng

throng is developed on the same machine that runs it, so an **unpackaged** run (`npm start`,
`npm run start:ui`) is a *dev instance*: it keeps its own data and never touches the installed
app's. Nothing to configure — the app decides from `app.isPackaged`.

| | Installed (packaged) | Dev (`npm start`) |
|---|---|---|
| userData — window state, editor recovery, font cache | `%APPDATA%\throng` | `%APPDATA%\throng-dev` |
| Config — settings, keybindings, themes, icon packs | `%USERPROFILE%\.throng` | `%USERPROFILE%\.throng-dev` |
| Database | `%APPDATA%\throng\throng.db` | `%APPDATA%\throng-dev\throng.db` |
| Daemon pipe | `\\.\pipe\throng.<user>.<hash>.daemon` | …`.daemon.dev` |

The separate pipe is the load-bearing one: an instance that finds a daemon running a *different*
build **retires it**, killing every terminal that daemon owns — so a shared pipe would mean a
rebuild destroys the terminals in the throng you are working in. Distinct pipes also give each
instance its own single-instance lock, so both can run at once. Every override above
(`THRONG_CONFIG_ROOT`, `THRONG_DATABASE_PATH`, `THRONG_PIPE_NAME`, `--user-data-dir`) still wins
in both modes, and a dev launch prints the three locations it resolved.

Your **window and panel layout** is written back as you work, on a short (400ms) debounce, and is
flushed on every ordinary exit — closing a window, quitting the app, a sign-out or a restart. **A
known and accepted limit:** a termination the application cannot intercept — `SIGKILL`, *End task* in
Task Manager, a power loss — can lose **up to the last 400ms** of layout changes. This is a
deliberate trade, not a defect: dragging a panel emits a continuous stream of layout changes, and
writing each one straight through would amplify a single drag into hundreds of disk writes. The
debounce coalesces them. Removing it to close a 400ms window that only an uncatchable kill can open
would cost every user constant write churn for the entire time they are arranging panels — so please
do not "fix" it by lowering or deleting the debounce. Every exit path the OS lets us observe already
drains the pending write before the process goes.

The application ships an immutable, versioned record of its defaults (built-in themes, settings, key
bindings), generated from the application's own definitions and distributed with the build. It is the
single source every restore-to-default reads from: a first run seeds the config from it (without
clobbering any file already present), and an application upgrade only *adds* newly-shipped themes and
fills in newly-added theme properties — it never overwrites a value you already have. A version marker
(`defaults-state.json`) records which defaults have been applied. Adopting new shipped *values* on an
existing theme is a deliberate choice, made via the theme editor's restore controls — **Restore All
Themes to Default**, or a per-theme restore / recreate on a single built-in. Every restore is
whole-operation atomic: if a theme file cannot be written, nothing is changed.

## Testing

Five Vitest/Playwright layers — **unit, component, integration, contract, E2E** — run via the
commands above. Every change ships coverage at the lowest layer that can prove it, and E2E is
reserved for what no lower layer can observe. The elevation-gated `@admin` terminal suite runs via
`npm run test:e2e:admin`. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full testing bar.
