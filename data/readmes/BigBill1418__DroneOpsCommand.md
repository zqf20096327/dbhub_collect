DroneOpsCommand is a self-hosted, full-stack platform for managing commercial drone operations end-to-end. It covers the complete lifecycle from flight data ingestion and GPS telemetry visualization through AI-powered report generation, invoicing, and client delivery — all running on your own hardware.

Designed for FAA Part 107 certified operators running missions such as search & rescue, inspections, mapping, videography, and more.

### Why DroneOpsCommand?

- **100% self-hosted** — runs on your own hardware via Docker Compose. No cloud dependencies, no per-seat licensing, no subscription fees.
- **AI report generation** — local via Ollama (Llama 3.1 8B Instruct `q4_K_M` default) or cloud via Claude API. Your data stays on your hardware with Ollama; Claude API available for faster, higher-quality output.
- **White-label ready** — company name, tagline, and branding are fully configurable from the Settings UI. No code changes needed to make it yours.
- **Full lifecycle** — flight log upload, GPS path visualization, animated flight replay with video export, telemetry analysis, mission management, AI reports, PDF export, invoicing, and email delivery in one platform.
- **Real-time airspace** — live aircraft tracking via OpenSky Network with anonymous or authenticated access.
- **Mobile-friendly** — responsive dark-themed UI works on phones, tablets, and desktops.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2+)
- x86_64 or ARM64 host

**Minimum resources (self-hosted):**

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------------|-------|
| RAM      | 12 GB   | 16 GB       | `docker-compose.yml` gives Ollama `mem_reservation: 8g` / `mem_limit: 10g`; the default Llama 3.1 8B `q4_K_M` model is ~6 GB resident with its KV cache. Backend + Postgres + flight-parser + Redis push the total past 8 GB, so 8 GB of host RAM is not enough unless you run `LLM_PROVIDER=claude` and drop the `ollama` service. |
| CPU      | 4 cores | 6–8 cores   | `docker-compose.yml` pins Ollama to 6 cores. Fewer cores means slow AI report generation. |
| Disk     | 30 GB   | 100 GB+     | Flight logs, Postgres, the ~4.9 GB Ollama model, video exports. Grows with usage. |

> **Docker Desktop users (Windows/Mac) — READ THIS.** Docker Desktop runs containers inside a Linux VM with its own RAM/CPU limits. The defaults are usually **too low** for DroneOpsCommand. Open **Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources** and raise **Memory to at least 8 GB** (16 GB recommended) and **CPUs to at least 4** before `docker compose up`. If the VM runs out of memory the stack will crash at startup or under load with no clear error. `setup-server.sh` does not run on Windows/Mac, so you won't see a preflight warning — allocate the VM resources manually.

> **Windows?** See the [Windows Self-Hosting Guide](docs/windows-self-hosting.md) for step-by-step Docker Desktop + WSL 2 setup.

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone and configure
git clone https://github.com/BigBill1418/DroneOpsCommand.git
cd DroneOpsCommand
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Set your secrets. These four have NO default (ADR-0012) — compose
#    interpolates them with `:?` and REFUSES TO START if any is empty:
#    - POSTGRES_PASSWORD       openssl rand -base64 32
#    - DATABASE_URL            postgresql+asyncpg://doc:<that password>@db:5432/doc
#    - REPLICATION_PASSWORD    openssl rand -base64 32  (any value on a standalone install)
#    - JWT_SECRET_KEY          openssl rand -hex 32

# 3. Launch
docker compose up -d

# 4. Wait for the AI model to download (first run only, ~4.9 GB)
docker compose logs -f ollama-setup

# 5. Open the app
#    Web UI:   http://localhost:3080
#    API docs: http://localhost:3080/docs
#    First visit shows the setup wizard — create your admin account there.
```

### What happens on first startup

1. PostgreSQL schema is created automatically
2. Setup wizard prompts you to create the admin account (no env vars needed)
3. Aircraft fleet (7 DJI models) and rate templates (14 billing presets) are pre-loaded
4. Ollama downloads the Llama 3.1 8B Instruct `q4_K_M` model (~4.9 GB)
5. All storage directories are created

### Auto-start on boot

Run the setup script to install the boot-time systemd unit:

```bash
sudo ./setup-server.sh             # install droneops.service
sudo ./setup-server.sh --uninstall # remove it (also cleans up legacy autopull units)
```

This installs **one** systemd unit:
- **`droneops.service`** — starts the Docker Compose stack on boot

```bash
# Useful commands
systemctl status droneops          # stack status
journalctl -u droneops -f          # stack start/stop logs
docker compose logs -f backend     # application logs
```

### Updating

```bash
git pull --ff-only
docker compose up -d --build       # rebuild only what changed
docker compose ps                  # confirm everything is healthy
```

Database migrations run automatically on backend startup. There is deliberately
**no in-repo deploy script or auto-update poller** — see
[Updating](#updating) below for the full rationale
([ADR-0018](docs/adr/0018-deploy-path-is-noc-fleet-deployer.md)).

All containers have healthchecks and `restart: unless-stopped`, so individual services auto-recover from crashes. The backend retries DB and Redis connections on startup to handle restart race conditions.

### Personalize it

After logging in, go to **Settings > Branding** to set your company name, tagline, website, and contact email. These appear on PDF reports, emails, the login page, and customer-facing pages.

- Stripe webhook automatically marks invoices paid in the operator's financial dashboard
- Operator generates client access links from the mission detail page

### Authentication & Security
- JWT access tokens (configurable expiration, default 30 min)
- Refresh token rotation (configurable, default 30 days)
- Secure password hashing via bcrypt 4.x (direct, no passlib wrapper)
- All API endpoints require authentication
- Admin account seeded on first startup only — password never overwritten on restart
- PostgreSQL advisory lock prevents race conditions during seed
- Single-worker uvicorn for consistent async behavior
- Explicit commit + read-back verification on password changes

**Optional: Cloudflare Access SSO for the operator login (off by default).** If you put the
operator surface behind Cloudflare Access, the app can verify the `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion`
itself rather than trusting the perimeter — RS256 against your team's JWKS, with `iss`, `aud`,
`exp` (30 s skew), key selection bound to the token's `kid`, and an e-mail allow-list. It is
**inert unless you set both `CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` and `CF_ACCESS_AUD`**; until you do, the
verifier never runs, no network call is made, and `POST /api/auth/sso-exchange` answers `404`.

- `POST /api/auth/sso-exchange` trades a verified assertion for the same token pair
  `/api/auth/login` returns, so an SSO-only operator can still obtain a bearer for any route
  your Access policy *bypasses*.
- `LOCAL_LOGIN_DISABLED=true` (default `false`) retires the password entirely: `login`,
  `setup`, `account` and `refresh` return `403`. Nothing is deleted — set it back to `false`
  and redeploy to restore password login. **`docker compose restart` does not re-read the
  environment; use `up -d`.**
- `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_USERNAMES` is a comma-separated exemption from that `403` for non-interactive
  machine accounts, which cannot hold an Access cookie. The exemption is from the `403` and
  **nothing else** — the password, the lockout and the `is_active` check all still run.
- **Self-hosted, OSS and demo installs are unaffected by all of the above by construction**:
  both Access variables are empty and `LOCAL_LOGIN_DISABLED` is `false` in the shipped
  `docker-compose.yml` and `.env.example`.

Design notes and the two production outages that shaped it:
`docs/adr/0047-operator-cloudflare-access-sso.md` (five amendments) and
`docs/adr/0048-service-account-allowlist-and-sso-bearer-exchange.md`.

## Architecture

| Service | Technology | Port | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|------|---------|
| Frontend | React 18 + Vite + Mantine UI | 3080 (nginx) | SPA web interface |
| Backend | Python 3.12, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0 | 8000 | REST API |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 Alpine | 5434:5432 (bound to `127.0.0.1` + `10.99.0.1`, never `0.0.0.0`) | Persistent storage with replication support |
| Flight Parser | Rust (axum) microservice | 8100 | DJI/Litchi/Airdata flight log decryption and parsing |
| LLM | Ollama (Llama 3.1 8B Instruct `q4_K_M` default) or Claude API | 11434 | AI report generation |
| Queue | Redis 7 Alpine | 6379 | Celery task broker |
| Worker | Celery (same backend image) | — | Async report generation |
| Cloudflared | cloudflare/cloudflared | — | Secure tunnel (optional) |

### PostgreSQL Streaming Replication

On BarnardHQ's own deployment the primary runs on **BOS-HQ (10.99.0.4)** as the
container `droneops-standby-db` (a promoted former standby — the name is
historical), and it streams WAL to a standby on **CHAD-HQ (10.99.0.2)**,
`application_name=chad_hq_standby`. Verified live 2026-09-21. This provides:

- **Hot standby** — read-only replica available for failover
- **Continuous WAL shipping** — changes stream in real-time to the standby
- **Replication user** — dedicated `replicator` role with `REPLICATION` privileges
- **Managed by NOC** — replication health monitored by NOC Master's continuous replication monitor (30s checks, auto-recovery)

The primary entrypoint script (`scripts/primary-entrypoint.sh`) configures `pg_hba.conf` for replication access and WAL sender settings.

> **Note on `docker-compose.standby.yml` / `scripts/init-standby.sh`:** both still
> describe the **pre-2026-04-20 topology** (primary on CHAD-HQ, standby on HSH-HQ)
> and their `10.99.0.2` primary address is the old one. The direction inverted
> during the HSH→BOS migration. Set the primary host to the real primary before
> using either on a fresh standby; the files carry the same warning in their
> headers.

### Map basemap providers

All map tiles come from one registry — `frontend/src/lib/basemaps.ts` — rendered
by `<BasemapLayers/>`. No page holds a tile URL, so changing provider is a
one-line edit. Decision and the risks accepted:
[ADR-0046](docs/adr/0046-keyless-basemap-registry-and-tile-health-probe.md);
provider comparison: `docs/reports/2026-09-21-basemap-provider-eval.md`.

| Layer set | Provider | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Dark** (default) | Esri `Canvas/World_Dark_Gray_Base` + `Reference/World_Transportation` | Keyless. Base has real data to z16, the roads/labels overlay to z19 — which is what keeps street detail crisp at drone zoom while the backdrop upsamples. |
| **Satellite** | Esri `World_Imagery` | Keyless, real data to z19. |
| **Hybrid** | Imagery + `World_Boundaries_and_Places` + `World_Transportation` | Place names and roads over satellite. |
| **Street** | OpenStreetMap standard | User-selectable only, never the default — the OSMF Tile Usage Policy allows human-driven viewing, not bulk or pre-emptive fetching. |

No API key, no account, no cost. Esri serves `{z}/{y}/{x}`; OSM serves
`{z}/{x}/{y}` — a transposed template returns a real tile of somewhere else.
Neither provider offers an `@2x` retina variant, and `maxNativeZoom` values are
measured rather than taken from the services' advertised LOD.

Both providers require attribution, which every map renders. The backend report
renderer (`app/services/map_renderer.py`) fetches OSM server-side and sends
`DroneOpsCommand/<version> (+https://droneops.barnardhq.com; bill@barnardhq.com)`
as required by the policy.

**Tile-health probe.** A weekly Celery task fetches one fixed tile per provider
and compares two perceptual hashes and the byte size against a checked-in
baseline. This exists because the provider this replaced (CARTO) started serving
tiles with an "API KEY REQUIRED" watermark burned into the pixels while still
returning HTTP 200 with correct headers — a failure no status check, retry
handler or cache can see. Inspect it at
`GET /api/admin/basemap/tile-health`; run it on demand with
`POST /api/admin/basemap/tile-health/run`. ntfy alerting is wired but ships
**off** (`basemap_probe_ntfy_enabled`) until the thresholds are tuned against
real data — ROADMAP MP-2.

## Configuration

All settings are configured via environment variables in the `.env` file.

### Database
| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `POSTGRES_USER` | `doc` | PostgreSQL username |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | *(no default — required)* | PostgreSQL password. Per ADR-0012 compose interpolates this with `:?`, so the containers refuse to start if it is unset. |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | `doc` | Database name |
| `DATABASE_URL` | *(no default — required)* | Full async connection string, e.g. `postgresql+asyncpg://doc:<pw>@db:5432/doc`. Also `:?`-guarded in compose. |

### Authentication
| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | *(no default — required)* | Signs every access/refresh token. `:?`-guarded in compose per ADR-0012 — the stack will not start without it. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| `JWT_ALGORITHM` | `HS256` | Token signing algorithm |
| `JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` | `30` | Access token lifetime |
| `JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS` | `30` | Refresh token lifetime |

> **Note:** Admin credentials are created via the first-run setup wizard in the browser. There are no `ADMIN_USERNAME`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables.

### Integrations
| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OPENDRONELOG_URL` | *(empty)* | Your OpenDroneLog server URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.50:8080`) |

| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | `http://ollama:11434` | Ollama API endpoint |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | `llama3.1:8b-instruct-q4_K_M` | Ollama model for report generation. **Must match what `ollama-setup` pulls** (same value in `docker-compose.yml`) — point it at a model that was never pulled and report generation fails with a model-not-found error. |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | `ollama` | Active LLM provider: `ollama` or `claude` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | *(empty)* | Anthropic API key (required when `LLM_PROVIDER=claude`) |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Anthropic model id used when `LLM_PROVIDER=claude`. Override to pin or bump; do not hardcode model ids in service modules. |

### Email (SMTP)
| Variable | Default | Description |

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | *(empty)* | Stripe secret key for payment processing |
| `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | *(empty)* | Stripe publishable key (exposed to frontend) |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | *(empty)* | Stripe webhook signing secret |

### Networking
| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `FRONTEND_URL` | `http://localhost:3080` | Public URL used in intake emails and client portal links |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` | `3080` | Host port for the frontend. Use `127.0.0.1:3080` to restrict to localhost when behind a tunnel |
| `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN` | *(empty)* | Cloudflare Tunnel token for secure remote access without opening ports |

### Trusted-proxy IP resolution (ADR-0045)
Every rate limiter and the login lockout resolve the real caller through
`backend/app/utils/client_ip.py`. `X-Forwarded-For` is honoured **only** when the
direct peer is a trusted proxy — never blindly.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOSTNAME` | `frontend,cloudflared` | Comma-separated Docker Compose service names, each resolved via Docker's embedded DNS on every check. The default matches this compose file's real two-hop chain (cloudflared → nginx → uvicorn) and needs no operator action. Managed tenants must set `caddy` instead — see [docs/managed-hosting.md](docs/managed-hosting.md). |
| `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` | *(empty)* | Optional additional comma-separated IPs/CIDRs to trust, for a proxy hop that cannot be resolved by hostname from this container's network. |

### Customer-facing links
| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TOS_SIGNED_DOWNLOAD_EXPIRE_DAYS` | `730` | How long a customer's signed-TOS download link stays valid after acceptance. Bounded but durable — it used to be unbounded. |
| `INTAKE_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS` | `7` | Lifetime of a customer intake link. |
| `CLIENT_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS` | `30` | Lifetime of a client-portal access link. |
| `GOOGLE_REVIEW_URL` | BarnardHQ's `g.page` link | Review CTA on the final-invoice PDF, report-delivery email, post-payment portal state and payment-received email. Unset = the CTAs hide themselves. Change this for your own deployment. |

### Operator locale
| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OPERATOR_TIMEZONE` | `America/Los_Angeles` | Defines the *calendar date* of a flight (ADR-0017). A flight's instant is stored in UTC; its date is the date in this zone. Evening Pacific flights otherwise roll to the next UTC day. |

### Managed instance (BarnardHQ-hosted tier only)
| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MANAGED_INSTANCE` | `false` | `true` enables the managed gates (setup wizard skipped, LLM locked to Claude). |
| `CLIENT_ID` | *(empty)* | Tenant identifier surfaced on the health endpoint. |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | *(empty)* | Auto-provisioned admin for managed instances **only**. A self-hosted install creates its admin through the first-run setup wizard and ignores these. |

### Demo mode (`docker-compose.demo.yml` only)
| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DEMO_MODE` | `false` | Enables the demo guard middleware and the demo banner. |
| `DEMO_ADMIN_USERNAME` / `DEMO_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | *(empty)* | Demo admin seeded on boot. |
| `DEMO_RESET_INTERVAL_HOURS` | `24` | **Read but unimplemented** — nothing in the app acts on it. `scripts/demo-nightly-reset.sh` on a crontab is the real reset. |

### Alerting and watchdogs (optional)
| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NTFY_DRONEOPS_PUBLISHER_TOKEN` | *(empty)* | Publisher token for self-hosted ntfy (fleet ADR-0036). Unset = watchdogs still log, alerts just do not go out. |
| `DEVICE_SILENCE_HOURS` | `48` | A device key active recently but silent this long raises an alert. |
| `DEVICE_SILENCE_ACTIVITY_WINDOW_DAYS` | `7` | How recently a key must have been used to be considered active. |
| `DEVICE_SILENCE_DEDUP_HOURS` | `12` | Per-key alert cooldown so a long outage does not spam. |

### Observability (optional)
All DSN/endpoint-gated — unset means no-op. A single-tenant self-hosted install can ignore this block.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SENTRY_DSN` | *(empty)* | Sentry/GlitchTip DSN for the backend + Celery worker. |
| `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` | `production` | Environment tag. |
| `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` | `0.05` | Trace sampling. |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | *(empty)* | OTLP/gRPC collector endpoint. |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | `droneops-api` | Service name on emitted spans. |
| `ENV` / `TENANT` | `prod` / `shared` | Stamped on logs, traces and the Sentry environment. |
| `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` / `VITE_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` | *(empty)* / `production` | Frontend Sentry — **build-time only**, read by Vite at `npm run build`. |

> Since v2.92.1 the **Sentry release tag** on both halves comes from the bumped
> source files (`backend/app/version.py` and `frontend/package.json`), not from
> the `APP_VERSION` env var. The `APP_VERSION` / `VITE_APP_VERSION` compose
> defaults are cosmetic.

### Replication
| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `REPLICATION_PASSWORD` | *(no default — required)* | Password for the PostgreSQL replication user. Set in your `.env`; per ADR-0012 there is no fallback default and containers will refuse to start if this is unset. |

### Storage
| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `UPLOAD_DIR` | `/data/uploads` | Mission image storage path |
| `REPORTS_DIR` | `/data/reports` | Generated PDFs and map images |

### LLM Provider Selection
Two LLM providers are supported, configurable from the Settings page or via environment variables:

| Provider | Model | Where it runs | When to use |
|----------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Ollama** (default) | Llama 3.1 8B Instruct `q4_K_M` | Local, on your hardware | Data stays on-premises, no API costs |
| **Claude API** | Claude Sonnet | Anthropic cloud | Faster, higher-quality reports, requires API key |

Set `LLM_PROVIDER=claude` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` to use Claude, or switch providers in Settings at runtime.

### Ollama Performance Tuning
The `docker-compose.yml` pins Ollama to 6 CPU cores (`cpuset: "0-5"`, leaving 2 for the OS and database), sets an 8 GB RAM reservation with a 10 GB hard cap, enables flash attention, serves one request at a time (`OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=1`, `OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=1`) and keeps the model loaded permanently (`OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=-1`). The image is pinned to `ollama/ollama:0.23.2` — not `:latest` — so a patch is an explicit edit.

---

## Updating

### Updating the application

```bash
git pull --ff-only
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps                  # confirm healthy
```

Compose rebuilds only the services whose build context changed, and database
migrations run automatically on backend startup — there is no separate migrate
step.

There is deliberately **no in-repo auto-deploy poller.** An earlier
`autopull.sh` + `droneops-autopull.timer` + `update.sh` arrangement was removed
([ADR-0018](docs/adr/0018-deploy-path-is-noc-fleet-deployer.md)): `autopull.sh`
still invoked the already-deleted `update.sh`, so the repo advertised two deploy
paths while one of them was a corpse. That cost real debugging time. If you want
polling-based CD on a self-hosted install, drive it from outside the repo (a
systemd timer of your own, a CI runner, or a webhook) rather than reintroducing
a second in-repo path.

### Base image updates

There is **no Watchtower sidecar.** It was removed on 2026-06-05 (fleet ADR-0088):
an auto-updater on a deployer-managed host is a second, uncoordinated deploy
path. Base images (`postgres:16-alpine`, `redis:7-alpine`, `ollama/ollama:0.23.2`,
`cloudflare/cloudflared`) are **pinned in `docker-compose.yml` on purpose** —
bump the tag in the file, then `docker compose up -d --build`. Self-hosters who
want automatic base-image updates should run that tooling outside this repo.

---

## Pages & Workflows

### Dashboard (`/`)
Landing page with mission stats, recent missions table, real-time weather conditions, METAR aviation data, FAA TFR/NOTAM alerts, NWS weather alerts, and flight condition assessment.

### Missions (`/missions`)
List all missions with status badges (Draft/Completed/Sent), billable indicators, search, and quick actions (edit, delete). Click a row to view mission details.

### Creating and editing a mission

A mission is **created from the inline modal behind the "New Mission" button on
`/missions`** — there is no standalone create page. Editing is per-section from
the mission hub at `/missions/:id`, not a linear wizard:

| Route | Step |
|---|---|
| `/missions/:id/details/edit` | Customer, title, type, date, location, description, billable toggle, lead source, UNAS folder path, download link URL with expiration |
| `/missions/:id/flights/edit` | Browse/attach flights, assign aircraft per flight, view flight map and coverage area |
| `/missions/:id/images/edit` | Upload mission photos (drag-and-drop or file picker), auto-resized and EXIF-corrected |
| `/missions/:id/report/edit` | Operator narrative, LLM report generation, rich-text editing, PDF, email to customer |
| `/missions/:id/invoice/edit` | Line items from rate templates or manually, quantities, rates, tax, paid/unpaid |
| `/missions/:id/edit-legacy` | The old 5-stage wizard, kept reachable |

`/missions/new` and `/missions/:id/edit` are **soft redirects** since v2.67.0 —
they show a toast and bounce to `/missions` and `/missions/:id` respectively, so
old operator bookmarks still land somewhere sensible.

### Mission Detail (`/missions/:id`)
Full mission view with metadata, assigned aircraft cards, interactive flight map, coverage stats, download link status, report content, and action buttons (edit, delete, generate PDF, email report).

### Flights (`/flights`)
Flight library with aggregate statistics, per-drone breakdowns, top flights, sortable/searchable table, and a detail drawer with interactive GPS flight path map, telemetry data, and export options (GPX/KML/CSV). Flight Replay button for flights with GPS tracks.

### Flight Replay (`/flights/:id/replay`)
Animated GPS flight path playback with altitude-colored trail, drone marker with heading, live telemetry sidebar (altitude, speed, heading, position), flight stats, and playback controls (play/pause, speed, scrub). One-click video export renders the full replay as a downloadable WebM video with map, flight path, and telemetry overlay.

### Upload Logs (`/upload-logs`)
Drag-and-drop flight log upload with folder support. Batched uploads for large file sets. Progress tracking per file with duplicate detection and error reporting.

### Telemetry (`/telemetry`)
Time-series telemetry visualization with altitude, speed, battery, satellites, signal, and distance-from-home charts. Auto-downsampled for smooth rendering.

### Airspace (`/airspace`)
Live aircraft tracking via OpenSky Network. Works anonymously or with credentials for better rate limits. Configurable location and search radius.

### Batteries (`/batteries`)
Battery fleet management with serial numbers, cycle counts, health tracking, and per-battery flight history.

### Maintenance (`/maintenance`)
Maintenance scheduling and logging per aircraft. Custom maintenance types, photo attachments, and due-date tracking.

### Customers (`/customers`)
Customer CRM with add/edit/delete, address auto-complete via OpenStreetMap geocoding, digital intake forms with TOS signature capture, and search.

### Financials (`/financials`)
Revenue dashboard with total/average/outstanding metrics, breakdowns by drone, category, mission type, month, and customer. Full invoice table with search.

### TOS Acceptances (`/tos-acceptances`)
Admin view of every captured Terms-of-Service acceptance: who signed, when, and
a link to the stored signed PDF with its SHA-256 anchor.

### First-run setup
Not a route — the app renders the setup wizard in place of every authenticated
page while no users exist, then the login screen. It creates the initial admin
account. To reset: `docker compose exec backend python reset_to_setup.py`.

### Public routes (no operator login)

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/intake/:token` | Tokenized customer intake form |
| `/tos/accept` | Terms-of-Service acceptance (typed name + checkbox → AcroForm-filled PDF) |
| `/client/:token` | Client portal — mission list + invoices, opened from a signed link |
| `/client/login` | Optional password login for repeat clients |
| `/client/mission/:missionId` | Client-facing mission detail |

Client portal authentication is a separate scope from the operator UI.

### Settings (`/settings`)
System configuration across multiple tabs:
- **LLM** — Provider selection (Ollama or Claude API), connection status, loaded model, API key configuration
- **Flight Data** — OpenSky Network credentials, DJI API key, OpenDroneLog server URL with connection test
- **SMTP** — Email server configuration with test email
- **Payment Links** — PayPal and Venmo URLs for invoices
- **Stripe** — Stripe API keys for client portal payments
- **Home Location** — Coordinates for weather, airspace, and METAR data
- **Aircraft Fleet** — Add/edit/delete aircraft with specifications
- **Pilots** — Add/edit/delete pilot profiles with certifications and flight hour tracking
- **Rate Templates** — Add/edit/delete billing rate presets
- **Device Keys** — API key management for DroneOpsSync companion app
- **Backup** — Database export and restore
- **Branding** — Company name, tagline, website, social media, contact email — used in PDF reports, emails, login page, and customer-facing pages

## Backend Services

### PDF Generator
Renders branded PDF reports from Jinja2 HTML templates via WeasyPrint. Includes mission metadata, report narrative, flight path map, aircraft specs, mission images, invoice with line items and totals, payment links, and optional download link.

### Email Service
Async SMTP client that sends HTML emails with the PDF report attached. Loads configuration from database settings first, falls back to environment variables. Supports TLS.

### LLM Provider Service
Dual-provider LLM client supporting Ollama and Claude API. The active provider is selectable from Settings or via `LLM_PROVIDER` env var.

- **Ollama** — HTTP client to the `/api/generate` endpoint. Sends a structured prompt with mission data, flight telemetry, and operator notes. Temperature 0.3 for consistency, 300s timeout, 6 CPU threads.
- **Claude API** — Anthropic SDK client, model from `CLAUDE_MODEL` (default `claude-sonnet-4-6`). Same structured prompt, cloud-processed. Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

### OpenDroneLog Client
REST client that fetches flight data from a self-hosted OpenDroneLog instance. Handles multiple API endpoint patterns for version compatibility. Normalizes field names between camelCase and snake_case. Extracts GPS tracks for map rendering.

### Map Renderer
Generates GeoJSON FeatureCollections with flight path LineStrings, start/end markers, and convex hull polygons. Calculates coverage area in acres using UTM projection and Shapely geometry with configurable buffer distance. Renders static PNG maps using OpenStreetMap tiles, sending an identifying User-Agent per the OSMF Tile Usage Policy.

### Flight Parser Service
Standalone **Rust** (axum) microservice on port 8100 that decrypts and parses DJI flight logs using the DJI Cloud API, plus Litchi and Airdata CSV exports. `GET /health` reports its own crate version — the only reliable confirmation that a parser deploy landed. Extracts GPS tracks, telemetry time-series, drone metadata, and battery information from encrypted TXT log files.

### Airspace Service
Proxies requests to the OpenSky Network API for real-time aircraft position data. Supports anonymous and OAuth2-authenticated modes. Converts search radius to bounding box coordinates and normalizes the response into a clean aircraft list.

### Weather Service
Aggregates data from 4 external APIs: Open-Meteo (current conditions), AviationWeather.gov (METAR, TFRs), aviationapi.com (NOTAMs fallback), and NWS (weather alerts). Location configurable from Settings.

---

## API Reference

Full interactive API documentation is available at `http://localhost:3080/docs` (Swagger UI) when the app is running — nginx proxies `/docs`, `/redoc` and `/openapi.json` straight to the backend. The table below is a curated subset; `/openapi.json` is the complete, authoritative list.

## Roadmap

### Next — Multi-Tenant Managed Hosting

Transform DroneOpsCommand from a self-hosted tool into a revenue-generating SaaS product. The self-hosted open-source path remains for operators who want it — managed hosting is the commercial tier.

**Tenant Architecture**
- Schema-per-tenant isolation in PostgreSQL. Each tenant gets their own schema with identical table structures.
- Tenant provisioning API: signup → subdomain claim → payment → automatic schema creation and admin user seeding.
- JWT tenant claims with schema routing middleware. Every authenticated request resolves to the correct tenant schema.
- CI test coverage verifying tenant A cannot read tenant B's data under any code path.

**Billing & Licensing**
- Stripe subscription integration: plan tiers with mission limits, user seat limits, and storage quotas.
- Stripe Checkout hosted page for signup — no custom payment frontend required.
- Stripe Customer Portal for self-service plan changes, payment method updates, and invoice history.
- Webhook-driven plan enforcement: upgrade/downgrade/cancel reflected in tenant configuration automatically.
- Stripe Tax add-on for US sales tax compliance.

**AI Processing (Cloud Offload)**
- Managed tenants use cloud LLM (Anthropic or OpenAI API) instead of local Ollama.
- Per-tenant API key configuration with model selection.
- Celery queue hardening: retry logic, dead letter queue, per-tenant job isolation, queue depth monitoring.
- SLA-aware job priority to prevent report generation backlog across tenants.

**Infrastructure**
- Application servers behind a load balancer with subdomain-based tenant routing.
- Managed PostgreSQL with automated backups.
- S3-compatible object storage for mission images, reports, and deliverables (per-tenant path prefixes).
- Signed URLs for secure file delivery.
- Redis for Celery broker and session caching.

**Pricing Tiers (Planned)**
- Starter — limited missions/month, 1 user, cloud AI reports, email support.
- Professional — higher limits, multi-user with RBAC, priority report generation, UNAS integration.
- Enterprise — unlimited, custom branding, dedicated support, SLA.

---

### Planned — Additional Features

- **Thermal Inspection Report Engine** — Ingest DJI radiometric RJPEG thermal imagery, auto-detect hotspot anomalies via configurable temperature delta thresholds and OpenCV contour detection, annotate visual images with bounding boxes, GPS coordinates, and measured temperatures, and generate branded PDF inspection reports. Plugs into the existing Celery/WeasyPrint report pipeline as a thermal-specific report template. Industry-configurable severity presets (solar/NETA electrical/roofing).
- **Multi-User / Role-Based Access** — Admin and Operator roles at minimum. Foundation for teams and the multi-tenant SaaS tier. Implement before schema changes get harder.
- **Notification System** — Email and in-app alerts for overdue invoices, upcoming maintenance, battery cycle limits, certificate expirations, and completed report generation.
- **Report Template Library** — Multiple PDF templates for different mission types. Inspection reports, SAR after-action reports, videography delivery summaries. Operator-buildable custom templates. LLM prompt adapts per template type.
- **Airspace Pre-Check Workflow** — Drop a pin before mission creation and get a pre-flight airspace assessment: LAANC status, nearby TFRs, Class B/C/D proximity. Uses existing weather/FAA API infrastructure.
- ~~**Claude API Integration**~~ — **Done.** Switchable from Settings or via `LLM_PROVIDER=claude` env var.
- **React Native Android App** — Mission creation, photo capture on-site, report review, and customer lookup from the field. Communicates with the stack via JWT-authenticated HTTPS API.
- **Voice-to-Text** — On-device speech recognition in the Android app for dictating operator field notes hands-free during or after missions.
- **DroneOpsSync Deep Integration** — Field-captured photos auto-upload to the correct mission. Field notes from the controller pre-populate report narrative. JWT API is already in place.
- **Public API & Webhooks** — Let third-party tools (dispatch software, QuickBooks, project management) integrate with Command. Webhooks on mission status changes, invoice payment, and report delivery.
- **Public Demo Instance** — **Live** at [command-demo.barnardhq.com](https://command-demo.barnardhq.com) with pre-loaded sample data, sandboxed operations (demo guard middleware), demo-mode banner with "Deploy Your Own" CTA, and a **nightly reset at 02:23 PT** (`scripts/demo-nightly-reset.sh` from the BOS-HQ operator crontab, line `23 2 * * *`; hosts run `America/Los_Angeles` since 2026-08-25, so that is local time — older docs saying "09:23 UTC" and this line's former "24-hour auto-reset" are both stale). `DEMO_RESET_INTERVAL_HOURS` is configured but **unimplemented** — the script is the reset, because the demo worker and beat must stay stopped (dunning-email hazard, ADR-0042). The demo is **not** deployer-managed: `~/droneops-demo` on BOS-HQ is updated by hand. See `docker-compose.demo.yml` for deployment config. **Always start the demo via `./bootstrap.sh`** — never `docker compose up -d` directly. The bootstrap script validates `.env.demo` before compose runs, so a missing or incomplete env file produces a clear error instead of silently falling back to default credentials (the failure mode that caused a 6h+ outage on 2026-04-16).
