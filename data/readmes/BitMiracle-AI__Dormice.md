**The SQLite of agent sandboxes** — a self-hosted sandbox platform for AI agents. One machine or a fleet of them, sandboxes that live forever, idle costs nothing.

> **Status: early development.** The daemon, its lifecycle engine, the SDK, the CLI, the web console, the real Docker + gVisor executor, the S3 archiver, and the E2B-compatible API work end to end — the full create → freeze → stop → archive → restore cycle, command execution, file I/O, and the official `e2b` SDK against real infrastructure. Nothing here is ready for production yet.

## The idea

Cloud sandbox platforms charge for every second a sandbox exists, so their sandboxes are disposable. Dormice inverts that: you run it on a machine you already pay for, and sandboxes are **permanent** — they just get cheaper to keep the longer they sit idle.

- **`acquireSandbox(userKey)` is the entire mental model.** Idempotent: the same key always comes back to the same sandbox, whatever state it was in. No sandbox → create; frozen → wake; stopped → start; archived → restore.
- **Idle is free.** Sandboxes cool down on their own — `active → frozen → stopped → archived` — one rung at a time, and any acquire brings them back. Measured on real hardware: freezing takes an idle sandbox holding 1 GiB down to ~5 MiB of resident memory, and waking it takes ~50 ms.
- **Deploys like a single binary.** One daemon, one SQLite ledger, one port. No Kubernetes, no external database.
- **[E2B compatible](#e2b-compatibility)**: the official `e2b` SDK works against Dormice by changing two URLs.

## Install

One command on a bare Ubuntu/Debian x86_64 host (as root):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BitMiracle-AI/Dormice/main/deploy/install.sh | bash
```

Behind a slow connection to the usual sources, add `-s -- --mirror cn`.
The installer is idempotent — re-running it upgrades the code and repairs
drift, and never rotates your API token. It ends by running `dor doctor`,
a battery of read-only checks — three of them boot a real gVisor
container — that decides whether the install actually succeeded;
`dor doctor` can be re-run on its own at any time.

A second machine joins the same fleet with one more command
(`--role node --gateway http://<first machine>:80`, the token in the
environment) and needs no settings of its own; upgrades then run from
the gateway, one node at a time. See the
[installation](website/content/docs/installation.mdx) and
[upgrading](website/content/docs/upgrading.mdx) docs.

## Quick start

`@dormice/sdk` is the native TypeScript client. (Not on npm yet — the
first release is queued; inside this repo, `pnpm build` produces it.)

```ts
import { Dormice } from '@dormice/sdk';

const client = new Dormice({
  endpoint: 'http://127.0.0.1:3677',
  token: process.env.DORMICE_API_TOKEN!,
});

// One key, one sandbox — created, woken or restarted as needed.
// stopAfterSeconds: null makes it a resident agent: it may freeze when
// idle (~50 ms to wake) but never cold-starts.
await client.acquireSandbox('my-agent', { policy: { stopAfterSeconds: null } });

const result = await client.execCommand('my-agent', 'python3 -c "print(6 * 7)"');
console.log(result.exitCode, result.stdout); // 0 42

await client.writeFiles('my-agent', [
  { path: 'notes.txt', content: 'survives freeze and stop' },
]);

await client.destroySandbox('my-agent'); // destroy — the only verb that loses data
```

The wire is plain HTTP RPC (`POST /acquireSandbox`, `POST /execCommand`, …),
so `curl` works where the SDK doesn't reach, and the `dor` CLI covers the
operator side: `dor sandbox ls / exec / push / pull / rebuild / destroy`,
plus `dor doctor`. The full native surface is documented in
[`packages/sdk`](packages/sdk/README.md), and runnable versions of these
flows live in [`examples/`](examples/).

## Agent skill

Dormice's users are agents, so the manual comes in a form an agent can
install — a skill in the open [Agent Skills](https://skills.sh) format:

```sh
npx skills add BitMiracle-AI/Dormice
```

One file, [`skills/dormice/SKILL.md`](skills/dormice/SKILL.md), teaching a
coding agent the whole surface: how to connect, pick between the E2B SDKs /
native API / CLI, run commands, move files, and set lifecycle policy. The
documentation site is AI-readable too — its build emits `/llms.txt`,
`/llms-full.txt`, and a plain-markdown `.md` twin of every docs page.

## E2B compatibility

The daemon speaks the E2B protocol on two prefixes (`/e2b/api`,
`/e2b/envd`). The **official `e2b` package** — unmodified, straight from
npm — runs against Dormice with two URLs and an API-key prefix; migrating
an application is configuration, not code:

```ts
import { Sandbox } from 'e2b';

const sbx = await Sandbox.create({
  apiKey: `e2b_${process.env.DORMICE_API_TOKEN}`,
  apiUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1:3677/e2b/api',
  sandboxUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1:3677/e2b/envd',
});
```

Everything below is exercised by the black-box e2e suite *through the
official package*, and has passed against a real Docker + gVisor daemon:

| Surface | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `Sandbox.create` / `connect` / `kill` / `list` | `list` filters by state and metadata, and paginates |
| Timeouts | `timeoutMs` and `setTimeout()` are real absolute deadlines; `lifecycle: { onTimeout: 'pause' }` parks the sandbox instead of killing it |
| `pause()` / resume | explicit pause; `connect` revives it, files intact |
| `commands.run` | live streaming (`onStdout` / `onStderr`), background + `connect` / `disconnect`, `sendStdin`, `kill`, `list`, per-command `envs`, `user: 'root'`; a non-zero exit raises the SDK's own `CommandExitError` |
| `pty.*` | `create` / `sendInput` / `resize` / `kill` — a real interactive bash |
| `files` read / write | text or bytes, streamed, no artificial size cap — the disk quota is the cap |
| `uploadUrl()` / `downloadUrl()` | signed URLs: expiry enforced, a tampered signature is a 401 |
| `files.list` / `exists` / `makeDir` / `rename` / `remove` | typed errors match the SDK's expectations |
| `files.watchDir` | streamed events, and the polling watcher API the Python sync SDK uses |
| `getHost(port)` | port proxy with wake-on-traffic (set `DORMICE_SANDBOX_DOMAIN`) |
| `getMetrics()` | one live sample; observing never wakes a frozen sandbox |

Deliberate deltas from the hosted product:

- **No template builds.** Templates are named images: build one with
  docker, register it with `dor template add`, and `Sandbox.create('name')`
  resolves it (an unregistered name is an honest 404). The hosted
  product's build pipeline (`e2b template build`) is not implemented.
- **Freezing keeps processes.** A frozen sandbox's processes suspend and
  resume mid-flight — any touch wakes the sandbox in ~50 ms.
- **Permanence stays the default.** Sandboxes created through the E2B
  surface get real deadlines, as E2B semantics demand; deadlines are never
  imposed on natively created sandboxes.
- **`metadata.externalId`** turns `Sandbox.create` into Dormice's idempotent
  acquire: the same key returns the same sandbox instead of a new one.
- **Not implemented**, answered with an honest `unimplemented` on the
  wire: `Process/StreamInput` (the JS SDK never calls it) and xattr-based
  file metadata. The daemon reports envd `0.6.1`, so the SDK itself gates
  those features client-side.

## Web console

The gateway — the fleet's front door, installed beside the daemon — serves
a small web console at `http://127.0.0.1:3677/console`: sign in with the
API token once and it becomes an httpOnly session cookie; the token itself
is never stored anywhere the page can read. The console
shows every sandbox with its live lifecycle state (the same
`/listSandboxes` the SDK sees), opens a per-sandbox detail view, creates
sandboxes (the same idempotent `acquire`, with the lifecycle knobs),
releases them, and has a Connect page with copy-paste snippets for every
client (E2B SDK, native SDK, CLI) pointed at your own endpoint.

Both processes listen on 127.0.0.1 only (the gateway on 3677, the daemon
on 3676), so reaching them from another machine is a choice you make
explicitly, one of two ways:

- **SSH tunnel** (private, zero setup):
  `ssh -L 3677:127.0.0.1:3677 root@host`, then open
  `http://127.0.0.1:3677/console`.
- **Reverse proxy** for the console, the API, and the E2B surface at once —
  e.g. Caddy pointed at the gateway, which also handles TLS certificates
  automatically once you give it a domain:

  ```
  your-domain.example {
  	reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3677 {
  		flush_interval -1
  	}
  }
  ```

  `flush_interval -1` matters: streamed command output is written frame by
  frame, and a buffering proxy would turn it into one lump at the end.
  Anything exposed beyond localhost should be HTTPS — the API token and the
  session cookie travel in every request.

## Cold archive (S3, optional)

Configure a store in the console's settings page — or seed the four
`DORMICE_S3_*` variables in the gateway's env (`/etc/dormice/gateway.env`)
— and idle sandboxes take the last step down: a week after stopping (tunable per sandbox via
`archiveAfterSeconds`), the disk is packed with `tar` + `zstd`, shipped to
any S3-compatible bucket (AWS, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, Alibaba OSS in
S3-compat mode), and freed locally. The next `acquireSandbox` answers
`{ status: 'restoring', progress }` immediately and flips to `ready` once
the disk is back — slow wake-ups are honest, never a silent hang.

```sh
DORMICE_S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.example.com   # full URL; MinIO speaks http
DORMICE_S3_BUCKET=dormice-archive
DORMICE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
DORMICE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
# DORMICE_S3_REGION=us-east-1
# DORMICE_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true           # MinIO needs this
```

Unset, the feature is honestly absent: sandboxes park at `stopped`
forever, and a policy asking to archive is refused rather than silently
stored. The bucket must exist; the host needs `zstd` (`install.sh`
installs it, `dor doctor` checks it).

## Host prerequisites (docker executor)

The daemon itself runs anywhere Node 22+ runs, with an in-memory fake
executor for development. Running **real** sandboxes needs a Linux host
prepared as above — `install.sh` automates all of it and `dor doctor`
verifies it, but these are the facts underneath:

- **Docker + gVisor (`runsc`)**, and root (loop mounts, cgroup writes).
- **Swap, and `vm.swappiness=100`.** Freezing squeezes an idle sandbox's
  memory out to swap; gVisor holds sandbox memory as shared memory, which
  the kernel refuses to swap at the default swappiness — measured on real
  hardware: 0 bytes reclaimed at the default, 99.5% reclaimed at 100. Note
  that some cloud images (Alibaba Cloud, for one) ship `vm.swappiness=0`;
  check the *effective* value with `sysctl vm.swappiness`, not the config
  files.
- **Network hardening is not optional.** Sandboxes run untrusted code:
  block the cloud metadata service from containers
  (`iptables -I DOCKER-USER -d 169.254.0.0/16 -j DROP`, persisted) and
  disable inter-container traffic (`"icc": false` in `daemon.json`). The
  daemon binds to 127.0.0.1 only, by design without a knob; exposing it is
  a reverse proxy's job.
- **One daemon per machine.** The daemon enforces this with a lock next to
  its ledger and refuses to start when its ledger and the machine's reality
  cannot belong together.

## When Dormice is the wrong tool

Pick something else if:

- **You need sandboxes that move between machines, or a fleet across
  regions.** A fleet is one gateway and the machines on its private
  network — sharded, not distributed, by design: a sandbox lives on the
  machine it was created on, and a node that is down takes its sandboxes
  with it until it is back.
- **You want a managed service.** No hosted anything, no SLA. That is
  E2B's product, and it is good at it.
- **Your threat model demands hardware virtualization.** Sandboxes are
  Docker + gVisor — a userspace kernel, chosen deliberately: freezing
  requires sandboxes to be processes, and "installs anywhere" rules out
  requiring KVM. If only Firecracker-class VM isolation will do, this
  trade is not for you.
- **Your workloads aren't Linux.** Sandboxes are Linux containers.

## Repository layout

pnpm monorepo:

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/shared` | Protocol schemas (zod) — the single source of truth for wire types |
| `packages/server` | The daemon: Fastify + SQLite ledger + lifecycle engine |
| `packages/sdk` | `@dormice/sdk` — TypeScript client for the native API |
| `packages/cli` | `dormice` command-line tool (`dor` for short) |
| `packages/console` | Web console: React SPA, served by the gateway at `/console` |
| `packages/gateway` | The fleet's one door in front of one or more daemons: holds the fleet's settings, templates, API keys and the console; places new sandboxes, finds existing ones by asking the nodes, forwards everything else |
| `e2e` | Black-box suite: boots the built daemon, drives it over the wire |
| `examples` | Runnable demos: the native SDK, the official `e2b` package, a resident agent |

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build      # the e2e suite boots the built daemon, so build comes first
pnpm typecheck
