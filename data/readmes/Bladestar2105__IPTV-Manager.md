## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-User Management**: Support for multiple users with individual channel configurations, secure login, and customizable concurrent stream limits (max connections).
- **Per-User Provider Access**: Administrators can show or hide the upstream provider information and management box per user without removing provider selection or access to that user's channel, movie, series, or EPG mapping lists.
- **Provider Management**: Connect to multiple IPTV providers via Xtream Codes API with automatic connection pooling.
- **Category Organization**: Drag & drop sorting and visual channel assignment.
- **EPG Integration**: Comprehensive Electronic Program Guide (EPG) support with automatic updates.

### Advanced Features
- **Experimental AI Assistant (opt-in)**: Use an OpenAI-compatible API or your own private ChatGPT connection for list editing, name cleanup, duplicate review, EPG suggestions, sync reports, search, diagnostics and description translation/summaries/tags. Both connection options are experimental. List changes require a preview and confirmation, with conflict-aware undo. AI is disabled by default; see [AI setup and operation](docs/AI_INTEGRATION.md).
- **Automatic Synchronization**: Configurable intervals (hourly, daily, weekly) with intelligent category mapping.
- **Provider Connection Pooling**: Add the same provider multiple times to create a pool; streams automatically round-robin and fall back to available accounts when connection limits are reached.
- **HDHomeRun Emulation**: Emulate HDHomeRun devices for seamless integration with Plex, Emby, and Jellyfin.
- **Stalker/MAG (Experimental)**: MAC-authenticated live TV, movies, synchronized series, radio, EPG-backed catch-up, and tokenized playback links.
- **Shared Links**: Create public share links with customizable slugs (short URLs) and expiration dates.
- **Bulk Operations**: Optimized bulk category import and deletion for managing large playlists efficiently.
- **VOD & Series Support**: Full proxy support for Movies and TV Series.
- **Internationalization**: Localized UI (English, German, French, Greek).
- **M3U Playlist Generation**: Generate custom M3U playlists for external players.
- **Import/Export**: Secure, password-protected data migration.
- **User Backups**: Automatically create and manage backups of assigned categories and channels per user.

### Security
- **🛡️ SSRF Protection**: Robust validation of upstream URLs (preventing access to private IPs, localhost, cloud metadata).
- **🔐 Rate Limiting**: Tunable protection for general API traffic, brute force (Login), and DoS attacks (Client Logs).
- **🎫 Secure Authentication**: JWT-based auth with session management and Bcrypt password hashing.
- **🚫 IP Blocking**: Configurable IP blocking and whitelisting.
- **🔒 Security Headers**: Comprehensive Helmet.js security headers.

### Performance
- **🔥 Multi-Core Optimization**: Node.js Clustering utilizes all CPU cores.
- **⚡ Optional Redis**: Shared active-stream tracking across workers or instances.
- **🧵 Worker Threads**: Offloads CPU-intensive tasks like EPG mapping.
- **⚡ Optimized Channel Matching**: Fast channel matching algorithms using bitwise signatures.
- **⚡ Optimized Database Schema**: Optimized indices for faster streaming performance and EPG updates.

## 📋 Requirements
- **Node.js**: 24.x+
- **npm**: 10.x+
- **SQLite**: 3.x (included)
- **MaxMind GeoLite2 License Key**: While basic region locking functions work out of the box with the included database, updating the internal GeoIP database requires a free MaxMind License Key. You can get one at [maxmind.com](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407111582235-Generate-a-License-Key) and enter it in the WebUI Security Settings. On startup, IPTV-Manager checks MaxMind checksums first and only downloads/rebuilds GeoIP data when an update is available.

### Production Deployment
For production environments, it is strongly recommended to set `NODE_ENV=production` and run the application behind a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Traefik) that handles HTTPS. The application will enforce secure cookies when in production mode.

## 🐳 Docker Installation (Recommended)

### Using Docker Compose or Portainer
The standard stack is self-contained and uses Docker's default security profiles.
It supports IPTV management and the experimental AI Assistant with API connections;
it does not require extra files or host setup.

```bash
mkdir -p iptv-manager && cd iptv-manager
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bladestar2105/IPTV-Manager/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

In Portainer (Docker Standalone), paste `docker-compose.yml` into the stack's
**Web editor**. Keep your existing port, environment and `/data` volume mapping
when updating an existing stack. Access `http://localhost:3000`.

**Repair a stack reporting `opening seccomp profile ... no such file or directory`:**
remove the complete `security_opt` block from that stack's editor, set
`AI_CODEX_ENABLED=false`, and update the stack. Leave all data mounts unchanged;
do not delete the stack or its volumes. This restores the standard Docker security
profiles and the ordinary application/API connection path, not personal ChatGPT
connections. An image pull alone cannot fix a missing Compose-side file.

### Personal ChatGPT in Docker
The image already includes the pinned ChatGPT runtime. Its restricted sandbox
also needs a seccomp file accessible to **the process running Compose** and,
on AppArmor hosts, a profile loaded **on the Docker host**. Docker applies these
before starting the container, so putting them inside the image cannot install
them. This optional setup requires host administrator access; Portainer Web
Editor alone is not sufficient. API connections do not need this setup.

From the directory containing `docker-compose.yml`, download the optional overlay
and profiles:

```bash
mkdir -p docker
base=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bladestar2105/IPTV-Manager/main
curl -fsSL "$base/docker-compose.chatgpt.yml" -o docker-compose.chatgpt.yml
curl -fsSL "$base/docker/ai-seccomp.json" -o docker/ai-seccomp.json
curl -fsSL "$base/docker/ai-apparmor" -o docker/ai-apparmor
```

On a Docker host with AppArmor (`docker info` lists it under Security Options),
install and load the named profile **on that Linux host** before starting:

```bash
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0644 docker/ai-apparmor /etc/apparmor.d/iptv-manager-ai
sudo apparmor_parser -r -W /etc/apparmor.d/iptv-manager-ai
```

Keep the host's AppArmor boot service enabled so the installed profile is loaded
again before Docker restarts containers after a reboot.

On a host without AppArmor, remove only `apparmor=iptv-manager-ai` from
`security_opt` in `docker-compose.chatgpt.yml`; keep `seccomp=./docker/ai-seccomp.json`. Do not disable
another host security module. For a remote daemon or a Docker VM, loading a
profile on the client computer is not sufficient.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.chatgpt.yml up -d
docker compose exec -T --user app iptv-manager npm run check:ai-runtime
```

Access `http://localhost:3000`. The check must pass before testing a ChatGPT
link. It makes no sign-in or model request. Existing installations using personal
ChatGPT connections must retain their sandbox profiles and enable this overlay
when updating. See [configuration](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#ai-installation-verification).

## 🔧 Bare Metal / Manual Installation (Debian/Ubuntu)

We provide automated scripts for easy local deployment on Debian and Ubuntu systems. This is ideal for users who do not want to use Docker.

### Automated Installation
To install IPTV-Manager as a background systemd service, run the following command as `root`:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bladestar2105/IPTV-Manager/main/scripts/install.sh -o install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

### Automated Updates
To update an existing automated installation, refresh the updater first, then run it:
```bash
cd /opt/iptv-manager
sudo curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bladestar2105/IPTV-Manager/main/scripts/update.sh -o scripts/update.sh
sudo chmod +x scripts/update.sh
sudo ./scripts/update.sh
```

### Manual Installation (Development)
1.  Clone repo and enter it: `git clone https://github.com/Bladestar2105/IPTV-Manager.git && cd IPTV-Manager`
2.  Install application dependencies: `npm ci`
3.  On Debian/Ubuntu, provision the ChatGPT runtime: `sudo bash scripts/install-ai-runtime.sh`
4.  Configure: `cp .env.example .env` (edit as needed)
5.  As the non-root application user, run `npm run check:ai-runtime`, then `npm start`.

The automated installer and updater perform this provisioning and check for
you, preserving explicit disable settings. A failed ChatGPT preflight is printed
as a warning; API-key connections and the server remain usable.

Runtime databases, secrets, uploads, and caches are stored under `DATA_DIR`.
Local runs use the repository root by default; the Docker example uses
`/data`. Set `REDIS_URL` to use Redis for active stream tracking across
workers or instances. Without Redis, the server uses the SQLite
`current_streams` table.

### Proxmox LXC Installation
For Proxmox VE users, you can easily deploy an LXC container running IPTV-Manager.
Run the following command directly on your **Proxmox Host Shell**:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bladestar2105/IPTV-Manager/main/scripts/proxmox.sh -o proxmox.sh
chmod +x proxmox.sh
./proxmox.sh
```

This uses an unprivileged LXC with nesting enabled and the same Debian/Ubuntu
installer. The container's real runtime preflight must pass; host LXC/AppArmor
restrictions can still require administrator configuration. Do not switch to a
privileged or unconfined container. Proxmox has not yet been verified on a real
test host; Docker and Ubuntu checks do not substitute for that acceptance test.

### AI setup after installation

The AI integration is **experimental**, including API and ChatGPT connections.
All paths use the same [AI setup](docs/AI_INTEGRATION.md): enable AI in the
administrator policy, allow the required users/functions, then enable personal
AI preferences. For API connections, configure the endpoint/key and test a
model. For ChatGPT, run the installation preflight first, then link your own
account in the Web UI and test a model. Runtime checks do not prove account
eligibility or a live model response.

For example, select a user and ask **“Erstelle eine Liste mit allen Fußball-Sendern”**.
The assistant can propose matching entries such as Sky Sport Bundesliga and
DAZN from that user's available catalog. Review the proposal, use **Select all
actions** or choose individual actions, then confirm. **Clear selection** clears
the checkboxes without applying changes.

### Development
- **Linting**: `npm run lint`
- **Testing**: `npm test`
- **Build check**: `npm run build`
- **Browser smoke test**: `npm run test:playwright:smoke`
- **Developer notes**: `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`
- **Configuration reference**: `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`
- **API reference**: `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`

### First Time Setup
- **Default Username**: `admin`
- **Default Password**: Set by `scripts/install.sh` and printed at the end of the install (also saved as `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `/opt/iptv-manager/.env`).
- **Important**: Change password immediately after login.

### CORS Configuration
The application blocks Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) by default for security. If you need to access the API or streams from another domain (e.g., an external web player), you must configure the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable.

- **Default**: Cross-origin requests are blocked (`false`).
- **Setup**: Add `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-web-player.com,https://another-site.com` to your `.env` file.
- **Allow All**: Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*` to allow all domains (⚠️ Not recommended for production).

### Rate Limit Tuning
Defaults are intentionally high enough for IPTV clients that make bursty
playlist, XMLTV, and Xtream API requests. They can still be tuned via
environment variables:

- `API_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` (default: `1000` per `60000` ms)
- `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` (default: `100` per `900000` ms)
- `CLIENT_LOG_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` (default: `120` per `3600000` ms)

Each limit also has a matching `*_WINDOW_MS` variable documented in
`docs/CONFIGURATION.md`.

### Stream Session Cleanup (Live / VOD / Series)
To prevent stale sessions from blocking new playback with false `Max connections reached` / `HTTP 403` responses, stream session cleanup is applied across **Live TV, Movies, and Series**.

Optional tuning via environment variables:

- `STREAM_MAX_AGE_MS` (default: `86400000` = 24h)  
  Hard safety cap for a single session age. Very old orphan sessions are removed before limit checks.
- `STREAM_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_MS` (default: `120000` = 2 minutes)  
  Inactivity expiry for stalled streams to prevent orphan sessions from blocking new playback.

For most deployments, keep the defaults unless you have a specific operational need.

### Share + Companion App Integration
- Share companion integration guide (Xtream/M3U/EPG): `docs/SHARE_COMPANION_INTEGRATION.md`

### Stalker/MAG (Experimental)
- This is a full experimental software-client portal covering live TV, movies,
  synchronized series episodes, radio, EPG, and EPG-backed catch-up. It does
  not claim compatibility with hardware MAG devices.
- Register one or more MAC addresses in the selected user's **Stalker/MAG** tab.
- Configure the client with the canonical portal URL
  `http(s)://your-server/stalker_portal/c/`. Compatible clients derive the API
  endpoint `http(s)://your-server/stalker_portal/server/load.php` from it.
- Simple/legacy clients may continue to use `http(s)://your-server/c/` and
  `/portal.php`; the existing compatibility aliases remain available.
- An optional 4–8 digit parental PIN can be set per device. It is encrypted at
  rest and delivered only in that device's authenticated profile; when absent,
  the profile returns an empty parental PIN. Bulk channel lists exclude adult
  categories, while an authenticated session can explicitly request an adult
  category. This is client-side Stalker parental control: the server does not
  challenge every adult `create_link` request with the PIN.
- The portal serves live TV with EPG, movies, series episodes synchronized in
  the background or fetched when a series is opened,
  radio categories, and EPG-backed catch-up through the existing authenticated
  stream proxies.
- Bulk EPG responses clamp the requested period to 168 hours, return at most
  500 programmes per channel and 20,000 programmes overall, and preserve empty
  arrays for channels without returned rows. Click-through catch-up playback
  has been validated with OTT Navigator 1.7.4.1 on Android 16 through the
  authenticated IPTV-Manager timeshift proxy.
- Radio categories can be created or imported from a provider's live categories;
  Xtream has no separate standard radio stream type.
  MP3/AAC sources pass through directly; transport-stream radio is transcoded
  to MP3 for software clients. A hardware-specific MAG portal UI is not included.

### HDHomeRun Emulation
- `GET /hdhr/:token/discover.json`
- `GET /hdhr/:token/lineup.json`
- `GET /hdhr/:token/auto/v:channelId`
