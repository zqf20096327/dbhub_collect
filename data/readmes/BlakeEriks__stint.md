# Stint

A time tracker for solo contractors. One timer, a calendar, and invoicing —
and deliberately nothing else.

## Status

Design system, schema, shared logic and the `/api/v1/*` route handlers —
including invoicing, payment details and PDF generation — are built and
covered by integration tests. The app sends no email: invoices are downloaded
and sent by the user from their own address.

**Not built yet:** the mobile app. The web app is complete: timer, calendar,
clients, projects, settings, payment profiles, invoicing. The macOS menu bar
app runs the timer — start, stop, task name, project — and nothing else.

## Layout

```
docs/            setup, deploying, architecture, data model, API contract, design system
docs/design/samples/  committed renderer output
packages/
  schema/        Zod schemas — the API contract
  core/          duration, rates, timer, uuid, calendar,
                 invoice, payment
  design-tokens/ tokens.json -> CSS + TS + Swift (generated into dist/)
apps/
  web/           Next.js — the API layer
  macos/         Swift menu bar app — the timer only
supabase/migrations/
```

`apps/mobile` (Expo) is planned, not created.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm tokens                      # generate CSS / TS / Swift from tokens.json
pnpm tokens:validate             # assert the contrast contract (runs in CI)
pnpm --filter @stint/core test      # pure logic, no database needed
pnpm --filter @stint/web dev
pnpm --filter @stint/web typecheck
pnpm --filter @stint/web sample:invoice   # regenerate docs/design/samples/

./apps/macos/bundle.sh                    # build and install ~/Applications/Stint Local.app
```

Run `pnpm tokens` first on a clean checkout: `@stint/design-tokens` resolves
through the generated `dist/`.

### Running the API tests

They exercise the real handlers against a real database, and the RLS suite
checks row isolation as a non-superuser `authenticated` role — two throwaway
databases on the local stack's Postgres, beside the seed:

```bash
pnpm db:setup    # rebuilds both from this checkout's migrations
pnpm verify:db   # both suites, then the schema check
```

`docs/local-dev.md` has why there are two.

`pnpm test:e2e` is a fourth suite: Playwright against a real browser, needing
the local Supabase stack (`pnpm dev:up`) and the app (`pnpm dev`) already
running. It is deliberately outside `verify:static` and `verify:db` so a
browser download is not a prerequisite for the unit suites, and it signs in
for real through Mailpit rather than injecting a cookie. It is the only suite that sees cookies,
navigation, redirects and server components — see `docs/local-dev.md`.
