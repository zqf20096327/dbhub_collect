# sqlserver2tidb

[![ci](https://github.com/BornChanger/sqlserver2tidb/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BornChanger/sqlserver2tidb/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

`sqlserver2tidb` is a GitOps-oriented migration control toolkit for SQL Server to TiDB migrations.

The repository itself is the durable metadata store. Migration state, plans, approvals, checkpoints, and evidence are stored as YAML, JSON, and Markdown files under this repo. GitHub PRs provide the review and approval boundary.

## Current Scope

This release provides:

- A Go CLI named `sqlserver2tidb`.
- Initialization of the GitOps metadata repository structure.
- A local `doctor` preflight command for repository validation and optional `git`/`gh`/executor availability checks.
- Validation of the GitOps metadata repository structure, including schema policy mappings, inventory JSON parseability/status, cluster/project identity consistency, source profile/state/evidence ownership, schema diff status/timestamps/summary counts, evidence status/timestamps, review plan statuses, approval metadata/audit timestamps, export/import/CDC work-item fields, SQL Server source object and TiDB target object name shape, required row-count and query-based validation plan fields, and unresolved TODO predicates.
- SQL Server discovery dry-run planning without opening a database connection.
- SQL Server catalog discovery using a connection string supplied through an environment variable.
- Rule-based SQL Server compatibility analysis from `inventory/inventory.json`.
- LLM-assisted compatibility, schema rewrite candidate, migration strategy, validation mismatch, cutover risk, and PR summary advice generation that reads redacted deterministic inputs and writes advisory files under `clusters/<source_cluster_id>/ai/` or project `ai/` directories.
- Project-scoped TiDB schema draft generation from SQL Server inventory and project metadata.
- Project-scoped full export/import plan draft generation from SQL Server inventory and project metadata.
- Project-scoped schema drift detection against a reviewed schema baseline, with report generation, automatic draft regeneration for repairable drift, and a schema-drift PR draft.
- Project-scoped CDC plan draft generation from SQL Server inventory and project metadata.
- Project-scoped row-count validation plan draft generation from SQL Server inventory and project metadata, with optional exact-numeric scalar-query checksum, sampled-hash, and bucketed-count draft checks.
- PR draft generation and a dry-run-by-default GitHub PR creation wrapper.
- GitHub PR approval sync and closure for schema/export/import/CDC/validation/cutover PRs: after a PR is approved and green, the CLI/workflow can approve if needed, merge the PR, write the matching GitHub-file approval metadata with a freshly computed payload hash, commit it, and push it back to the base branch.
- DDL, export, import, CDC, validation, and cutover payload hash calculation.
- Approved metadata-only export/import/CDC/validation/cutover worker state write-back.
- Dry-run-by-default external executor command generation for approved DDL/export/import/CDC enablement/CDC apply/validation plans, with structured executor evidence for timing, retries, CDC applied-change counts, export/import data-volume metrics, and agent-triggered executor evidence PR draft generation after approved executor-backed execution.
- `sqlserver2tidb-executor` adapter for DDL/export/import/CDC plus row-count and query-based validation work items, including `apply-ddl --execute`, CSV `export --execute` to local file, HTTP(S), S3, GCS, or Azure Blob, CSV `import --execute` from local file, HTTP(S), S3, GCS, or Azure Blob, `validate-count --execute`, `validate-query --execute`, `cdc-lsn --execute`, `cdc-enable --execute`, and `cdc --execute` paths.
- A `cdc-orchestrator` command that repeatedly probes SQL Server CDC max LSN through the executor, prepares the next reviewed CDC range from committed checkpoints, writes a range PR draft, and can explicitly execute already-approved CDC ranges while preserving GitHub approval gates.
- A `cdc-health` command for long-running CDC operations that evaluates committed checkpoint freshness, lag against SQL Server max LSN, CDC retention coverage against per-table min LSNs, writes JSON metrics and JSONL history, and can send Feishu or Slack webhook alerts.
- Approved validation-only worker execution.
- Read-only worker reconcile dry-run planning across source clusters and projects.
- Lease-backed worker reconcile execute-next and bounded loop modes for approved metadata-only actions.
- A `worker-agent` command that packages the bounded reconcile loop as a stable local/container worker entrypoint.
- Worker state PR draft generation and a dry-run-by-default branch/commit/push/GitHub PR wrapper.
- An offline quickstart example that generates and validates a sample migration metadata repository without connecting to SQL Server, TiDB, GitHub, or object storage.
- A multi-stage Dockerfile for building a non-root CLI image with `sqlserver2tidb` and `sqlserver2tidb-executor`.
- Source-cluster-first metadata organization:

  ```text
  clusters/<source_cluster_id>/
    cluster.yaml
    inventory/
    state/
      cdc-checkpoint.yaml
      worker-lease.yaml
    prs/
    projects/<project_id>/
      project.yaml
      schema/
      plan/
      state/
      evidence/
      approvals/
      prs/
  ```

- JSON Schema files for core metadata, including cluster, project, migration, export, import, CDC, and validation plan metadata.
- Tests for repository initialization, validation, cluster/project metadata consistency, source profile/state/evidence/approval ownership checks, validation plan checks, executor-supported data plan checks, discovery, compatibility analysis, schema draft generation, data movement, CDC, validation plan generation, PR draft generation, GitHub PR dry-runs, worker gates, executor command dry-runs, executor binary dry-runs, DDL apply checks, CSV export/import checks, executor evidence metrics, validation command checks, worker reconcile flows, worker-agent runs, upstream SQL Server cluster creation, and migration project creation.

This release opens database connections only for explicit execution paths.

SQL Server connections are used for:

- read-only catalog discovery with `discover-sqlserver --connection-string-env`;
- approved CSV export with `sqlserver2tidb-executor export --execute`;
- CDC LSN probing with `sqlserver2tidb-executor cdc-lsn --execute`;
- idempotent CDC enablement with `sqlserver2tidb-executor cdc-enable --execute`;
- approved CDC range apply with `sqlserver2tidb-executor cdc --execute`.

TiDB or MySQL-compatible connections are used for:

- reviewed DDL apply with `sqlserver2tidb-executor apply-ddl --execute`;
- CSV import with `sqlserver2tidb-executor import --execute`;
- row-count validation with `sqlserver2tidb-executor validate-count --execute`;
- reviewed scalar-query validation with `sqlserver2tidb-executor validate-query --execute`.

Executor dry-runs validate object names, URI compatibility, `TODO` predicates, import engine/source URI compatibility, LSN ranges, captured columns, and key-column membership without opening database connections or writing data.

Export supports local `file://`, HTTP(S), native `s3://`, native `gs://`, and native `azblob://` CSV output. Import supports three engines:

- `sql-insert` streams local `file://`, HTTP(S), S3, GCS, or Azure Blob CSV into TiDB with batched inserts.
- `tidb-import-into` executes TiDB `IMPORT INTO ... FROM FILE` for absolute local paths, local `file://`, `s3://`, and `gs://` file locations.
- `tidb-lightning` generates Lightning-friendly CSV plans and invokes an external `tidb-lightning -config <toml>` process for local `file://`, `s3://`, `gs://`, or `azblob://` data-source directories.

HTTP(S) import URIs must include a host. S3 and GCS URIs must include both bucket and object path. Azure Blob URIs use `azblob://<container>/<blob>`.

Default CSV export writes a header plus an internal `__sqlserver2tidb_null_bitmap` column so `sql-insert` and `tidb-import-into` can restore SQL NULL values. `tidb-lightning` data plans instead write `null_encoding: backslash-n`, omit the internal bitmap column, encode SQL NULL as `\N`, and generate Lightning TOML with `null = '\N'`.

`--compression gzip` writes and reads gzip-compressed CSV for the `sql-insert` and `tidb-lightning` paths. It also sets `Content-Encoding: gzip` for HTTP(S), S3, GCS, and Azure Blob export uploads. Gzip compression is not enabled for `tidb-import-into` in this agent yet.

Cloud object storage authentication is handled by environment variables:

- S3 export/import uses AWS Signature V4 with `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION` or `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, optional `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, and optional `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` / `AWS_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE`.
- GCS export/import uses HMAC credentials from `GCS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `GCS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `GOOG_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `GOOG_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, plus optional `GCS_ENDPOINT_URL`.
- Azure Blob export/import uses Shared Key auth from `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT`, base64 `AZURE_STORAGE_KEY`, and optional `AZURE_BLOB_ENDPOINT_URL`.

HTTP(S), S3, GCS, and Azure Blob CSV downloads and uploads retry transient request errors and 408/429/5xx responses up to three attempts. Remote uploads are sent from local temporary files, so retries replay the complete payload.

`sql-insert` can optionally preflight the target table with `COUNT(*)` when `--require-empty-target` is set. That check is disabled by default so multi-chunk import jobs can load the same target table. Import-plan `fields` are only valid with `tidb-import-into`; `sql-insert` and `tidb-lightning` rely on CSV headers and reject reviewed jobs that carry `fields`.

`tidb-import-into` reads local/file/S3/GCS CSV headers or uses reviewed import-plan `fields`. It maps the internal tail column to a TiDB user variable so the column is skipped, and it always preflights the target table with `COUNT(*)` before executing `IMPORT INTO`. Reviewed fields must be non-empty, duplicate-free, and use simple `@name` syntax for user variables. Azure Blob is currently supported for the `sql-insert` and `tidb-lightning` CSV paths, not for TiDB `IMPORT INTO`.

Validation can explicitly connect to both SQL Server and TiDB for row-count comparison and reviewed scalar-query comparison. Scalar-query validation supports `checksum`, `sampled_hash`, `bucketed_count`, and `business_sql` checks. Validation dry-runs reject unresolved `TODO` predicates or scalar SQL before any database connection is opened.

The included CDC executor commands can query SQL Server CDC LSN bounds, idempotently enable SQL Server database/table CDC for reviewed tracked tables, and apply one explicit SQL Server CDC LSN range to TiDB. CDC dry-runs validate captured columns, key-column membership, and LSN format/range without starting a CDC reader or TiDB apply worker.

`worker-cutover` is a GitHub-file gate. It records completed cutover state only after reviewed runbook, successful export/import/validation executor evidence, passed validation worker state, and for non-offline projects a caught-up CDC checkpoint. It does **not** switch application traffic, update DNS/proxy settings, bypass GitHub branch protection, perform cleanup, or provide native row-digest/bucketed sampled-hash strategies.

PR approval metadata can be synchronized from already merged, approved, green GitHub PRs with `sync-github-pr-approval`. It can also be closed end-to-end with `complete-github-pr --execute` when the local `gh` and `git` identities have the required repository permissions.

Successful export and import commands emit audit metrics:

- CSV export prints `exported rows: N`, `output bytes: N`, and `output sha256: sha256:<digest>`.
- `sql-insert` import prints `imported rows: N`, `input bytes: N`, and `input sha256: sha256:<digest>`.
- Local-path, `file://`, S3, and GCS `tidb-import-into` imports pre-audit the CSV and print the same row/byte/SHA tuple after successful `IMPORT INTO`.
- `tidb-lightning` imports pre-audit all import-plan CSV sources, reject files that still contain the internal null bitmap column, print aggregate row/byte/SHA metrics, write a temporary or requested Lightning TOML config, and then invoke the external Lightning binary.

Local `file://` CSV export writes a same-directory temporary file and atomically publishes it only after the CSV writer closes successfully. HTTP(S), S3, GCS, and Azure Blob export also spool to local temporary files, then upload only after the writer closes. Abort removes the temporary file without starting a remote upload.

HTTP(S), S3, GCS, and Azure Blob imports explicitly request `Accept-Encoding: identity` so byte and digest metrics describe the stored object bytes. `worker-executor --execute` records the audit tuple as command-level `data_rows`, `data_bytes`, and `data_sha256` in `evidence/executor-<stage>-run.json`. It fails export and auditable import commands whose successful output omits the complete data audit tuple.

Executor evidence PRs render these metrics for review. Operator-visible command logs, executor evidence output, redacted command args/shell commands, executor evidence PR summaries, validation worker summaries, and CDC LSN probe failure messages redact common password/token/secret keys, URL userinfo passwords, and signed URL query parameters as `<redacted>` while preserving audit SHA256 digests.

Redaction is a defense-in-depth guard for evidence and logs. Secrets should still be passed through environment variables or secret managers and never committed to repository files. `validate-repo` and executor evidence PR generation require complete data audit for successful export, `sql-insert` import, local/file/S3/GCS `tidb-import-into` evidence, and `tidb-lightning` evidence.

## Build

```bash
make build
```

The binary is written to:

```text
bin/sqlserver2tidb
bin/sqlserver2tidb-executor
```

Both binaries expose build metadata:

```bash
bin/sqlserver2tidb version
bin/sqlserver2tidb-executor version
```

`make build` injects the current Git commit and UTC build time. Direct `go test` and unlinked development builds report `dev`, `unknown`, and `unknown`.

Install both binaries into `PREFIX/bin`:

```bash
make install PREFIX="$HOME/.local"
```

Build local release archives under `dist/`:

```bash
make dist VERSION=v0.1.0
```

Each archive includes both binaries, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, core documents under `docs/`, production operations material, quickstart examples, migration agent runtime templates, worker-agent examples, the LLM provider configuration template, helper scripts, and optional integration-test assets.

Limit local release builds to selected `GOOS/GOARCH` targets:

```bash
DIST_TARGETS="linux/amd64 darwin/arm64" make dist VERSION=v0.1.0
```

Pushing a tag like `v0.1.0` runs the release workflow, builds Linux/macOS/Windows archives, publishes checksums, and creates a GitHub Release. The container workflow also publishes `ghcr.io/bornchanger/sqlserver2tidb:v0.1.0` and updates `ghcr.io/bornchanger/sqlserver2tidb:latest`.

Build a local container image:

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg VERSION=dev \
  --build-arg COMMIT="$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" \
  --build-arg BUILD_DATE="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  -t sqlserver2tidb:dev .
```

Run the CLI against a mounted migration metadata repository:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  sqlserver2tidb:dev doctor --root /workspace
```

The image includes `git`, `gh`, `sqlserver2tidb`, and `sqlserver2tidb-executor`, and runs as a non-root `sqlserver2tidb` user. With a mounted metadata repository plus `GH_TOKEN` or a mounted GitHub CLI auth config, the same image can run PR automation commands such as `create-pr --execute`, `complete-github-pr --execute`, `sync-github-pr-approval`, `create-worker-state-pr --execute`, and `create-executor-evidence-pr --execute`.

Runtime templates for the top-level migration agent are under `examples/agent-runtime/`, including a manual GitHub Actions workflow, a Kubernetes CronJob, and systemd timers for periodic status and CDC operations.

## Test

```bash
make test
```

Run the same gate used by GitHub Actions:

```bash
make ci
```

Run the container build and PR automation smoke used by GitHub Actions:

```bash
make container-smoke
```

Run the offline quickstart example:

```bash
make example-check
```

This creates a temporary metadata repository from `examples/quickstart/inventory.json`, generates schema/data/CDC/validation drafts, runs `worker-reconcile --dry-run`, and validates the generated repository. To keep the generated repository for inspection, provide an empty output directory:

```bash
SQLSERVER2TIDB_QUICKSTART_ROOT=/tmp/sqlserver2tidb-quickstart make example-check
```

## Quick Start

Initialize the repository metadata layout:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb init-repo --root .
```

Validate the repository metadata layout:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb validate-repo --root .
```

Run local preflight checks:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb doctor --root .
```

By default, missing local tools are reported as warnings. Add `--require-tools` when the environment must already have `git`, `gh`, and `sqlserver2tidb-executor` on `PATH`. Add `--json` to emit repository and tool status for CI/CD or monitoring integrations.

Create an upstream SQL Server cluster:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb create-cluster \
  --root . \
  --cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --display-name "prod SQL Server A" \
  --listener sqlserver-a.internal \
  --port 1433 \
  --secret-ref vault://migration/prod-sqlserver-a/readonly \
  --owner dba-team,sre-team
```

The command refuses to overwrite an existing `clusters/<source_cluster_id>/` directory.

Preview the SQL Server discovery scope without connecting to SQL Server or writing inventory files:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb discover-sqlserver \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --dry-run
```

Run SQL Server catalog discovery. The connection string must come from the environment and must not be committed:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb discover-sqlserver \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --connection-string-env SQLSERVER2TIDB_SQLSERVER_DSN
```

Analyze SQL Server compatibility findings from the current inventory file:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb analyze-compatibility \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a
```

Generate optional LLM compatibility advice from the rule-based findings:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb llm-compatibility-advice \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --provider-config global/llm-providers.yaml \
  --execute
```

The command is dry-run by default. With `--execute`, it calls an OpenAI-compatible provider and writes `clusters/<source_cluster_id>/ai/compatibility-advice.md` plus `compatibility-advice.audit.json`. Provider auth supports API key, OAuth client credentials, OAuth refresh token, OAuth access token from environment, and explicitly allowed external token commands. LLM output is advisory only and is not read by workers as an approval, state file, or execution instruction.

Create a migration project under that upstream cluster:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb create-project \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --display-name "sales DB to TiDB prod A" \
  --source-database sales \
  --source-schema dbo \
  --target-name tidb-prod-a \
  --target-database app \
  --target-secret-ref vault://migration/tidb-prod-a/migrate-user \
  --owner dba-team,app-team
```

The command refuses to overwrite an existing `clusters/<source_cluster_id>/projects/<project_id>/` directory.

Generate project-scoped TiDB DDL drafts from the current SQL Server inventory and project metadata:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb generate-schema-draft \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a
```

This writes `schema/tidb-ddl/`, `schema/conversion-report.md`, and `schema/schema-diff.json` under the project. Manual-review mappings are marked in both the DDL comments and schema diff.

Generate optional LLM schema rewrite candidates from those schema draft artifacts:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb llm-schema-advice \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --provider-config global/llm-providers.yaml \
  --execute
```

This reads `schema/schema-diff.json`, `schema/conversion-report.md`, and generated `schema/tidb-ddl/*.sql`, then writes advisory candidates under `clusters/<source_cluster_id>/projects/<project_id>/ai/`. It does not modify reviewed DDL, plans, approvals, state, or executor evidence.

Generate project-scoped full export/import draft plans from the current SQL Server inventory and project metadata:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb generate-data-plans \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --object-uri-prefix https://object-store.example/migration/prod-sqlserver-a/sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a/full \
  --compression gzip
```

This writes `plan/export-plan.yaml` and `plan/import-plan.yaml` under the project. The command estimates chunks from inventory `row_count`; single-chunk tables get a reviewed-safe `1 = 1` predicate, while multi-chunk tables still get `TODO` split predicates that must be reviewed before export execution.

By default it generates executor-supported CSV plans with `sql-insert` imports over local `file://`, `http://`, `https://`, `s3://`, `gs://`, or `azblob://` URI prefixes. HTTP(S) prefixes must include a host, S3/GCS prefixes must include a bucket, and Azure Blob prefixes use the container as the URI host.

`--compression gzip` records `compression: gzip` in both plans and generates `.csv.gz` object names. The worker executor then passes `--compression gzip` to export and import commands.

If `--import-engine tidb-import-into` is used, the executable URI prefix must be a local absolute `file://` path, `s3://`, or `gs://`. S3/GCS prefixes must include a bucket, and compression must stay `none`.

If `--import-engine tidb-lightning` is used, the executable URI prefix must be local `file://`, `s3://`, `gs://`, or `azblob://`. Generated export files are named from TiDB target objects, the export plan records `null_encoding: backslash-n`, and the import plan records a top-level `data_source_uri` so one Lightning command can load the whole data directory.

Only `tidb-import-into` import jobs get a `fields` list derived from inventory columns plus `@sqlserver2tidb_null_bitmap`. That lets object-storage imports skip the internal CSV tail column. `sql-insert` and `tidb-lightning` jobs do not carry `fields`.

This command does not connect to SQL Server or TiDB and does not move data.

Detect reviewed source schema drift and prepare a repair PR:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb repair-schema-drift \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --object-uri-prefix https://object-store.example/migration/prod-sqlserver-a/sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a/full \
  --include-checksum \
  --apply \
  --pr-draft
```

This compares the reviewed `schema/schema-diff.json` baseline with the current `clusters/<source_cluster_id>/inventory/inventory.json`. It writes `evidence/schema-drift-report.md`; with `--apply`, auto-repairable table/column drift regenerates schema, export/import, CDC, and validation drafts back to `draft`/reviewable state; with `--pr-draft`, it writes `prs/schema-drift-pr.md` for review. Missing reviewed tables are classified as `manual_required` and block automatic repair. The command never recomputes approval hashes, never approves/merges PRs, and never executes database or object-storage work.

Generate a project-scoped CDC draft plan from the current SQL Server inventory and project metadata:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb generate-cdc-plan \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --mode sqlserver-cdc \
  --retention-hours 168 \
  --apply-batch-size 1000 \
  --role-name cdc_reader \
  --supports-net-changes
```

This writes `plan/cdc-plan.yaml` under the project. The command records tracked source/target table pairs, SQL Server CDC `capture_instance`, optional `role_name`, `supports_net_changes`, captured CDC columns, target apply key columns, and checkpoint policy.

Captured columns come from discovered non-computed SQL Server table columns. Key columns are chosen from the discovered SQL Server primary key first, then from a non-filtered unique index. Tables without either index produce an empty `key_columns` list that must be reviewed before execution.

The draft-generation command itself does not mutate SQL Server, start Debezium, start Kafka, or apply changes to TiDB.

After the CDC plan is reviewed and `approvals/cdc-approval.yaml` matches the current CDC payload hash, run `worker-executor --stage cdc-enable --execute` first. That idempotently enables SQL Server database/table CDC before `worker-executor --stage cdc --execute` applies LSN ranges.

`cdc-enable` treats the reviewed plan as the setup source of truth. It passes `capture_instance`, `role_name`, `supports_net_changes`, and `retention_hours_required` to the executor. Execute mode preflights SQL Server Agent status and CDC admin permissions, enables DB/table CDC only when needed, then verifies capture and cleanup jobs are present/enabled and cleanup retention is at least the reviewed `retention_hours_required`.

Prepare an explicit CDC LSN range for review:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb prepare-cdc-range \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --to-lsn 0x00000027000001f40003
```

This rewrites `plan/cdc-plan.yaml` and resets the plan and tracked table statuses to `draft`, so the new range must go through review and approval before execution. For tables that already have entries in `state/cdc-checkpoint.yaml`, the next `from_lsn` is the checkpoint `to_lsn`. For the first range, pass `--from-lsn` explicitly. The command does not connect to SQL Server or discover the current max LSN; use `sqlserver2tidb-executor cdc-lsn --execute` when an operator needs to read SQL Server CDC LSN bounds before preparing the reviewed range.

Prepare one CDC iteration from the committed checkpoint and a known SQL Server max LSN:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb prepare-cdc-iteration \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --max-lsn 0x00000027000001f40004 \
  --pr-draft
```

This is the deterministic GitHub-file part of a continuous CDC loop. It compares each tracked table checkpoint `to_lsn` with the supplied `--max-lsn`; if work remains, it rewrites `plan/cdc-plan.yaml` with the next range and can write `prs/cdc-range-pr.md` for review. If all tables are already at `--max-lsn`, it reports `caught_up` and leaves the plan unchanged. It still does not query SQL Server itself; use `sqlserver2tidb-executor cdc-lsn --execute` or an external scheduler to supply the max LSN.

Run the CDC orchestrator as the long-running probe-and-plan loop:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb cdc-orchestrator \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --apply-approved \
  --poll \
  --pr-draft
```

The orchestrator invokes `sqlserver2tidb-executor cdc-lsn --execute`, parses `max_lsn`, probes each tracked table's SQL Server CDC `min_lsn`, and then calls the same deterministic `prepare-cdc-iteration` path.

If a table's next `from_lsn` is older than its `min_lsn`, the orchestrator fails before mutating `plan/cdc-plan.yaml`. That means the CDC retention window no longer covers the requested range. Use `--skip-retention-check` only when another scheduler has already enforced the same min-LSN guard.

When `--apply-approved` is set, each iteration first checks whether the current CDC plan and approval already pass the approval/hash gate. If apply is still needed, it probes per-table `min_lsn` before running `worker-executor --stage cdc --execute`, so an approved range that expired while waiting for execution fails before any CDC apply command starts.

Successful apply records `evidence/executor-cdc-run.json`, advances `clusters/<source_cluster_id>/state/cdc-checkpoint.yaml` from that evidence, and skips reapplying a range that the checkpoint already covers.

`--min-applied-changes <n>` makes the orchestrator exit non-zero unless the run applied at least `n` CDC changes. This is useful for production soak validation and scheduled CDC health checks.

When the project is caught up it can keep polling. When a new range is prepared, it writes `plan/cdc-plan.yaml` and optional `prs/cdc-range-pr.md`, then stops at the PR boundary. It does not approve or merge PRs.

Run CDC operational health checks from the committed GitOps state:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb cdc-health \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --probe-lsn \
  --max-checkpoint-age 15m \
  --json \
  --metrics-file artifacts/cdc-health.json \
  --history-file clusters/prod-sqlserver-a/projects/sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a/state/cdc-health-history.jsonl \
  --feishu-alert-min-severity critical \
  --slack-alert-min-severity critical
```

`cdc-health` reads `plan/cdc-plan.yaml` and source-cluster `state/cdc-checkpoint.yaml`, optionally probes SQL Server through `sqlserver2tidb-executor cdc-lsn --execute`, and reports `ok`, `warning`, or `critical`.

It raises critical alerts for failed, stale, missing, ahead-of-source, or retention-expired checkpoints. It raises warning alerts for tables whose checkpoint is behind the probed or supplied `max_lsn`.

Operators can pass `--max-lsn` and repeated `--min-lsn source.object=0x...` values instead of `--probe-lsn`. They can also use `--fail-on-warning` for strict scheduled runs, write the latest JSON report with `--metrics-file`, and append durable JSONL history with `--history-file`.

Feishu alerts use a custom bot webhook URL from `SQLSERVER2TIDB_FEISHU_WEBHOOK` by default, optional signing secret from `SQLSERVER2TIDB_FEISHU_SECRET`, and `--feishu-alert-min-severity critical|warning|ok|none` to control when messages are sent.

Slack alerts use an incoming webhook URL from `SQLSERVER2TIDB_SLACK_WEBHOOK` by default and `--slack-alert-min-severity critical|warning|ok|none` to control when messages are sent.

The built-in `.github/workflows/cdc-ops-health.yml` uploads `artifacts/cdc-health.json`, appends and commits `state/cdc-health-history.jsonl` by default, and can use `SQLSERVER2TIDB_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN` when branch protection blocks `GITHUB_TOKEN` pushes.

Inspect the top-level migration agent status without writing files or calling GitHub/database endpoints:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb agent \
  --mode status \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a
```

Add `--json` for automation. This first agent slice validates the repository, reuses the same readiness logic as `worker-reconcile --dry-run`, reports the next ready action when one exists, and leaves planning/execution/PR side effects to explicit lower-level commands.

Start the guided terminal wizard when an operator wants the agent to walk through status, preview, PR, execution, CDC, and LLM-assist choices:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb agent \
  --mode wizard \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a
```

The wizard is a guided operator console over the same agent modes. It starts by showing a stage dependency view with the current status, blocking reason, and recommended next command.

Status and preview choices are read-only. Choices that can write files, call GitHub, execute approved work, run CDC apply/polling, or call an LLM provider ask for confirmation before dispatching to the underlying mode. GitHub metadata remains the durable source of truth.

Preview the next automatic agent step without writing files:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb agent \
  --mode auto \
  --dry-run \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a
```

`auto --dry-run` can identify a schema review boundary and suggest the `generate-pr-draft --stage schema` command, or report the next ready worker action from the same readiness logic used by `worker-reconcile`. It deliberately does not create PR drafts, call GitHub, execute workers, or touch databases.

Run bounded safe automatic planning steps:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb agent \
  --mode auto \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --max-steps 2
```

Without `--dry-run`, `auto` executes only deterministic non-database planning work. `--max-steps` defaults to `1`; increase it when the agent should chain safe planning actions, such as generating a schema draft and then the schema PR draft in one invocation. After schema review, if no worker action is ready and `prs/plan-pr.md` has not been generated yet, `auto` can generate the plan PR draft. Add `--execute-pr` only when the agent should also call `gh pr create` for a generated schema or plan PR; use `--gh-binary <path>` when the environment needs a wrapped GitHub CLI. If the next action is an approved worker stage, `auto` stops and prints the `execute-approved` boundary instead of mutating state or running database/object-storage work.

Generate a stage PR draft through the agent and preview the GitHub command:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb agent \
  --mode plan-and-pr \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage schema
```

This writes the same deterministic PR body as `generate-pr-draft`, then prints the `gh pr create` command without calling GitHub. Add `--execute-pr` only when the local checkout should call `gh pr create`; successful GitHub output, such as the created PR URL, is printed back to the operator. Use `--gh-binary <path>` for custom GitHub CLI wrappers.

Preview or execute an already-approved worker action through the agent:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb agent \
  --mode execute-approved \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage export
```

The default is a dry-run that reports the ready action and command. Add `--execute` to run the approved metadata worker for `export`, `import`, `cdc`, `validation`, or `cutover`.

For real data movement, CDC apply, or validation execution, add `--use-executor`. In dry-run mode this previews the `worker-executor` command list; with `--execute` it runs the approved executor path and writes `evidence/executor-<stage>-run.json`:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb agent \
  --mode execute-approved \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage export \
  --use-executor \
  --source-connection-string-env SQLSERVER2TIDB_SQLSERVER_DSN \
  --execute \
  --evidence-pr-draft
```

For executor-backed stages, the agent routes the approved action through `worker-executor` and accepts the same execution controls:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb agent \
  --mode execute-approved \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage ddl \
  --target-connection-string-env SQLSERVER2TIDB_TARGET_CONNECTION_STRING

go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb agent \
  --mode execute-approved \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage cdc-enable \
  --source-connection-string-env SQLSERVER2TIDB_CDC_ADMIN_CONNECTION_STRING \
  --command-timeout 5m \
  --command-retries 2 \
  --retry-backoff 10s \
  --resume \
  --execute \
  --create-evidence-pr
```

Use `--executor-binary` to point at a custom executor binary. The agent still uses the committed approval and payload-hash gates before any executor command is prepared. Add `--evidence-pr-draft` with `--execute` on executor-backed stages (`ddl`, `export`, `import`, `cdc-enable`, `cdc`, and `validation`) to write the matching `prs/executor-<stage>-evidence-pr.md` after successful executor evidence is recorded. Add `--create-evidence-pr` to generate the draft and preview the deterministic `git`/`gh` commands without changing git or calling GitHub. Use `--execute-evidence-pr` only when the local checkout should create the branch, commit evidence, push, and open the GitHub PR. Evidence PR creation accepts `--git-binary <path>` and `--gh-binary <path>` for wrapped automation clients.

Preview or execute the GitHub PR closure loop through the agent:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb agent \
  --mode pr-close \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage export \
  --pr 42 \
  --repo BornChanger/sqlserver2tidb
```

`pr-close` is dry-run by default and reuses `complete-github-pr`. It prints the `gh pr view`, optional `gh pr review --approve`, `gh pr merge`, `git pull`, approval sync, commit, and push operations without changing GitHub or git. Add `--execute` only when the local `gh` and `git` identities should approve or merge the PR, sync the stage approval file, commit it on the base branch, and push it. Use `--skip-approve`, `--merge-method`, `--base`, `--delete-branch=false`, `--gh-binary`, and `--git-binary` for the same controls as the lower-level PR command.

Run CDC health and long-period CDC range orchestration through the agent:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb agent \
  --mode cdc-ops \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --probe-lsn \
  --history-file clusters/prod-sqlserver-a/projects/sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a/state/cdc-health-history.jsonl \
  --metrics-file artifacts/cdc-health.json \
  --pr-draft \
  --poll \
  --idle-iterations 3
```

`cdc-ops` first runs `cdc-health`; if health returns critical or a requested `--fail-on-warning` warning, it stops before running the orchestrator. Otherwise it runs `cdc-orchestrator` with the same root, source cluster, project, executor, connection-env, retry, timeout, resume, polling, and PR-draft controls. Use `--apply-approved` only when already-approved CDC ranges should be applied before probing and preparing the next range. The agent does not approve CDC ranges or bypass the CDC payload hash gate.

Generate advisory LLM review output through the agent:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb agent \
  --mode review-assist \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage validation \
  --provider-config global/llm-providers.yaml \
  --execute-llm
```

`review-assist` routes to the existing `llm-*` advisory commands. Supported stages are `compatibility`, `schema`, `strategy`, `validation`, and `cutover`. The default is dry-run and does not call the provider; `--execute-llm` is required before it writes advisory Markdown and audit JSON under `ai/`. LLM output remains advisory and is not treated as approval, state, evidence, or executable plan content.

Generate a project-scoped validation draft plan from the current SQL Server inventory and project metadata:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb generate-validation-plan \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --include-checksum \
  --include-sampled-hash \
  --sample-modulo 100 \
  --include-bucketed-count \
  --bucket-count 16
```

This writes `plan/validation-plan.yaml` under the project with one `row_count` check per table in scope. When requested, it also adds `checksum` and `sampled_hash` scalar-query checks for tables that have exact numeric columns; sampled-hash checks require an integer sample column and use `--sample-modulo` to build the deterministic sample predicate. With `--include-bucketed-count`, it adds one `bucketed_count` scalar-query check per modulo bucket for tables that have a non-computed integer bucket column; `--bucket-count` defaults to `16` and is capped at `1024`. The command does not connect to SQL Server or TiDB and does not execute validation.

Generate optional LLM migration strategy advice from committed metadata and generated plan drafts:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb llm-migration-strategy \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --provider-config global/llm-providers.yaml \
  --execute
```

This reads cluster/project metadata, `plan/migration-plan.yaml`, and any available compatibility, schema, export/import, CDC, and validation artifacts, then writes advisory strategy notes under `clusters/<source_cluster_id>/projects/<project_id>/ai/`. It does not choose or approve a migration mode, does not rewrite plans, and does not trigger workers.

Generate optional LLM validation mismatch analysis after validation evidence exists:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb llm-validation-analysis \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --provider-config global/llm-providers.yaml \
  --execute
```

This reads the reviewed validation plan plus available validation state/report/executor evidence and writes `clusters/<source_cluster_id>/projects/<project_id>/ai/validation-mismatch-analysis.md` plus an audit JSON file. It can explain likely mismatch causes and deterministic checks to rerun, but it does not mark validation passed or modify validation evidence.

Generate optional LLM cutover risk notes before or after cutover rehearsal:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb llm-cutover-risk \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --provider-config global/llm-providers.yaml \
  --execute
```

This reads the reviewed cutover runbook plus available CDC checkpoint, validation status, approvals, and evidence files, then writes `ai/cutover-risk-summary.md` and an audit JSON file. It is advisory only and does not approve or execute cutover.

Generate optional LLM PR review prose from a deterministic PR draft:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb llm-pr-summary \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage schema \
  --provider-config global/llm-providers.yaml \
  --execute
```

This reads `prs/<stage>-pr.md` plus relevant project metadata and plan/schema artifacts, then writes `ai/pr-summary.md` and an audit JSON file. File lists, approval files, payload hashes, and GitHub CLI arguments remain deterministic; the LLM output is review assistance only.

Compute payload hashes and run reviewed DDL/export/import/CDC/validation/cutover actions after the matching approval files are marked approved. `worker-export`, `worker-import`, `worker-cdc`, and `worker-validate` also require their plan files to be `reviewed` or `approved`; draft export/import/CDC/validation plans are not executable even with approved approval files:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb compute-payload-hash \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage ddl

go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb worker-executor \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage ddl \
  --target-connection-string-env SQLSERVER2TIDB_TARGET_CONNECTION_STRING

go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb compute-payload-hash \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage export

go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb worker-export \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a

go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb compute-payload-hash \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage import

go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb worker-import \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a

go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb compute-payload-hash \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage cdc

go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb worker-cdc \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a

go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb compute-payload-hash \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage cutover

go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb worker-cutover \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a
```

These workers only convert approved repository files and evidence into state/evidence files. They do not export data, import data, start CDC, switch application traffic, connect to databases, or write object storage.

Preview external executor commands for an approved stage:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb worker-executor \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage export \
  --source-connection-string-env SQLSERVER_READONLY_DSN
```

This command reuses the same approval/hash gate and is dry-run by default. It prints `sqlserver2tidb-executor` commands for:

- reviewed DDL files;
- export chunks and import jobs;
- SQL Server CDC enablement;
- CDC table apply work;
- validation row-count checks;
- validation scalar-query checks.

Executor preparation fails before command generation when approval state or review state is not ready. Examples include an unreviewed DDL schema diff, a draft export/import/CDC/validation plan, or an approved export/import/CDC plan with no work items.

It also fails when the current GitHub inventory no longer matches the reviewed instruction. The source table must still exist, reviewed schema-diff baselines must still match inventory columns, reviewed `tidb-import-into` fields must still match, and reviewed CDC columns/key columns must still match the current inventory and key metadata.

Plan-shape validation rejects unsupported or unsafe work. Examples include unresolved export `TODO` predicates, non-CSV export plans, unsupported compression values, gzip with `tidb-import-into`, unsupported export `null_encoding`, unsupported source/output URIs, unsupported import engines, unsafe `tidb-import-into` fields, Lightning plans that do not resolve to one data-source directory, and validation plans with no supported checks.

CDC apply tables must provide `columns`, `key_columns`, `from_lsn`, and `to_lsn`; each key column must also be present in `columns`. `worker-executor --stage cdc-enable` is different: it reuses `approvals/cdc-approval.yaml`, reads `plan/cdc-plan.yaml`, and generates one idempotent `cdc-enable` command per tracked table without requiring LSN range fields.

The source schema drift checks read `clusters/<source_cluster_id>/inventory/inventory.json` and optional reviewed `schema/schema-diff.json`. They do not use a TiDB metadata table.

Validation plans can express separate source `predicate` and target `target_predicate` filters for row-count checks. `checksum`, `sampled_hash`, `bucketed_count`, and `business_sql` checks carry reviewed `source_sql` and `target_sql` scalar queries.

Execution settings are passed into generated commands with `--source-connection-string-env`, `--target-connection-string-env`, and `--import-batch-size`. Use `--require-empty-target` only when `sql-insert` import commands should fail before opening the CSV source if the target table is already non-empty.

Reviewed plan fields are passed through to the executor:

- `compression: gzip` becomes `--compression gzip` for export, `sql-insert`, and `tidb-lightning`;
- `tidb-import-into` import job `fields` become `--fields`;
- `tidb-lightning` import plans become one `--engine tidb-lightning` command with `--import-plan` and `--source-uri <data_source_uri>`;
- CDC apply table `columns`, `key_columns`, `from_lsn`, and `to_lsn` become the matching executor flags.

When `worker-executor --execute` is used, it invokes the external executor and injects the executor-level `--execute` flag. It writes `evidence/executor-<stage>-run.json` with command output, exit codes, per-command timestamps, duration, optional retry fields, and for CDC apply commands the parsed `cdc_applied_changes` value from the required `applied changes: N` output line.

Use `--command-timeout <duration>` to cap each external executor command. The default `0` disables the timeout. Use `--command-retries <n>` and `--retry-backoff <duration>` for bounded retries. Command-level evidence records the final attempt, while `attempts` preserves every retry attempt for review.

Use `--resume` after a partial run to skip commands that already have matching successful evidence for the same stage, payload hash, command ID, and exact executor args. Non-matching commands, failed commands, and CDC apply commands without `cdc_applied_changes` are executed again.

Timed-out commands are killed, recorded as failed evidence with a command `error`, and cause non-validation stages to fail fast after retries are exhausted. Validation continues aggregating command results. If a CDC apply command omits the applied-changes line or prints a non-numeric value, execute mode records failed evidence before returning non-zero.

For `validation`, execute mode runs all generated validation commands before writing failed evidence, so one mismatch does not hide later check results. Non-validation stages remain fail-fast.

The included executor binary can:

- apply reviewed TiDB DDL;
- export SQL Server data to local `file://`, HTTP(S), S3, GCS, or Azure Blob CSV/gzip CSV;
- stream local `file://`, HTTP(S), S3, GCS, or Azure Blob CSV/gzip CSV sources to TiDB with `sql-insert`;
- optionally preflight non-empty `sql-insert` targets with `--require-empty-target`;
- execute TiDB `IMPORT INTO` for `tidb-import-into` local/file/S3/GCS file locations;
- invoke an external TiDB Lightning binary for local/file/S3/GCS/Azure Blob data-source directories;
- preserve SQL NULLs through an internal CSV null bitmap column for `sql-insert` and supported `tidb-import-into` imports;
- use `\N` null encoding for Lightning CSV;
- run approval-gated SQL Server/TiDB row-count comparison and scalar-query validation;
- query SQL Server CDC LSN bounds, enable SQL Server database/table CDC, and apply a reviewed SQL Server CDC LSN range to TiDB.

GitHub PR approval sync is implemented for already merged, approved, green stage PRs. `complete-github-pr --execute` can approve, merge, sync the approval file, commit it, and push it back to the base branch. Native generated row-digest/sample-hash strategies are still not implemented.

Advance the source-cluster CDC checkpoint from successful CDC executor evidence:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb advance-cdc-checkpoint \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --status running
```

This validates `evidence/executor-cdc-run.json` against the current approval, payload hash, and reviewed CDC plan, requires succeeded CDC executor commands with `cdc_applied_changes`, verifies command source/target/LSN values match the current plan, and rewrites `clusters/<source_cluster_id>/state/cdc-checkpoint.yaml` with one checkpoint snapshot per applied table. Use `--status caught_up` only when the reviewed LSN range is known to represent catch-up. The command does not query SQL Server min/max LSNs; use `cdc-orchestrator` for the long-running probe/approved-apply/plan loop, or `sqlserver2tidb-executor cdc-lsn --execute` plus `prepare-cdc-range --min-lsn source.object=0x...` for manual operation with an explicit retention guard.

Preview ready and blocked worker actions across the repository:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb worker-reconcile \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --dry-run
```

This scans cluster/project metadata and reports which worker actions are ready or blocked by approval/hash checks. It covers `worker-executor --stage ddl`, `worker-export`, `worker-import`, `worker-executor --stage cdc-enable`, `worker-cdc`, `worker-validate`, and `worker-cutover`.

Use `--source-cluster-id` to scope the scan to one upstream SQL Server cluster directory.

DDL actions are blocked until `schema/schema-diff.json` is `reviewed`. Export, import, CDC enablement, CDC apply, and validation actions are blocked while their plan files are still `draft`.

Cutover is blocked until the runbook is reviewed, cutover approval matches, export/import/validation executor evidence succeeded, validation worker state passed, and for non-offline projects a caught-up CDC checkpoint.

A metadata-only stage is also blocked when the same approved payload hash already has non-empty state such as `planned`, `passed`, `completed`, or `failed`. This prevents reconcile loops from repeatedly running the same action.

This command does not execute workers, acquire leases, or write state.

Add `--json` to emit the same dry-run report as machine-readable JSON with `projects`, `ready_actions`, `blocked_actions`, and `actions` fields.

Execute the first ready metadata-only worker action with a source-cluster lease:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb worker-reconcile \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --execute-next \
  --holder agent-a \
  --state-pr-draft
```

This acquires or renews `state/worker-lease.yaml` for the selected source cluster. It runs exactly one ready metadata-only worker action (`export`, `import`, `cdc`, `validation`, or `cutover`) and writes the same state/evidence files that the explicit single-project worker would write.

Active lease records include non-empty `holder`, `lease_id`, `project_id`, `expires_at`, and `renewed_at`. `project_id` must reference an existing project directory under the same source cluster. Timestamps are RFC3339, and `expires_at` must not be before `renewed_at`. `phase: idle` remains the empty placeholder state.

DDL is intentionally executor-only and must be run through `worker-executor --stage ddl`. With `--state-pr-draft`, the command also writes a deterministic Markdown PR body under the project `prs/` directory for reviewing the state/evidence/lease changes. It does not create a branch or call GitHub. A different holder is blocked until the lease expires.

Run a bounded reconcile loop:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb worker-reconcile \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --loop \
  --holder agent-a \
  --max-iterations 10 \
  --interval 5s
```

Loop mode repeatedly executes ready metadata-only actions with the same lease holder until no ready metadata action remains or `--max-iterations` is reached. `--max-iterations 0` means continue until the repository has no ready metadata-only actions. It still does not execute DDL, external executor commands, GitHub PR creation, or database IO.

Run the packaged worker agent entrypoint:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb worker-agent \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --holder agent-a \
  --max-iterations 0 \
  --interval 5s \
  --poll \
  --idle-iterations 0 \
  --state-pr-draft
```

`worker-agent` is the same deterministic metadata-only loop packaged as a stable process entrypoint for local runs and containers. It requires a holder, uses the source-cluster lease, can be scoped with `--source-cluster-id`, can emit state PR drafts, and stops only when no ready metadata-only action remains unless `--poll` is enabled. In poll mode, `--idle-iterations 0` means keep waiting for new ready metadata actions; set a positive value for bounded smoke tests or batch jobs.

Run optional SQL Server + TiDB integration tests:

```bash
make integration-test
```

This starts the Docker Compose environment in `tests/integration/` unless `SQLSERVER2TIDB_INTEGRATION_SOURCE_DSN` and `SQLSERVER2TIDB_INTEGRATION_TARGET_DSN` are already set. It runs both the direct executor full-load flow and the CLI/GitOps E2E flow: real SQL Server catalog discovery, schema/data/validation plan generation, approval hash checks, `worker-executor --execute` DDL/export/import/validation, `worker-validate`, and `validate-repo`. The target is intentionally outside default `make ci` because the default path pulls database images and requires Docker.

Run the longer CDC production-validation suite explicitly:

```bash
make cdc-soak-test
```

This enables SQL Server CDC on a dedicated integration database, performs a full-load baseline, then runs multiple CDC insert/update/delete rounds through the GitOps range-review and `cdc-orchestrator --apply-approved` path. Each round requires at least one applied CDC change, verifies target rows in TiDB, and checks the source-cluster checkpoint. Set `SQLSERVER2TIDB_CDC_SOAK_ITERATIONS` to control the number of CDC rounds; the default is `3`. You can also append it to `make integration-test` with `SQLSERVER2TIDB_RUN_CDC_SOAK=1`.

For shared environments, configure `SQLSERVER2TIDB_INTEGRATION_SOURCE_DSN` and `SQLSERVER2TIDB_INTEGRATION_TARGET_DSN` as GitHub secrets, then trigger the manual `.github/workflows/cdc-soak.yml` workflow with the desired iteration count.

Prepare the git and GitHub commands for a worker state write-back PR:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb create-worker-state-pr \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage export
```

This is a dry-run by default. It requires the state PR draft and state/evidence/lease files to exist, validates and includes `evidence/executor-<stage>-run.json` when present, then prints deterministic `git switch`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, and `gh pr create` commands. Optional executor evidence must pass the same approval, payload hash, reviewed instruction, and command-structure checks used by executor evidence PRs. Dry-run reports whether the PR body needs a file-list refresh; `--execute` refreshes that body before commit and then runs the commands locally. Use `--git-binary <path>` and `--gh-binary <path>` when these commands should run through wrappers.

Generate and prepare a PR for executor-only evidence such as DDL apply evidence:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb generate-executor-evidence-pr-draft \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage ddl

go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb create-executor-evidence-pr \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage ddl
```

`generate-executor-evidence-pr-draft` validates the existing `evidence/executor-<stage>-run.json` against the current approved payload hash. It rejects evidence when the matching DDL schema diff or stage plan is not reviewed, and it also rejects evidence with no executor command records.

Evidence status must be `succeeded` or `failed`. Top-level `generated_at` must be RFC3339 when present, and command IDs must be unique.

Each command record must include `id`, non-empty `args`, shell-quoted `shell_command` matching those args, `exit_code`, `started_at`, `completed_at`, and `duration_ms`. Command timestamps must parse as RFC3339Nano, `completed_at` must not be earlier than `started_at`, and duration must be non-negative.

Optional command `attempt_count` must be at least 1. When `attempts` is present, its length and per-attempt timing fields must match `attempt_count`. Optional command `error` values are rendered into the PR body when present.

Optional `cdc_applied_changes` values must be non-negative. CDC evidence PR bodies include a CDC applied-changes column when the field is present, and CDC evidence PR drafts also list `state/cdc-checkpoint.yaml` so evidence and checkpoint advancement can be reviewed together.

`succeeded` evidence requires every final command exit code to be `0` and every final command error to be empty. `failed` evidence requires at least one non-zero final command exit code or command error.

The command writes a Markdown PR body under `prs/`. The body includes a command summary table with exit codes, attempt counts when present, timing, command errors when present, and a whitespace-normalized output summary capped for review.

`create-executor-evidence-pr` is a dry-run by default. It rejects stale PR bodies whose content no longer matches the current evidence, then prints deterministic `git switch`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, and `gh pr create` commands. Add `--execute` only when the local checkout should create the branch, commit the evidence/body, push it, and open a GitHub PR. Use `--git-binary <path>` and `--gh-binary <path>` for custom automation clients.

Generate a project-scoped PR draft for schema review:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb generate-pr-draft \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage schema
```

This writes a Markdown PR body under `prs/` and prints the suggested `gh pr create` command. It does not call the GitHub API.

Prepare a GitHub PR create command from the generated draft:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb create-pr \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage schema
```

This is a dry-run by default. Add `--execute` to call `gh pr create`; use `--gh-binary <path>` when the command should run through a wrapped GitHub CLI.

After the GitHub PR is reviewed and green, complete the PR closure loop in one command:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb complete-github-pr \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage schema \
  --pr 42 \
  --repo BornChanger/sqlserver2tidb \
  --execute
```

This command calls `gh pr view`, refuses pending or failed checks, approves the PR if needed, merges it with `gh pr merge`, pulls the base branch, recomputes the stage payload hash, writes the corresponding approval file, commits it, and pushes it back to the base branch. Omit `--execute` to print the planned `gh` and `git` commands without changing GitHub or the local checkout.

The bundled `github-pr-auto-complete` workflow can run the same closure loop from GitHub Actions. It starts from an approved review, a successful check suite, or manual `workflow_dispatch`.

The workflow serializes each PR with a `sqlserver2tidb-pr-<number>` concurrency group, checks out the base branch, runs `complete-github-pr --execute`, and records workflow audit metadata in the approval file.

Configure `SQLSERVER2TIDB_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN` when branch protection or automated PR approval requires a GitHub App or fine-grained token. Otherwise the workflow falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN` and can still close PRs that are already human-approved and mergeable by the default token.

If the approval file already reflects the same merged PR and payload hash, the command preserves the existing approval audit block and exits without `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push`.

When an external workflow or human operator has already merged the PR, synchronize its approval status back into the project approval file:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb sync-github-pr-approval \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage schema \
  --pr 42 \
  --repo BornChanger/sqlserver2tidb
```

The sync command calls `gh pr view`, requires `state: MERGED`, `reviewDecision: APPROVED`, passed checks, at least one approving reviewer, and a PR file list restricted to that stage's review scope. It then recomputes the stage payload hash and writes the corresponding `approvals/<stage>-approval.yaml` file. The bundled `github-pr-approval-sync` workflow runs this command from `pull_request_target` after an approval-stage PR is merged, uses the same per-PR concurrency group as auto-complete, and preserves an existing current approval file so it does not overwrite the audit block produced by `github-pr-auto-complete`. Set `SQLSERVER2TIDB_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN` to a GitHub App or fine-grained token if branch protection does not allow `GITHUB_TOKEN` to push the generated approval commit.

Compute the validation payload hash before approving validation:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb compute-payload-hash \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a \
  --stage validation
```

After `plan/validation-plan.yaml` is reviewed and `approvals/validation-approval.yaml` is set to `status: approved` with that hash, run the validation-only worker:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sqlserver2tidb worker-validate \
  --root . \
  --source-cluster-id prod-sqlserver-a \
  --project-id sales-db-to-tidb-prod-a
```

This checks approved metadata, writes `state/validation-status.yaml`, and writes `evidence/validation-report.md`. The validation plan structural check message includes a supported check-type summary, for example `1 row_count, 1 checksum, 1 sampled_hash, 16 bucketed_count, 1 business_sql`. If `evidence/executor-validation-run.json` exists, the worker also validates that executor evidence against the current approval hash and adds an executor-evidence summary to the validation status/report; failed validation commands make the worker result `failed`.

## Design Principles

- `https://github.com/BornChanger/sqlserver2tidb` is the source of truth for migration control metadata.
- Metadata is organized by upstream SQL Server cluster.
- A source cluster can contain multiple migration projects.
- LLM output is never executed directly. It must become reviewed repository files first.
- Workers execute only approved and merged instructions.
- Project migration state phases are restricted to `planning`, `ddl`, `export`, `import`, `cdc`, `validation`, `cutover`, or `completed`; status is restricted to `not_started`, `planned`, `running`, `completed`, or `failed`; and `updated_at` must be RFC3339.
- Export/import state phase and status fields are optional during initialization, but phase must match `export`/`import` and status must be `planned` when present; their optional `updated_at` fields must be RFC3339.
- Validation status state is restricted to `pending`, `passed`, or `failed`; its optional phase must be `validation`, and when present `updated_at` must be RFC3339.
- State `payload_hash` fields are optional during initialization, but must use `sha256:<64 hex chars>` when present.
- High-frequency logs and per-event CDC offsets do not belong in GitHub. Periodic checkpoint snapshots do.
- CDC checkpoint snapshots stay source-cluster scoped; their mode must match the source cluster `cdc.mode`, optional phase must be `cdc`, status must be one of `not_started`, `planned`, `running`, `caught_up`, or `failed`, `updated_at` must be RFC3339, and table checkpoint entries must carry SQL Server source objects as `schema.table` or `database.schema.table`, TiDB target objects as `table` or `database.table`, 10-byte hex `from_lsn` / `to_lsn` with `from_lsn <= to_lsn`, non-negative `applied_changes`, and RFC3339 `completed_at`.
- Plaintext credentials must never be committed. Use secret references only.

## Next Milestones

- Extend `sqlserver2tidb-executor export` beyond CSV over local file/HTTP(S)/S3/GCS/Azure Blob to reviewed production formats.
- Extend `sqlserver2tidb-executor import` with more production import controls, including richer `IMPORT INTO` / Lightning options, TLS/security settings, and provider-specific Lightning credential validation.
- Extend validation beyond exact-numeric scalar-query checksum/sample-hash and integer bucketed-count checks to broader row digest generators and production-grade bucketed sampled-hash strategies.
