A native macOS SQL Server client in the shape of SQL Server Management Studio:
Object Explorer, a T-SQL editor with IntelliSense, a results grid, execution plans,
scripting, an editable data grid, activity monitoring, backup/restore, flat-file import,
Standard Reports, Query Store and the error log viewer — plus **Schema Compare** and
**Data Compare**, modelled on Redgate SQL Compare and SQL Data Compare, in the app and
on the command line.

It talks to SQL Server directly. There is **no ODBC driver, FreeTDS, Docker container
or JVM to install** — the TDS 7.4 protocol is implemented in Swift inside this repo.

## Install

### Installer package — recommended

Download `SSMS-for-Mac-<version>.pkg` from
[Releases](https://github.com/Bornanaj/SSMS_MAC/releases), open it, and step through
Introduction → Read Me → License → Destination → Install. It asks for your password
once, because writing to `/Applications` needs administrator rights.

The quarantine flag macOS attaches to a download lands on the `.pkg`, not on the payload
it writes, so **the installed app opens with no Gatekeeper prompt**.

The installer itself is still challenged once, because this build is not notarized:

> "Apple could not verify … is free of malware."

On **macOS 15 and later** the old right-click → Open trick no longer clears this. Do one
of these instead:

- **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll to the message naming the file, and
  press **Open Anyway**; or
- clear the flag from a terminal:

  ```bash
  xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/SSMS-for-Mac-*.pkg
  ```

  `./Scripts/allow-download.sh <file>` does the same thing and explains what it is doing.

A package you built yourself is never quarantined, so `./Scripts/make-pkg.sh release`
followed by opening `build/SSMS-for-Mac-<version>.pkg` shows no prompt at all.

### Build from source

One command. The app is compiled on your machine, so macOS never quarantines it and
opens it with **no Gatekeeper prompt**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bornanaj/SSMS_MAC.git
cd SSMS_MAC && ./Scripts/install.sh
```

Needs macOS 14+ and the Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`). Full Xcode
is not required — the build uses SwiftPM and assembles the `.app` bundle by hand.

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap bornanaj/ssms https://github.com/Bornanaj/SSMS_MAC.git
brew install --HEAD bornanaj/ssms/ssms-mac
```

### Disk image

Grab the `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/Bornanaj/SSMS_MAC/releases) and drag
the app to Applications. This is the drag-and-drop route; the `.pkg` above is the
stepped installer.

Unless the release notes say the build is notarized, macOS will ask:

> Apple could not verify "SSMS for Mac" is free of malware…

That is the quarantine flag macOS attaches to *anything* downloaded, not a problem with
the app. On macOS 15 and later, clear it through **System Settings → Privacy & Security →
Open Anyway**, or from a terminal:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/SSMS for Mac.app"
```

The `.pkg` above avoids this for the app entirely, which is why it is the recommended
download.

Removing that prompt for downloads requires an Apple Developer ID certificate and Apple
notarization ($99/year); the release pipeline already implements it and switches on as
soon as the signing secrets exist. [docs/CODE_SIGNING.md](docs/CODE_SIGNING.md) explains
the whole mechanism.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 or later, Apple silicon or Intel
- Swift 6 toolchain — the **Command Line Tools are enough**, Xcode is not required
- A reachable SQL Server 2016–2022, Azure SQL Database, or Azure SQL Managed Instance

## Building by hand

```bash
swift build -c release          # libraries and executables
./Scripts/build-app.sh release  # -> build/SSMS for Mac.app
./Scripts/make-dmg.sh release   # -> build/SSMS-for-Mac-1.0.0.dmg
```

## Features

**Connecting**
- SQL Server authentication, Windows authentication (NTLMv2), Microsoft Entra ID access tokens
- Encryption: mandatory (default), strict (TDS 8.0), or off; optional certificate trust
- Named instances resolved through the SQL Browser (UDP 1434)
- Saved connections with passwords in the login keychain, per‑connection tab colours
- Azure SQL redirection (ENVCHANGE routing) is followed automatically

**Object Explorer**
- The SSMS tree: Databases → Tables/Views/Programmability/Storage/Security, plus
  server‑level Security, Server Objects and Management
- Lazy expansion, one round trip per folder, name filter, system‑object toggle
- Context menus: Select Top 1000 Rows, Edit Top 200 Rows, Script as
  CREATE/ALTER/DROP/SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, Properties, Refresh
- Scripting also covers the kinds with no `sys.sql_modules` body: synonyms, sequences,
  user-defined data and table types, schemas, users, roles, logins, partition functions
  and schemes, and XML schema collections

**Query editor**
- T‑SQL syntax colouring, line numbers, current‑line highlight
- IntelliSense that understands aliases: `c.` after `FROM dbo.Customers AS c` lists that
  table's columns; `EXEC sales.` lists only procedures
- Signature help, snippets, block indent, comment toggle, SQL formatter
- `GO` batch splitting including `GO 5`, comment‑ and string‑aware
- F5 executes, ⇧F5 executes the selection, ⌘. cancels (a real TDS attention)

**Results**
- Virtualised grid backed by `NSTableView`; 100k rows stay responsive
- Results to Grid or Results to Text, the fixed-width output sqlcmd prints
- Query Options dialog for the SET flags, isolation level and row limits
- Multiple result sets, Messages with clickable error lines, client statistics
- Actual and estimated execution plans with per‑operator cost and missing‑index hints
- Export to CSV, TSV, JSON, XML, Markdown, HTML, SQL INSERT and XLSX

**Design and scripting**
- Table Designer: add, drop and alter columns, defaults, identity and primary keys, with
  the ALTER batch shown before it runs
- Generate Scripts for a whole database, dependency-ordered, to the clipboard or a file
- View Dependencies in both directions, from `sys.sql_expression_dependencies`
- Template Explorer with 30+ ready T-SQL templates and the "Specify Values for Template
  Parameters" dialog (⇧⌘M)

**Administration**
- Activity Monitor: processes, resource waits, expensive queries, file I/O, KILL, plus a
  Blocking tab that arranges the waiters into chains and names the head of the worst one
- Database and table properties, index fragmentation with rebuild/reorganize
- Backup and restore script generation, `RESTORE HEADERONLY` / `FILELISTONLY` inspection
- Attach, detach, shrink and disk usage, each showing its script first
- Import Flat File with delimiter sniffing, encoding detection and type inference

**Monitoring**
- Reports: 18 of SSMS's Standard Reports, from the server dashboard to missing indexes
- Query Store: top resource consumers by seven metrics, regressed queries against a
  baseline window, forced plans with their failure reason, plan forcing and unforcing, and
  the stored showplan opened in the operator tree — which is the only way to see the plan
  for a query that finished hours ago
- SQL Server and SQL Agent error logs through `sp_readerrorlog`, with archive selection,
  server-side filtering and a severity column inferred from the wording
- SQL Server Agent: jobs, steps, schedules as sentences, history, start/stop/enable

**Schema Compare** (Tools → New Schema Comparison, ⌥⌘K, or a database's *Compare* menu)
- Compares a live database, a snapshot (`.ssnap`) or a scripts folder with any of the three
- Covers tables (columns, keys, indexes, constraints, triggers, statistics, full-text,
  temporal, memory-optimized, partitioning), views, procedures, functions (T-SQL and CLR),
  synonyms, sequences, types, table types, XML schema collections, assemblies, partition
  functions and schemes, schemas, users, roles, application roles, permissions, extended
  properties, rules, defaults, security policies, full-text catalogs and stoplists,
  Service Broker objects and DDL triggers
- Results grouped by outcome (different, only in source, only in target, identical) or by
  type, with a side-by-side SQL diff and a plain-language list of what changed
- 49 comparison and deployment options: whitespace, comments, case, brackets, collations,
  fill factor, filegroups, compression, identity seed, constraint names, permissions,
  statistics, trigger order, WITH NOCHECK, … and dependency handling, smart defaults,
  existence checks, drop-and-create, transactions, error handling, ONLINE index builds
- Owner (schema) mapping, object mapping for renamed objects, column mapping, and
  include/exclude filters by type, name and schema (equals, LIKE, regex, …)
- Deployment wizard: every action and the dependencies it pulled in, warnings by
  severity (data loss, table rebuilds, dropped columns), the full script, and deployment
  in one transaction that rolls back on the first error. Tables are altered in place where
  SQL Server allows it and rebuilt with their data kept where it does not; foreign keys,
  schema-bound views and dependent objects are dropped and restored around the change
- Deploy to a database or update a scripts folder file by file; save the script, open it
  in a query window, or run it
- Projects (`.scmp`), snapshots, scripts folders, and HTML, Excel, XML, CSV and JSON reports

**Data Compare** (Tools → New Data Comparison, ⌥⇧⌘K, or a database's *Compare* menu)
- Pairs tables and views automatically, including across schemas with owner mapping, and
  lets you pair tables whose names differ
- Comparison key per table: primary key, a unique constraint or index, or any columns
  you choose; choose the compared columns and add a WHERE filter for each side
- SQL Server's own equality: collation-aware text (case and accent sensitivity), trailing
  spaces ignored, numbers by value across types, datetimeoffset by instant; options for
  binary collation, white space, empty strings as NULL, float precision, fractional
  seconds, identity/computed/rowversion/LOB columns, and a CHECKSUM shortcut
- Row counts per table by outcome, and a row grid with source and target values side by
  side, differing cells highlighted, and a deploy checkbox per row
- Synchronization wizard: inserts, updates and deletes per table, warnings, the script,
  and deployment. Exactly the enabled foreign keys and triggers are switched off and back
  on (re-checked so they stay trusted), deletes run child-first and inserts parent-first,
  identity values are kept with IDENTITY_INSERT, and identities can be reseeded
- Projects (`.dcmp`) and HTML, Excel, XML, CSV and JSON reports

## Comparing from the command line

`ssms-compare` runs both comparisons without the app — for build pipelines, scheduled
drift checks and release scripts:

```bash
swift build -c release --product ssms-compare

# What differs? Report it; exit code 79 means differences, 63 identical.
.build/release/ssms-compare schema \
    --source-server dev --source-database Shop \
    --target-server prod --target-database Shop \
    --report drift.html

# Deploy a scripts folder from source control, refusing if data could be lost.
.build/release/ssms-compare schema --source-scripts ./database \
    --target-server prod --target-database Shop \
    --abort-on-warnings high --script deploy.sql --deploy

# Synchronize two tables' rows.
.build/release/ssms-compare data \
    --source-server dev --source-database Shop --target-server test --target-database Shop \
    --include-table dbo.Product,dbo.Category --deploy
```

Passwords come from `--source-password` / `--target-password` or the `SSMS_SOURCE_PASSWORD`,
`SSMS_TARGET_PASSWORD` and `SQL_PASSWORD` environment variables. Projects saved in the app
run unchanged with `--project`. `ssms-compare help` lists every option.

## Data fidelity

Values are decoded from the wire, not through an intermediate driver, so they render the
way SSMS renders them:

| Type | Rendered as |
|---|---|
| `decimal(38,10)` | `12345678901234567890123456.7890000000` (never via `Double`) |
| `datetime` | `1999-12-31 23:59:59.997` (1/300 s ticks) |
| `datetime2(7)` | `2024-06-15 08:30:15.1234567` |
| `datetimeoffset(7)` | `2024-06-15 08:30:15.1234567 +03:30` |
| `real` | `3.14159`, not `3.141590118408203` |
| `money` | `1234.5678` |
| `varchar` in a Persian/Arabic collation | decoded through Windows‑1256 |

Non‑Unicode columns are decoded using the code page implied by the column's collation, so
`varchar` data in `Arabic_CI_AS` or `Persian_100_CI_AS` reads correctly instead of turning
into mojibake.

## Testing

```bash
swift run ssms-tests          # 310 offline regression checks, no server needed
swift run tdscli all          # service smoke tests against a live server
./.build/debug/ssms-mac --selftest   # drives the real UI models end to end
```

The live tests read `SQL_HOST`, `SQL_PORT`, `SQL_USER`, `SQL_PASSWORD` and `SQL_DB`.
To bring up a server to test against:

```bash
docker run -d --platform linux/amd64 --name ssms-mac-test \
  -e ACCEPT_EULA=Y -e 'MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=Str0ngP@ssw0rd!' -e MSSQL_PID=Developer \
  -p 11433:1433 mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
```

## Known limitations

- Login‑only encryption (`ENCRYPT_OFF`) is not implemented; connections are either fully
  encrypted or fully plaintext. Every SQL Server since 2005 supports full encryption.
- Windows authentication uses NTLMv2. Kerberos and channel binding are not implemented,
  so a server configured to require them will reject the login.
- MARS is not negotiated. Each query window owns its own connection, which is how SSMS
  behaves anyway.
- The execution plan is a cost‑annotated operator tree, not the SSMS graphical canvas.
- Always On, Replication, Service Broker and SQL Agent job editing are not implemented;
  SQL Agent jobs are listed but not editable.
- The error log viewer needs membership of `securityadmin`, because that is what
  `sp_readerrorlog` requires. It reports the permission error rather than an empty log.
- Query Store needs SQL Server 2016 or later, and the reports stay empty until the first
  collection interval closes after switching it on.
- Schema Compare reads live databases, snapshots and scripts folders; backup files and
  direct source-control links are not data sources (a scripts folder kept in Git is the
  equivalent). Data Compare compares live databases only.
- Deploying to a snapshot is not possible — save the script and run it instead.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. `./Scripts/test.sh` runs the offline suite, plus
the live suites when a SQL Server is reachable on `SQL_HOST:SQL_PORT`. CI runs the
offline suite and builds the bundle on every push.
