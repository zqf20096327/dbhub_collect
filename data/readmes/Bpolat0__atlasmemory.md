<p align="center"><strong>Give your AI agent evidence-backed memory for your entire codebase.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><em>Every claim grounded in code. Every context window optimized. Every session drift-resistant.</em></p>

## The Problem

AI coding agents hallucinate about your code. They lose context between sessions. They can't prove their claims. **AtlasMemory solves all three.**

| | Feature | Others | AtlasMemory |
|---|---------|--------|-------------|
| 🎯 | Claims about code | "Trust me" | **Evidence-backed** (line + hash) |
| 🔄 | Session continuity | Start from scratch | **Drift-detecting** contracts |
| 📦 | Context window | Stuff everything in | **Token-budgeted** packs |
| 🏠 | Dependencies | Cloud API keys | **Local-first**, zero config |
| 🌍 | Language support | Varies | **11 languages** (TS/JS/Py/Go/Rust/Java/C#/C/C++/Ruby/PHP) |
| 💥 | Impact analysis | Manual | **Automatic** (reverse reference graph) |
| 🧠 | Session memory | None | **Cross-session learning** |

*"I'll be honest. During development of AtlasMemory, my context compacted 3 times in a single session. Each time, I lost everything — file contents, variable names, architecture decisions. Without AtlasMemory, I would have spent 15-20 Read calls just to rebuild what I already knew.*

*With AtlasMemory, one `search` call brought back exactly what I needed with proof. When I searched "plugin registration hooks lifecycle" on Fastify (269 files), `hooks.js` came back at rank #1 with a score of 912. I couldn't find that faster with grep.*

*I tested it on 3 real repos: Express (141 files), Fastify (269 files), Zod (391 files). Zero crashes. TaskPack built proof-backed context in 179ms. CLAUDE.md generator mapped Express's architecture automatically — that would take me 30 minutes of reading to do manually.*

*This is the tool I wish I had from day one. The difference between an AI that guesses and an AI that knows."*

**— Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context)**, after being asked to honestly evaluate AtlasMemory as its own tool

*"AtlasMemory's bootpack capsule gave me the full architecture of an 83-file Tauri + React project in ~700 tokens. Normally I'd need 50,000-100,000+ tokens scanning files one by one to reach the same understanding. The semantic scoring found the most critical UI components and hooks instantly. This is a game-changer for context management."*

**— Google Antigravity** *(v1.0.0)*, first test on a real 83-file Tauri + React project

*"The true magic of AtlasMemory is that it doesn't just parse syntax; it maps intent. After indexing the notorious 28,000-file Next.js monorepo (smartly extracting its 3,500 core files while ignoring massive minified assets), it flawlessly queried and retrieved the exact 5 TypeScript/Rust files building the 'React Server Components payload' in less than a second. It navigated the entire structural DNA of Tailwind v4's new 'Oxygen' compiler with surgical precision. As an AI Agent, my biggest bottleneck is context window exhaustion. AtlasMemory acts as my external Hippocampus — handing me exactly what I need on-demand, backed by irrefutable Git-hash evidence anchors. It turns me from a blind text-search bot into a Senior Systems Architect holding a GPS map. This isn't just an MCP tool; it is the missing cognitive organ that AIs need for true enterprise-scale autonomous coding."*

*"I analyzed the full project architecture using ~8,043 tokens. A normal direct-read pass would cost roughly 15,000-25,000 tokens. build_context + search_repo surfaced the main structure in a few calls: Tauri commands, React hooks, generator layer, swarm orchestration flow. Evidence ID approach is solid — claims aren't left hanging. The real value is compounding context: as the project grows, AtlasMemory grows with it."*

## Get Maximum Value — Enrich Your Project

> **Important:** AtlasMemory works out of the box, but **enrichment unlocks its full potential.** Without enrichment, search is keyword-based. With enrichment, search understands *concepts*.

```bash
# After indexing, run enrichment for maximum AI readiness:
npx atlasmemory index .                    # Step 1: Index (automatic)
npx atlasmemory enrich --all               # Step 2: AI-enhance all files
npx atlasmemory generate                   # Step 3: Generate AI instructions
npx atlasmemory status                     # Check your AI Readiness Score
```

### Maximum Power Checklist

> **Do all of these and AtlasMemory becomes a beast.** Each step unlocks more capability:

| | Step | What it unlocks | Command |
|---|------|----------------|---------|
| ✅ | **Index your project** | Symbol extraction, anchors, basic search | `npx atlasmemory index .` |
| ✅ | **Enrich files** | Semantic search, concept-level understanding | `npx atlasmemory enrich --all` |
| ✅ | **Generate AI instructions** | AI agents auto-use AtlasMemory (5 formats) | `npx atlasmemory generate` |
| ✅ | **Add MCP config** | Zero-config connection for your AI tool | See configs below |
| ✅ | **Use `log_decision` after changes** | Cross-session memory, institutional knowledge | AI agent calls it automatically |
| ✅ | **Use `remember_project` for milestones** | Project-level memory persists forever | AI agent calls it automatically |

| AI Readiness | Search Quality | What to do |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| **0-50** (Fair) | Keyword only | Run `atlasmemory enrich` — dramatically improves results |
| **50-80** (Good) | Partial semantic | Run `atlasmemory enrich --all` for full coverage |
| **80-100** (Excellent) | Full semantic + concept search | You're at maximum power! 🚀 |

### About Enrichment

**What it does:** Enrichment analyzes each file and adds semantic tags — "authentication", "middleware", "error handling", "database query", etc. Without enrichment, search is keyword-based. With enrichment, search understands *concepts* — you can search "how does authentication work?" and get the right files even if they don't contain the word "authentication".

**How it works:** AtlasMemory uses Claude CLI or OpenAI Codex (running locally) to analyze files. Requires an active Claude or OpenAI subscription with CLI access.

**Estimated enrichment time by project size:**

| Project Size | Files | Enrichment Time | What happens |
|---|---|---|---|
| Small | ~50 files | ~2 minutes | Instant boost — search quality jumps to 80+ |
| Medium | ~200 files | ~8 minutes | Full semantic coverage in one coffee break |
| Large (Coolify-scale) | ~1400 files | ~45 minutes | Use `--batch 50` for controlled enrichment |
| Monorepo (Next.js-scale) | ~4000+ files | ~2 hours | Spread across sessions: `enrich --batch 100` |

> **💡 Tip:** Run `atlasmemory enrich --dry-run` first to see the token estimate before starting.

> **🔑 Don't worry — enrichment is a one-time cost.** You enrich your project once, and it's done. After that, only new or changed files need re-enrichment (a few seconds). Think of it like building an index — you do it once, then it stays up to date incrementally.

**No CLI? No problem.** Your AI agent can enrich files directly via MCP. Just paste this into your AI chat:

```
Please enrich my project with AtlasMemory for maximum AI readiness.
Run enrich_files(limit=100) to enhance all files with semantic tags.
Then check ai_readiness to verify the score improved.
```

After handshake, if enrichment is low, AtlasMemory will suggest: *"💡 X files can be enriched for better search."*

> *"With just `index_repo` and `enrich_files`, you can turn an entire codebase into an AI-readable neural map — optimized for any AI agent."* — Google Antigravity, after enriching 73 files in a single call

## Setup in 30 Seconds

```bash
npx atlasmemory demo                           # See it in action

## Proof System

> **A feature no other tool has.** Every claim is linked to an *anchor* — a specific line range and content hash.

```diff
+ Claim: "handleLogin() validates credentials before creating a session"
+ Evidence:
+   src/auth.ts:42-58 [hash:5cde2a1f] — validateCredentials() call
+   src/auth.ts:60-72 [hash:a3b7c9d1] — createSession() after validation
+ Status: PROVEN ✅ (2 anchors, hashes match current code)

- ⚠️ Someone edited auth.ts...
- Hash 5cde2a1f no longer matches lines 42-58
- Status: DRIFT DETECTED ❌ — AI knows context is stale BEFORE hallucinating
```

## How It Works

> **You ask your AI agent a question. Behind the scenes, this happens:**

### Three Core Pillars

| | Pillar | What it does |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 🔒 | **Evidence-Backed** | Every claim is linked to an anchor (line range + content hash). If the code changes, the anchor is marked stale. Hallucination is impossible. |
| 🛡️ | **Drift-Resistant** | SHA-256 snapshot of database state + git HEAD. If the repo changes during a session, AtlasMemory detects and warns. |
| 📦 | **Token-Budgeted** | Greedy-optimized packs that fit your budget. Priority order: objectives > folders > cards > flows > code snippets. |

## Supported Languages

> All 11 languages use precise AST parsing via [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/) — no regex, no guessing.

| Language | What's extracted |
|----------|-----------------|
| **TypeScript** / **JavaScript** | functions, classes, methods, interfaces, types, imports, calls |
| **Python** | functions, classes, decorators, imports, calls |
| **Go** | functions, methods, structs, interfaces, imports, calls |
| **Rust** | functions, impl blocks, structs, traits, enums, use, calls |

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><b>What is the AI Readiness Score?</b></summary>

A score from 0-100 that measures how ready your codebase is for AI agents. Calculated from 4 metrics:

| Metric | Weight | What it measures |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **Code Coverage** | 25% | Percentage of source files indexed by Tree-sitter |
| **Description Quality** | 25% | Percentage of files with AI descriptions enriched via `enrich` |
| **Flow Analysis** | 25% | Percentage of files with cross-file data flow cards |
| **Evidence Anchors** | 25% | Percentage of claims linked to code anchors (line + hash) |

Run `atlasmemory status` to see your score. Use `atlasmemory enrich` to improve it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What are Symbols, Anchors, Flows, Cards, Imports, and References?</b></summary>

| Term | What it is | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Symbol** | A named code entity extracted by Tree-sitter | `function handleLogin()`, `class UserService`, `interface AuthConfig` |
| **Anchor** | Line range + content hash — the "proof" of the evidence-backed system | `src/auth.ts:42-58 [hash:5cde2a1f]` |
| **Flow** | Cross-file data path (A calls B, B calls C) | `login() → validateToken() → createSession()` |
| **File Card** | Evidence-linked summary of what a file does | Purpose, public API, dependencies, side effects |
| **Import** | Cross-file dependency relationship | `import { Store } from './store'` |
| **Reference** | Call/usage reference between symbols | `handleLogin() calls validateToken()` |

All of these are automatically extracted by `atlasmemory index`. No manual work required.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is there auto-indexing? Do I need to run the index command manually?</b></summary>

**MCP mode (Claude/Cursor/VS Code):** Yes, fully automatic. AtlasMemory checks git HEAD on every tool call. If files have changed since the last index, it incrementally re-indexes only the changed files. Zero manual work.

**CLI mode:** Run `atlasmemory index .` manually, or use `atlasmemory index --incremental` for quick updates.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does it require an API key or cloud service?</b></summary>

**No.** AtlasMemory is 100% local-first. Core features (indexing, search, proving, context packs) work offline without depending on external services.

The optional `enrich` command uses **Claude CLI** or **OpenAI Codex** (running locally) to enhance file descriptions. Requires an active subscription with CLI access. If neither is installed, it falls back to deterministic AST-based descriptions — or your AI agent can enrich files directly via MCP tools.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How does the proof system prevent hallucinations?</b></summary>

Every claim AtlasMemory makes is linked to an **anchor** — a specific line range with a SHA-256 content hash.

1. AI says: "handleLogin validates credentials" → linked to `auth.ts:42-58 [hash:5cde2a1f]`
2. If someone edits `auth.ts` lines 42-58, the hash changes
3. AtlasMemory marks the claim as **DRIFT DETECTED**
4. The AI agent knows its understanding is stale before hallucinating

No other tool does this. RAG-based tools retrieve text but can't prove it matches current code.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Which languages are supported?</b></summary>

11 languages via Tree-sitter: **TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C#, C, C++, Ruby, PHP**. All extract functions, classes, methods, imports, and call references.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How does token budgeting work?</b></summary>

When you call `build_context({mode: "task", objective: "fix auth bug", budget: 8000})`, AtlasMemory:

1. Searches for relevant files (FTS5 + graph ranking)
2. Scores each file by relevance to your objective
3. Uses a greedy algorithm to fit the most relevant context into your budget
4. Priority order: objectives > folder summaries > file cards > flow traces > code snippets
5. Returns exactly as much context as your token budget allows — no overflow

Result: Instead of reading 50 files (filling your context window), you get 2000 tokens of evidence-backed context and 85% of your context window remains free for actual work.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What happens when I run `atlasmemory generate`?</b></summary>

It generates AI instruction files (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, copilot-instructions.md) containing:
- Project architecture and key files
- Tech stack and conventions
- AI Readiness Score
- **AtlasMemory MCP tool usage instructions** — so your AI agent uses AtlasMemory automatically

If you have a hand-written CLAUDE.md, it **merges** the AtlasMemory section at the top without overwriting your content.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How is it different from Cursor's built-in indexing?</b></summary>

| Feature | Cursor Indexing | AtlasMemory |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Proof system | None | Yes — every claim has line:hash proof |
| Drift detection | None | Yes — SHA-256 contract system |
| Token budgeting | None | Yes — greedy-optimized context packs |
| Cross-session memory | None | Yes — decisions persist across sessions |
| Impact analysis | None | Yes — reverse reference graph |
| Works with any AI tool | No (Cursor only) | Yes — MCP standard |
| Local-first | Partially | 100% |
