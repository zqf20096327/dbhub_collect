## ✨ Features

### 🌐 Website Management
- **Nginx, Apache2, OpenLiteSpeed, Caddy** — install and manage from the same panel
- **One-click SSL** via Let's Encrypt — auto-detects Cloudflare DNS-01 vs HTTP-01
- Reverse proxy, custom directives, PHP version per site, Composer integration
- One-click WordPress/Laravel/Symfony deploy
- PHP webshell scanner integrated with the File Manager
- **Per-site disk usage** (lazy-loaded, won't slow down servers with many/large sites)
- **Global SSL expiry alerts** on the Dashboard, aggregated across every site

### 🔵 Go Projects & 💚 Node.js Projects
Deploy compiled Go binaries and Node.js apps with the same one-click simplicity as WordPress — a capability none of cPanel, Plesk, aaPanel, or HestiaCP offer out of the box:
- **Go**: binary-only deployment, Go SDK manager (multiple versions side by side), GOPROXY config, systemd auto-restart, resource limits (`MemoryMax`/`CPUQuota`), on-demand TCP health checks, binary version history with one-click rollback
- **Node.js**: PM2 or systemd per project, nvm-based version switching, current LTS reality (v24 Active, v22 Maintenance, v18/v20 correctly blocked as EOL)
- Both: reverse proxy on all 4 webservers with **WebSocket support**, Let's Encrypt SSL per domain, firewall integration, all 9 supported distros

### 📥 Website Import Wizard
Migrate a site off cPanel, aaPanel, or HestiaCP by uploading its backup archive — no SSH pull required:
- **Detect → confirm → import** flow — every auto-detected field (domain, PHP version, document root, database) is editable before anything executes
- Imported sites use the exact same code path as "New Website", so they're indistinguishable from natively-created ones
- Fresh random database password generated on import (originals are never in a backup dump)
- Files + database in this release; email/cron/SSL migration not yet included

### 🔷 WP Toolkit
Full WordPress lifecycle management — install, manage, secure, stage, back up — no separate plugin or paid add-on:
- **Full install** in one click: downloads WP, creates DB, writes `wp-config.php`, runs the installer, creates the vhost, configures SSL — done
- **PHP 7.4 → 8.5**, **Nginx / Apache / OpenLiteSpeed / Caddy**, **MariaDB / MySQL** — pick any combination
- Plugin & theme management, one-click admin login (no password needed), bulk updates
- **Security scanner** — 9 checks with one-click auto-fix buttons
- **Staging clone** — full site clone with DB, push/pull between staging and live, auto-backup before push
- Backup/restore, maintenance mode, system cron, debug mode toggle
- Auto-generates non-default admin username + randomised table prefix on install (security by default)

### 🔒 Server Security
- **Firewall** — UFW (Debian/Ubuntu) **and** firewalld (Fedora/RHEL/AlmaLinux/Rocky/Oracle/CentOS/CloudLinux) from the same UI
- **Fail2ban** — intrusion prevention, brute-force protection
- **ModSecurity WAF** — OWASP CRS v4, 3-state engine (Blocking/Detection/Off), paranoia level 1–4, custom rule editor, audit log viewer, per-site override, weekly auto-update cron
- **SSH Hardening** — create sudo users, add SSH keys, disable root login, disable password auth, change port — all with built-in safety checks that block you from locking yourself out
- **Security Score** dashboard — SSH config, firewall (UFW or firewalld), Fail2ban, auto-updates, panel password strength, 2FA status, secret key — all in one glance

### 🛡 Panel Security *(hardened to OWASP standards)*
- **Argon2id password hashing** (OWASP's #1 recommendation) with transparent migration from legacy SHA-256/bcrypt — existing users never notice
- **2FA / TOTP** — QR-code setup with any authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password), required on every login once enabled
- **Brute-force lockout** — 5 failed attempts → 15-minute lockout, persists across panel restarts
- **Panel HTTPS** — self-signed or Let's Encrypt, served on your **custom port** (never the well-known 443), so enabling HTTPS never makes the panel newly discoverable by a generic port scan
- **IP allowlist**, session timeout, login audit log, auto-generated 64-byte secret key, security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS-ready) on every response

### 🗄 Databases
- MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB — multi-engine
- phpMyAdmin integration (auto-configured on its own port, separate PHP version)

### 📦 App Store
- **27** one-click installs: Nginx, Apache, OpenLiteSpeed, Caddy, PHP (multi-version), MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, **Memcached**, **FFmpeg** (multi-version, side by side), Docker, Node.js, Python, Composer, Fail2ban, ClamAV, ModSecurity, Roundcube, Supervisor, Pure-FTPd, BIND9 DNS, and more
- **Live installation terminal** — every install, uninstall, and version switch streams real-time output line-by-line (like aaPanel's task terminal)
- Automatic conflict detection, RHEL-family package manager support — **all 5 previously-broken RHEL install paths (nginx, MySQL, Caddy, MongoDB, PostgreSQL) fixed**, tested on both x86_64 and arm64
- **Safe database version policy** — databases (MariaDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB) require uninstall-first to prevent data corruption; version switching kept for non-data modules

### ⚙ Settings — redesigned card-based control center
- **Network & Access** — panel port (auto-updates firewall), custom domain, webroot
- **Panel SSL** — one-click self-signed or Let's Encrypt, validity countdown, automatic safe cutover (no downtime race conditions)
- **Authentication & Security** — 2FA, password, IP allowlist, session timeout, all at a glance
- **PHP Webshell Scanner** — pick a path, scan, get severity-coded results with file/line/snippet
- **Panel Settings** — auto-update, timezone, NTP sync, hostname, OS package updates
- **System Information** — OS, kernel, IP, uptime, version, all in one card

### ⚡ Performance
- Dashboard stats from `/proc` (not `top -bn1`) — **10× faster**
- Response caching for expensive endpoints, gzip compression on all responses
- `app.js` 150KB → ~40KB, `index.html` 350KB → ~70KB over the wire

### 🔧 Everything else
- **Docker** — container management, 45+ pre-configured image catalog, **domain assignment + automatic SSL** (reuses the same reverse-proxy code as Go/Node.js Projects, no Traefik needed)
- **DNS** — BIND9 zone management + Cloudflare DDNS
- **Mail** — Postfix + Dovecot, domains, accounts, Roundcube webmail
- **CDN** — Cloudflare, BunnyCDN, Akamai, CloudFront, KeyCDN
- **Monitoring & Dashboard** — realtime CPU/RAM/Network charts, process list, bandwidth, **login audit log viewer**
- **File Manager** — code editor, chmod, AES-encrypted zip support, ClamAV scan
- **Web Terminal** — full PTY shell in browser over WebSocket
- **Backups** — website + database, restore, S3-compatible cloud backup
- **Cron Jobs** — visual scheduler, 10 task types, run-now, logs
- **AI Assistant** — configurable OpenAI-compatible API (NeonCodex, OpenAI, etc.)

## 🚀 Quick Install

```bash
wget -O install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrowserlessAPI/VortexPanel/main/install.sh && bash install.sh
```
If wget not default installed.
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrowserlessAPI/VortexPanel/main/install.sh && bash install.sh
```
Access the panel at: **`http://YOUR-SERVER-IP:8888`**

The installer auto-detects your OS and package manager. On RHEL 8-family systems (AlmaLinux 8 / Rocky 8, where default Python is 3.6) it automatically installs Python 3.11.

**First things to do after install:** change the default password, enable 2FA, and enable Panel SSL — all from Settings.

## 🗺 Roadmap

**v3.4 — shipped:**
- [x] Go Projects — binary deployment, Go SDK manager, WebSocket proxy, Let's Encrypt per-domain, resource limits, health checks, version rollback
- [x] Node.js Projects — PM2 + systemd, nvm version switching
- [x] Website Import wizard — cPanel, aaPanel, HestiaCP backup upload (files + database)
- [x] FFmpeg Manager — multi-version side-by-side install (7.1/8.1/nightly), x86_64 + arm64
- [x] Memcached — full Service/Config/Switch Version/Load Status/Optimization management
- [x] Docker container domain assignment + automatic SSL (no Traefik)
- [x] Dashboard realtime CPU/RAM/Network charts, global SSL expiry alerts
- [x] Settings → Login audit log viewer
- [x] Per-site disk usage
- [x] RHEL-family install fixes — nginx, MySQL, Caddy, MongoDB, PostgreSQL now install correctly on RHEL/CentOS/Fedora/AlmaLinux/Rocky
- [x] arm64 fixes — MongoDB and PostgreSQL RHEL install paths
- [x] Modal/layout system overhaul — centering, horizontal scrollbar, cross-component scoping bugs

**v3.4.5 (current) — reliability & security hardening:**
- [x] Mail, DNS, Cron, Fail2ban — full functional test pass against real running services (not just code review); found and fixed 4 confirmed bugs: disabled cron jobs silently vanishing from the job list instead of showing as disabled, mail account maildirs created with the wrong directory structure (silently broke every new mailbox), DNS zones written to disk but never actually declared to BIND9 (zones were completely unservable), Fail2ban website-jails monitoring the wrong log source entirely due to an unset backend
- [x] ModSecurity WAF, UFW Firewall, Docker deploy — same full test pass, all verified working correctly against real services, no bugs found
- [x] WP Toolkit — install-status checks now honest at every layer (was silently reporting Nginx/MySQL as installed when they weren't, both in the UI and in the install logic itself)
- [x] Fixed 3 pages (WP Toolkit, Databases, Node.js Projects) where navigating in didn't refresh data, due to a broken event listener repeated across all three
- [x] Security settings modals — fixed floating-popup positioning
- [x] Dashboard charts — root-caused two separate issues: an external CDN dependency that silently failed to load, and an Alpine.js reactivity/Chart.js conflict causing an infinite-recursion crash
- [x] All frontend JS/CSS dependencies now self-hosted (Alpine.js upgraded 3.14 → 3.15, plus Chart.js, xterm, CodeMirror) instead of loading from third-party CDNs
- [x] Tightened Content-Security-Policy — fixed Terminal and code-editor styling that had been silently broken by a CSP/CDN mismatch

**v3.5 (next):**
- [ ] Bandwidth Monitor — per-domain traffic graphs (daily/weekly/monthly)
- [ ] Website-level Backup — files + database together in one click per domain
- [ ] Dark mode — toggle with full dark variable set
- [ ] Onboarding wizard — guided first-run flow
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness — sidebar + layout for small screens
- [ ] PHP Webshell Scanner — scan web roots for obfuscated shells
- [ ] Disk usage analyzer — visual tree, delete from panel
- [ ] Alerting — CPU/RAM/SSL-expiry notifications (email/webhook)
- [ ] Website Import — email, cron, and SSL migration (currently files + database only)
