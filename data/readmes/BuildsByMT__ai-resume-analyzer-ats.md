# CVOptimize: AI Resume Analyzer & ATS Builder

**CVOptimize** is a premium, high-fidelity web dashboard designed to help job seekers evaluate and optimize their resumes against applicant tracking systems (ATS). Built using a modern, serverless architecture, the platform grades resumes in real-time, extracts keywords, provides structured AI rewriting suggestions, and generates clean, single-column, parser-friendly PDFs.

This project is engineered to operate **100% free of charge** using serverless free tiers and an automatic **Gemini API Fallback Cascade** that cycles through backup models to bypass daily rate limit thresholds.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **AI ATS Scoring Engine:** Upload a resume in PDF format and paste a target job description. The system executes semantic grading against industry standards, returning an overall match score from 0 to 100%.
* **Keyword Density Analysis:** Dynamically extracts present vs. missing hard and soft skills, showing them in color-coded visual grids.
* **ATS Compatibility Audit:** Runs checkups to identify formatting errors (such as multi-column layouts, incompatible fonts, tables, or icons) that frequently trigger parser failures.
* **AI Bullet-Point Optimizer:** Provides side-by-side rewriting suggestions to help users phrase experience descriptions using strong action verbs and quantifiable metrics.
* **ATS-Friendly Resume Creator:** A step-by-step form wizard featuring an interactive **Wavy SVG Stepper** (fluid sinusoidal path tracking, glowing active nodes, and animated speech bubble tooltips).
* **Dynamic Stepper Node Validation:** Form inputs are validated in real-time. Visited nodes dynamically turn green with checkmarks (when valid) or red with "X" markers and warnings (when incomplete/action required), providing intuitive UI guidance.
* **Gemini API Fallback Cascade:** Protects all endpoints from quota limits (`429`) and server errors (`503`) by automatically retrying requests across a prioritized model cascade (`gemini-2.5-flash` -> `gemini-3.5-flash` -> `gemini-2.5-pro` -> `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` -> `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`).
* **Resume Optimizer AI Chatbot:** A floating AI career assistant at the bottom-right corner of the website for logged-in users. Using system restrictions, the assistant strictly handles queries related to resume writing, templates, page length, ATS compatibility, and CV comparisons.
* **Global Toast Notification System:** A lightweight state-driven toast component indicating successful uploads and AI imports.
* **Dashboard History Logging:** Logged-in users can view, re-examine, or delete previous scan results.
