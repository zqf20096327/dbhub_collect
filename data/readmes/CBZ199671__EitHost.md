EitHost is a Windows desktop application for multi-set Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) systems. It coordinates USB2070 data acquisition, DDS excitation, device pairing, HDF5/SQLite data management, real-time demodulation, and signal-quality diagnostics. When a compatible backend is available, EitHost connects to PyEIDORS through WSL2 for reconstruction and visualization.

> **Project scope:** EitHost is research and engineering software, not a medical device. Hardware control, synchronization accuracy, and reconstruction results must be independently validated on the target equipment and under the intended experimental conditions.

> **Backend release status:** EitHost currently integrates with the unreleased PyEIDORS v2 backend used by our laboratory. We are committed to open-sourcing PyEIDORS v2 after the associated manuscript has been completed. The current public [PyEIDORS repository](https://github.com/CBZ199671/PyEIDORS) represents an earlier public generation and does not include the worker required by this EitHost version.

## Highlights

- **Multi-set orchestration:** Each EIT set consists of one USB2070 acquisition card and one DDS serial controller. EitHost supports manual pairing, single-set operation, and synchronized multi-set startup.
- **Real-time acquisition and demodulation:** Acquisition, demodulation, diagnostics, reconstruction, and UI rendering run as decoupled pipeline stages so slower work does not unnecessarily disturb acquisition cadence.
- **Traceable data lifecycle:** Raw data and derived results are stored in HDF5; experiments and processing state are managed by a SQLite catalog, with CSV export and database replay support.
- **PyEIDORS integration layer:** EitHost includes a configurable persistent WSL2 worker bridge and manifest/profile routing. The compatible PyEIDORS v2 backend currently used by the laboratory has not yet been publicly released.
- **Visualization and analysis:** Live boundary voltages, reconstruction images, fixed-ROI temporal analysis, and a display-only pseudo-3D view built by quality-aware anisotropic universal kriging over two independent 2D inverse problems, reported together with a per-node relative variance.
- **Field operations:** Device discovery, driver preflight, runtime logs, evidence export, and Chinese/English UI localization.
- **Ready-to-run host package:** A self-contained Windows x64 build is published as a GitHub Release asset and does not require a separate .NET Runtime installation. Real-time reconstruction still requires a compatible PyEIDORS backend.

## Experiment recordings

Pseudo-3D conductivity imaging, recorded from the workstation during paired
time-division acquisition. All three runs start from a background solution at
11.4 µS/cm.

**An acrylic rod and a hollow copper cylinder placed into the tank.** An insulator and a
conductor, so the two contrast against the background in opposite directions.

**A single droplet of 10 % w/w KCl solution.** The conductivity change spreads from the
point where the droplet enters.

**KCl droplets at 2 %, 4 %, 6 %, 8 % and 10 % w/w, added in sequence.** The response can be
compared across an increasing concentration step.

The recordings are also versioned under [`media/`](media/), which records the setup for
each run. The pseudo-3D view is produced by quality-aware anisotropic universal kriging
across the two measured layers, weighted by each layer's quality and validated to keep
the measured planes intact, and it reports a relative variance beside the values. It uses
only the two independent 2D parameter fields: no cross-layer voltage is synthesised, and
this is not a true 3D CEM inversion. The view also carries the inter-layer time difference
of the time-division schedule. Conductivity is shown as the change relative to each run's
locked reference, not as a calibrated absolute reading.

The first recording is encoded with HEVC (H.265), which many browsers do not play; the
copy under `media/` opens in a desktop player. The other two are H.264.

EitHost owns the Windows-side hardware, experiment workflow, and data lifecycle. A compatible PyEIDORS backend owns finite-element forward and inverse solving. A defined backend configuration and data protocol keep both projects independently evolvable.

## PyEIDORS v2 availability and open-source commitment

PyEIDORS v2 is a major next-generation release with substantial new capabilities, architectural improvements, expanded solver workflows, and major enhancements in performance, robustness, and integration with real-time EIT systems.

While the associated research manuscript is being prepared, the PyEIDORS v2 source code, worker implementation, backend manifest, and solver profiles are not yet publicly available. The current public [PyEIDORS repository](https://github.com/CBZ199671/PyEIDORS) corresponds to an earlier public generation and should not be assumed to implement the worker interface required by the current EitHost reconstruction pipeline.

**We are committed to open-sourcing PyEIDORS v2 after the associated manuscript has been completed.** The planned release will include the source code, EitHost-compatible worker implementation, backend manifests and profiles, installation documentation, reproducible examples, and validation materials. This is a temporary publication-timing restriction, not a decision to keep PyEIDORS v2 permanently closed source.

## Quick start

### Run the published Windows x64 build

1. Install the USB2070 Windows driver supplied by the hardware vendor.
2. Download `EitHost-<version>-Windows-x64.zip`, or the smaller `.7z`, from the [latest release](https://github.com/CBZ199671/EitHost/releases/latest). Running the application does not require cloning this repository.
3. Extract the whole `EitHost-Windows-x64` folder to a writable, permanent location, then run:

```powershell
.\EitHost-Windows-x64\EitHost.App.exe
```

Do not run the application from inside the archive, and do not copy only the `.exe`. It requires `HDF.PInvoke.dll`, `HDF.PInvoke.dll.config`, `hdf5.dll`, `hdf5_hl.dll`, and `USB2070.dll` beside it. Startup performs a real HDF5 create/write/close/delete probe before hardware can open. The USB2070 kernel-driver package is not included.

Every archive carries a `SHA256SUMS.txt` covering each packaged file, and every release publishes the archive's own SHA-256. See [`release/EitHost-Windows-x64/README.md`](release/EitHost-Windows-x64/README.md) for package usage and verification instructions.

The copy of `release/EitHost-Windows-x64` in this repository holds the package's supporting files and checksums but not the executable: the self-contained EXE exceeds GitHub's 100 MiB file limit, so it ships as a release asset, and a source build reproduces it.

After changes affecting the application, runtime configuration, or build/package workflow pass relevant checks, run `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\package-eithost.ps1`. It rebuilds the current source into the single `release/EitHost-Windows-x64` installation while preserving `Data`. The version comes from the application project; dated release directories are no longer created by default. Documentation, comment, and agent-instruction-only changes need only the checks appropriate to their impact. See the [project release policy](packaging/RELEASE-RULES.md).

### Build from source

Building from source requires an x64 edition of a [.NET 10-supported Windows release](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows)—a supported Windows 11 release, or a supported Windows 10 Enterprise/LTSC release—and [.NET SDK 10.0.301](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0) or a later 10.0 feature band. The repository's `global.json` does not accept an earlier .NET 10 SDK.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/CBZ199671/EitHost.git
cd EitHost
dotnet restore .\EitHost.slnx
dotnet build .\EitHost.slnx --configuration Release --no-restore
dotnet run --project .\src\EitHost.App\EitHost.App.csproj --configuration Release --no-build
```

## Configure the PyEIDORS backend

Real-time reconstruction is optional and requires WSL2 plus a compatible PyEIDORS v2 backend. At present, this section applies only to collaborators who already have authorized access to that backend; the public PyEIDORS repository does not include the required worker implementation.

EitHost reads the per-user configuration from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\EitHost\eithost.reconstruction.json`. Create it from the example with:

```powershell
$configDirectory = Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA 'EitHost'
$configPath = Join-Path $configDirectory 'eithost.reconstruction.json'
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $configDirectory | Out-Null
Copy-Item `
  .\src\EitHost.App\eithost.reconstruction.example.json `
  $configPath
notepad $configPath
```

Set `DistroName`, `BackendRepositoryPath`, and optionally `BackendProfile` for the authorized local backend environment. As an alternative, set `EITHOST_RECONSTRUCTION_CONFIG` to the absolute path of another configuration file before launching EitHost.
