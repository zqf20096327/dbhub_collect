<h1 align="center">URL Shortener API</h1>
<p align="center">
  A production-grade, secure, and extensible backend for high-performance URL shortening.
</p>

---

## Overview

URL Shortener is a containerized, enterprise-ready backend API for managing short URLs, built with Go and following clean architecture principles. It integrates PostgreSQL, Redis, Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, and Traefik. The system emphasizes scalability, observability, security, and operational maintainability.

This project includes no frontend. It is designed to be integrated into existing platforms (web, mobile, CLI) or to run as a dedicated microservice.

---

## Key Features

- REST API for shortening URLs (with optional custom aliases)
- Secure user registration, login, and JWT-based authentication
- Email verification and password reset using branded HTML templates
- Admin-only endpoints for managing users and URLs
- Click batching system using PostgreSQL and Redis
- Real-time health check API and periodic background health verifier
- Per-IP rate limiting via Traefik middleware
- Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards
- Email alerts for system and application-level anomalies
- Per-component structured logging
- GitHub Actions-based CI/CD and Docker Hub deployment
- Secure HTTPS routing using Traefik with automatic TLS

## Architecture

| Component           | Description                                             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `url-shortener`     | Go-based REST API                                       |
| `postgres`          | Persistent relational database                          |
| `redis`             | Caching layer for hot URLs                              |
| `prometheus`        | Metrics collection and alert rule engine                |
| `grafana`           | Dashboard visualization                                 |
| `alertmanager`      | Alert delivery engine (email notifications)             |
| `node_exporter`     | Host-level metrics (CPU, RAM, Disk)                     |
| `postgres_exporter` | PostgreSQL performance metrics for Prometheus           |
| `traefik`           | HTTPS reverse proxy, rate limiter, and router           |

All services are managed via Docker Compose and isolated with internal Docker networks.

## API Documentation

The API is fully documented using Swagger (OpenAPI 3.0) via [swaggo/swag](https://github.com/swaggo/swag).

**Live Docs:**  
[API Swagger Live Documentation](https://cemakan.com.tr/api/docs/index.html)

The documentation includes:
- All available endpoints and methods
- Field schemas and validation rules
- Authentication structure (JWT)
- Example requests and responses
- Error responses and status codes

---

## Security

- JWT Bearer tokens for all authenticated endpoints
- IP allowlisting and Basic Auth for:
  - `/metrics`
  - `/grafana`
  - `/prometheus`
  - `/alert`
  - `/api/docs`
- Passwords stored using bcrypt hashing
- Auto-seeding of an admin account on first launch if none exists
- All traffic securely routed via Traefik with TLS (Let's Encrypt or manual certs)

---

## Monitoring & Health

- `/health` endpoint returns live JSON status of:
  - PostgreSQL
  - Redis
  - SMTP
- Background health checker runs periodically
- Prometheus scrapes metrics from:
  - Application
  - Redis
  - PostgreSQL
  - Node exporter
- Alertmanager triggers alerts via email based on thresholds or failures
- Grafana dashboards provide visual monitoring for all systems

### Default Alerts

- CPU usage above 80%
- Memory usage above 85%
- Redis, PostgreSQL, or SMTP service down
- API redirect latency degradation
- Request throughput outside configured bounds
- Flusher failure or unexpected idle time

---

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                    | Access        | Description                              |

## Reverse Proxy & Routing

All routes are proxied securely via Traefik with rate limiting and middleware protections.

| Path Prefix     | Destination        | Access Protection            |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------------------------|
| `/api`          | url-shortener      | JWT-based, rate limited      |
| `/grafana`      | grafana            | IP allowlist + Basic Auth    |
| `/prometheus`   | prometheus         | IP allowlist + Basic Auth    |
| `/alert`        | alertmanager       | IP allowlist + Basic Auth    |
| `/metrics`      | exporters + app    | IP allowlist + Basic Auth    |
| `/health`       | url-shortener      | Public                       |

Rate limit settings are configured in `.env` and applied via Traefik middlewares.
