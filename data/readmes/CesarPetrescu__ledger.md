**Project memory that carries across conversations.**

Save decisions, find past context, and hand work from one assistant to another.

## What is Ledger?

Ledger is a self-hosted [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that gives Codex, Claude, ChatGPT, and other MCP clients a shared project notebook. Your data lives in PostgreSQL on your own server.

- **Remember decisions.** Keep notes, todos, status updates, and an append-only project history.
- **Find past context.** Search across projects with full-text search and optional semantic search.
- **Hand off work.** Leave another assistant a thread with messages, attachments, and progress.
- **Stay in control.** Manage projects, connected clients, and optional Nextcloud calendars from the web console or Android app.

> “What did we decide about Atlas last week?”
>
> Your assistant searches Ledger and brings the decision into the current conversation.

## How it looks

Real application captures with fictional demo data. The Android image comes from an emulator; the glasses image shows the official Even Hub simulator, not a photograph through physical G2 lenses.

### Website

Browse projects, inspect their goals and history, and add notes or decisions from the web console.

### Android

Keep the project overview and owner controls available from your phone.

### Even Realities G2 / R1

A glanceable current-project view, with Capture, Recall, Brief and Calendar/Next available through Ledger Glass. This is the real 576 × 288 simulator framebuffer, composited onto black for readability.

## Get started

| I want to… | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| Connect Codex on Windows, Linux, or WSL | [Install the CLI](#install-the-ledger-client) |
| Connect Claude, ChatGPT, or another MCP client | [Use the MCP endpoint](#connect-another-assistant) |
| Manage Ledger from my phone | [Install the Android app](#android-app) |
| Develop/test Ledger on Even Realities G2/R1 | [Ledger Glass](#ledger-glass-g2r1) |
| Run my own Ledger server | [Self-hosting guide](docs/hosting.md#quick-start) |

Clients need an existing **HTTPS Ledger server**. Use its base address, such as `https://ledger.example.com`, for the CLI and Android app. MCP clients use the same address with `/mcp` appended.

## Install the Ledger client

Install on the machine where **Codex runs**. Windows 10/11 and Linux support x64 and ARM64, including WSL and remote Linux over SSH. You need Codex CLI **0.152 or newer**; the installer does not require Go, Docker, or administrator access.

### Windows

Run in PowerShell:

```powershell
curl.exe -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CesarPetrescu/ledger/main/install.ps1 -o "$env:TEMP\ledger-install.ps1"
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:TEMP\ledger-install.ps1"
```

Open a **new terminal** so the updated PATH takes effect.

### Linux and WSL

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CesarPetrescu/ledger/main/install.sh | sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

If needed, add that export line to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` for future terminals.

### Connect and approve

On either platform, replace the example address with your server's base HTTPS URL:

```sh
ledger connect codex --server https://ledger.example.com --name "My laptop"
```

Open the URL shown in the terminal, sign into the owner console, and approve the matching device code. Wait for the terminal to confirm the connection, then start `codex`.

| Command | Use it to… |
| --- | --- |
| `ledger auth status` | Check your connection |
| `ledger update` | Install the latest stable client |
| `ledger auth logout` | Revoke this machine's access |

The CLI checks for updates automatically. See the [client guide](docs/clients.md) for portable downloads, custom paths, profiles, update controls, and troubleshooting. Windows executables are not Authenticode-signed.

### Connect another assistant

Add this remote MCP URL to your client and complete its OAuth approval flow:

```text
https://ledger.example.com/mcp
```

For Claude Code:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http ledger https://ledger.example.com/mcp
```

For Codex, use `ledger connect codex` above. See the [MCP reference](docs/reference.md#mcp-surface) for tools, permissions, and discovery.

### Android app

Download the signed **`ledger-android-vX.Y.Z.apk`** from [the latest release](https://github.com/CesarPetrescu/ledger/releases/latest). Requires Android 9 or newer.

Enter your server's base HTTPS URL and sign in with the **owner password** used by the web console. You can manage projects, search, handoffs, calendars, and device approvals. See [Android setup and builds](android/README.md).

### Ledger Glass (G2/R1)

`evenhub/` contains **Ledger Glass**, the Even Realities G2/R1 client. It pairs through Ledger's OAuth device flow and provides Now/Projects, Capture, Recall, Brief, and Calendar/Next without introducing a second data store. Initial access is read-only; Capture requests explicit write approval and Calendar/Next requests calendar-read approval.

Capture and Recall accept voice or phone text. Voice transcription requires a server-side speech provider; typed input works without one. See the simulator screenshot [above](#how-it-looks).

The package is bound to one HTTPS Ledger origin at build time because Even Hub requires outbound network destinations to be declared in the app manifest. See [Ledger Glass setup, security, and hardware checks](evenhub/README.md).

## Self-host Ledger

The Docker Compose stack includes four Go services, the web console, and PostgreSQL. Put it behind an HTTPS reverse proxy.

1. Clone the repository and configure `.env` from [`.env.example`](.env.example).
2. Set separate OAuth-approval and owner-console password hashes, plus the database password and calendar encryption key.
3. Build and start the stack, then open `/admin/` on your server.

Follow the **[complete setup guide](docs/hosting.md#quick-start)** for commands and configuration. Semantic search uses an inference endpoint; if it is unavailable, full-text search still works.
