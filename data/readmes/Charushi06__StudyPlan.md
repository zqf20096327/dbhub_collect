## 🧠 The Idea

Students don’t lack information.  
They lack **organization**.

Assignments live in:
- 📧 Emails  
- 💬 WhatsApp groups  
- 📄 PDFs & portals  

And the biggest problem?
> ❌ You have to manually re-enter everything into a planner  

---

## 💡 Solution

**StudyPlan removes manual planning completely.**

Just:
1. Paste messy text  
2. AI extracts tasks  
3. Everything becomes structured  

> 🎯 From chaos → clean plan in seconds

  - Due Soon
  - This Week
  - Completed
- Conflict detection (deadline clustering alerts)

### 📅 Interactive Calendar
- Global calendar view
- Click a date → filter tasks instantly
- Color-coded deadlines

### 🧩 Seamless Editing
- Inline editing (no popups)
- Modify extracted data before saving

### 🔔 Smart Notifications
- Modern, glassmorphic toast notifications
- Interactive confirmation modals
- Zero-dependency Vanilla JS implementation
- Automatically adapts to Light/Dark mode

### 💾 Persistent Storage
- SQLite-based local database
- Structured task + subject mapping

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|------|-----------|
| Frontend | HTML, CSS (Glassmorphism), Vanilla JS |
| Backend | Node.js + Express |
| Database | SQLite |
| AI | Google Gemini (GenAI SDK) |

## 🚀 Key Differentiators

| Feature | StudyPlan | Typical Planners |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| AI Extraction | ✅ | ❌ |
| Zero Manual Entry | ✅ | ❌ |
| Conflict Detection | ✅ | ❌ |
| Inline Editing | ✅ | ❌ |

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Charushi06/StudyPlan.git
cd StudyPlan
npm install
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Development

StudyPlan runs as a **single container** because Express serves both the API and static frontend, and SQLite is file-based (not a separate database server). Docker provides a consistent, reproducible environment for onboarding and local development.

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 24+ and Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose` CLI)
- Copy [`.env.example`](.env.example) to `.env` and set `GEMINI_API_KEY` (optional — the app falls back to local NLP without it)

### Quick Start

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # edit GEMINI_API_KEY
docker compose up --build
```

Open → http://localhost:3000

### Common Docker Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `docker compose up --build` | Build and start the stack |
| `docker compose up -d` | Start detached |
| `docker compose down` | Stop and remove containers (volume preserved) |
| `docker compose down -v` | Stop and **delete** SQLite data |
| `docker compose logs -f app` | Tail app logs |
| `docker compose exec app npm test` | Run tests inside container |
| `docker compose ps` | Show service health status |

### Development Workflow

- **Docker (recommended for onboarding):** one command, consistent Node 20 + sqlite3 build, persistent data in the `sqlite_data` volume
- **Local npm (faster iteration):** use the bare-metal flow below — no Docker required for day-to-day UI changes
- **Reset database:** `docker compose down -v` then `docker compose up --build`

---

## 🔑 Environment Setup

Create `.env`:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gen_ai_key_here
```

---

## ▶️ Run Locally

Without Docker:

```bash
node server.js
```
Open → http://localhost:3000
