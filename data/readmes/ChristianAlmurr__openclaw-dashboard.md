## What is OpenClaw Dashboard?

Running AI agents at scale means juggling costs, context windows, memory drift, competitor landscapes, and coordination across dozens of autonomous processes. **OpenClaw Dashboard** gives you a single local-first command centre that reads directly from your [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) installation -- no cloud dependency, no telemetry, full control.

> **New in v2.0** -- 10-step onboarding wizard, project workspaces with competitor scanning, market intelligence feeds, practitioner signal aggregation, visual cron pipeline builder, memory health AI analysis, and a complete Apple-inspired glass design system.

---

## Features

### Agent Fleet Monitoring
Real-time monitoring of multi-agent systems with constellation graph visualization, execution traces, context health bars, and drift detection. Four home views -- **Org Map, Grid, Feed, and Constellation** -- let you choose how to observe your fleet.

### Competitor Intelligence
Discover, track, and profile competitors across your market. Add competitors manually or let AI discover them. Drill into per-competitor detail pages with SWOT analysis, update tracking, and category organization.

### Cost Analytics
Per-agent and per-provider spend attribution with token-level granularity. Optimization scoring, cache savings estimation, anomaly detection, week-over-week trending, and per-model breakdowns.

### Cron Pipeline Builder
Visual DAG editor for job dependencies powered by @xyflow/react. Track execution history with cost attribution, configure delivery rules, and build dependency chains between scheduled tasks.

![Cron Pipelines](./Screenshots/cron-pipelines.png)

### Interactive Agent Chat
Real-time SSE streaming chat with multimodal support. Upload images, review per-agent conversation history, and use slash commands (`/help`, `/status`, `/cost`) to query your fleet.

### Kanban Board
Full agile project management with columns (todo / in-progress / done / blocked), agent assignment, priority labels, ticket chat threads, and automation rules.

### Memory Health Monitor
AI-driven analysis of agent memory with staleness detection, completeness checks, editing hints, and one-click reindex controls. Know when an agent's context is drifting before it causes problems.

### Market Intelligence
Automated competitive intelligence feeds with signal categorization. Your agents scan the market and surface trends, competitor moves, and technology shifts.

### Practitioner Signals
Community signal aggregation from Reddit, forums, and social media. Surface pain points, feature requests, and positive signals from real practitioners in your domain.

### Tech Updates Radar
Curated technology radar with category filtering. Stay on top of framework releases, AI model updates, and tooling changes relevant to your stack.

### Project Workspaces
Organize your intelligence feeds, competitors, and reference files into named projects. Each project gets its own icon, description, and URL. Create, edit, and delete projects from the sidebar.

### Settings & Customization
Full UI for accent color, portal branding (name, subtitle, logo), agent avatars, operator profile, and theme customization. 12 accent color presets + custom color picker.
