### How to use

Create the database and tables. The `raw` table uses JSON type hints plus a few
materialized columns and a text index so the UI's queries stay fast (see
`schema.sql` for the full definition and the reasoning):

```
clickhouse-client < schema.sql

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS claude_code.classification
(
    data JSON
)
ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree
ORDER BY data.session_id::String;
```

Upload your sessions:

```
clickhouse-local -q "
    SELECT _path AS path, json AS data
    FROM file('$HOME/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl', 'JSONAsString')
    WHERE isValidJSON(json)
    SETTINGS input_format_allow_errors_ratio=0.1
    FORMAT Native
" | clickhouse-client --host '...' --password '...' -q "INSERT INTO claude_code.raw FORMAT Native"
```

This is likely optional:

```
clickhouse-local -q "
    SELECT _path AS path, json AS data
    FROM file('$HOME/.claude/history.jsonl', 'JSONAsString')
    WHERE isValidJSON(json)
    SETTINGS input_format_allow_errors_ratio=0.1
    FORMAT Native
" | clickhouse-client --host '...' --password '...'  -q "INSERT INTO claude_code.raw FORMAT Native"
```

#### Uploading only new data (incremental updates)

After the first upload, you don't need to re-send everything. Re-running the
commands above is always *safe* (the `raw` table is a `ReplacingMergeTree`, so
duplicates collapse), but it re-reads and re-sends every session each time.

Use `upload_incremental.sh` to upload only **new sessions** and **new entries
appended to existing sessions**:

```
CH_HOST='...' CH_USER='...' CH_PASSWORD='...' ./upload_incremental.sh
```

On each run it uploads the union of two sets:

1. **Sessions ClickHouse doesn't have yet** — it asks the `raw` table which
   `path`s are already loaded and uploads any local `.jsonl` that's missing.
   This does *not* rely on file mtimes, so it works when you **collect from
   several machines, at different times**: copy the `.jsonl` files over (rsync,
   scp, …) and upload later. (Plain mtime checks miss these, because copying
   preserves the original, older mtime.)
2. **Sessions that grew** — files modified since the previous successful run *on
   this machine* (tracked by the marker file `~/.claude/.ch_last_upload`) are
   re-uploaded so appended entries get in.

Any overlap is deduplicated by the table's `ORDER BY (sessionId, timestamp,
uuid)`, so nothing is duplicated. It's idempotent, so it's a good fit for cron,
e.g. hourly:

```
0 * * * * CH_HOST='...' CH_PASSWORD='...' /path/to/upload_incremental.sh >> ~/.claude/ch_upload.log 2>&1
```

Options (environment variables):

- `CH_SECURE=1` / `CH_SECURE=0` — force TLS on/off (defaults to on for any
  non-`localhost` host, which ClickHouse Cloud requires).
- `PROJECTS=/path/to/projects` — where the `.jsonl` files live (default
  `~/.claude/projects`); point this at a directory you sync other machines into.
- `FORCE=1` — re-upload every local file, ignoring both the marker and what's
  already in ClickHouse.

Edit `index.html` around CH_URL, CH_USER, CH_PASSWORD with your database credentials.

Optional: ask claude to run classification scripts and fill the classification table.

Open `index.html`.

### Do not share your sessions publicly

The sessions contain tool calls and results, including fragments of arbitrary files. They may contain sensitive info, that's why it's not recommended to share sessions publicly.
