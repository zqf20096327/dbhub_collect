## ClickHouse clickhouse-go linter

A linter for the [clickhouse-go](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-go/tree/main) driver.

This linter targets the ClickHouse-native API (`clickhouse_api`): connections opened via `clickhouse.Open()` returning a `clickhouse.Conn`.  
It does not apply to the standard `database/sql` interface opened via `clickhouse.OpenDB()` or `sql.Open()`. 
See [documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/integrations/go#the-clickhouse-go-client) for more details on the two interfaces.

The linter detects 2 common implementation mistakes:
- forgetting to call `rows.Err()` after calling `rows.Next()`
- forgetting to call `defer batch.Close()` when using `Batch`

These implementation mistakes are often observed in codebases using the clickhouse-go driver. They result 
in incomplete data and hard-to-troubleshoot bugs.

## Rules
The rules are independent of the protocol used (`HTTP` / `TCP`).

## 1. chrowserr
Detect when the `github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-go/v2/lib/driver` `Rows.Err()` call is missing after a call to `Rows.Next()`.

Calling `Rows.Err()` is mandatory (see [here](https://clickhouse.com/docs/integrations/go#copy-in-some-sample-code)).
Failing to handle `Rows.Err()` results in subtle, hard to troubleshoot errors: partial or inconsistent result are passed downstream.

Incorrect code: 

```go
parsedRows := []... 
rows, _ := conn.Query(ctx, "SELECT ...")
for rows.Next() {
   parsedRow, err = ....
   if err {
     return nil, err
   }
   append(rows, parsedRow)
}

// !!! MISSING rows.Err() handling before returning !!! 
// !!! incomplete results may be returned with no errors !!!  

return parsedRows, nil
```

<details><summary>Correct code</summary>

```go
parsedRows := []... 
rows, _ := conn.Query(ctx, "SELECT ...")
for rows.Next() {
   parsed, err = ....
   if err {
     return nil, err
   }
   append(parsedRows, parsed)
}

// !!! correct - check rows.Err() before returning !!!
if err := rows.Err(); err != nil {
  return nil, err
}

return parsedRows, nil
```

</details>

### Rule details

The linter goes through every function. 
If `rows.Next()` is called in a function, it looks for `rows.Err()`. If not found, an error is reported.
Variable re-assignments and intertwined variable are supported. See [testcases.go](passes/chrowserr/testdata/src/testcases/testcases.go).

There are some limitations:
- the linter does not check if the output of `.Err()` is effectively used.   
  For instance: `_ = rows.Err()` is not caught as an error. The assumption is this kind of code would be written on purpose and would not be a mistake.  
- the linter does not cross function block boundaries. If `.Next()` is called in a function and `.Err()` is called in a 
  closure (eg a closure created inside the function), the linter will not be able to associate the `Err()` and the `.Next()` calls. 
  (note: in most cases such pattern is a bad idea). See `nextAndErrNotInSameFunctionBlock` test case. 
- even if `.Err()` is called _at some point_, improperly returning before the call to `.Err()` is not detected. (Contrived) example:
  ```
  parsedRows = []... 
  rows, _ := conn.Query(ctx, "SELECT 1")
  for rows.Next() {
    parsedRow, err = ....
    if err {
      return nil, err
    }
    append(rows, parsedRow)
    }
  
    if len(parsedRows) = 1 {
       // !!! returns without checking rows.Err !!! 
       return parsedRows[0], nill 
    }

    if err := rows.Err(); err != nill {
       // correct error handling
    }
    
    return parsedRows[1], nil
  ```
  --> in this case the linter will not be able to detect that `.Err()` may be called too late. 


## 2. chbatchclose
Detect when a `github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-go/v2/lib/driver` `Batch` variable is used but no associated `defer batch.Close()` is called.

Calling `defer batch.Close()` is highly recommended (see [here](https://clickhouse.com/docs/integrations/go#batch-insert)).
While it is possible to not use this statement, code that do not use it often end up with subtle leaks, as the 
underlying batch connection may not be closed if `Batch.Append` or `Batch.Send` fail.
As the `defer batch.Close()` does not change the logic or performance of the program, this rule enforces its usage.

Incorrect code:

```go
batch, err := conn.PrepareBatch(ctx, "INSERT INTO example")
if err != nil {
    return err
}
// !!! missing defer batch.Close() !!!

for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
    err := batch.Append(i),
    if err != nil {
        return err  // !!! connection leak !!!
	}
}

return batch.Send() // !!! potential connection leak if Send fails !!!
```

<details><summary>Correct code</summary>

```go
batch, err := conn.PrepareBatch(ctx, "INSERT INTO example")
if err != nil {
    return err
}
defer batch.Close()

for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
    err := batch.Append(i),
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
}

return batch.Send()
```

</details>

### Rule details

The linter goes through every function.
If a clickhouse driver `Batch` is instantiated and is not part of the values returned by the function, a `defer batch.Close()` must be found.
Also, assigning a `Batch` to the blank identifier `_` is flagged.  
Variable re-assignments and intertwined variable are supported. See [testcases.go](passes/chbatchclose/testdata/src/testcases/testcases.go).

The linter recognizes two forms of `defer`:
- direct call: `defer batch.Close()`
- immediately-invoked closure: `defer func() { ... batch.Close() ... }()` (useful for wrapping the `Close` error).

There are some limitations:
- the linter does not cross function call boundaries. In particular:
  - a closure passed as an argument (e.g. `defer func(b driver.Batch) { b.Close() }(batch)`) is not recognized.
  - a helper function that closes the batch (e.g. `defer closeWithLog(batch)`) is not recognized.
- inside a deferred closure, the linter does not descend into nested closures or goroutines.
  `defer func() { go func() { batch.Close() }() }()` is not recognized as a valid close.
- inside a deferred closure, tracking is name-based and does not consult type information, so shadowing the
  outer batch name with another `Close`-able local can hide a missing close. See `deferCloseInClosureShadowed`
  test case. We expect IDE / shadow linter to flag this as a bad pattern.
- `defer batch.Close()` must be called after checking that the `PrepareBatch` call returned no error.
   incorrect: 
   ```
   batch, err := conn.PrepareBatch(ctx, "INSERT INTO example")
   defer batch.Close()
   if err != nil {
		return
   }
   ```
   correct:
   ```
   batch, err := conn.PrepareBatch(ctx, "INSERT INTO example")
   if err != nil {
		return
   }
   defer batch.Close()
   ```
   This is not enforced by the linter.
- it is in theory possible to write correct code without using `defer batch.Close()`, by properly checking  
  error results after each call to `.Append()`, `.Send()`, etc... and calling `Close` or `Abort` accordingly. Because 
  writing such correct code is difficult and prone to regressions, and because `defer batch.Close` does not 
  change the code correctness and is easy to add, this linter enforces its usage.

## Development
If `CH_GO_LINTER_DEBUG` is set to `TRUE` (or any truthy value), the linter also repots valid usages. 
This can be useful for to troubleshoot the linter behavior.
