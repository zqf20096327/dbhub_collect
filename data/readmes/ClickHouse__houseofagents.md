## Execution Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Relay** | Sequential handoff — each agent builds on the previous agent's output |
| **Swarm** | Parallel rounds with cross-agent context injected between rounds |
| **Pipeline** | Custom DAG builder — wire arbitrary blocks of agents into a dependency graph, with optional finalization DAG for post-execution analysis |

## Supported Providers

| Provider | API | CLI |
|----------|:---:|:---:|
| **Anthropic** (Claude) | `api_key` | `claude` binary |
| **OpenAI** | `api_key` | `codex` binary |
| **Gemini** | `api_key` | `gemini` binary |
| **OpenCode** | -- | `opencode` binary |

Each agent can run in API mode or CLI mode (`use_cli = true`). Mix and match freely. OpenCode is CLI-only.

## Features

- **Terminal UI** — select agents, mode, prompt, iterations, run count, and concurrency from an interactive TUI
- **Named agents** — define multiple agents per provider with independent configs
- **Pipeline builder** — visual DAG editor for wiring arbitrary agent blocks with dependency-driven execution, independent per-connection routing, loop-back connections for iterative refinement of sub-DAGs, scatter connections for distributing work items across replicas, sub-pipeline blocks for encapsulating inner DAGs as opaque units, and an optional finalization DAG for post-execution analysis and summarization
- **Multiple runs** — launch N independent copies of the same setup in parallel with bounded concurrency
- **Resume runs** — pick up where you left off in relay or swarm sessions
- **Forward Prompt** — relay mode option to include the original prompt in every handoff
- **Keep Session** — toggle per-provider conversation history persistence across iterations (on by default; turn off to clear provider memory between iterations while preserving inter-agent handoff context). Pipeline mode has its own per-session configuration popup in the Builder screen (`s`)
- **Consolidation** — merge multi-agent output within a run or across multiple runs (any configured agent can consolidate)
- **Diagnostics** — optional post-run analysis pass that writes `errors.md`
- **Config editor** — add/remove/rename agents, edit settings, timeouts, and models live with a popup (`e`)
- **Model picker** — browse available models from the API directly inside the config editor (`l`)
- **Cross-run memory** — SQLite-backed memory system that recalls relevant context from previous runs and extracts new memories post-run (decision, observation, summary, principle)

## Requirements

- **Rust 1.88+** and Cargo
- A terminal with TUI support
- At least one agent configured via API key **or** locally-installed CLI with auth set up

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antonio2368/houseofagents.git
cd houseofagents
./install.sh
```

The install script runs `cargo install --path .` and writes a starter config via `houseofagents --init-config`.

<details>
<summary>Custom config path / overwrite existing</summary>

```bash
# Custom config location
./install.sh /absolute/path/config.toml

# Overwrite existing config
./install.sh /absolute/path/config.toml --force
```

</details>

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Initialize config (skip if you used install.sh)
houseofagents --init-config

# 2. Edit config — for at least one agent:
#    - API mode: set `api_key` and `use_cli = false`
#    - CLI mode: set `use_cli = true` and ensure the CLI is installed/authenticated
#    Default location: ~/.config/houseofagents/config.toml
#    Optional: set diagnostic_provider to an agent name to enable diagnostics

# 3. Launch
houseofagents
```

In the TUI: select agents with `Space`, pick a mode, enter your prompt, and hit `Enter` or `F5` to run.

## CLI Options

```

      --consolidation-prompt <S>  Extra consolidation instructions
      --output-format <FMT>       Output format: text, json [default: text]
      --quiet                     Suppress stderr progress output
      --memory                    Enable cross-run memory
      --output-dir <DIR>          Override output directory
      --print-result              Print finalization/consolidation/sub-pipeline output to stdout
```

## Noninteractive (Headless) Mode

Run agents from scripts and CI pipelines without the TUI. Activate headless mode by passing `--prompt`, `--prompt-file`, or `--pipeline`.

### Relay / Swarm Examples

```bash
# Swarm with two agents, 3 iterations
houseofagents --prompt "Analyze this codebase" --agents Claude,OpenAI --iterations 3

# Relay with explicit order
houseofagents --prompt "Review and fix" --mode relay --agents Claude,OpenAI --order OpenAI,Claude

# Batch: 5 independent runs, 3 at a time
houseofagents --prompt "Generate tests" --agents Claude --runs 5 --concurrency 3

# With consolidation
houseofagents --prompt "Debate pros and cons" --agents Claude,Gemini --iterations 2 \
  --consolidate Claude --consolidation-prompt "Summarize the debate"

# JSON output for scripting
houseofagents --prompt "Analyze" --agents Claude --output-format json --quiet
```

### Pipeline Examples

```bash
# Run a saved pipeline
houseofagents --pipeline my_pipeline.toml

# Batch: 3 independent runs
houseofagents --pipeline my_pipeline.toml --runs 3

# Pipeline with consolidation
houseofagents --pipeline my_pipeline.toml --consolidate Claude

# Print finalization output directly to stdout
houseofagents --pipeline my_pipeline.toml --print-result
```

### Output Behavior

- **stdout**: In text mode, prints the run directory path on success. In JSON mode, prints a structured result object. With `--print-result`, finalization or consolidation content is appended after the directory path (text) or included as a `"results"` array in the JSON object. Results are printed on both success and error paths (partial failures still produce usable artifacts) but NOT on cancellation. On error paths, the directory path is printed to stderr and result content appears directly on stdout without a preceding path line. For single-run pipelines without finalization or consolidation, sub-pipeline terminal outputs are used as a fallback. When results exceed the internal size budget (512 KB per file, 2 MB aggregate), a `"results_truncated": true` key is added to the JSON object and inline `[...truncated...]` markers appear in the content.
- **stderr**: Progress events (agent starts, iteration completions, errors). Suppressed with `--quiet`. In JSON output format, progress events are NDJSON on stderr.
  - `sub_block_started` — An inner block within a sub-pipeline has started. Fields: `parent_block_id`, `inner_block_id`, `inner_label`, `parent_label`, `iteration`, `loop_pass`, `inner_loop_pass`.
  - `sub_block_finished` — An inner block within a sub-pipeline has finished. Same fields as `sub_block_started`.
  - `sub_block_error` — An inner block within a sub-pipeline encountered an error or was skipped. Same fields as `sub_block_started` plus `error`, `details`, and `is_skip`. When `is_skip` is `true`, the event represents a forwarded `BlockSkipped` (dependency not met). Only non-skip errors feed the error ledger and may affect exit codes.
- Headless mode never enters alternate-screen mode — safe for piping and CI.

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | Validation error (bad flags, missing agents, etc.) |
| `2` | Execution error (provider failure, partial failure) |
| `130` | Cancelled (Ctrl+C) |

### Limitations

- Resume is not supported in headless mode (planned for a future version).
- Prompt is required for relay/swarm (`--prompt` or `--prompt-file`); for pipeline, the pipeline TOML's `initial_prompt` is used if `--prompt` is not given.
- `--consolidate` is not supported for single-run relay (relay produces a single output chain with no branches to merge). Batch relay consolidation works normally.

## Configuration

The starter config lives at `~/.config/houseofagents/config.toml`:

```toml
output_dir = "~/houseofagents-output"
default_max_tokens = 4096
# For values 4+, providers keep the first exchange plus the newest messages.
# For values 1-3, providers keep only the most recent messages up to the cap.
max_history_messages = 50
http_timeout_seconds = 120
model_fetch_timeout_seconds = 30
cli_timeout_seconds = 600
max_history_bytes = 102400
# pipeline_block_concurrency = 0

# Optional: set to an agent name to enable diagnostics
# diagnostic_provider = "Claude"

# Named agents — you can have multiple agents per provider

### Config Reference

**General settings** (top-level):

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `output_dir` | Base directory for run output folders |
| `default_max_tokens` | Token budget sent to providers |
| `max_history_messages` | Max chat history kept per provider session. Values `4+` preserve the first exchange plus newer messages; values `1-3` keep only the most recent messages. |
| `http_timeout_seconds` | Timeout for API calls (`use_cli = false`) |
| `model_fetch_timeout_seconds` | Timeout for model list fetch in config editor |
| `cli_timeout_seconds` | Timeout for CLI calls (`use_cli = true`) |
| `max_history_bytes` | Max total bytes of conversation history per provider session (default 100 KB). Applied after message-count pruning. |
| `pipeline_block_concurrency` | Max concurrent pipeline blocks. `0` = unlimited (default). |
| `diagnostic_provider` | Agent name for the automatic diagnostics pass (disabled when unset) |

**Memory settings** (`[memory]`):

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `enabled` | Enable cross-run memory (`false` by default) |
| `db_path` | Custom SQLite database path (default: `{output_dir}/memory.db`) |
| `project_id` | Override automatic project detection (default: derived from git remote or cwd) |
| `max_recall` | Max memories to recall per run (default: 10) |
| `max_recall_bytes` | Byte budget for recalled memory context (default: 8192) |
| `max_summary_recall` | Max summary-kind memories per recall, 0 = unlimited (default: 2) |
| `extraction_agent` | Agent to use for post-run memory extraction (default: first participating agent, then first configured). Stronger models produce higher-quality memories. |
| `disable_extraction` | Disable post-run memory extraction (default: false) |
| `observation_ttl_days` | Days before observations expire (default: 120) |
| `summary_ttl_days` | Days before summaries expire (default: 180) |
| `stale_permanent_days` | Archive permanent memories (decisions, principles) after N days without recall (default: 365, 0 to disable) |

**Agent settings** (`[[agents]]`):

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Display name for the agent (must be unique) |
| `provider` | Provider type — `anthropic`, `openai`, `gemini`, or `opencode` |
| `api_key` | API key (required when `use_cli = false`, leave empty for CLI mode) |
| `model` | Model identifier to use |
| `use_cli` | Use local CLI binary instead of HTTP API (always `true` for OpenCode) |
| `extra_cli_args` | Shell-style extra CLI args parsed at runtime, for example `--sandbox workspace-write --profile "fast mode"` |
| `reasoning_effort` | OpenAI effort setting — `low` / `medium` / `high` / `xhigh` |
| `thinking_effort` | Anthropic & Gemini effort setting — `low` / `medium` / `high`; Anthropic CLI also supports `xhigh` and `max` (`max` for `claude-opus-4-6`) |

Anthropic `thinking_effort = "xhigh"` and `thinking_effort = "max"` are rejected in API mode. In CLI mode, House of Agents passes them through and lets the `claude` CLI report any model-specific incompatibility.

OpenCode is a CLI-only provider; it has no API mode. Loaded OpenCode agents are normalized to `use_cli = true`, and runtime validation still rejects any invalid in-memory OpenCode API-mode state. The `model` field uses `provider/model` format (e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`, `openai/gpt-4o`). Run `opencode models` to view or configure models, then set the model manually. OpenCode effort is delegated to the OpenCode/model configuration. The `opencode` binary must be installed and authenticated. OpenCode agents always pass `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for non-interactive execution.

OpenCode `extra_cli_args` cannot include `--format`, `--dir`, `--model`, or `-m` forms because House of Agents owns those flags. OpenCode prompts are passed to `opencode run` as a positional argument and preflighted for embedded NUL bytes and a conservative byte limit before spawn. The default `max_history_bytes` can still allow a final OpenCode argv prompt above this conservative cap once prompt wrappers are added. If a prompt-limit error appears, reduce prompt/history size or lower `max_history_bytes`.

### Pipeline Builder Screen

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|

| `a` | Add a new block |
| `d` | Delete selected block |
| `e` | Edit selected block (name, agents, prompt, session ID, replicas); for sub-pipelines edits name + replicas |

| `?` | Open help popup (8 tabbed sections; Tab/Shift+Tab to cycle). Only when focus is not on a text field (initial prompt / session name). |
| `Esc` | Cancel current action / back to home |

Inside the **edit popup**: `Tab` cycles between Name, Agents (multiselect list — `Up`/`Down` to navigate, `Space` to toggle), Profiles (multiselect list of reusable instruction files), Prompt (text area), Session ID, and Replicas fields. `Esc` closes the popup. Each block can have one or more agents selected. Setting Replicas > 1 spawns that many copies per agent. Total tasks per block = agents × replicas (max 32).

**Sub-pipeline blocks**: Press `p` to create a sub-pipeline block. Press `Enter` to drill into it and edit its inner DAG. Press `e` to edit its name and replica count. Press `Esc` to pop back to the parent. Sub-pipelines execute as opaque units. The parent block can have replicas > 1, in which case each replica runs an independent copy of the inner DAG with its own sub-run directory. The inner DAG's terminal finalization block output becomes the sub-pipeline's output to the parent pipeline. Limitations: one level of nesting only (sub-pipelines cannot contain sub-pipelines), the inner pipeline must have exactly one finalization leaf with a single agent and `replicas = 1`. Save (Ctrl+S) and Run (F5) are disabled while inside a sub-pipeline. Tab cycles between the initial prompt and the builder canvas.

**Scatter connections**: A scatter connection splits an upstream block's output into discrete work items using a configurable delimiter (default `===SCATTER_ITEM===`) and distributes them across replicas of the downstream block. Source blocks automatically receive a prompt instruction telling them to format their output with the scatter delimiter — no manual prompt editing needed. To toggle scatter: press `x` to enter connection-action mode, navigate to the connection, and press `s`. Sub-pipeline scatter targets auto-consume: each replica loops internally until the shared queue is drained, so all items are processed even when items outnumber replicas. Faster replicas naturally consume more items. Because sub-pipeline targets drain the queue in a single pass, loop connections are redundant for sub-pipeline scatter targets (the loop will terminate after the first pass since the queue is already empty). For regular (non-sub-pipeline) scatter targets, each replica pops one item at a time from the queue. Combine with a loop connection for full queue drain — replicas keep processing items until the queue is empty, at which point the loop terminates automatically (loop count acts as a safety cap). The scatter target must be the loop's restart block (the block the loop feeds back into). Sub-pipeline blocks can be scatter targets (each replica auto-consumes multiple work items) or scatter sources (the finalization leaf receives the delimiter instruction). Scatter wires render as dashed lines (`╌╎`) in cyan. Constraints: source must have exactly 1 logical task (1 agent × 1 replica, or a single-replica sub-pipeline), max 1 scatter input per block, all scatter edges from the same source must use the same delimiter.

### Order Screen (relay with 2+ agents)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | Move cursor |
| `Space` | Grab / reorder agent |
| `Enter` | Confirm and start |
| `Ctrl+E` | Analyze setup — sends current configuration to `diagnostic_provider` for a plain-language explanation |
| `?` | Open help |
| `Esc` | Back to prompt |

### Running Screen

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | Select run row in batch mode |
| `Esc` | Cancel in-flight run or batch |
| `Enter` | Open results after completion |
| `q` | Quit after run completes |
| `l` | Toggle activity log detail panel |
| `p` | Toggle stream preview on/off |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Cycle preview target between agents/blocks |

### Results Screen

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | Navigate files |
| `Enter` / `l` | Expand/collapse run groups in batch results |
| `Esc` | Return to home |
| `q` | Quit |

> `Ctrl+C` exits from any screen (cancels an active run first).

## Run Artifacts

Each run creates a directory inside `output_dir`:

```
output_dir/
  latest -> 2026-03-05/my_session  # symlink to most recent run (unix)
  runs.toml                        # append-only run index
  2026-03-05/
    my_session/                    # user-defined session name
      prompt.md                    # Original prompt
      session.toml                 # Run metadata
      Claude_iter1.md              # Agent output per iteration
      OpenAI_iter2.md
      consolidated_Claude.md       # Optional: merged output
      errors.md                    # Optional: diagnostics report
      _memories.json               # Optional: extracted memories from this run
      _errors.log                  # Application-level error log
      _sessions.toml               # CLI provider session ID mapping (block/agent → session ID)
    swift-falcon/                  # auto-generated name (no session provided)
      ...
```

Pipeline runs produce per-block output files named using the block's name (sanitized) and a unique block id suffix. Blocks with multiple agents produce one file per agent. When `replicas > 1`, each replica gets an `_rN` suffix. Total runtime tasks per block = agents × replicas:

```
output_dir/
  2026-03-05/
    my_session/
      session.toml                         # mode = "pipeline", block/connection counts, total_runtime_tasks
      prompt.md                            # Pipeline-level prompt (shared across blocks)
      pipeline.toml                        # Pipeline definition snapshot (may include [[session_configs]])
      Analyzer_b1_Claude.md                # Block "Analyzer" (id 1), agent Claude
      Reviewer_b2_Gemini.md                # Block "Reviewer" (id 2), single agent, replicas=1
      Critic_b4_Claude.md                  # Block "Critic" (id 4), agents=[Claude, GPT] — one file per agent
      Critic_b4_GPT.md
      Worker_b3_Claude_r1.md               # Block "Worker" (id 3), replicas=3, replica 1
      Worker_b3_Claude_r2.md               # replica 2
      Worker_b3_Claude_r3.md               # replica 3
      Analyzer_b1_Claude_loop1.md          # loop pass 1 (from loop connection)
      Analyzer_b1_Claude_loop2.md          # loop pass 2
      Fixer_b5_Claude_r1_item0.md          # scatter: replica 1, item 0 (pass 0)
      Fixer_b5_Claude_r2_item1.md          # scatter: replica 2, item 1 (pass 0)
      Fixer_b5_Claude_r1_item2_loop1.md    # scatter: replica 1, item 2 (loop pass 1)
      _errors.log
      _sessions.toml                      # CLI provider session ID mapping
```

Sub-pipeline blocks create a `sub_{name}_b{id}/` subdirectory containing the inner pipeline's outputs and finalization:

```
my_session/

With `replicas > 1`, each replica creates its own sub-directory and parent-level output:

```
my_session/
  Analyzer_b1_Claude.md
  sub_Debugger_b2_pipeline_r1.md      # Replica 1 parent-level output
  sub_Debugger_b2_pipeline_r2.md      # Replica 2 parent-level output
  sub_Debugger_b2_r1/                 # Replica 1 inner artifacts
    InnerBlock_b100_Gemini.md
    finalization/
      Consolidate_b200_Claude.md
  sub_Debugger_b2_r2/                 # Replica 2 inner artifacts
    InnerBlock_b100_Gemini.md
    finalization/
      Consolidate_b200_Claude.md
```

With scatter connections to a sub-pipeline, each replica auto-consumes items from the shared queue. Each processed scatter item gets its own sub-directory and parent-level output file:

```
my_session/
  Source_b1_Claude.md
  sub_Debugger_b2_pipeline_r1_item0.md   # Replica 1, scatter item 0
  sub_Debugger_b2_pipeline_r1_item3.md   # Replica 1, scatter item 3 (auto-consumed)
  sub_Debugger_b2_pipeline_r2_item1.md   # Replica 2, scatter item 1
  sub_Debugger_b2_pipeline_r2_item2.md   # Replica 2, scatter item 2
  sub_Debugger_b2_r1_i0/                 # Item 0 inner artifacts
    ...
  sub_Debugger_b2_r1_i3/                 # Item 3 inner artifacts (auto-consumed)
    ...
  sub_Debugger_b2_r2_i1/
    ...
  sub_Debugger_b2_r2_i2/
    ...
```

Loop-back connections create iterative refinement cycles. `from` is the downstream feedback source and `to` is the upstream restart target. All blocks on regular-graph paths between the two endpoints form the loop sub-DAG and re-run on each pass. In saved pipeline TOML files they appear as:

```toml
[[loop_connections]]
from = 2
to = 1
count = 3
prompt = "Refine based on feedback"
break_agent = "Claude"
break_condition = "Stop when the output is stable and no new improvements are suggested"
```

`count` is the number of additional passes beyond the initial run. Each block in the sub-DAG runs `count + 1` times total. Loop wires are drawn as double-line in yellow on the canvas. Optionally set `break_agent` and `break_condition` to enable early termination — the agent evaluates outputs after each pass and can stop the loop before reaching `count`.

### Profiles

Profiles are reusable system instruction files (Markdown) stored in
`~/.config/houseofagents/profiles/`. Assign them to pipeline blocks to
inject instructions into every message sent by that block.

**Create a profile:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/houseofagents/profiles
cat > ~/.config/houseofagents/profiles/reviewer.md << 'EOF'
You are a senior code reviewer. Focus on:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance implications
- API contract violations
EOF
```

**Assign profiles:** Open the pipeline builder, select a block, press `e` to edit,
Tab to the Profiles field, and Space to toggle profiles on/off.

**CLI vs API behavior:**
- **API agents:** Profile content is read and inlined into the message.
- **CLI agents:** Profile file paths are passed (the CLI tool reads them).

Profiles persist in the pipeline TOML under each block's `profiles` key.
Values are file stems without the `.md` extension:
```toml
[[blocks]]
id = 1
agents = ["Claude"]
profiles = ["reviewer", "security"]
prompt = "Review this PR"
position = [0, 0]
```

Finalization blocks support profiles too since they share the same block model.

**Missing profiles:** If a profile file is deleted or renamed after assignment, the
edit dialog shows it in yellow with `[!]` and setup analysis marks it `[missing]`.
Missing profiles are silently skipped at runtime — no instructions are injected for them.

### Finalization DAG

Pipeline mode supports an optional **finalization phase** that runs after the execution DAG completes. Finalization blocks receive execution outputs via **data feeds** and can be wired into their own dependency DAG via finalization connections. When finalization is defined, it replaces consolidation for pipeline mode.

**Data feeds** connect execution blocks to finalization blocks with two configurable dimensions:

| Setting | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Collection** | `last_pass` (default), `all_passes` | `last_pass` deduplicates loop passes, keeping only the latest output per block. `all_passes` feeds every output including all loop pass variants. |
| **Granularity** | `per_run` (default), `all_runs` | Whether the finalization block runs once per successful run or once across all runs |

A **per-run** finalization block runs independently for each successful run, receiving only that run's execution outputs. An **all-runs** finalization block runs once, receiving outputs from all successful runs. Per-run blocks can feed into all-runs blocks via finalization connections, enabling patterns like "summarize each run, then synthesize across summaries."

Wildcard feeds (`from = 0`) collect outputs from all execution blocks. Block-specific feeds target a single execution block.

Single-run finalization outputs are stored in `run_dir/finalization/`:

```
my_session/
  session.toml
  pipeline.toml
  Analyzer_b1_Claude.md
  Reviewer_b2_Gemini.md
  finalization/
    finalization.toml
    Summary_b3_Claude.md
    Report_b4_GPT.md
```

Batch finalization outputs are stored in `batch_root/finalization/`:

```
my_session/
  batch.toml
  run_1/
    ...
  run_3/
    ...
  finalization/
    finalization.toml
    per_run_summary_Claude_run1.md
    per_run_summary_Claude_run3.md
    meta_report_Claude.md
```

Per-run finalization filenames include the real run ID (only successful runs). The `finalization.toml` metadata file records the successful run IDs, finalization block count, and feed count.

Example pipeline TOML with finalization:

```toml
initial_prompt = "Analyze the codebase"

[[blocks]]
id = 1
name = "Analyzer"
agents = ["Claude"]
prompt = "Analyze the architecture"
row = 0
col = 0

[[blocks]]
id = 2
name = "Reviewer"
agents = ["Gemini"]
prompt = "Review the analysis"
row = 0
col = 1

[[connections]]
from = 1
to = 2

[[finalization_blocks]]
id = 3
name = "Summary"
agents = ["Claude"]
prompt = "Synthesize all findings into a final report"
row = 0
col = 0

[[data_feeds]]
from = 0
to = 3
collection = "last_pass"
granularity = "per_run"
```

Example pipeline TOML with a sub-pipeline block:

```toml
initial_prompt = "Analyze the codebase"

[[blocks]]
id = 1
name = "Prep"
agents = ["Claude"]
prompt = "Gather context"
position = [0, 0]

[[blocks]]
id = 2
name = "Deep Analysis"
position = [1, 0]

[blocks.sub_pipeline]
initial_prompt = "Perform deep analysis"

[[blocks.sub_pipeline.blocks]]
id = 100
name = "Researcher"
agents = ["Gemini"]
prompt = "Research thoroughly"
position = [0, 0]

[[blocks.sub_pipeline.finalization_blocks]]
id = 200
name = "Synthesizer"
agents = ["Claude"]
prompt = "Synthesize findings"
position = [0, 1]

[[blocks.sub_pipeline.data_feeds]]
from = 0
to = 200
collection = "last_pass"
granularity = "per_run"

[[connections]]
from = 1
to = 2
```

Runs are grouped by date: `YYYY-MM-DD/<session_name>`. When no session name is provided, a random two-word name (`adjective-noun`) is generated. Duplicate user-defined session names within the same date are rejected.

When `runs > 1`, House of Agents creates a batch root and one subdirectory per independent run:

```
output_dir/
  2026-03-08/
    my_session/
      batch.toml
      cross_run_consolidation.md   # Optional: synthesis across successful runs
      run_1/
        prompt.md
        session.toml
        Claude_iter1.md
        consolidation.md           # Optional: per-run synthesis
      run_2/
        ...
```

Legacy directories (`YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_NNN[_session]` and `YYYY-MM-DD/HH-MM-SS[_session]`) from older versions are preserved and remain searchable.

## Resume, Consolidation & Diagnostics

- **Resume** (toggle with `Space` on Prompt screen) — available for relay and swarm modes
  - With a session name: resolves the latest run with that name, then validates it against the current run configuration before resuming
  - Without: resumes the latest compatible run with an exact mode match
  - Relay resume requires the exact same agent order
  - Swarm resume requires the exact same agent set
  - Resume also requires the same Keep Session setting — a run started with `keep_session = true` cannot be resumed with it off, and vice versa
  - Batch roots are excluded from resume lookup; resume is currently single-run only
  - Note: resuming a `keep_session = true` run across app restarts does not restore provider conversation history — providers are recreated fresh, though inter-agent handoff context is preserved
- **Forward Prompt** (toggle with `Space` on Prompt screen) — relay mode only; when enabled, downstream agents receive the original prompt alongside the previous agent's output, preventing context loss in the handoff chain
- **Keep Session** (toggle with `Space` on Prompt screen) — on by default; controls whether providers retain their conversation history across iterations. When turned off, each provider's history is cleared before every iteration after the first, so agents treat each round as a fresh conversation. Inter-agent handoff context (relay's previous output, swarm's round outputs) is always preserved regardless of this setting. Pipeline mode has its own per-session session configuration popup accessible via `s` in the Builder screen — each effective session (shared or isolated) can toggle **Loop** (keep across loop passes, default on). When Loop is off, provider history is cleared between loop pass advances. Use `Space` to toggle. Non-default settings are stored in `pipeline.toml` as `[[session_configs]]` entries
- **Consolidation**
  - Single-run: offered after non-cancelled swarm/pipeline runs with 2+ final outputs
  - Batch: first offers per-run consolidation, then optional cross-run consolidation across successful runs
  - Skipped automatically for pipeline runs that have finalization defined (finalization replaces consolidation)
- **Setup Analysis** — press `Ctrl+E` on the Prompt, Order, or Pipeline screen to send the current run configuration to the `diagnostic_provider` for a plain-language explanation of what the run will do. Requires `diagnostic_provider` to be set in config. The popup shows loading state, then a scrollable analysis result (scroll with `j`/`k`/arrows/PgUp/PgDn, close with `Esc`/`q`). Pre-flight checks catch invalid setups locally before making the provider call. Errors are shown inside the popup itself.
- **Diagnostics** — when `diagnostic_provider` is set to an agent name, a final analysis pass writes `errors.md`
