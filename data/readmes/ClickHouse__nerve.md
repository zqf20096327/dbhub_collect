Nerve is a self-hosted runtime for AI agents, built around the [Claude Agent SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk). It gives agents everything they need to be useful long-term: persistent memory, scheduled execution, task management, learnable skills, and channels to reach you through — web UI, Telegram, or autonomous cron jobs.

Ship a **personal assistant** that develops a personality, remembers your preferences, and manages your inbox. Or deploy a **worker agent** that monitors your CI, reviews PRs, and fixes flaky tests — all plan-driven with human approval. Same engine, different mission.

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClickHouse/nerve/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer handles everything — installs dependencies (Python, Node.js, uv), clones the repo, builds the web UI, and launches the interactive setup wizard.

<summary><strong>Manual install</strong></summary>

**Prerequisites:** [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Python 3.13+](https://www.python.org/), [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), [Node.js 22.12+](https://nodejs.org/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ClickHouse/nerve.git && cd nerve
uv sync                      # creates .venv from uv.lock
source .venv/bin/activate
cd web && npm ci && npm run build && cd ..
nerve init
nerve start -f
```
</details>

### Upgrading

```bash
nerve upgrade
nerve restart
```

Runs `git pull`, reinstalls Python deps, and rebuilds the web UI in one shot. Use `--no-pull`, `--no-deps`, or `--no-frontend` to skip steps. For Docker deployments, rebuild the image instead: `git pull && docker compose build && docker compose up -d`.

**No API key?** Use your Claude subscription instead

## Two Modes

### 🧑 Personal Mode

A full-featured assistant for one human. Syncs your email, remembers your preferences, develops personality over time. Comes with a web UI, Telegram bot, memory, cron jobs, and notifications out of the box.

> *"You're not a chatbot. You're becoming someone."* — from the Personal SOUL template

- Workspace files define personality (`SOUL.md`), identity (`IDENTITY.md`), and user context (`USER.md`)
- Memory categories are life-oriented: relationships, finances, travel, health, work
- Default crons: inbox processor, task planner, memory maintenance
- The agent develops opinions, follows up on past conversations, and gets better the longer you use it

### 🔧 Worker Mode

A task-focused autonomous agent for teams or programmatic deployment. Monitors something, proposes fixes, implements after approval. Plan-driven with a full audit trail.

> *"You're a specialist, not a script."* — from the Worker SOUL template

- **Self-configuring**: give it a plain-English task description and it researches, writes its own `TASK.md`, creates skills, sets up cron jobs, and starts working
- Memory categories are operational: patterns, procedures, decisions, approvals, infrastructure
- No `IDENTITY.md` or `USER.md` — workers execute a mission, not build a relationship
- Built for reliability: plan before acting, verify after executing, log everything

```bash
# Spin up a worker that monitors CI and fixes flaky tests
nerve init --mode worker
# → Wizard asks for a task description
# → Agent onboards itself on first boot
```

## Why Nerve?

| | |
|---|---|
| 🧠 **Memory that persists** | Dual-layer memory: curated hot memory loaded every session + semantic search over your entire history. Agents remember context, preferences, and lessons learned — permanently. |
| 🔧 **Self-evolving skills** | Agents watch for repeated workflows and propose reusable skills automatically. Skills are plain Markdown — agents read, create, and improve their own procedures over time. |
| 📋 **Autonomous task planning** | A background planner explores open tasks, researches codebases, and proposes implementation plans — without being asked. You review and approve; the agent executes. |
| 📡 **Multi-source awareness** | Gmail, GitHub, and Telegram flow into a unified inbox with Kafka-style cursors. Multiple consumers process the same data independently — inbox triage, digest generation, task extraction. |
| ⚡ **Single process, zero ops** | No Docker required, no message queues, no service mesh. FastAPI + uvicorn + asyncio. Runs on a Raspberry Pi. |
| 🔑 **No API key required** | Optional OAuth proxy routes through your Claude Max/Pro subscription. Zero API costs. |
| 🔄 **Session persistence** | Sessions survive server restarts. Fork conversations, resume from any point, run up to 4 concurrent agent sessions. |
| 🛡️ **Human-in-the-loop** | Agents can pause mid-turn to ask questions via any channel. Plans require approval before execution. Destructive actions need explicit consent. |

## Channels

Every channel shares the same agent engine, memory, and tools.

### 💬 Web UI

Full React + Vite + TailwindCSS frontend served by FastAPI. Real-time streaming over WebSocket.

- Chat with session history, branching, and resume
- Inline diff viewer for file changes (no git required)
- Task manager, memory browser, skill editor
- Source inbox, notification center, cron logs
- Plan review with approval/decline/revision workflow
- JWT auth, self-signed HTTPS via mkcert

### 🤖 Telegram Bot

Powered by `python-telegram-bot` v21+.

- Streaming responses via edit-in-place
- Inline keyboard buttons for interactive tool questions
- `/reply` command for free-text answers
- Configurable DM policy (`open` or `pairing`)

### ⏰ Cron Jobs

Scheduled AI sessions via APScheduler. Three session modes:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Isolated** | Fresh session per run. No prior context. Best for briefings, cleanup, reports. |
| **Persistent** | Accumulates context across runs. Optional rotation to manage token usage. Reminder mode for lightweight follow-ups. |
| **Main** | Runs inside the user's primary conversation — full context access. |

Built-in crons (personal mode): `skill-extractor` (12h), `skill-reviser` (weekly), `inbox-processor` (15min), `task-planner` (4h). Worker mode ships with `skill-reviser`, `skill-extractor`, and `task-planner` by default; additional crons are configured during onboarding.

### 📡 Source Sync

Cursor-based data ingestion pipeline. Each source runs as an independent APScheduler job.

- **Telegram** — Telethon user-account API (`updates.getDifference`)
- **Gmail** — `gog` CLI with 2-step fetch and LLM condensation
- **GitHub Notifications** — `gh api` enriched with PR/issue content
- **GitHub Events** — Pushes, PRs, reviews, comments

Multiple independent consumers read the same inbox at their own pace. Content is prefixed with untrusted-data warnings to prevent prompt injection.

## Core Systems

### 🧠 Memory

Two layers, one seamless experience.

**L1 — Hot Memory (MEMORY.md)**
Curated facts injected into every system prompt. Active projects, current deadlines, operational lessons. Tagged with dates, automatically evicted when stale.

**L2 — Deep Memory (memU)**
Semantic search over everything — conversations, facts, preferences, events. SQLite-persisted. Uses vector embeddings when an OpenAI key is configured, or LLM-based ranking with Anthropic models only.

- Four memory types: `profile`, `event`, `knowledge`, `behavior`
- Automatic conversation indexing on session close
- Pre-recall: relevant memories delivered with the first message when sessions start (kept out of the system prompt so it stays cacheable across sessions)
- 3-level quality filtering prevents generic facts from polluting memory
- Semantic deduplication (cosine similarity 0.85 threshold)
- Full audit log of all mutations

Memory categories adapt to mode — personal agents track relationships, health, and finances; workers track patterns, procedures, and approvals.

### 📋 Tasks

Markdown files backed by SQLite FTS5 full-text search.

- Statuses: `pending` → `in_progress` → `done` / `deferred`
- Duplicate detection: exact URL match + fuzzy FTS fallback
- Escalation reminders: deadline → +30min follow-up → +2h URGENT (respects quiet hours)
- Full markdown editor in the web UI

### 🔧 Skills

The agent's procedural knowledge. Pure Markdown files that agents read, create, and update themselves.

```
workspace/skills/
└── my-skill/
    ├── SKILL.md          # Instructions (YAML frontmatter + markdown)
    ├── references/       # On-demand documentation
    ├── scripts/          # Executable code (30s timeout)
    └── assets/           # Supporting files
```

- Progressive disclosure: only name + description in system prompt; full content loaded on demand
- `skill-extractor` cron proposes new skills from repeated workflows
- `skill-reviser` cron reviews existing skills for accuracy
- Usage statistics tracked per skill

### 📐 Plans

Proactive task planning with human-in-the-loop approval.

1. Planner cron picks open tasks autonomously
2. Agent explores codebase, researches approaches, proposes implementation plan
3. User reviews → approves / declines / requests revision
4. Approved plans spawn implementation sessions automatically

Revisions happen in the same persistent planner session — full context preserved.

### 🔔 Notifications

Async communication between agent and human, delivered to both web UI and Telegram.

- **`notify`** — Fire-and-forget alerts (status updates, completions, reminders)
- **`ask_user`** — Questions with predefined options, rendered as buttons
- Priority levels: `urgent`, `high`, `normal`, `low`
