# sql-mandelbrot-benchmark
**Because why benchmark sql engines with boring aggregates when you can generate fractals?**

This project uses recursive Common Table Expressions (CTE) to calculate the Mandelbrot set entirely 
in SQL — no loops, no procedural code, just pure SQL. It serves as a fun and visually appealing benchmark 
for testing recursive query performance, floating-point precision, and computational capabilities of SQL engines.

## What is This?

A benchmark suite that:
- Computes the famous [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) using SQL recursive CTEs
- Tests multiple SQL engines — ClickHouse, chDB, CedarDB, DuckDB, ArrowDatafusion, SQLite — plus NumPy and Python implementations for reference.
- Generates beautiful fractal images as proof of correct computation
- Reveals which database / SQL engine renders infinity fastest

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/duckbrot.git
cd duckbrot

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the benchmark suite
python main.py
```

A few engines need a bit of setup (the suite skips any engine that isn't available):
- **ClickHouse** — install the latest build: `curl https://clickhouse.com/ | sh` (puts `clickhouse` on your `PATH`).
- **CedarDB** — start it in Docker before running: `docker run --rm -p 5432:5432 -e CEDAR_PASSWORD=postgres cedardb/cedardb:latest`. CedarDB auto-sizes its working memory to the RAM visible to the container, and the recursive CTE needs a few GB; on macOS/Docker-Desktop give the VM enough memory (≥ ~16 GB) or the query fails with `unable to allocate working memory`.
- **Arc** — start a local Arc server ([build instructions](https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc)) with auth and telemetry off, then leave it running while the suite executes:
  ```bash
  ARC_AUTH_ENABLED=false \
  ARC_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false \
  ARC_STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH=/tmp/arc-mandelbrot/data \
  ARC_AUTH_DB_PATH=/tmp/arc-mandelbrot/arc.db \
  ./arc
  ```
  The Arc binary must be built with the `duckdb_arrow` tag (Arc's `make build` does this by default) so the `/api/v1/query/arrow` endpoint is available. Point the benchmark at a non-default host with `ARC_URL` (default `http://localhost:8000`).

**Winner overall: ClickHouse** — the only engine to beat hand-vectorized NumPy, and by a comfortable margin. End-to-end wall-clock, including launching `clickhouse local` as a subprocess and reading the result back.

**Winner SQL: ClickHouse** — CedarDB is the fastest non-ClickHouse SQL engine (835 ms), yet ClickHouse is still ~1.6x ahead of it and ~3.8x faster than DuckDB.

How ClickHouse gets there (all on the **latest master build**, `curl https://clickhouse.com/ | sh`):
- **Parallelized recursive CTE.** Master fans the recursion's per-iteration work across all cores (~1.7x over a single thread); older builds ran it single-threaded.
- **A jemalloc fix in master.** The recursion allocates and frees a block every iteration. On macOS the jemalloc build used to set `dirty_decay_ms:0` (purge dirty pages immediately), so every free triggered a `madvise()` syscall — pure syscall overhead that also serialized the threads and roughly *doubled* the runtime. This benchmark surfaced the issue ([#108429](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/108429)); it's now fixed in master ([#108430](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/108430)) by enabling jemalloc's `background_thread` and a finite `dirty_decay_ms` on macOS, so **no allocator tuning is needed** — the numbers above are the plain master default.
- **Lean query.** Only the pixel coordinates flow through the recursion (as narrow `UInt16`); the complex-plane mapping is recomputed on the fly, and the final `ORDER BY` is replaced by a NumPy scatter.

`chDB` is the very same ClickHouse engine embedded in-process (its embedded 26.5.1 isn't built with jemalloc, so it never hits the decay issue, but its recursive CTE doesn't parallelize — hence it lands behind the parallel master binary). All SQL engines produce a pixel-for-pixel identical image.

**Arc** ([Basekick-Labs/arc](https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc)) is a columnar analytical database whose query engine *is* DuckDB, so it runs the DuckDB reference query unchanged. Unlike the `duckbrot` row — which embeds DuckDB in-process — the Arc row is the full **client-server** path: a JSON query POSTed over HTTP to a running Arc server, executed on DuckDB, and the ~1.1M-row result streamed back as an Apache Arrow IPC stream (`POST /api/v1/query/arrow`). It lands *faster* than the in-process `duckbrot` row here because the Arrow columnar result is materialized in bulk rather than row-by-row into Python objects, and the recursive-CTE compute — single-threaded in DuckDB — dwarfs the HTTP round-trip. In other words, Arc's server + columnar-wire overhead is negligible on a compute-bound query; the ceiling is DuckDB's single-threaded recursion, which is why Arc (like DuckDB) sits well behind ClickHouse's parallelized master build.

¹ The GPU figure is the original author's MacBook Pro M4 Max measurement, kept as the theoretical "true limit" reference; all other rows are re-measured on this M3 Max.

² Arc re-measured on an Apple M3 Max (best of 5 warm runs, via the repo's own `run_benchmark` harness). Arc's engine is DuckDB v1.5.1; only this row was re-measured, so treat the Arc-vs-DuckDB gap as *client-server transport vs in-process*, not two different engines.

## How It Works

The Mandelbrot set is computed by iterating the formula `z = z² + c` for each pixel in the complex plane:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE
  -- Generate pixel grid and map to complex plane
  pixels AS (
    SELECT
      x, y,
      -2.5 + (x * 3.5 / width) AS cx,
      -1.0 + (y * 2.0 / height) AS cy
    FROM generate_series(0, width-1) AS x,
         generate_series(0, height-1) AS y
  ),
  -- Recursively iterate z = z² + c
  mandelbrot_iterations AS (
    SELECT x, y, cx, cy, 0.0 AS zx, 0.0 AS zy, 0 AS iteration
    FROM pixels

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
      x, y, cx, cy,
      zx * zx - zy * zy + cx AS zx,
      2.0 * zx * zy + cy AS zy,
      iteration + 1
    FROM mandelbrot_iterations
    WHERE iteration < max_iterations
      AND (zx * zx + zy * zy) <= 4.0
  )
SELECT x, y, MAX(iteration) AS depth
FROM mandelbrot_iterations
GROUP BY x, y;
```

The iteration count determines the color of each pixel, creating the iconic fractal pattern.

## Adding New Benchmarks

Want to test PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite or even Oracle or SQL-Server? Just:

1. Create a new file (e.g., `postgresqlbrot.py`)
2. Implement a `run_postgresqlbrot(width, height, max_iterations)` function (the DuckDB implementation is a good starting point)
3. Add one line to `main.py`:
   ```python
   BENCHMARKS = [
       ("ClickHouse (SQL)", "clickbrot", "run_clickbrot"),
       ("DuckDB (SQL)", "duckbrot", "run_duckbrot"),
       ("Pure Python", "pybrot", "run_pybrot"),
       ..., 
       ("PostgreSQL", "postgresqlbrot", "run_postgresqlbrot"),  # New!
   ]
   ```

The framework handles everything else automatically!

## Configuration

Adjust the benchmark parameters in `main.py`:

```python
WIDTH = 1400           # Image width in pixels
HEIGHT = 800           # Image height in pixels
MAX_ITERATIONS = 256   # Maximum recursion depth
```

Higher values = more detail, longer computation time.

## Known Engine Compatibility

### ✅ Works Great
- **ClickHouse** - The fastest engine in the benchmark, beating even vectorized NumPy. Full `Float64` precision, parallelized recursive CTE across all cores (run via the standalone `clickhouse local` binary, latest master build)
- **chDB** - ClickHouse embedded in-process; same engine, same full precision
- **CedarDB** - Fastest non-ClickHouse SQL engine; speaks the PostgreSQL wire protocol (connect via psycopg), run in Docker
- **NumPy** - Highly optimized with loop unrolling and vectorized operations
- **DuckDB** - Excellent performance, proper DOUBLE precision
- **Pure Python** - Reference implementation, just to have an idea how fast the database engines are
- **SQLite** - Works but significantly slower due to recursive CTE overhead

### Should Work (untested, please contribute 🤙)
- PostgreSQL (with proper recursive CTE support)
- others 

### Known Issues
- Some engines might struggle with support for DOUBLE precision and may use DECIMAL (not good for fractals, and lead to pixelated results)
- Watch out for type inference - explicit `::DOUBLE` casts are critical!

## What This Tests

This benchmark evaluates:
1. **Recursive CTE Performance** - How efficiently engines handle deep recursion
2. **Floating-Point Precision** - DOUBLE vs DECIMAL arithmetic accuracy
3. **Query Optimization** - How well engines optimize complex recursive queries
4. **Scalability** - Performance with increasing iterations and resolution
