# Tokenomics Viewer

Local-first cost and token analytics for Codex, Claude Code, omp (oh-my-pi),
Pi, Gemini CLI, Qwen Code, OpenCode, Cursor Agent, Grok Build, and GitHub
Copilot CLI/VS Code, powered by ClickHouse. Tokenomics reads local session logs,
removes replayed parent traces
from forked Codex sessions, normalizes exact usage where the source proves its
semantics, and estimates costs from an editable pricing catalog.

The dashboard and database run on your machine. Tokenomics does not upload
session logs or reports.

## Quick Start

Install or update Tokenomics on macOS or Linux, run the initial sync, and open
the dashboard:

```bash
/bin/sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skuznetsov/tokenomics-viewer/main/install.sh)"
```

Automatic setup supports arm64 and x86-64 macOS or Linux. It expects the
standard `curl`, `tar`, `sed`, `awk`, and `find` tools; installing the private
Node.js runtime also requires `shasum` or `sha256sum` for verification.

The installer does not use `sudo` or install npm packages. On the first run it:

1. Installs Tokenomics under `~/.local/share/tokenomics-viewer`.
2. Adds launchers under `~/.local/bin`.
   On macOS, it also records the launcher for the native menu bar client under
   `~/Library/Application Support/Tokenomics Viewer`.
3. Installs a private Node.js 26 runtime when the system Node.js is too old.
4. Installs `clickhousectl`, selects stable ClickHouse, and starts the named
   `tokenomics` server.
5. Imports supported exact-usage sessions and observed-only Cursor/Grok/Copilot
   metadata into ClickHouse.
6. Starts the dashboard on a loopback address and opens it in your browser.

Subsequent launches are one command:

```bash
tokenomics-launch
```

Run the one-line installer again to update Tokenomics. To install or update
without launching the application:

```bash
TOKENOMICS_NO_LAUNCH=1 /bin/sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skuznetsov/tokenomics-viewer/main/install.sh)"
```

Updates replace the previously installed local runtime before synchronization.
Ordinary incremental synchronization keeps the last committed report visible;
when an analytics-format migration requires a one-time replay, Tokenomics hides
the affected totals until the corrected generation is published atomically.

If `~/.local/bin` is not on `PATH`, the installer prints the exact `export`
command to use. It does not edit shell startup files.

## What You Get

- Cost, request, and input/cache/output token totals with compact units.
- Adaptive Token Flow and Project Cost charts from daily down to 15-minute
  resolution, with pointer-centered wheel zoom, drag pan, range selection, and
  absolute or relative dates.
- Model-colored points and lines, gaps when a model was not used, and interval
  tooltips with cost, token, and share breakdowns.
- Model and effort tables with input/cache/output costs, tokens, and shares.
- `Overview` for a compact report and `Analyst` for project, model, effort, and
  resource diagnostics.
- Deterministic recommended actions with evidence, confidence, and caveats.
- An editable, database-backed provider and model pricing catalog.
- Usage events preserve the billing provider, harness agent, raw service tier,
  and canonical `standard`/`fast`/`unknown` service mode as separate dimensions.
- The dashboard exposes Service Mode totals so explicit fast telemetry is not
  confused with a model name or a provider-specific tier.
- Codex fast-mode credit-equivalent pricing when a session records its service
  tier.
- Codex rate-limit consumption summaries when snapshots are present.
- Observed Harness Coverage for Cursor Agent, Grok Build, and GitHub Copilot
  CLI/VS Code session metadata. These sessions are explicitly `observed-only`:
  usage is unavailable and they
  never change exact token, request, cost, agent, or service-mode totals.

Cost estimates are analytical aids, not billing statements. Subscription usage,
negotiated rates, batch pricing, missing service-tier markers, and unrecognized
models can differ from the standard API-equivalent catalog.

## Common Commands

Start with ClickHouse, sync changed sessions, and open the browser:

```bash
tokenomics-launch
```

Start without opening a browser, or prefer another dashboard port:

```bash
tokenomics-launch --no-open
tokenomics-launch --port 8790
```

Limit discovery to one source. Tokenomics options follow `--`:

```bash
tokenomics-launch -- --source codex
tokenomics-launch -- --source claude
tokenomics-launch -- --source omp
tokenomics-launch -- --source gemini
tokenomics-launch -- --source opencode
tokenomics-launch -- --source cursor
tokenomics-launch -- --source grok
tokenomics-launch -- --source copilot
```

The default `--source all` scans exact Claude Code, Codex, omp, Pi, Gemini,
Qwen, and OpenCode sources together, plus observed-only Cursor Agent, Grok
Build, and GitHub Copilot CLI/VS Code metadata.

Serve the current ClickHouse database without scanning source files:

```bash
tokenomics --db-engine clickhouse --webserver --no-sync
```

Print a JSON report from the current ClickHouse database:

```bash
tokenomics --db-engine clickhouse --json
```

Scan explicit files or archives directly and print an in-memory report:

```bash
tokenomics /path/to/session.jsonl /path/to/archived_sessions.zip
tokenomics --json --output report.json /path/to/sessions
```

When running from a source checkout, replace `tokenomics-launch` with
`./launcher.js` and `tokenomics` with `./app.js`.

## ClickHouse

ClickHouse is the default and recommended database. The launcher normally
installs and manages it, so manual setup is not required. The dashboard starts
listening before the automatic sync finishes; `/api/sync` and the UI expose the
running, succeeded, or failed state while synchronization continues in the
background.

The local defaults are:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Server name | `tokenomics` |
| HTTP endpoint | `http://127.0.0.1:8123` |
| Native TCP port | `9000` |
| Database | `tokenomics` |

### Check and Control the Local Server

```bash
cd "${TOKENOMICS_DATA_HOME:-${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}}/tokenomics-viewer"
chctl --version
chctl local server list
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8123/ping
chctl local client --name tokenomics --query "SELECT version()"
```

Start or stop the named server:

```bash
cd "${TOKENOMICS_DATA_HOME:-${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}}/tokenomics-viewer"
chctl local server start --name tokenomics --http-port 8123 --tcp-port 9000
chctl local server stop tokenomics
```

`clickhousectl` stores local server state under `.clickhouse/` in the directory
where it is run. `tokenomics-launch` always invokes it from Tokenomics' persistent
data directory, independent of the shell, Finder, or Login Items working directory.
Run manual control commands from that same data directory. If
`chctl local server list` is unexpectedly empty, check your current directory first.

To install `clickhousectl` manually:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clickhouse.com/cli | sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
chctl local use stable
```

See the official
[`clickhousectl` getting-started guide](https://clickhouse.com/blog/getting-started-clickhousectl)
for version and local-server management details.

### Use an Existing ClickHouse Server

The low-level CLI accepts an alternate endpoint, database, and credentials:

```bash
tokenomics --sync --webserver --db-engine clickhouse \
  --clickhouse-url http://127.0.0.1:8123 \
  --clickhouse-database tokenomics \
  --clickhouse-user default
```

Credentials can also be supplied through `TOKENOMICS_CLICKHOUSE_USER` and
`TOKENOMICS_CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD`. The endpoint and database have matching
`TOKENOMICS_CLICKHOUSE_URL` and `TOKENOMICS_CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE` variables.
Prefer environment variables to command-line passwords so credentials do not
appear in shell history or process listings.

Webserver mode binds its HTTP endpoint before the initial sync begins and serves
a valid snapshot while `/api/sync` reports progress. Later syncs keep the last
completed statistics readable; pass `--no-sync` to serve the current database
without starting an automatic scan.

### Batching, Compression, and Reset

ClickHouse inserts are bounded by both row count and request size: 100,000 rows
or 32 MiB by default, whichever is reached first. Tune memory and server load
with:

```bash
tokenomics --sync --db-engine clickhouse \
  --clickhouse-insert-batch-rows 50000 \
  --clickhouse-insert-batch-bytes 16MiB
```

Tokenomics uses ZSTD-based per-column codecs, plus Delta, Gorilla, or T64 where
appropriate for timestamps, counters, floats, and flags.

As a last resort, discard and rebuild every Tokenomics-owned ClickHouse table:

```bash
tokenomics --sync --db-engine clickhouse --clickhouse-reset
```

This is destructive for the selected Tokenomics database. Normal upgrades,
pricing changes, and incremental syncs do not require a reset.

## How Sync Works

With no explicit paths, Tokenomics discovers:

- `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/projects/**/*.jsonl`, or every root in the
  path-delimited `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIRS`
- Claude Desktop/Cowork
  `local-agent-mode-sessions/**/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`
- `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/sessions/**/*.{jsonl,jsonl.zst}`
- `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/archived_sessions/**/*.{jsonl,jsonl.zst,zip}`
- `${OMP_HOME:-~/.omp/agent}/sessions/**/*.jsonl` (omp/oh-my-pi)
- `~/.pi/agent/sessions/**/*.jsonl` (Pi)
- `~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats/session-*.{json,jsonl}` (Gemini CLI)
- `~/.qwen/projects/*/chats/*.jsonl` (Qwen Code)
- `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/opencode/opencode*.db` (OpenCode,
  read-only)
- `~/.cursor/projects/*/agent-transcripts/**/*.jsonl` (Cursor Agent,
  observed-only)
- `~/.grok/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<session-id>/updates.jsonl` (Grok Build,
  observed-only; reads sibling `summary.json` and optional `signals.json`)
- `~/.copilot/session-state/<session-id>/events.jsonl` (GitHub Copilot CLI,
  observed-only)
- `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/workspaceStorage/*/chatSessions/*.jsonl`
  on macOS, with the equivalent `~/.config/Code/...` and
  `~/AppData/Roaming/Code/...` roots on Linux and Windows (GitHub Copilot in
  VS Code, observed-only)

Use `--source claude`, `--source codex`, `--source omp`, `--source pi`,
`--source gemini`, `--source qwen`, `--source opencode`, `--source cursor`,
`--source grok`, `--source copilot`, `--archives`, or `--no-archives` to control
default discovery.
ZIP and Zstandard-compressed rollouts are read
directly without extracting them. If both `.jsonl` and `.jsonl.zst` versions
exist during a compression transition, the plain file is read once.

Cursor, Grok Build, and Copilot records are metadata coverage, not exact token
telemetry. The
ingester does not parse Cursor conversation content or Grok `updates.jsonl`
events, and never turns file size, mtime, context snapshots, or running totals
into usage or cost estimates. Cursor records use the transcript file mtime as
explicit `fileModifiedAt` provenance and leave the model unknown unless a
future source proves a session-level model. Grok records retain the model and
project from `summary.json`, plus `contextTokensUsed` and
`contextWindowTokens` snapshots from `signals.json` when present. Copilot CLI
records retain completed turns, reported output tokens, premium requests, and
AIU checkpoints. VS Code journals are replayed to final request metadata while
conversation and tool-response payloads are discarded; their reported prompt,
completion, credit, and tool-round counters remain observational only.

Sync is incremental by source fingerprint. Unchanged sessions are skipped.
Plain append-only Codex and Claude Code JSONL files resume after the last
complete newline, using a ClickHouse-stored byte cursor and resumable parser
checkpoint; an incomplete trailing record waits for the next sync. The cursor
binds the device/inode, a tail hash, and bounded prefix samples. Truncation,
rotation, a changed guard, Codex fork/replay input, or an unsafe parser
checkpoint falls back to a new full source epoch. The bounded guard deliberately
trusts the append-only producer contract: hashing every byte on every sync would
make a tiny append proportional to the lifetime of the file, and an in-place
rewrite outside the sampled windows can therefore require a manual reset.

Claude Code checkpoints retain only a bounded recent request-ID window. The
durable ClickHouse event key (request ID when present, otherwise the global
source line) remains the exact cross-append and retry deduplication authority,
so an old duplicate does not force the checkpoint or parser memory to grow with
the session. Compressed files, archive entries, and other adapters replace their
previous normalized data. Codex fork metadata and replay traces avoid counting
inherited parent history again in subagent sessions.

All calendar buckets and range boundaries use UTC: day, ISO week, month, year,
and the existing 15-minute timeline. A version upgrade that changes a derived
field such as UTC calendar keys or service tier causes one full source reimport;
later syncs return to normal fingerprint-based incrementality.

Each append-only ClickHouse source keeps one immutable epoch ID while new
normalized rows are added only for the newly completed byte range. A rewrite
starts a new epoch. A sync writes manifest deltas only for changed or removed
sources. Every 128 delta generations it writes a metadata-only checkpoint of
the current source heads, bounding later manifest reconstruction without
rereading or reinserting session events. Deltas live in a time-ordered table,
and reports constrain that primary-key range to post-checkpoint generations.
Each checkpoint records its base generation; a checkpoint crossed by a
concurrent commit is ignored while its changed-source delta remains available.
The sync then publishes one global generation marker last. Reports reconstruct
and pin both
the active epoch and its committed byte offset at that marker,
deduplicate idempotent retries by logical event key, and replace provisional
open-turn metrics by turn key. A failed sync can leave recoverable staged rows,
but they remain past the committed offset and therefore cannot advance either
the report or the next parser cursor. Physical storage grows with newly observed
events (plus failed staging retries and orphaned epochs after rewrites), not with
repeated copies of the entire session or source manifest.

Pricing revisions are deliberately excluded from source fingerprints. Editing
a rate or adding a model updates normalized database costs without reopening
JSONL, ZIP, or Zstandard source files.

### Exact multi-harness adapters

Pi records per-message `usage` buckets directly. Gemini CLI and Qwen Code
record cached tokens as a subset of prompt/input tokens, so Tokenomics subtracts
that subset exactly once before aggregation. Their visible candidate/output and
thinking buckets are disjoint, so both contribute to output-billed tokens while
thinking remains available as an attributed subset. OpenCode is opened read-only with
Node's SQLite API; active top-level session messages use `data.tokens`, retain
`providerID` as the billing provider and `opencode` as the harness agent, and
ignore embedded cost in favor of the normal pricing catalog. Claude discovery
honors its config-directory environment variables and includes nested Claude
Desktop/Cowork project sessions. Missing or malformed explicit mode metadata
always remains `unknown`.

### Observed-only Cursor Agent, Grok Build, and GitHub Copilot

Cursor Agent, Grok Build, and GitHub Copilot are metadata-coverage adapters, not
exact usage adapters. Cursor discovery uses
`~/.cursor/projects/*/agent-transcripts/**/*.jsonl`
and records only the project path plus transcript file mtime (`fileModifiedAt`);
conversation lines are not parsed and the model remains unknown. Grok Build
discovery uses `~/.grok/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<session-id>/updates.jsonl` and
reads only sibling `summary.json` plus optional `signals.json` metadata. It
retains summary model/project/timestamp fields and context-token snapshots when
present. Copilot CLI discovery uses
`~/.copilot/session-state/<session-id>/events.jsonl`; it retains the session
model/project/timestamp, completed turns, assistant-reported output tokens, and
the final `session.usage_checkpoint`. VS Code discovery filters
`workspaceStorage/*/chatSessions/*.jsonl` to GitHub Copilot snapshots, replays
the journal to its final request metadata, and ignores response-array content.
None of these adapters calls usage aggregation, creates service-mode rows, or
contributes to exact token/cost totals. The dashboard labels this surface
“Observed Harness Coverage” and states that usage is unavailable.

### omp (oh-my-pi)

omp is a coding-agent harness that runs Zhipu AI (Z.AI) GLM models. Each omp
session is one append-only JSONL transcript at
`~/.omp/agent/sessions/<project-slug>/<ISO-timestamp>_<session-uuid>.jsonl`, with
one subdirectory per working directory.

The default root is relocatable. Override it with `--omp-home` (or the `OMP_HOME`
variable), which points at the agent data directory that contains `sessions/`,
the same role `--codex-home` plays for Codex. omp's native relocation variables
are also honored: `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` moves `~/.omp/agent` outright, and
`PI_CONFIG_DIR` renames the config root (default `.omp`).

Ingest walks every `.jsonl` file under the sessions tree, so a session's parent
transcript and omp's own subagent sidecars are both counted. Totals are flat per
session: each assistant and tool-result line carrying a `usage` block is summed
into one input, cache-read/write, and output total. omp transcripts carry no
rate-limit or quota snapshots, and subscription-plan detection is not supported
for omp, so no rate-limit summaries appear for it (Codex shows rate-limit
summaries only when its snapshots are present).

## Dashboard

The dashboard has three modes:

- `Overview` shows headline totals, recommendations, Token Flow, and a compact
  model ranking.
- `Analyst` adds per-project timelines, the full model/effort table, and Cost &
  Resource Diagnostics.
- `Settings` edits pricing and analytics configuration.

Each source's usage surfaces under its provider in the model and effort tables.
omp models appear as `omp/<model>` (for example, `omp/glm-5.2`), next to Codex
and Claude Code entries.

Token Flow and Project Cost load compact timeline buckets on demand. Hover
anywhere in a chart to inspect the nearest interval; use the wheel to zoom at
the pointer, drag in `Pan` mode to move through history, drag in `Zoom` mode to
select a range, and double-click to reset. Relative and absolute date controls
bound the data before interactive zooming.

The dashboard exposes these local endpoints:

- `/api/summary` for dashboard aggregates.
- `/api/timeline` for range- and project-filtered timeline data.
- `/api/report` for the complete normalized report.
- `/api/sync` and `/api/sync/events` for protected sync and live progress.

The server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. Dashboard-triggered sync and pricing
changes are enabled only on loopback bindings. A server exposed through
`0.0.0.0` or a LAN address is intentionally read-only because Tokenomics does
not provide remote-user authentication.

## Pricing and Diagnostics

The first database open seeds a packaged pricing catalog from
`lib/core/pricing.js`. The active catalog and analytics settings then live in
the selected database.

In `Settings`, you can:

- select a `Work API` profile for estimated billed cost and an optional monthly
  USD limit, or a `Home Subscription` profile for observed quota windows and
  API-equivalent list-price economics;
- edit per-million-token input, cache-write, cache-read, and output rates;
- add providers and models;
- choose exact, prefix, or dated-snapshot model matching;
- select OpenAI short/long context pricing;
- apply a global rate multiplier.

Saves use optimistic revisions. SQLite derives new costs from normalized rows;
ClickHouse creates a compact revisioned cost overlay with one `INSERT SELECT`
and publishes the configuration marker last. Neither backend rereads session
files after a pricing-only change. Profile-name, profile-mode, and monthly-limit
changes do not alter prices, so they reuse the current pricing revision and do
not create a new ClickHouse cost overlay.

`API Cost` is the estimated billed amount for an API profile. `API Equivalent`
applies the same active catalog to subscription usage as a counterfactual value;
it is not an invoice. Subscription windows are shown only when the provider
reports them, and per-quota-point projections require near-complete pricing and
time coverage. The current frontier supports one usage profile per database;
mixed local and work sources require separate databases until source-level
profile assignment is implemented.

Custom providers can be priced only when an ingested record contains the same
provider slug. Adding a catalog row cannot infer provider identity missing from
the source log. Set the pricing basis to `custom` for negotiated, batch,
subscription, or other non-standard rates.

Diagnostics compare effort levels only inside one provider/model cohort and
within the selected model date range. They report usage-event count, tariff
coverage, estimated spend, covered input/cache/output per event, amortized spend
per output token, cache-read share, and reasoning share. A usage event is not
necessarily a user request or completed task, and tariff coverage means only
that the local catalog recognized an event. Without outcome or quality data,
Tokenomics does not rank effort levels as objectively better or worse.

GPT-6 Astra, Sol, and Luna, and GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra, and Luna support separate
input, cache-write, cache-read, and output rates. GPT-6 Sol and Luna use their
[official rates](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing) from September
22, 2026 UTC; earlier usage of those model IDs stays unpriced. Packaged GPT-5.6
Sol prices preserve the pre-August 21, 2026 tariff and apply the reduced rate
from that date.
Legacy Codex `input_tokens` plus `cached_input_tokens` records are
treated as total input with cached input as a read subset. Explicit
`cache_creation_input_tokens` plus `cache_read_input_tokens` records preserve
cache writes separately. Tokenomics does not invent cache-write volume for
legacy records that cannot prove it.

For standard pricing, Codex `thread_settings_applied.service_tier=priority`
applies the documented ChatGPT fast-mode credit multipliers: `2.5x` for
GPT-6 Astra, GPT-5.6, and GPT-5.5, and `2x` for GPT-5.4
([official fast-mode documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/speed)).
This is deliberately separate from API Priority processing. GPT-6 Sol and Luna
do not receive a Codex fast credit multiplier until that separate tariff is
confirmed; the API's Fast-mode multiplier alone does not establish it. Missing
or unknown tiers remain standard-priced instead of silently assuming fast mode. In
particular, a forked child rollout that omits its own service tier does not
inherit the parent's tier, so such local logs can understate workspace billing.
Custom pricing is used as entered and does not receive these packaged
multipliers.

Claude Code `usage.speed` is mapped per request: `fast` is fast mode and
`standard`/`normal` are standard mode; missing or invalid values remain
`unknown`. Claude `usage.service_tier` is retained separately and never implies
fast mode. The packaged catalog prices Claude Opus 5.5 at its
[official rates](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing)
from September 22, 2026 UTC, including its special 5% cache-read rate.
It prices Claude Opus 5 and Claude Opus 4.8 at the same standard rates and
applies the documented 2x fast tariff to all three; other models
stay at their standard catalog rate until an explicit provider tariff is
verified. Custom pricing is not multiplied by this packaged fast tariff
([official Claude Code fast-mode documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/fast-mode)).
Claude's first transition into fast mode can invalidate the current prompt
cache; Tokenomics prices the token buckets recorded by the harness and does not
guess that transition from surrounding requests.

`codex-auto-review` uses effective rates of `$2.50` input, `$0.25` cached
input, and `$15.00` output per million tokens through August 6, 2026, then
`$0.20`, `$0.02`, and `$1.20` respectively from August 7. The rates and cutoff
are derived from observed OpenAI workspace billing exports; OpenAI does not
currently publish a separate public model-rate page for this internal model id.

omp (oh-my-pi) cost is estimated from the packaged omp pricing catalog using
official Z.AI (Zhipu AI) GLM rates in USD per million tokens
([source](https://docs.z.ai/guides/overview/pricing)). The catalog covers the
`glm-4.5`, `glm-4.6`, `glm-4.7`, `glm-5`, `glm-5.1`, and `glm-5.2` models and
their variants, plus free tiers such as `glm-4.5-flash` and `glm-4.7-flash`.
omp writes a precomputed cost into each transcript, but Tokenomics ignores it
and re-derives cost from this catalog so unpriced or repriced models stay
accurate.

The proposed compressed session store and project-scoped session viewer are not
implemented. Their intended safety boundary is documented in
[`docs/PRICING_CONFIGURATION_FRONTIER.md`](docs/PRICING_CONFIGURATION_FRONTIER.md).

## Troubleshooting

### The First Sync Takes a Long Time

The initial import must parse all discovered sessions and archives. Watch the
terminal for per-session progress. Later syncs use source fingerprints and
should skip unchanged data. Large ClickHouse inserts are streamed in bounded
batches, so increasing the Node.js heap should not be the first response to a
slow or failed import.

For a smaller diagnostic run:

```bash
tokenomics --sync --db-engine clickhouse --source codex --limit-files 20
```

Each sync also emits single-line JSON records prefixed with `[sync-metric]`.
They cover discovery, per-source imports, same-session source decisions, and the
final report snapshot. The records include request, token, cost, pricing,
parser, date-range, model, agent, and service-mode metrics so runs can be
compared with standard JSON tooling:

```bash
tokenomics --sync --source codex 2>&1 | rg '^\[sync-metric\]'
```

Structured diagnostic records use stable hashed source and session identifiers
instead of raw paths or session IDs. Existing human-readable progress messages
remain available for interactive troubleshooting.

### `chctl` Is Not Found

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
chctl --version
```

Add that export to your shell startup file if needed. The Tokenomics installer
prints a shell-specific suggestion but does not modify the file itself.

### ClickHouse Is Not Reachable

```bash
cd "${TOKENOMICS_DATA_HOME:-${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}}/tokenomics-viewer"
chctl local server list
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8123/ping
```

Run both commands from the Tokenomics data directory because local
`clickhousectl` servers are directory-scoped. If port `8123` belongs to another
service, either stop that service or run Tokenomics directly against another
ClickHouse HTTP endpoint with `--clickhouse-url`.

### The Dashboard Port Is Busy

The launcher tries the preferred port and the next 20 ports. Set another
starting point explicitly:

```bash
tokenomics-launch --port 8790
```

### An Installer Fails with HTML or `<!doctype`

Run the current one-line installer again. The launcher validates the
`clickhousectl` download before executing it and rejects HTML/error responses
instead of passing them to `/bin/sh`.

### Start Without Rescanning

```bash
tokenomics --db-engine clickhouse --webserver --no-sync
```

## SQLite Fallback

SQLite remains available for portability, small datasets, or environments
where running ClickHouse is not practical. ClickHouse is the tested default and
recommended path for large session histories.

Use SQLite for one launch:

```bash
tokenomics-launch --sqlite
```

Install or update and immediately opt out of ClickHouse:

```bash
/bin/sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skuznetsov/tokenomics-viewer/main/install.sh)" -- --sqlite
```

Or manage the SQLite database directly:

```bash
tokenomics --sync --webserver --db-engine sqlite --db tokenomics.sqlite
tokenomics --webserver --no-sync --db-engine sqlite --db tokenomics.sqlite
```

Installed-launcher SQLite data is kept across application updates at
`~/.local/share/tokenomics-viewer/tokenomics.sqlite`.

## Privacy and Data

Session logs, reports, and databases can reveal local paths, project names,
timestamps, model choices, usage patterns, and estimated spending. Keep the
dashboard on loopback and review generated output before publishing it.

The installer writes application versions beneath
`~/.local/share/tokenomics-viewer` and launchers beneath `~/.local/bin`. Local
ClickHouse server data is managed by `clickhousectl` beneath the launch
directory's `.clickhouse/` tree. SQLite files and generated reports in the
repository are ignored by `.gitignore`.

## Development

Requirements:

- Node.js 26 or newer
- No npm dependencies

Run from a source checkout:

```bash
./launcher.js
./app.js --help
```

Run the complete test suite and syntax checks:

```bash
node --test
node --check app.js
node --check launcher.js
```

The implementation is organized by responsibility:

- `lib/core/` contains report state, usage normalization, pricing,
  aggregation, and rate-limit calculations.
- `lib/ingest/` contains source discovery, JSONL parsing, archive readers, and
  fork/replay handling.
- `lib/storage/` contains the SQLite and ClickHouse backends and shared facade.
- `lib/report/`, `lib/web-server.js`, and `lib/cli.js` contain presentation,
  HTTP, and command-line boundaries.
- `test/*.test.js` mirrors those domains; shared fixtures live in
  `test/support/`.
