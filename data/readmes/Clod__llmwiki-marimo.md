**English** · [Español](README_ES.md)

A personal, local-first wiki that ingests your documents, builds a structured knowledge base, and lets you read and chat with it — all on your machine, no cloud required.

Inspired by [Karpathy's LLM Wiki idea](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2039805659525644595).
The PDF-extraction and a few low-level ingestion pieces are adapted from [Lucas Astorian's open-source LLM Wiki](https://github.com/lucasastorian/llmwiki)
(Apache-2.0); the rest is an independent local-first build on Marimo + SQLite. See [`NOTICE`](NOTICE).

![The read app's Read tab on the built-in sample wiki: a searchable table of generated pages on the left, and the selected concept page rendered on the right with its definition, key characteristics, context, and cross-links to related pages](docs/assets/read_app_read_tab.png)

*The **Read** tab on the built-in sample wiki — every page in the table was written by the model from a source PDF, and the See-also links between them were added by the repair pass, not by hand.*

![The read app's Chat tab: two checkboxes select the answering mode, and the assistant answers "What do Cinderella and Snow White have in common?" across two documents, citing a specific wiki page for each of the three claims it makes. Below, an expanded form offers to save the answer as a new page](docs/assets/read_app_chat_tab.png)

*The **Chat** tab, same wiki, one real answer. Three claims, five citations, each naming the page it came from. The two checkboxes are the whole design argument — **Strict mode** audits the model after it answers; **Pre-retrieval** has code retrieve first and refuse before the model is ever called ([which to pick, and why](docs/query_walkthrough.md)). Below: the **Save to wiki** form — the agent has no write tool, so a good answer becomes a permanent page only on your click.*

▶ **[Watch the 1-minute demo](https://youtu.be/VLX5kLczQbk)** — reading a generated wiki, then one cross-document answer citing a page for every claim (9s), then the same kind of question refused **in 1.2s because the model was never called**.

---

## Highlights

> **Why not just point Claude Code at a folder of notes?** That is the honest
> question, and it has a long answer:
> **[From Idea to Product](docs/from_idea_to_product.md)** — seventeen ways the
> LLM-wiki idea leaks when a generic agent is pointed at it, each with a real
> example and what this project does about it — including the three where the
> answer is a deliberate trade rather than a fix.

**A self-contained, agentic LLM-wiki.** Most takes on Karpathy's idea point an
*external* agent — Claude Desktop, Cursor, an MCP client — at an Obsidian vault.
This one ships its own embedded agent: ingestion, agentic retrieval (the chat
assistant decides when to read a page vs. search), self-maintenance, and a
reading UI are a single app, with no external agent or plugin host to wire up.
The trade-off is honest — it's not an Obsidian plugin, so there's no graph view
or plugin ecosystem (see [Limitations](#limitations--non-goals)).

**Knowledge that also knows the numbers — beyond an encyclopedia.** Most "chat
with your documents" tools — classic RAG, NotebookLM, even the original LLM-wiki
— handle only *durable prose*: they answer "what **is** X?" but go stale and
can't tell you the current numbers, let alone compute over them. This adds a
**second, first-class kind of knowledge**: alongside the distilled concept pages,
a wiki can carry **live, structured datasets** (rates, prices, stats) that are
refreshed, queried exactly, and **computed over deterministically** — and the
same grounded agent reasons across *both*, citing source **and date** for every
figure and refusing to invent or estimate the unknowable. The bundled example is
an **Argentine personal-finance advisor** (`finance_argentina`): ask *"I have $X
I won't need for Y months — what are my options and what would I earn?"* and it
ranks real alternatives with cited, dated figures, computes the gains in
**deterministic code (never the LLM)**, and flags variable-return instruments
(equities, inflation- or FX-linked) as *not estimable* rather than guessing. The
data engine is **domain-neutral** (`datasets`, not "rates") — finance is just the
first overlay. *An original synthesis: a local-first, fully-cited knowledge wiki
that also keeps live data and computes grounded advice over it.*

**AI / LLM engineering**

- **Dynamic data, not just prose** — a domain-neutral `datasets` engine ingests structured, periodically-refreshed tables (rates/prices/stats) as a lane separate from the durable concept pages, exposed to the chat agent as a `query_dataset` tool; values are quoted verbatim with their `as_of` date, never recalled from memory.
- **Deterministic, grounded advisory** — the example `finance_argentina` overlay computes "what would I earn" over those datasets in pure Python (effective-rate math, eligibility), lists every option ranked and cited, and refuses to estimate the non-deterministic (equities, inflation, FX) rather than fabricating a number.
- **Enforceable grounding (cite-or-refuse)** — a deterministic post-check: if an answer isn't backed by a tool result it's replaced with an honest refusal, so the model can't quietly fall back on general knowledge. A GUI toggle switches strict (buffered + gated) vs. normal (streamed).
- **Wiki-first RAG** — reads a curated, interlinked encyclopedia first (`index.md` → wiki FTS5 → raw source chunks as a fallback), so knowledge is compiled once and compounds instead of being re-retrieved per query.
- **Per-wiki language (en/es, extensible)** — set `[wiki] language` in `wiki_config.toml` and the whole wiki — generated pages, section headers, *and* chat answers — is produced in that language, **regardless of the source documents' language**. Run an English wiki and a Spanish wiki side by side; adding a third language is one `Locale` entry.
- **LLM-as-judge eval packet** — one command bundles the questions, the model's own answers, the cited evidence, and source-vs-generated page pairs against a *frozen* 1–5 rubric, to score chat **and** ingestion quality (and compare models).
- **Model-suitability check** — a one-command PASS/FAIL on whether a given model clears the bar for off-corpus refusal, citations, and cited synthesis.
- **Evidence-based prompting** — the default system prompt embeds a worked, fully-cited example because testing proved that's what reliable cross-document citation took.
- **Self-maintaining wiki** — ten lint checks (contradictions, stale pages, orphans, missing concepts, missing cross-refs, data gaps, filled gaps, vocabulary drift, thin pages, sources that produced no page) with auto-repair of the safe ones.
- **Provider-agnostic, split-model** — any OpenAI-compatible endpoint; run a cheap local model for chat and a stronger one for ingestion, via `.env` alone.

**Engineering quality**

- **Tests across three layers, ≈1:1 test-to-code** (framework-agnostic core in `base/`, exercised without a browser) — deterministic fake-LLM unit tests (no keys, no network); a frozen golden-corpus *characterization* regression that re-checks the real-ingest backbone without re-calling the model; and Playwright E2E on the live apps.
- **Framework-agnostic core** — all logic lives in `base/domain/{ingestion,chat,eval,lint,repair,tools}`; Marimo is only the UI at the edges, so the engine is exercised by unit tests without a browser.
- **Malleable UI** — because the GUI is marimo notebooks, the read app's layout is plain `@app.cell` annotations: open it with `marimo edit` and re-stack, re-column or re-tab the cells to suit your workflow, taste, or monitor — no frontend code to touch. Both arrangements ship, from the same engine: a tabbed one and a three-column grid.
- **Security-conscious** — a path-traversal guard on the LLM-callable page reader, an explicit prompt-injection threat model, and a documented [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
- **Local-first & private** — runs entirely on-device; each wiki is its own local-only git repo (version history for free); source files are never modified and nothing is pushed anywhere.
- **Scale-aware** — re-ingest skips unchanged files by content hash, lint compares only page pairs that share a source (not N²), and the overview synthesis is incremental.
- **Reproducible & clean** — pinned `uv.lock` for deterministic installs, zero `ruff` warnings, and no `TODO`/`FIXME` debt in the codebase.

**Transparency & docs**

- **Citation graph in SQLite** — every page→source and page→page edge is recorded and rebuilt deterministically, so provenance is queryable.
- **Opt-in tracing** (`WIKI_TRACE=1`) — emits a JSONL trace of the full LLM + data-flow per ingest, viewable in a dedicated trace-report app.
- **Documented end to end** — a programmer manual with its apps / workflows / internals reference, a SQLite data dictionary, a three-part UAT plan, and an honest Karpathy-alignment matrix grading what's done, partial, and deferred.

## How is this different from RAG / NotebookLM?

Classic RAG (and tools like NotebookLM or ChatGPT file uploads) re-discovers  
knowledge from scratch on every question: it retrieves chunks at query time and  
synthesises an answer that vanishes into chat history. Nothing accumulates.

LLM Wiki **compiles knowledge once and keeps it current**. Each ingested source  
is read, summarised, and integrated into a persistent, interlinked set of  
markdown pages — cross-references, contradictions, and synthesis are already  
written down before you ask anything. The wiki is a compounding artifact that  
gets richer with every document; the chat agent reads those curated pages first  
and only falls back to raw chunks when needed.

> Filing cabinet (SQLite + FTS5) vs. encyclopedia (human-readable markdown) —  
> this project maintains both, and the encyclopedia is the point.

---

## What it does

1. **Ingest** — drop PDFs or DOCXs into the ingest app (this only saves them to `sources/`), then click **Ingest** to run the pipeline. It extracts text page by page, chunks it with overlap, runs structured concept extraction, and creates / updates summary + concept pages plus the catalogue, overview, and timeline — then snapshots the result to the wiki's own git repo (optional; see [What ends up on disk](#what-ends-up-on-disk)).
2. **Read** — browse the generated wiki pages in a clean 3-column interface. Navigation, content viewer, and AI chat all in one.
3. **Chat** — ask questions about your documents. A PydanticAI agent reads curated wiki pages first, queries live datasets when you ask for current figures, and falls back to raw-source FTS5 only when needed — citing every fact. An optional grounding guardrail enforces cite-or-refuse (UI toggle: strict/buffered vs. normal/streamed).
4. **Maintain** — run lint to surface orphans, stale pages, missing cross-references, and missing concepts; run repair to auto-fix the safe ones.

```

Source files are never modified. Delete `.llmwiki/` anytime — re-ingest rebuilds it.

Your **`WIKI_PATH` workspace is its own git repo** (a separate repo from this
project's). Each ingest commits the generated `wiki/` as a labelled snapshot
(`ingest: paper.pdf`), giving you version history of the knowledge base for free.
It only ever stages `wiki/` and the `.gitignore` it creates — never your `sources/` or the database — and uses a
local `LLM Wiki <llmwiki@local>` identity, so your global git config is untouched.
Set `WIKI_AUTOCOMMIT=0` in `.env` to turn this off and manage the wiki's git
yourself (then LLM Wiki runs no `git init` and no commits).

**The wiki repo is local-only — nothing is pushed anywhere.** It has no remote
and stays entirely on your machine; LLM Wiki only ever commits locally, it never
pushes. That's deliberate: your sources and the knowledge derived from them are
private by default. If you *want* to back the wiki up or sync it across machines,
add your own remote — and use a **private** repo, since it holds your personal
knowledge:

```bash
cd "$WIKI_PATH"                                       # your wiki folder
git remote add origin git@github.com:you/my-wiki.git # a PRIVATE repo you own
git push -u origin HEAD
```

From then on, pushing is on you (`git push` whenever you like, or wire up your
own automation) — the app's job ends at the local commit.

> Each wiki is a **separate** repo from this project and from your other wikis.
> So a wiki you back up to GitHub is its own private repo — not a folder inside
> `llmwiki-marimo`, and nothing about your documents ever lands in the public
> project repo.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+** and **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)**
- An **OpenAI-compatible LLM API** (OpenRouter, Ollama, LM Studio, etc.)
- **A Java runtime** — needed for **all** ingestion, PDF and DOCX alike: the text
  extractor (`opendataloader-pdf`) runs a bundled `.jar` through the `java`
  command, and a DOCX is converted to PDF before that same extractor reads it.
  Reading and chatting with a wiki that is already built need no Java runtime,
  which is why the bundled demos open without one:
    - macOS: `brew install --cask temurin`
    - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install default-jre` (Fedora: `sudo dnf install java-21-openjdk`)
    - Windows: `winget install EclipseAdoptium.Temurin.21.JRE`
- **LibreOffice** — only needed for DOCX ingestion:
    - macOS: `brew install --cask libreoffice`
    - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libreoffice` (Fedora: `sudo dnf install libreoffice`)
    - Windows: `winget install TheDocumentFoundation.LibreOffice`
- **git** — needed to clone the repo (the Quick start's first step; most systems already have it). It also powers the wiki's version-history auto-commit, which *is* optional: if git is missing at runtime, snapshots are skipped (with a warning) and ingestion still works — or set `WIKI_AUTOCOMMIT=0` to opt out.

---

## Quick start

The fastest way to see it running — all you need is **Python 3.12+ and git**
(no `uv`, no manual `.env`; the demo wiki ships pre-ingested, so no Java
runtime is needed to read it):

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Clod/llmwiki-marimo.git
cd llmwiki-marimo
python3 quickstart.py
```

`quickstart.py` is a dependency-free console installer. It checks your Python
version, drops in a **pre-ingested demo wiki** (browsable instantly — no LLM
needed just to read), runs a short provider wizard (**local Ollama by default**,
or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint such as LM Studio or OpenRouter), builds an
isolated virtualenv from a lock-pinned
`requirements.txt`, runs an advisory **grounding check** on your model
(`--no-eval` skips it), and launches the read app. It won't overwrite an existing
`.env` or demo without asking, and flags make it scriptable:

```bash
python3 quickstart.py --demo fairy-tales --provider ollama --yes --no-launch
```

> The demo lives in [`examples/`](examples/); browsing its generated pages needs
> no model configured — only the chat assistant calls the LLM.

Prefer to wire it up yourself? The manual `uv` setup is below.

### Manual setup (uv)

#### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Clod/llmwiki-marimo.git
cd llmwiki-marimo
uv sync
```

#### 2. Configure

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:

```env
WIKI_PATH=/path/to/your/wiki          # the wiki opened on launch (the default)

# Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works. Example: Ollama (local, free).
LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
LLM_API_KEY=ollama                    # any non-empty string for Ollama
LLM_MODEL=llama3.2
```

`WIKI_PATH` is just the **default** — both apps have a wiki picker (top-left) so  
you can switch between multiple wikis at runtime without editing `.env`. It lists  
wikis discovered next to `WIKI_PATH` plus a recent list, and you can open any  
other folder by path. Set `WIKI_HOME=/path/to/wikis` to point discovery at a  
specific folder instead of the parent of `WIKI_PATH`.

See [LLM providers](#llm-providers) for Ollama and LM Studio config.

#### 3. Ingest documents

```bash
uv run marimo run marimo/ingest_app.py --no-sandbox --port 2718
```

Open [http://localhost:2718](http://localhost:2718), drop in your PDFs or DOCXs, click **Ingest**.

#### 4. Read and chat

```bash
uv run marimo run marimo/read_app_tabs.py --no-sandbox --port 2720
```

Open [http://localhost:2720](http://localhost:2720). Select a page on the left, read it in the middle, chat on the right.

> Using distinct ports (2718 for ingest, 2720 for read) lets you run both apps  
> at once without a collision — marimo defaults both to 2718 otherwise.

---

## LLM providers

The stack uses the OpenAI-compatible API everywhere. Switch providers by changing `.env` only — no code changes needed.

**Ollama (local, free):**

```env
LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
LLM_API_KEY=ollama
LLM_MODEL=llama3.2
```

**LM Studio (local, free):**

```env
LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:1234/v1
LLM_API_KEY=lm-studio
LLM_MODEL=local-model-name
```

**OpenRouter (cloud, hosted models):**

```env
LLM_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
LLM_API_KEY=sk-or-...
LLM_MODEL=anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5
```

**Split config** — use a cheap/local model for chat but a stronger model for wiki generation:

```env
LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1   # chat uses this
LLM_API_KEY=ollama
LLM_MODEL=llama3.2

WIKI_LLM_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1   # ingest uses this
WIKI_LLM_API_KEY=sk-or-...
WIKI_LLM_MODEL=anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5
```

If `WIKI_LLM_*` are blank, ingestion falls back to `LLM_*`.

> **Don't use too small a model for ingestion.** Summarisation, concept
> extraction, and contradiction-checking all lean on the model's reasoning, so a
> model that's underpowered for *your* documents yields thin summaries, weak
> citations, or hallucinated pages. What counts as "too small" depends on your
> corpus and your standards — judge it on the pages it actually produces. If wiki
> quality disappoints, raise the `WIKI_LLM_*` (ingest) model before blaming the
> pipeline; the split config above lets you do that while keeping chat on a
> smaller local model.

> **Chat grounding & citations scale with the chat model, too.** The chat agent's
> default prompt is strict — *answer only from your wiki, and cite every fact* —
> but a prompt is only a request; the model has to be capable of honouring it.
> A concrete example from testing on OpenRouter, same provider, same wiki, with
> the strict default prompt:
>
> | Question | `openai/gpt-4o-mini` | `openai/gpt-4o` |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | "What's the capital of France?" (off-corpus) | sometimes answers "Paris" | declines — outside the wiki |
> | "Who is Cinderella?" (single fact) | answers, but cites the raw PDF or nothing | cites the curated wiki page |
> | "What do Cinderella and Snow White have in common?" (synthesis) | drops citations | cites every point to its source pages |
>
> Cross-document **synthesis** is the most demanding case — a weaker model gives up
> citations there first. Getting it cited reliably took *both* a capable model and
> a worked example of a fully-cited comparison, which is why that example is now
> baked into the default prompt. If chat answers arrive uncited or stray outside
> your documents, raise the chat model (`LLM_MODEL`) before assuming the agent is
> broken. You can keep a cheap model for ingestion and a stronger one for chat (or
> vice versa) via the split config above.
>
> **Not sure if a model clears the bar?** Run `uv run python scripts/eval_chat_model.py`
> — it asks the built-in sample wiki a few fixed questions and gives a PASS/FAIL on
> exactly these behaviours (off-corpus refusal, citations, cited synthesis). It
> verifies the model **actually called a retrieval tool**, not just that the answer
> *looks* cited — so a model that fabricates a citation from memory (zero tool
> calls) fails. See [`docs/uat_test_plan.md`](docs/uat_test_plan.md) Part C.
>
> **A data point from local testing** (LM Studio on an M2 Pro, Q4_K_M quants, chat
> agent pinned at `temperature=0`). The strict retrieve-then-cite protocol is
> demanding, and local models under ~12B each broke it in a different way:
>
> | Model (local) | `eval_chat_model.py` | How it failed |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | `Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct` | 2/3 | skipped retrieval when it "knew" the answer; retrieved but then didn't cite |
> | `Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct` | 2/3 | followed the protocol, but *gave up* on the synthesis question — wrongly claimed the content wasn't in the wiki when it was |
> | `gemma-4-12b-it-qat` (QAT) | ✗ inconsistent | fabricated citations with **zero tool calls**; leaked a reasoning channel into the answer |
> | `gemma-4-12b` (non-QAT) | **3/3** | — |
>
> Takeaway: **choose a model that passes 3/3**, and for local models expect that to
> mean roughly **12B or larger**. Smaller models each break the grounding contract
> in their own way — the eval is how you catch it *before* you trust the wiki's
> answers. (Temperature is pinned to 0 in the chat agent, so grounding is
> deterministic and a PASS is reproducible, not luck.)

## Customising the chat assistant

Create `wiki_config.toml` in your `WIKI_PATH`:

```toml
[assistant]
system_prompt = """
You are a personal investment wiki assistant.
Answer from the curated wiki first: read wiki/index.md, then search_wiki_fts;
only fall back to search_source_chunks when the wiki pages lack the detail.
Cite document name and page for specific facts.
"""

suggested_prompts = [
    "Summarize my investment portfolio",
    "What are the main risks?",
    "Which instruments offer the highest returns?",
]
```

Copy `wiki_config.example.toml` from the project root as a starting point (or `wiki_config_es.example.toml` for a Spanish wiki — same structure with `language = "es"` and Spanish prompts). If the file is absent, generic defaults are used.

### Who goes looking: the pre-retrieval switch

By default the model holds the search tools and decides what to call. A
`[pre_retrieval] enabled = true` section flips that: code retrieves *before* the
model is consulted and decides, in Python, whether this wiki covers the question
at all — refusing without spending a token when it does not.

It is a trade, not an upgrade. You gain a guarantee that retrieval happened and
a refusal you can predict; you lose reach, because coverage is derived from your
concept-page names, so a question naming no concept is turned away even when a
search would have found something. Leave it off for a wiki of prose; turn it on
when a wrong answer costs money, a dose or a legal date. The shipped demos
disagree on purpose — `examples/fairy-tales` off, `examples/finanzas-argentinas`
on — and [`docs/query_walkthrough.md`](docs/query_walkthrough.md) walks both with
captured output from each. The template documents the section and the three
scope lists that go with it.

### Wiki content language

Add a `[wiki]` section to generate the whole wiki — pages, structural headers and
labels, and chat answers — in a given language, **regardless of the source
documents' language**:

```toml
[wiki]
language = "es"   # "en" (default) | "es"; extensible — add a Locale in base/domain/i18n.py
```

Language is a *per-wiki* property, so you can keep an English wiki and a Spanish
wiki side by side. Set it **before the first ingest**; an absent or unknown value
falls back to English. See [`docs/manual/programmer_manual.md`](docs/manual/programmer_manual.md) §8.

## Document formats

| Format | Parser             | Notes                          |
| ------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| PDF    | opendataloader-pdf | Text-heavy PDFs work well; requires a Java runtime |
| DOCX   | LibreOffice → PDF  | Requires LibreOffice **and** a Java runtime |

**Text-based PDFs only.** Scanned / image-only PDFs are not OCR'd yet — they  
ingest as empty or garbled text. OCR for scanned PDFs is on the roadmap  
(see [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md)).

## Testing

Three layers, fastest first.

**1. Fast regression gate** — deterministic, no LLM keys or running apps, finishes
in about a minute. Run it after any change:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit tests/regression -q
```

It asserts the structural invariants (DB integrity, FTS alignment, deletion
cascade, save mechanics, lint logic, git snapshots) over fake-LLM unit tests plus
a **frozen real-ingest "golden corpus"** — so the backbone is checked against a
real ingest without re-calling the model.

**2. End-to-end (Playwright)** — drives the actual marimo apps:

```bash
uv run playwright install chromium                            # once
HEADLESS=1 uv run pytest tests/e2e/test_ingest_app_v2.py -v -s  # ingest pipeline
HEADLESS=1 uv run pytest tests/e2e/test_read_app_tabs.py -v -s  # read app (uses the step-1 workspace)
```

**3. Acceptance & model check (manual)** — the human-judgment pass for the things
assertions can't grade. The full plan is **[`docs/uat_test_plan.md`](docs/uat_test_plan.md)**,
a user-acceptance test in three parts:

- **Part A** — the automated gate above.
- **Part B** — a manual checklist: does the chat stay grounded and cite sources?
  do generated pages read like real entries? do lint findings make sense?
- **Part C** — *is the model you picked good enough?* A one-command check of the
  chat model (no documents needed — it uses the built-in sample wiki):

  ```bash
  uv run python scripts/eval_chat_model.py    # PASS/FAIL for the chat model (LLM_MODEL)
  ```

Test PDFs live in `tests/fixtures/pdfs/`; the E2E workspace is gitignored and
rebuilt on each ingest run. Use the skills `/test-ingest`, `/test-read`, and
`/test-all` in Claude Code for self-testing.

### Automating the un-testable: the eval packet

Some behaviour simply can't be regression-tested — there's no deterministic "right
answer" for *is this chat reply well-grounded?* or *is this generated page faithful
to its source?* The output varies with the model and even run to run. The workaround
is to **move the judgement to an LLM, but keep it cheap and bias-resistant**: generate
a single self-contained markdown **eval packet** and paste it into one — or several —
capable chat models (a free Gemini / ChatGPT / Claude tab) to score against a fixed
1–5 rubric.

```bash
uv run python scripts/build_eval_packet.py                 # benchmark sample wiki
uv run python scripts/build_eval_packet.py --wiki PATH      # an existing wiki
uv run python scripts/build_eval_packet.py --skip-ingestion # chat only (cheap)
```

The packet bundles everything a judge needs — the questions, the model's own answers,
the cited pages, and (per source) the original text next to the pages the engine
generated — plus the rubric and a blank scorecard. It covers **chat quality** and
**ingestion quality**, records the two models it measured and a corpus hash so packets
are comparable, and is written to a gitignored `eval_reports/`. Generation is
automated; judging stays human-in-the-loop (paste to as many judges as you like and
average), so it doubles as a way to compare the models your wiki engine uses. Details
in [`docs/manual/programmer_manual.md`](docs/manual/programmer_manual.md) §9.

## Performance at scale

For a personal-sized wiki (tens to low-hundreds of documents) the pipeline stays
comfortable — nothing here grows quadratically with the document count:

- **Ingestion is incremental.** Unchanged files are skipped by content hash, so
  re-scanning a large `sources/` folder only re-processes what actually changed.
- **Lint doesn't compare every page against every other.** The cross-reference
  and contradiction checks only look at concept-page *pairs that cite a common
  source*, so their cost scales with how topically interconnected your wiki is —
  not with the raw document count. Unrelated pages are never compared.
- **The overview synthesis is incremental.** Each ingest folds the new document
  into the existing overview instead of re-reading the whole corpus.

The one cost that *can* grow is the **contradiction** lint check: it makes one
LLM call per shared-source page pair, so a single source cited by many concept
pages can make that (opt-in) check slow. It reports progress and never blocks
ingestion — everything else stays roughly linear.

## Limitations & non-goals

This is a working proof of concept of the LLM-Wiki pattern, not a finished  
product. The core loop — ingest → build/maintain wiki → read → chat with  
citations → lint → repair — is fully implemented. Some ideas from the original  
concept are **deliberately deferred** for the PoC:

- **No web search.** The chat agent answers only from *your* curated local  
corpus — it never reaches out to the web, and there's no automatic web→wiki  
loop. To bring in an outside source, fetch it yourself (e.g. save the article  
as a PDF) and then **ingest it manually** — dropping a file into `sources/`  
does nothing on its own. Open the ingest app and either (a) drag the file into  
the upload box and click **⚙️ Ingest uploaded file(s)**, or (b) put it in  
`WIKI_PATH/sources/` and click **🔄 Scan sources/ for changes**, which detects  
and ingests anything new or modified. Treat a document from an untrusted origin  
the way you'd treat untrusted code: at ingestion its text is turned into wiki  
pages automatically — see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
- **No image / vision handling.** Text-only ingestion — images embedded in a  
document are skipped, not described or summarised.
- **Text-based PDFs only.** No OCR yet, so a scanned / image-only PDF ingests as  
empty or garbled text. Use a text-based PDF or convert it first.
- **Output is markdown only — no visualisations or alternate formats.** The wiki  
records a full citation/link graph in the database (`document_references`:  
which page cites which source, which pages link to which), but there's no  
interactive **graph view** to *see* that shape, and no generators for slide  
decks (**Marp**) or spatial **canvas** layouts. You read the wiki as linked  
markdown pages — cross-links are clickable, the graph just isn't drawn.
- **Ingestion is automated, not a guided conversation.** Karpathy's flow has the  
LLM discuss a source with you and write pages under your direction; here you  
drop a file and the pipeline extracts → summarises → files it in one shot, with  
no mid-ingest review. You steer the wiki *afterwards*: open the resulting page  
in the read app, chat about the document, then save a corrected or synthesised  
answer back as a wiki page via the read app's **Save to wiki** form
(`save_to_wiki`). The agent only drafts and proposes — the save is your explicit  
click — so the human-in-the-loop step is post-hoc rather than during ingestion.

The rationale for each cut and the revisit plan live in  
[`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md).

Those are the deliberate omissions. For what is planned next, and for the
things that are built but known to be imperfect — measured rather than
suspected — see [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md).
