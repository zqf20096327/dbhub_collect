# Plasmod

## What is Plasmod?

[Plasmod](https://github.com/CodeSoul-co/Plasmod) is an open-source **agent-native database** designed for AI applications and multi-agent systems. It provides the memory and retrieval infrastructure that AI agents need to maintain context, track state evolution, and retrieve structured evidence across long-running workflows.

Unlike traditional vector databases that focus primarily on embedding storage and similarity search, Plasmod treats **memory**, **state**, **event**, **artifact**, and **relation** as first-class database objects. This means your AI agents can store not just vectors, but complete cognitive context — including what happened (events), what the agent knows (memory), what the agent decided (state), what the agent produced (artifacts), and how these objects relate to each other (edges).

Plasmod is built for scenarios where agents need more than top-k similarity matches. It supports **event-driven state evolution**, **provenance-aware retrieval**, and **structured evidence assembly** — returning query results that include proof traces, source attribution, and graph context. This makes Plasmod ideal for RAG systems, autonomous agents, long-term memory applications, and multi-agent collaboration workflows.

> **Core thesis:** agent memory, state, event, artifact, and relation should be modeled as first-class database objects, and (batch) query results should return structured evidence rather than only top-k text fragments.

Written in Go with a Python SDK (`pyplasmod`), Plasmod can be deployed via Docker for local development or scaled for production workloads. It integrates with LangChain and other AI frameworks, making it easy to add agent-native memory to your existing AI applications.

## Quickstart

### 1. Install the Python SDK

```bash
pip install -U pyplasmod
```

This installs `pyplasmod`, the Python SDK for Plasmod. Import `EasyPlasmod` to create a client:

```python
from pyplasmod import EasyPlasmod
```

### 2. Start Plasmod with Docker

Pull and run the Plasmod server using Docker:

```bash
docker pull oneflybird/plasmod
docker run -d --name plasmod -p 19530:19530 oneflybird/plasmod
```

The server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:19530`.

### 3. Connect to Plasmod

```python
from pyplasmod import EasyPlasmod

# Connect to local Plasmod server
with EasyPlasmod(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:19530") as client:
    # Check server health
    print(client.health())  # {"status": "ok"}
```

### 4. Ingest Data

Plasmod uses an event-driven ingestion model. You can ingest events that will be materialized into memory objects:

```python
from pyplasmod import EasyPlasmod

with EasyPlasmod(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:19530") as client:
    # Ingest an observation event
    client.ingest_event({
        "event_type": "observation",
        "workspace_id": "my-agent",
        "payload": {
            "text": "The user prefers dark mode and uses Python for development.",
            "source": "user_preferences"
        }
    })
```

Or use the HTTP API directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:19530/v1/ingest/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event_type": "observation",
    "workspace_id": "my-agent",
    "payload": {
      "text": "The user prefers dark mode and uses Python for development.",
      "source": "user_preferences"
    }
  }'
```

### 5. Query Data

Retrieve relevant memories with structured evidence:

```python
from pyplasmod import EasyPlasmod

with EasyPlasmod(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:19530") as client:
    # Search for relevant memories
    results = client.search(
        query_text="What are the user's preferences?",
        workspace_id="my-agent",
        top_k=5
    )
    print(results)
```

Or use the HTTP API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:19530/v1/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query_text": "What are the user preferences?",
    "workspace_id": "my-agent",
    "top_k": 5
  }'
```

Query responses include not just matching content, but also provenance information, proof traces, and related graph edges.

## Public Data Assets

The [Plasmod Agent Event Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CodeSoulco/plasmod-agent-event-data-release) dataset provides sanitized JSONL assets derived from re-collected agent trajectories and normalized by a common event-generation pipeline. It contains two complementary collections: agent-framework trajectories for code repair, text-to-SQL, tool use, open-ended assistance, and environment interaction; and research, API-tool, and multi-agent collaboration trajectories. Each record carries event identity, actor/session context, timestamps, state transitions, object lineage, causality, visibility, materialization, retrieval metadata, and runtime timing.

The source catalog covers MetaGPT x SWE-bench, LangGraph x BIRD-SQL and tau-bench, LlamaIndex x GAIA, PydanticAI x MINT, AutoGen x AgentBench, GPT Researcher x MS MARCO/GAIA, OpenManus x ToolBench, and AutoGen x MS MARCO/GAIA. The dataset card lists the official reference links, collection counts, field schema, and source-specific provenance notes.

The dataset is maintained separately from this core repository so that data assets can be versioned and consumed independently. It is a normalized trajectory release, not a redistribution of the upstream benchmark packages; upstream licenses and access terms continue to apply.

## Why Plasmod?

Plasmod is designed to solve the memory problem for AI agents. Here's why developers choose Plasmod over traditional approaches:

<details>
  <summary><b>Agent-Native Data Model</b></summary>

Most vector databases treat everything as embeddings with metadata. Plasmod provides a purpose-built data model for agent memory:
- **Events** — Immutable records of what happened (observations, actions, decisions)
- **Memory** — Materialized knowledge derived from events
- **State** — Current agent state with version history
- **Artifacts** — Produced outputs (code, documents, plans)
- **Edges** — Typed relationships between objects
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Event-Driven State Evolution</b></summary>

Instead of direct overwrites, all state changes in Plasmod flow through an append-only WAL (Write-Ahead Log). This enables:
- Full audit trail and replay capability
- Point-in-time queries ("What did the agent know at time T?")
- Conflict detection and resolution for multi-agent scenarios
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Structured Evidence Retrieval</b></summary>

Traditional vector search returns top-k similar chunks. Plasmod returns **evidence packages** that include:
- Matching memory objects with relevance scores
- Provenance information (where did this knowledge come from?)
- Proof traces (how was this conclusion reached?)
- 1-hop graph expansion (what's related to these results?)
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Workspace and Session Isolation</b></summary>

Built-in multi-tenancy with `workspace_id` and `session_id` scoping. Each agent or user session can have isolated memory without complex application-level partitioning.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Tiered Storage Architecture</b></summary>

Plasmod implements a hot/warm/cold data plane:
- **Hot tier** — In-memory LRU for frequently accessed data
- **Warm tier** — Segment-based index for recent data
- **Cold tier** — S3-compatible storage for archival
</details>

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Event** | Immutable record of something that happened (observation, action, decision). Events are the source of truth. |
| **Memory** | Materialized knowledge derived from events. Memories have lifecycle states (active → compressed → archived → deleted). |
| **State** | Current state of an agent or entity, with full version history. |
| **Artifact** | Produced output such as code, documents, or plans. |
| **Edge** | Typed relationship between any two objects (e.g., "derived_from", "references", "contradicts"). |
| **Workspace** | Isolation boundary for a tenant, project, or agent. |
| **Session** | Isolation boundary within a workspace for a conversation or task. |
| **Provenance** | Metadata tracking the origin and transformation history of data. |

## Key Features
