## Why

### Mesh-Client: The Universal Desktop Suite for Mesh Networks

Reliable Desktop Power. Local Persistence. Total Insight.

While official mobile apps cover the basics, desktop power users often face a fragmented ecosystem: limited desktop options for MeshCore and Reticulum (LXMF), inconsistent support across operating systems, and persistent sync issues on macOS. Mesh-Client fills those gaps with a high-performance desktop experience that unifies **Meshtastic**, **MeshCore**, and **Reticulum** in one app.

With a dedicated local SQLite database, Mesh-Client keeps message history and mesh logs durable across restarts and sync failures. It provides one reliable hub for Meshtastic, MeshCore, and Reticulum (via an AGPL Rust sidecar), delivering a unified workflow regardless of protocol or hardware.

**Why Mesh-Client?**

- **True message persistence:** Local SQLite storage for reliable long-term history, without lost chats or broken logs.
- **Universal protocol support:** One consistent interface for Meshtastic, MeshCore, and Reticulum (rail protocol switcher, MT / MC / RN; Reticulum yellow; LXMF DMs, RRC hub chat, Nomad, Remote, Games, and LXST voice via sidecar).
- **Advanced mesh visibility:** Routing diagnostics and mesh health insight that mobile apps often skip.
- **Desktop-first workflow:** MQTT integration (Meshtastic/MeshCore); for Reticulum, LXMF DMs / encrypted paper / propagation, RRC, LRGP Games, LXST voice, and rnsh/rncp Remote — aimed at Ratspeak-compatible peers.
- **Cross-platform stability:** A feature-rich experience across macOS, Linux, and Windows.

From real-time diagnostics to permanent message archives, Mesh-Client delivers the desktop visibility serious mesh users require.

**Protocol scope:** Mesh-Client focuses on **RF mesh** networking—LoRa and related radio meshes. Additional protocols are in scope when they support that kind of RF mesh path. Internet-only messaging stacks are out of scope. Amateur-radio (ham) protocols are welcome when they meet the same RF-mesh bar; Mesh-Client is for everyone, everywhere, and is not gated or targeted specifically at people with a ham radio license. Protocols that already ship may still use internet transports _alongside_ RF.

**Known Bugs:**

- **Linux BLE**: uses the same reticulum-sidecar **btleplug** GATT path as macOS/Windows (no Web Bluetooth). Ensure BlueZ is running (`systemctl status bluetooth`); see [docs/development-environment.md](docs/development-environment.md#linux-bluetooth-ble).

## Key Features

<!-- docs-site:features:start -->

Mesh-Client supports **three mesh stacks** in one desktop app. Use the **protocol switcher** at the top of the rail (MT / MC / RN; Meshtastic green, MeshCore cyan, Reticulum yellow) to focus a tab; the other sessions stay connected in the background.

### Meshtastic Features

**Radio & Channel Configuration**

- Edit channels: name, PSK, and role; 36 current region presets plus UNSET and deprecated UA_868, and 15 current modem presets plus deprecated LONG_SLOW and VERY_LONG_SLOW. On firmware 2.8+, the modem preset list follows the radio's per-region preset map (allowed presets, region default, licensed-only bands)
- **Firmware 2.7 / 2.8 parity**: long names are limited to **24 UTF-8 bytes** (emoji count as several bytes); LoRa **Apply** stays disabled until the LoRa config loads from the device; when firmware 2.8 renumbers a node from its public key, chat history and saved remote-admin keys follow it to the new node number (only when the new number matches the key)
- **Channel URL import/export** (Radio tab): generate, copy, preview, and apply `https://meshtastic.org/e/#…` or `meshtastic://` links (same ChannelSet protobuf format as the Android/web clients); replace all channels or add-only mode
- Device roles: Client, Router, Tracker, Sensor, TAK, and more
- **Display**, **Bluetooth**, and **Power** settings on the Radio tab (screen/LED, pairing, sleep, and power limits)
- Per-channel MQTT gateway uplink (RF → MQTT)
- **Administration** tab: reboot, shutdown, factory reset, NodeDB reset (optional preserve favorites), reboot-to-OTA, and enter DFU (local radio only; OTA/DFU disabled when **Configure node** targets a remote node)

**MQTT**

- Subscribe to a broker to receive mesh traffic over the internet; **AES-128/256-CTR** decryption (16- or 32-byte channel PSKs), automatic RF deduplication, **cross-transport chat dedup** (when the same message arrives on MQTT and RF within ~10 minutes, one bubble is kept and the transport badge upgrades to **both**), **exponential MQTT reconnect backoff** (60s base, capped at 45 minutes; faster retry on connack timeout), and an **active node cache** that periodically refreshes presence information so MQTT-only and RF+MQTT nodes stay visible even when your radio is offline
- **Channel PSKs** on the Connection tab: base64 keys per line (`ChannelName=base64` or `ChannelName@index=base64` when your local slot differs from the MQTT topic name); multiple keys per channel name are supported; LongFast default is always tried; keys from the Radio tab sync automatically when the radio is connected (custom named keys are not overwritten by the default public PSK on sync). Inbound MQTT text is attributed using the **topic channel name** (receiver-local slot), not the sender's `MeshPacket.channel`
- **MQTT-only chat identity**: when sending without a connected radio, outbound `from` uses your last known RF node id when available, otherwise a stable per-install virtual id (persisted in app settings)
- **Enable TLS (mqtts / wss)** toggle for private brokers (not only port 8883/443); optional **Allow insecure TLS** for self-signed or non–public CA chains
- **Per-channel MQTT uplink** (RF → MQTT) uses each channel’s real name and PSK when publishing
- Transport indicator (RF / MQTT / both) on received messages; MQTT messages are shown in chat but not rebroadcast over RF
- Enter your broker URL, topic, and optional credentials in the MQTT section of the Connection tab; settings persist across sessions
- **Saved MQTT profiles**: save the current broker settings as a named profile (for example "Chicago"), then switch, rename, or delete profiles from the MQTT card; switching to a profile with a different broker waits until you disconnect and reconnect MQTT

**Module Configuration**

- Telemetry module (device, environment, air quality intervals), MQTT relay, Serial, External Notification, Store & Forward, Range Test, Canned Messages, Neighbor Info, Ambient Lighting, Detection Sensor, Pax Counter, Remote Hardware, Traffic Management, TAK (when firmware exposes the module key), and **RTTTL** (ringtone); editable from the **Modules** tab in firmware-dependent order (not strictly alphabetical)
- **ConfigApplyNotice** at the top of Radio, Modules, and Security reminds you that changes persist to the device and may require reboot; **Apply** stays disabled until each config slice hydrates from the device so defaults cannot overwrite live settings
- **Remote Hardware (GPIO)**: configure pins and apply module settings; live GPIO status stream when the module is enabled
- **Module status displays**: Range Test, Serial, Store & Forward, Remote Hardware (GPIO), and IP Tunnel (status-only) show packet counts and last-received timestamps when the corresponding module is enabled on the device
- **Store & Forward chat history**: after RF configure, the client may request `CLIENT_HISTORY` on the first primary router heartbeat (capped messages/window, 15 min cooldown, 5 min offline gate; opt-out in App settings). Use **Catch up from Store & Forward** in Chat for manual fetch. Replayed text shows a **Store & Forward** badge; MQTT reconnect floods within ~30 s are treated as history and deduped

**Security**

- **Meshtastic — Security (PKI)** tab (between Telemetry and **TAK**): admin / PKI key management; backup, restore, regenerate, and apply keys and related toggles from the device.
- **MeshCore — Security** tab (partial): per-node **key backup / restore** (full public + private pair), sign data, export/import private key. Meshtastic PKI admin sections are hidden (`hasSecurityPanel` is true for both protocols; capabilities differ).
- **DM / device key backup / restore:** **Backup Keys** encrypts the connected **local** radio’s **public and private keys** into a **per-node** slot (`localStorage`, OS keychain via `safeStorage`). Meshtastic indexes by `nodeNum`; MeshCore by `nodeId`. Backing up a second radio does **not** overwrite the first. **Restore Keys** applies the archive for the connected node; **Restore from backup…** picks any archived entry (factory reset / node id change). Hidden for remote configure targets. See [Key backup and cryptography](docs/key-backup-and-crypto.md) (includes **backing up before moving Meshtastic nodes to MeshCore**).
- **PKC remote node administration** (Meshtastic, firmware 2.5+): **Configure node** selector on Radio, Modules, Security, and Administration tabs to edit another node’s settings through your connected local radio; **Configure node remotely** from node detail when a per-node admin key is saved; **Copy** public key in Security for one-time trust setup. Paste a remote node’s admin public key in node detail (base64, `base64:…`, or 64-char hex). PKI uses the mesh NodeDB key when present, with stored admin-key fallback. Requires a **connected local Meshtastic radio** — MQTT-only sessions cannot administer remote nodes.

**Network Diagnostics**

- **Protocol-scoped rows**: The shared Diagnostics tab filters findings to the **active protocol** — Meshtastic/MeshCore show LoRa routing + RF rows only (including MeshCore **High Companion TX Queue**); Reticulum shows `reticulum/*` interface/path/LXMF rows only (sidecar health, propagation sync stuck/failing, interface-down alerts no longer bleed onto LoRa tabs). Map halos, node-list badges, and node detail routing sections use the same filter.
- **Network health**: status band **Healthy / Attention / Degraded** plus error and warning counts. **Degraded** applies only when routing error count ≥ 3; fewer errors use **Attention** so small issues don't paint the whole panel red
- **Single table** from `diagnosticRows` (routing trace rows + RF rows), searchable; rows persist across sessions with an optional restore banner; **max age** (1–168 hours) trims stale routing (24 h default) and RF (1 h default) rows
- **Foreign LoRa overhear** (Meshtastic tab): MeshCore-heard, Reticulum RNS, other-Meshtastic, and unknown LoRa classes from decode-fail logs and dual-radio RX; 90-minute window; MeshCore repeater conflict escalation above 5 pkt/min
- **Mesh congestion attribution**: orange banner when mesh-wide routing stress is present; duplicate-traffic block in node detail when relevant
- Routing anomaly detection: **hop_goblin** (distance-proven over-hopping; **Meshtastic-only**), **bad_route** (high duplication; close-in distance variant Meshtastic-only), **route_flapping** / **path_instability** (MeshCore PathUpdated events), **impossible_hop**, **weak_link** (MeshCore per-hop SNR from trace); with remediation suggestions and severity levels
- **Channel Utilization History**: 24h CU timeline chart for the connected node in DiagnosticsPanel (fed by LocalStats / device-metrics ingest, not only NodeInfo)
- Anomaly badges inline in node list; status aura circles on the map; congestion halos toggle; global and per-node MQTT ignore
- **Environment Profile** segmented control; Standard (3 km), City (1.6× threshold), Canyon (2.6× threshold)
- **Trusted location only**: distance checks (Impossible hop, Hop goblin, suboptimal route) measure only from a trusted position: this session's radio GPS fix, or a saved location you confirmed this launch (or marked "doesn't move"). With an approximate IP / browser position or an unconfirmed saved location, those checks pause and the Diagnostics panel asks you to set your location

> See [Diagnostics Reference](docs/diagnostics.md) for a full reference on what triggers each finding and how to interpret it.

**Environment Telemetry**

- Push-based environment charts (temperature, humidity, pressure, air quality) from Meshtastic telemetry packets, displayed in the Telemetry tab
- **Sensor history and map layer**: environment readings from RF, MeshCore remote telemetry, and Meshtastic MQTT are saved to SQLite and shown on the Map as a **Sensors** layer (pick temperature, humidity, or pressure; node popups include sparklines). History loads are capped (newest 2,000 nodes, 500 points per node)
- **Weather forecasts layer**: channel forecast posts from senders marked as weather senders are placed on the Map (**Layers → Weather forecasts**) at the named place, or near the sender when the place can't be found. Each place shows its newest forecast, and wx broadcasts drop off the map **12 hours** after they were sent — including posts loaded from chat history at startup

**Packet Redundancy**

- Per-node redundancy score derived from the last 20 observed packets; `+N` echo count in the node list; collapsible Path History in node detail

**TAK Server (CoT Gateway)**

- **TAK** tab (Network rail section, after Remote) on Meshtastic, MeshCore, and Reticulum: broadcast node positions as Cursor on Target (CoT) XML events over TLS TCP (port 8089)
- Feeds every protocol at once, whichever tab is open: Meshtastic and MeshCore nodes heard within their protocol's online window, Reticulum RMAP-discovered interfaces with coordinates, and your own Reticulum position when a static GPS position is set. Positions are re-sent every 5 minutes so markers do not go stale in ATAK
- Enables **ATAK, WinTAK, and iTAK clients** to see mesh nodes on their tactical maps
- **Remote TAK server relay**: stream the same positions to an OpenTAKServer, FreeTAKServer, or TAK Server over mutual TLS, or over plain TCP (unencrypted, and not saved for launch auto-connect). Import the server truststore and your client certificate as `.p12` or PEM files, or enroll with a username and password on the server's enrollment port (usually 8446); the private key stays in the main process. With verification on (the default), the server certificate must chain to the imported CA, or to the system trust store when no CA is imported, and must name the server address. An opt-out accepts a certificate issued for another name, as ATAK does; it needs verification on and an imported CA. With verification off, certificate failures do not stop the connection, so anyone who can intercept it receives the relayed positions, and the relay does not connect at launch. The relay reconnects on its own after a drop. Inbound CoT from local clients and the remote server shows as contacts on the map. The status bar uses one TAK label that combines the local server and the remote relay (for example, "TAK running, remote connected")
- **Certificate management**: self-signed CA + server + client certificates via node-forge (server cert includes DNS + LAN IP in Subject Alternative Name so EUDs can verify TLS); regenerate anytime from the TAK tab
- **Data package generator**: export ATAK-compatible (ca.pem, client.p12, connection.pref) for direct import on TAK devices — connect host is your LAN IP and must match the server cert SAN; re-generate the package after certificate regeneration or a LAN IP change
- Auto-start option (off by default); status indicator in header when running
- **ATAK Plugin Messages** (Meshtastic): incoming ATAK plugin packets from mesh nodes are displayed in the TAK tab with sender node and packet counts

### Desktop shell (all protocols)

- **Tri-protocol switcher**: Meshtastic, MeshCore, and Reticulum run simultaneously; per-protocol unread badges (Meshtastic green, MeshCore cyan, Reticulum yellow — the Reticulum total is LXMF Chat + **RRC** + **Games**; Games also has its own tab badge); passive toast notifications when an inactive protocol receives traffic
- **Localization**: 16 languages via static JSON bundles; fully offline — see [Localization & Languages](docs/localization.md)
- **Accessibility**: modal focus trap, screen reader labels, reduce-motion and **Use 24-hour time** toggles in App → Appearance — see [Accessibility Checklist](docs/accessibility-checklist.md)
- **Colors** (App → Appearance): customize theme tokens including chat/RRC **message action** bar and button hover colors; optional **Show background** on the action bar and **Always show message actions**
- **Log panel**: live stream, **Analyze** heuristics, export/delete; Reticulum sidecar lines tagged `[ReticulumSidecar]`
- **SQLite persistence**: protocol-scoped history and settings; DB export/import/clear in the App tab; **Export for GitHub** (zip: debug snapshot + logs) and **Export for Developer** (includes full SQLite — share privately only)
- **Updates & tray**: update status in the status bar; system tray unread badge when the window is backgrounded
- **Launcher settings search**: Ctrl/Cmd+K finds panels and individual settings; choosing a setting opens its panel, expands the section, scrolls to the row, and focuses it
- **Enable / disable protocols** (App → Protocols): turn off protocols you don't use. A disabled protocol is hidden from the switcher, disconnected, and skipped by auto-connect, autostart, and sleep/wake recovery; with one protocol left, the switcher is hidden
- **Firmware update toast**: **Don't remind me** silences the toast for that release (per protocol); it returns when a newer release ships
- **Developer announcements**: a dismissible strip at the top of the window shows short notices from the maintainers (outages, "please update", news), fetched from a JSON file in this repo; plain text only, and nothing shows when offline. See [`docs/service-announcements.md`](docs/service-announcements.md)

### Shared RF features (Meshtastic & MeshCore)

These sections apply to the two LoRa companion-radio stacks. Reticulum uses the sidecar model documented under [Reticulum Features](#reticulum-features) below.

**Connectivity**

- **Bluetooth LE**: pair wirelessly via sidecar **btleplug** GATT on all platforms; startup auto-reconnect can run without a user gesture. **Reticulum** BLE (RNode / BLE Peer) shares the same sidecar process and may coexist on a **different** MAC — see [Reticulum BLE coexistence](docs/reticulum.md#interface-management-connection-tab).
- **USB Serial**: plug in via USB; auto-reconnects silently on startup (saved port signature matches the same physical device across re-enumeration)
- **WiFi / HTTP / TCP**: Meshtastic offers **WiFi/HTTP** (REST, one packet per request) and **WiFi/TCP (fast)** (native binary streaming on port **4403**, same framing as USB serial — much faster NodeDB sync on large networks); MeshCore uses TCP on port **5000** by default; remembered addresses **auto-connect on launch** (same coordinator as serial/BLE) and support quick reconnect after drops
- **Dual LoRa mode**: Meshtastic and MeshCore stay connected while you switch views; per-protocol unread badges; passive toasts on background traffic
- **Connection status in header**: device, MQTT, and TAK indicators pulse **red** after an unexpected disconnect; manual stop/disconnect stays gray; in-progress connect keeps yellow

**Chat**

- Send/receive messages across channels with per-transport delivery badges and delivery ACK / failure states
- **Durable outbox**: outgoing messages are queued in SQLite and retried until delivered; survive app restarts and connection drops
- **Long message chunking (Meshtastic / Reticulum)**: messages over the payload limit are auto-split into sequential `[N/T]`-prefixed chunks (word-boundary split, max 9 chunks). **MeshCore is single-packet**: each message is sent as one radio packet and longer text is blocked with an explanatory notice (busy repeaters drop split parts — see [Limitations](#limitations)). MeshCore MQTT-only connections are also guarded from sending when no RF path is available
- **Shared composer** (`ChatComposer`): drafts, mentions, protocol-aware length limits (chunking for Meshtastic / Reticulum; single-packet for MeshCore, see above), spellcheck, and emoji picker used by **Chat** and **MeshCore Rooms**; right‑click misspelling replacements (Electron spellchecker for both protocols)
- **F1–F12 macro bar**: twelve composer macros on channels, DMs, Rooms, and RRC (insert into the draft, or send when the box is empty); collapsed by default
- **Structured chat cards** (`ChatStructuredPayloads`): signal reports, RNCP control messages, and drone reports render as cards in the bubble instead of raw text
- **Emoji reactions / tapbacks**: Meshtastic — 12 quick-pick reactions plus compose emoji (native panel on macOS/Windows; `emoji-picker-element` on Linux); wire tapbacks decode payload UTF-8 glyphs (flags, ZWJ sequences, and legacy index 1–12). MeshCore — same picker UX; **default** outbound tapbacks and text replies use keyless companion wire `@[Display Name] …` (inbound keyed `@[Name#key]`, Open `r:HASH:INDEX`, and `g:GIFID` also parsed). Optional **MeshCore Open compatibility** in App settings enables keyed replies, `r:` reactions, and Giphy GIF send — see [docs/meshcore-meshtastic-parity.md](docs/meshcore-meshtastic-parity.md#meshcore-emoji-reactions-tapbacks); reply-to-message with quoted preview in bubble (including room BBS posts)
- **System tray**: docked/minimized on macOS and Windows shows an unread indicator when chat or MeshCore **Rooms** traffic arrives while the window is in the background
- **`@[Display Name]` tokens** (Meshtastic / MeshCore reply, tapback, path, and inline-reference syntax) render as compact inline labels in the bubble instead of raw brackets; see [docs/meshcore-meshtastic-parity.md](docs/meshcore-meshtastic-parity.md#chat-mention-tokens)
- Unread message divider that persists across restarts; auto-scrolls on tab switch
- Direct messages (DMs) to individual nodes; **DM info header** shows battery, last heard, and SNR for the peer
- **Draft persistence**: unsent message is saved per channel/DM and restored when you return
- **Copy message**: hover action copies message text to the clipboard
- **Sender filter**: click any message sender to filter the view to that sender; Escape clears
- **Jump to date**: scroll the chat to a specific calendar date
- **Link previews**: `http`/`https` URLs fetch metadata via main-process IPC — Open Graph for pages, **YouTube oEmbed** for watch/shorts/youtu.be links, and **inline image embeds** for direct raster URLs (`.jpg`, `.png`, etc.). Localhost and private IPs are blocked.
- **Sound notifications**: audio ping for new messages in non-active channels/DMs; global mute in the toolbar; **per-conversation mute** (bell on channel/DM tabs) stored per protocol. **App → Notifications → Notification tones** configures presets or short imported audio for channel, DM, reply/mention, each MECP severity, and ops alerts (link lost / battery low); MAYDAY/URGENT bypass mute (with a volume floor). See [notification-sounds.md](docs/notification-sounds.md)
- **Message starring**: star messages from the hover row; **Starred** view lists bookmarks across conversations (newest first, cap 200). Opening Starred does not mark the previous channel read, and the composer is hidden there
- **Weather view**: a toolbar toggle shows only weather posts (bot forecasts, °F/°C readings, JSON telemetry) in the selected channel; optionally **hide weather posts in channels** (hidden posts don't badge or beep), add an extra regex pattern, or **Mark as weather sender** from a sender's header. DMs are never filtered
- **Timestamp tooltip**: hover the short time label for full date and time
- **@mention autocomplete**: type `@` to open a node-name picker; Tab or Enter to insert; arrow keys to navigate
- **Export chat**: save the current channel or DM history as a `.txt` file via Save dialog

**Node Management**

- Node list with SNR, battery, GPS, **last heard** (any live RF packet—position, telemetry, traceroute, text—not only chat); **signal bars** appear only for direct (0-hop) RF neighbors; multi-hop and MQTT-only paths omit bars; SNR in traces and neighbor views uses **color-coded quality** (good / marginal / poor)
- **Cross-Protocol Signal Analyzer**: foreign LoRa traffic detection (MeshCore, Reticulum RNS, other Meshtastic, unknown) on the **Meshtastic** and **MeshCore** Diagnostics tabs and in node detail when RF rows are present; not shown on the Reticulum Diagnostics tab
- Distance filter, favorite/pin nodes, device role icons
- Node Detail Modal: DM, trace route with per-hop display, delete node, neighbor info, **Map Report** (Meshtastic), PaxCounter, Detection Sensor, **channel utilization** (Meshtastic), **export/share contact** (MeshCore), **node notes** (free-text, SQLite-persisted), **watch / notify** (OS desktop notification on online/offline transition)
- **Node Health Score**: composite 0–100 badge on each node row (signal 40 pts, recency 30 pts, load 20 pts, battery 10 pts); color-coded green / yellow / red with tooltip breakdown
- **Node export**: export the node list as topology JSON or CSV from NodeListPanel

**EMCOMM / Incident Command**

- **MECP** (Mesh Emergency Communication Protocol): structured emergency text (`MECP/<severity>/<codes> …`) on Meshtastic, MeshCore, and Reticulum (LXMF chat). Inbound reports alert with severity-specific tones, append to a durable audit log (`mecp-received.log`), and can optionally bridge Meshtastic↔MeshCore RF channels (**App → MECP RF rebroadcast**, default off). Chat compose is opt-in (**App → MECP → Show MECP button in Chat**, default off); when on, a red siren button sits in the composer next to Send. Chat channel and DM chips show a shield icon, colored by the highest severity, while unread MECP reports are waiting. Operator guide: [EMCOMM: MECP and Incident Command](docs/emcomm.md).
- **Incident** tab (always visible on all three protocols; pinned at the bottom of the rail next to **App** — rarely needed day-to-day, but the red badge counts open MAYDAY/URGENT so you still notice it): common operating picture for open MECP emergencies. Each row shows severity, sender, MECP codes, optional free text, ACK count, which protocols heard the report, and whether a distress **beacon** is active. Coordinates come from the report or the sender's last known position and can appear on the Map (**Layers → Emergency incidents**) for Meshtastic, MeshCore, **and Reticulum** (Reticulum Map uses the same incident overlay; MECP over LXMF chat still populates the Incident tab). **Acknowledge** sends R01 (or **Confirm** / B02 when a beacon is active). **Resolve** closes the row locally. If you sent the distress beacon, **Cancel beacon** also sends B03 ("I am OK") on that protocol and channel so other stations clear it. Broadcast ACKs are best-effort / network-heard — not read receipts. Drills are listed but never badge. Operator guide: [EMCOMM: MECP and Incident Command](docs/emcomm.md).
- **Emergency outbox**: MECP / MAYDAY sends that can't go out live are queued as emergency priority and keep retrying after reconnect (no 24h age cutoff or attempt limit; a soft cap blocks, never deletes)
- **ACK honesty**: broadcast acknowledgements are **heard by the network** / best effort — not read receipts
- **Ops alerts** (App → Notifications): watched-node silence escalation, battery low (where telemetry exists), and unexpected link-down (never on manual disconnect or during reconnect)
- **Exports**: node list as topology JSON or CSV, Diagnostics rows as JSON, and the durable MECP audit log (App → MECP)

**Map & Position**

- Interactive map with node positions and your current location (device GPS → saved location → browser geolocation → IP-based city-level fallback); default **OpenStreetMap** basemap with optional **Carto Dark** and **USGS Topo** (US only; offline-cacheable like the other basemaps)
- **Offline maps**: basemap tiles are served through the privileged **`mesh-tiles:`** protocol and cached under app **userData** `tile-cache/` (~1 GiB LRU; viewed tiles cache automatically while online). Use **Layers → Offline maps → Download current view** to pre-fetch a region (estimate + confirm; single-job size capped so downloads are not immediately evicted). Optional **Auto-cache** and **Clear tile cache**. Uncached areas are blank offline; markers and trails still render from local/SQLite state — see [Troubleshooting — Map offline](docs/troubleshooting.md#map-tab-without-internet-offline--no-wan)
- **Saved locations** (App tab, Diagnostics, or a startup strip): when the radio has no GPS, save named places this computer is used from (Home, EOC). Each launch asks "Still at …?" unless the location is marked "doesn't move". Coordinates can be pasted as decimal, degrees/minutes/seconds with N/S/E/W, MGRS, or a Google / Apple / OpenStreetMap share link. Only this session's radio GPS fix counts as device GPS; MeshCore advert coordinates do not
- **Layers** control (Map tab, top right): switch basemap, toggle overlays (markers, movement trails, waypoints, diagnostic halos, open **incidents**, **MGRS grid**, **Sensors**, **Weather forecasts**, and **TAK units** from ATAK clients and the remote TAK server); basemap preference persists in SQLite and localStorage
- **Show on map** from the node list pin or node detail; switches to the Map tab and flies to that node
- **Position trail**: persisted path overlay (configurable 1 h – 7 days); survives restarts via SQLite; senders of open incidents keep their track through retention pruning until the incident is resolved; toggle and window size in App tab; wipe via Danger Zone
- **SAR tools**: MGRS grid overlay and a distance **measure** tool on the Map tab
- Auto-refresh at configurable intervals; manual static position entry; send your position back to your device
- **Reticulum Map tab** uses RMAP v4 discovery (opt-in heard interfaces), not Meshtastic/MeshCore node positions — plus the same **Emergency incidents** overlay when open MECP rows have coordinates (MECP over LXMF chat) — see [Reticulum Features](#reticulum-features)

**Telemetry**

- Battery voltage and signal quality charts (SNR/RSSI) in the Telemetry tab

### MeshCore Features

MeshCore runs simultaneously alongside Meshtastic and Reticulum. Use the protocol switcher at the top of the rail to bring MeshCore into view; the other sessions stay connected in the background. Panels are grouped into rail sections (Chat, Network, Map, Monitor, Device, then Incident and App) and every panel is also in the Ctrl/Cmd+K launcher. **Meshtastic** shows **17** panels (including **Administration**, **Security**, **TAK**, **Incident** next to **App**, **Stats**, and **Sniffer**; no **Rooms** tab). **MeshCore** shows **18** panels (**TAK**, and **Incident** next to **App**; **Contacts** replaces **Nodes**, **Repeaters** replaces **Modules**, and **Rooms** is MeshCore-only; **Security** shows backup/restore and crypto tools only). **Reticulum** shows **17** panels (Connection, Chat, **Games**, **RRC**, Nomad Network, **Remote**, Peers, **Map**, Network, Admin, **TAK**, **Incident**, App, Diagnostics, **Stats**, **Sniffer**, Topology). **Stats** and **Sniffer** are available in all three protocols; **RF** and **Graph** are LoRa-only (Meshtastic and MeshCore).

- **Transmit queue**: header badge (with tooltip) when the connected radio reports outbound queue depth (STATS).

**Contacts & Discovery**

- Contact list with advert-based positions, contact types (Chat, Repeater, Room), and GPS coordinates persisted to SQLite; contacts seed from DB on reconnect as a fallback cache
- **Favorite / pin**: persisted per contact in SQLite (`meshcore_contacts.favorited`)
- **Contact groups**: protocol-neutral; create and manage groups from the **Contacts** tab toolbar (Meshtastic: **Nodes** tab); Meshtastic has built-in groups (**GPS**, **RF+MQTT**); filter the list by group; **Room** contacts excluded from user groups by default
- **Import Contacts**: **Nodes** tab: bulk **JSON nickname import** to pre-fill contact names (not on the Repeaters panel)
- **Refresh Contacts**: pull the full contact list from the device on demand
- **Show Public Keys**: toggle to display full public keys under contact names
- **Contact Auto-Add**: configure auto-add mode (on/off), overwrite existing, max hops; apply settings to device
- **Clear All Contacts**: destructive action with confirmation (Radio tab Danger Zone)
- **Send Advert**: broadcast your node's presence (flood advert) to the mesh with loading state and toast feedback. The header **Flood Advert** is a split button; its chevron opens **Zero-hop Advert**, which reaches only radios in direct range
- **Auto-offload when full** (Radio tab, contact settings): moves contacts from the radio to the app database when the contact table is nearly full (based on the radio-reported table size), when the radio reports it is full, rejects a contact as full, or evicts one under overwrite-oldest
- **Manual Contact Approval**: toggle between auto-add (contacts appear automatically when heard) and manual-add (new contacts require approval before appearing); preference is persisted and re-applied on reconnect

**Messaging**

- Channel messaging and **direct messages (DMs)** with delivery ACK tracking (`expectedAckCrc`) and failure timeout; a DM shows delivered only after the hop ACK arrives (channel sends are marked sent when the companion accepts them); **DM threads can be closed** from the chat UI
- **Remove or clear a channel from Chat**: right-click a channel chip (or use the menu key / Shift+F10) for **Remove channel** and **Clear messages**; the + channel dialog also has a remove button per channel. Public (slot 0) can be cleared but not removed. Both confirm first and do nothing if a different radio is connected by then
- **Transport badges** on received messages; **RF**, **MQTT**, or **both** (persisted as `received_via` in `meshcore_messages`); MQTT JSON chat can be used when RF is down
- **Inbound dedup** (`meshcoreStoreDedup.ts`): merges duplicate RF/MQTT echoes, companion TX echoes, and tapback self-echoes so chat and Rooms stay readable
- **MeshCore Open GIFs**: inbound `g:GIFID` (and Giphy URLs) render inline in chat; outbound send via Radio **MeshCore Open compatibility** toggle (paste URL/ID or **GIF** composer button) — see [parity doc](docs/meshcore-meshtastic-parity.md#meshcore-open-gif-wire-ggifid)
- Incoming push events: periodic advert (0x80), path update (0x81), send confirmed (0x82), message waiting (0x83), new contact (0x8A), incoming DM (7), incoming channel message (8)
- All messages and contacts persisted to SQLite (`meshcore_messages`, `meshcore_contacts` tables)

**Room servers (BBS)** — **Rooms** tab (RF only; not MQTT)

- Login to room-server contacts; **blank** guest password for read-only when allowed; **`"hello"`** as the default read/write guest password; **Continue read-only** also sends blank
- Post plain UTF-8 after login; inbound **SignedPlain** pushes show author prefix stripped in the UI
- **Remember password**, **Auto-sync** (periodic re-login while connected, minimum 60 minutes per room), per-room unread badges (**Rooms** tab in the Chat section; separate from **Chat** badges)
- Room admin CLI / ACL setperm on the **Repeaters** tab (room rows); Rooms Members still call `get acl` via the same CLI path. Session/login queue and path sync in `meshcoreRoom*.ts` — see [docs/meshcore-meshtastic-parity.md](docs/meshcore-meshtastic-parity.md#meshcore-room-servers) and [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting-meshcore.md#meshcore-room-server-login-posts-and-windows-10)

**Diagnostics & Remote Queries**

- **Trace route** (`tracePath`): per-hop SNR display; each intermediate hop's SNR is reported individually, unlike Meshtastic's hop-count-only trace
- **Repeater Status**: on-demand query of noise floor, last RSSI/SNR, packet counts, air time, uptime, TX queue, error events, and duplicate counts; available for any contact
- **Remote Telemetry**: pull CayenneLPP-encoded environment data (temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, voltage, GPS) from any contact via `getTelemetry`; results shown inline in the node detail modal with fetch timestamp
- **Neighbor Info**: query a Repeater node's neighbor list via paged binary `GetNeighbours` (request page size 50; firmware may return fewer rows); shows each neighbor's name (resolved from contacts or hex prefix), how recently it was heard, and color-coded SNR; **Load more** continues from the listed count when the total is higher

**Repeaters**

- **Repeaters panel** (MeshCore-only tab): list **repeaters and room servers** (All / Repeaters / Rooms filter) with on-demand status (noise floor, RSSI/SNR, packet counts, air time, uptime, TX queue); **Path** column shows a per-hop SNR sparkline from the last trace (last trace/path hop data is also stored in local SQLite so sparklines can survive app restarts); per-row **Neighbors** expands an inline neighbor list (same query as node detail, including **Load more**); room rows add **Open room** (jump to Rooms) plus room CLI pills (`get acl`, `allow.read.only`, ACL setperm)
- **Per-node admin passwords**: optional **Remember** saves credentials per repeater/room in SQLite `app_settings` (`meshcoreRepeaterCredential:<nodeId>` / room admin password); collapsible **Saved passwords** sidebar section with per-node Forget
- **Waiting-message drain**: header status indicator (queued backlog and active sync on any protocol tab; **paused/deferred** state only on the MeshCore tab) during serial companion backlog drain; **Sync now** for manual catch-up
- **Repeater CLI**: per-repeater expandable **CLI** interface; command input with Enter to send, scrollable command/response history, Up/Down arrow history navigation, quick-command bar (get name, get radio, neighbors, version, clock, clock sync, clear stats, advert, board, …) plus a **Radio** row of MeshCore v1.17+ settings (RX gain, FEM RX/TX gain, CAD, …), flood vs. auto (saved path) routing toggle; responses are correlated to commands via 2-character hex prefix tokens; configurable retries with dynamic timeout; **auto Ping** before the first multi-hop CLI command when no trace exists this session (info toast while establishing route); **destructive-command confirm** modal for reboot/erase/factory-reset patterns
- **Remote session authentication (optional)**: Password may be required for **CLI** and some **telemetry** paths when firmware ACL demands it. **Status** and **Neighbors** use pubkey-framed companion commands and typically work without login on direct (0-hop) repeaters; the auth modal offers “Continue without password.” Saved passwords persist when **Remember** is checked. Admin RPCs share a serialized companion queue — expect up to ~2 minutes blocked while a ping or multi-hop request runs. Status/Telemetry/Neighbors toast when the radio is disconnected.
- **Panel toolbar**: **Reboot Device** (shown when the device supports the command); **Send Advert** and **Sync Clock** moved to Radio panel Device Actions section (distinct from the Repeater CLI **`clock sync`** quick pill)
- **Per-repeater removal**: two-click confirm button on each row; removes from in-memory state and deletes from the SQLite contacts DB
- **Clear All Repeaters**: Danger Zone entry in the App tab that deletes all Repeater-type contacts (contact_type = 2) from the DB while leaving Chat and Room contacts intact

**Radio Parameters**

- Frequency (Hz), bandwidth, spreading factor, coding rate, and TX power; synced from device `selfInfo` and applied live via the Radio tab
- **Channel display and edit**: view and edit channel list from the device in the Radio tab; **Import Config JSON** (MeshCore) applies name and radio settings to the device and reports what was applied vs. not supported

**Battery & Signal Telemetry**

- Battery voltage from device `selfInfo`; per-packet signal telemetry (SNR/RSSI) from RF event 0x88; visible in the Telemetry tab
- **Environment charts** (temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, etc.) in the Telemetry tab when pulled Cayenne LPP data is available; same panel as Meshtastic environment telemetry
- **Raw Packet Log** (**Sniffer** tab): virtualized log (ring-buffer capped at **2,500** entries per protocol) with **sortable columns**, **relative timestamps**, **quick-filter chips**, and expandable hex. **MeshCore:** on-air **path hash chains**, hop count, route-type color bars, device-type icons, ping/trace from row actions; **Meshtastic:** transport badges (RF/MQTT), collapsed hop count; **Reticulum:** sidecar wire packets via WebSocket/`GET /api/v1/packets` (see [docs/reticulum.md](docs/reticulum.md)); filter by type, name, or hex; **Clear** resets the buffer

**Device Control**

- **Administration** tab: **Reboot** when connected (Meshtastic also gets shutdown, factory reset, NodeDB reset, reboot-to-OTA, and enter DFU on the same tab)
- _Not available for MeshCore_ (not implemented in the meshcore.js library): shutdown, factory reset, reset NodeDB, reboot-to-OTA, enter DFU mode

**Transport Notes**

- BLE: waits for sidecar GATT session connect before issuing commands; includes nudge timeout for stuck `deviceQuery` on some devices. On **Windows**, the app checks the pairing state and pairs the radio itself when needed (it asks for the PIN shown on the MeshCore radio; Meshtastic prefills `123456`); if pairing is stuck, use **Remove & Re-pair Device**. Pairing only in Windows Settings is no longer required and can leave some radios half-paired. A **second connect attempt** may run automatically after some transient GATT discovery or handshake timeouts.
- Serial: auto-reconnects on startup using a saved port signature so reconnect targets the same physical device when possible
- TCP: connects to MeshCore companion radio; default port **5000**, configurable per connection
- **MQTT (JSON v1):** The Connection tab MQTT card includes a **Network Preset** picker (order: **LetsMesh**, **MeshMapper**, **Colorado Mesh**, **Waev**, **Meshat.se**, **MeshCore.CA**, **EastMesh**, **Ripple Networks**, **Custom**). New installs default to **LetsMesh** (WebSocket on port 443, topic prefix `meshcore/test`; broker auth uses `@michaelhart/meshcore-decoder`'s `createAuthToken`; MQTT username `v1_<64-hex public key>`, password token with JWT `aud` matching the **MQTT server hostname**; optional **Packet logger** forwards RX packet summaries to the broker when enabled; see [docs/letsmesh-mqtt-auth.md](docs/letsmesh-mqtt-auth.md)). **LetsMesh**, **MeshMapper**, **Waev**, **Meshat.se**, **MeshCore.CA**, and **EastMesh** share that device-signing JWT flow (WebSocket path `/ws` for LetsMesh/MeshMapper, `/mqtt` for Waev/Meshat.se/MeshCore.CA/EastMesh; **MeshCore.CA** adds a Primary/Backup broker toggle). **Colorado Mesh** is regional (Colorado residents only; WebSocket on port 443, topic prefix `meshcore/DEN`; confirm dialog on select; existing Colorado users get a one-time stay-or-switch prompt). IATA-scoped brokers require topic `meshcore/{IATA}` or `meshcore/test`. **Ripple Networks** (TLS on port 8883, topic prefix `meshcore`, shared credentials, insecure TLS confirm) and **Custom** remain available for other brokers.

### Reticulum Features

Reticulum is the third protocol (yellow **RN** on the rail switcher). The stack runs in an **AGPL-3.0-or-later Rust sidecar** (`mesh-client-reticulum`) spawned by Electron main; the GPL-3.0-or-later renderer talks to it through `electronAPI.reticulum` (HTTP/WS proxy). Chat history and LXMF contacts persist in SQLite.

**Ratspeak-compatible stack.** Primary interop target is [Ratspeak](https://github.com/ratspeak/Ratspeak) peers on [rsReticulum](https://github.com/ratspeak/rsReticulum) / [rsLXMF](https://github.com/ratspeak/rsLXMF), with sibling crates for the same surfaces Ratspeak ships:

| Surface                      | Sibling / library                                   | mesh-client UI                  |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| LXMF DMs, paper, propagation | rsLXMF                                              | Chat, Network                   |
| Nomad pages                  | [rsNomad](https://github.com/Colorado-Mesh/rsNomad) | Nomad Network                   |
| Live voice                   | [rsLXST](https://github.com/ratspeak/rsLXST)        | Call on Peers / Chat DM         |
| Games (TTT / Chess / FIAR)   | [lrgp-rs](https://github.com/ratspeak/lrgp-rs)      | **Games** tab + Challenge       |
| Relay chat / Remote          | rsReticulum + sidecar                               | **RRC**, **Remote** (rnsh/rncp) |

Architecture and API: [docs/reticulum.md](docs/reticulum.md). Games wire parity: [docs/reticulum-games-parity.md](docs/reticulum-games-parity.md).

**Stack & interfaces (Connection tab)**

- **Start stack** / **Stop stack**, **Auto-start** (quitting lives in the header's red **Disconnect & Quit**, at the top right of every screen)
- **Interfaces** CRUD: TCP client, **I2P**, Auto (discovery), RNode over USB serial, **Bluetooth** (`ble://…`), or **Wi‑Fi** (`tcp://host:7633`); **Add default backbones** regional hub picker
- Config **audit/repair** for ghost TCP rows, unreachable hubs, and RF preset mismatches (Diagnostics + inline hints)

**Network & identity (Network tab)**

- Generate or import LXMF identity (mnemonic); Ratspeak `.rsi` PIN backup and official raw identity file export/import; optional **identity vault**; import/export rnsd-style config from standard system paths
- Stack settings (`enable_transport`, `share_instance`, log level), announce interval, **Clear announces**, **RMAP v4 discovery** publish controls
- **Propagation nodes** (Network tab): **Propagation mode** Off (default) / Auto / Manual, Preferred node for offline DMs, per-node sync, optional **local propagation inbox** / Advanced PN hosting policy

**Messaging (Chat + encrypted paper + RRC)**

- **Chat tab:** **DM-only** LXMF text and reactions (peer file transfer via Remote rncp; historic LXMF attachment labels still render; **cached raster images** under `reticulum/attachments/` display inline)
- **Encrypted paper (Ratspeak / LXMF paper):** Chat DM **Share as paper** encrypts offline to a QR / `lxm://` URI with **no network send** (Completes immediately, **Paper** delivery badge); **Scan paper** (Chat or Network **Scan / import**) decrypts into the local inbox when the identity matches. OS `lxm://` paper deep links ingest without a confirm prompt; contact / MeshCore imports still confirm
- **LXST voice Call** on DM headers and Peers rows — live telephony over rsLXST (not an LXMF voice-note clip)
- **RRC tab:** multi-hub relay chat (rooms, nicklists, slash commands, favourites, auto-join, reconnect; up to 8 hubs); @mentions badge Chat + the Reticulum rail switcher
- **Remote tab:** **rnsh** interactive shell sessions and **rncp** file transfer (send / receive / fetch), saved addresses and inbound-policy controls; Chat DM send-file convenience (distinct from Meshtastic remote admin)
- **Delivery:** **Direct** when the destination is in the path table; after Direct exhausts, **multi-PN cascade** (preferred remote → other enabled remotes hop-sorted → local-prop last). Remote PN Completes show **Stored at propagation node** (`delivered`); local-prop Completes as local inbox (`stored_locally`) — neither is recipient Delivered

**Games (LRGP)**

- **Games** tab (Reticulum-only): **Tic-Tac-Toe**, **Chess**, and **Four in a Row** over [LRGP](https://github.com/ratspeak/lrgp-rs), wire-compatible with Ratspeak — challenge, accept, play, draw/resign, session list + unread badge (sidebar; folded into the rail protocol switcher total with LXMF Chat and RRC)
- **Challenge** from Peers rows and Chat DM headers; deep links `lrgp:<session>` and `lxm://game/<id>` open the Games tab to that session
- See [Games parity checklist](docs/reticulum-games-parity.md) for command/UI interop status vs Ratspeak

**Peers, topology, Nomad Network, Map**

- **Peers** tab: RNS path-table peers, messaged **History**, saved **Contacts**, and **Favorites** (sub-tabs); LXMFace avatars; virtualized large lists, path probe, **LXST Call**, **LRGP Challenge**, and peer detail modal (Save as contact is manual — messaging alone does not add Contacts)
- **Map** tab: local RMAP v4 discovery map (Leaflet + OSM basemaps; heard opt-in interfaces with GPS; interface-type filters; reachable vs heard-only sidebar list; publish via Network + Connection); **Global map** link to [rmap.world](https://rmap.world/) — no position trails or waypoints (contrast with Meshtastic/MeshCore Map)
- **Topology** tab: best-effort graph from the RNS path table (next-hop edges, force layout)
- **Nomad Network** tab: collapsible favourites/announces list (default **Favourites** sub-tab); **My Pages** hosts a static Nomad site (rsNomad `nomad-core`) — **Choose folder** for a watched site root (e.g. sibling `nomad-page` with `pages/*.mu`) or pages directory, set a display name, Start serving (off by default; auto-restores when the stack comes back up); in-app Micron page editor and per-page **Access** (`.allowed`) lists. Browsing is anonymous by default; a per-node fingerprint toggle opts in to identifying yourself to that site (see [Nomad identify](docs/reticulum.md#nomad-identify-to-this-site)). Micron browser with fit-width default + open-width toggle; panel lazy-mounts after first visit

**Deep links & QR**

- Registered OS scheme **`lxm://`** (identity / contact / paper / game); Columba-compatible **`lxma://`** contact+key when pasting or opening; MeshCore `meshcore://` ingest when pasted/opened (not OS-registered)
- Network **Scan / import** and Chat paper controls share one ingest path (`handleReticulumQrIngest`)

**Admin & hardware**

- **RNode firmware flasher** (Web Serial): nRF52 DFU, ESP32 (`esptool-js`), EEPROM provision, optional Wi‑Fi station/AP provisioning
- Stack **factory reset** (danger zone)

**Diagnostics**

- Reticulum-native interface, path, and LXMF health rows — **not** Meshtastic Hop Goblins or MeshCore repeater noise-floor findings
- LoRa routing/RF findings from other protocols are **hidden** on the Reticulum tab (`filterDiagnosticRowsForProtocol`)

**Transport notes**

- No Meshtastic/MeshCore-style MQTT `ConnectionDriver` path; connect by starting the sidecar, then enabling interfaces
- **BLE coexistence:** Meshtastic, MeshCore, and Reticulum run Bluetooth in the same sidecar process and can use **different devices** concurrently. The app checks configured device ownership and serializes scans requested through the app; Reticulum's background discovery and reconnect run separately. See [BLE coexistence](docs/agents/ble-serial.md#multi-protocol-ble-coexistence-incl-reticulum).
- Packaged builds bundle `mesh-client-reticulum` beside the Electron app; dev builds: `pnpm run reticulum:sidecar:build` — see [development-environment.md](docs/development-environment.md#reticulum-sidecar-optional)

## Limitations

<!-- docs-site:limitations:start -->

- **MQTT → RF (Meshtastic)**: Downlink uses the firmware **MQTT module** (`proxy_to_client_enabled` on BLE/USB) and per-channel **downlink enabled** on the Radio tab — not legacy app `sendText` relay. mesh-client bridges `MqttClientProxyMessage` between broker and radio when proxy is active.
- **MQTT → RF (MeshCore JSON)**: Not supported; MeshCore MQTT is chat ingest only.
- **Meshtastic - PKC remote admin**: Configure-node-over-MQTT is not supported; a connected local RF radio is required to reach remote nodes (firmware 2.5+).
- **MeshCore - MQTT (JSON v1)**: The Connection tab can connect to an MQTT broker in MeshCore mode using a small JSON chat envelope (see [docs/meshcore-meshtastic-parity.md](docs/meshcore-meshtastic-parity.md)). This is separate from Meshtastic's protobuf MQTT pipeline.
- **Breaking change — MeshCore single-packet messages (no multi-part / multi-split)**: mesh-client **no longer** auto-splits outbound MeshCore chat, DM, or room messages into numbered `[i/N]` packets. Each send is one radio packet (max ~130-160 characters depending on context and sender name); longer text is **blocked** with an explanatory notice in the composer. On a busy mesh, repeaters routinely drop some split parts, so recipients previously got silently incomplete messages. **Migration:** shorten long messages, or send them as a few separate shorter messages. A non-blocking advisory also appears if you send faster than the mesh can relay (~5s). Call this out in release notes. Upstream: [meshcore-dev/MeshCore#1502](https://github.com/meshcore-dev/MeshCore/issues/1502), [#2820](https://github.com/meshcore-dev/MeshCore/issues/2820), [#3053](https://github.com/meshcore-dev/MeshCore/issues/3053). Inbound multi-part from other clients is still merged for display. Meshtastic multi-split (up to 9 parts) is unchanged.
- **MeshCore - partial routing diagnostics**: MeshCore supports `route_flapping` / `path_instability` (PathUpdated events) and `weak_link` (when `hasPerHopSnr` and a trace is completed). Distance-based `hop_goblin` / close-in `bad_route` are Meshtastic-only (`hasDistanceBasedHopAnomalies`). Full hop-anomaly detection and Meshtastic-style LocalStats RF findings require Meshtastic packets; MeshCore provides its own RF findings (Elevated Noise Floor, Excessive Flooding) from Repeater Status packet stats. **Foreign LoRa** tables render on the Meshtastic tab only (MeshCore may record overhear internally).
- **MeshCore - channel editing**: Can add/edit/delete channels (name + PSK) via the Radio tab, but does not expose Meshtastic-style full protobuf config. Radio parameters (frequency, bandwidth, spreading factor, coding rate, TX power) can be set via the Radio tab.
- **MeshCore - remote telemetry availability**: `getTelemetry` requires the remote node to have environment sensors. A timeout is returned if the node has no sensor data.
- **MeshCore - neighbor info availability**: `getNeighbours` is supported only by Repeater-type nodes running firmware v1.9.0+. The button is hidden for Chat and Room contacts.
- **MeshCore - Trace Route / Ping trace**: Remote nodes typically respond only if they have **your** node as a contact. One-way or foreign heard nodes may lead to a client-side timeout; multi-hop paths without synced outPath bytes trigger **passive** PathUpdated wait + contact refresh (**15s + 5s × hops**, capped at **45s**), then for **2+ hops** up to **two** flood-advert priming rounds before `SendTracePath`. **1-hop** targets may use a synthesized `[relayPrefix, destPrefix]` path when a direct 0-hop repeater is known. If priming and synthesis still fail, ping may fast-fail with **No route from radio yet** instead of waiting the full trace timeout. See [Troubleshooting; MeshCore: Trace Route or Ping trace times out](docs/troubleshooting-meshcore.md#meshcore-trace-route-or-ping-trace-times-out).
- **MeshCore - contact type labels**: MeshCore reports a numeric `type` field (0 = None, 1 = Chat, 2 = Repeater, 3 = Room); displayed in the hw_model field in the node list.
- **MeshCore - Security tab (partial)**: Meshtastic-style PKI admin is not on MeshCore firmware; the **Security** tab shows per-node key backup/restore, sign, and export/import only. LetsMesh MQTT uses a separate **active identity cache** (`mesh-client:meshcoreIdentity`); per-node archives do not overwrite each other — see [Key backup and cryptography](docs/key-backup-and-crypto.md).
- **Map tiles; OpenStreetMap Referer requirement**: Packaged desktop builds load the UI from the local filesystem. The main process now loads the renderer with an explicit HTTP referrer so OpenStreetMap tile requests include a valid `Referer` header and comply with the [tile usage policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/). If you point the app at a different tile server, ensure its usage policy permits this client.
- **Reticulum — no LoRa companion parity**: Reticulum does not use Meshtastic/MeshCore `ConnectionDriver`, MQTT hybrid, channel pills, Rooms BBS, or Hop Goblins diagnostics. The **Chat** tab is **DM-only**; hub room chat lives on the **RRC** tab. Interface add/edit/delete updates config on disk — **restart the stack** after changes under `rns-stack`.
- **Reticulum — sidecar license**: The spawned `mesh-client-reticulum` binary is **AGPL-3.0-or-later** (separate process from the GPL-3.0-or-later Electron shell). See [docs/reticulum.md](docs/reticulum.md) and [docs/credits.md](docs/credits.md#bundled-binaries).

- **Graph / Topology visible-node cap**: Meshtastic and MeshCore **Graph** and Reticulum **Topology** render at most **400** nodes after hop filters (force-layout budget). Numeric **Max hops** is applied even when Show distant is off. Unknown hops are omitted unless Max hops is **All hops** and Show distant is on (they are not 1-hop neighbors). The nearby hop ceiling (Mesh hops > 1, Reticulum hops > 2) applies only when Max hops is **All hops**. Reticulum Topology can also filter **RF only** (RNode / KISS / BLE; hides TCP/I2P/Auto). Reticulum path-table ingest is a separate layer (renderer feed **800**, sidecar **2,000**).
- **Reticulum — propagation required for offline peers**: LXMF send fails with `no_propagation_node` when the destination is not in the path table and no cascade candidates exist (enabled remotes or local-prop). Local inbox Completes (`stored_locally`) ≠ peer delivery at a remote PN. When a path exists, Direct is tried first; on Direct fail the sidecar cascades preferred remote → other enabled remotes (hop-sorted) → local-prop last.

## Quick Start

<!-- docs-site:install:start -->

### System requirements

| Platform    | Minimum                                                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **macOS**   | **13 Ventura** or later (Electron 44; Monterey is not supported)      |
| **Windows** | Windows 10 version **1809+** or Windows 11 (x64 and arm64 installers) |
| **Linux**   | x86_64 or aarch64; AppImage, `.deb`, `.rpm`, or Flatpak               |

**Pre-built binaries** for **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Windows** are available in the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Colorado-Mesh/mesh-client/releases) area. Download the installer or archive for your platform; no Node.js or build tools required.

- **Windows (Intel/AMD x64):** `Mesh-client-Setup-{version}.exe`
- **Windows 11 on ARM (Snapdragon, etc.):** `Mesh-client-Setup-{version}-arm64.exe` — do not use the x64 installer on native ARM hardware.

**Flatpak** bundles (`org.coloradomesh.MeshClient-x86_64.flatpak` and `org.coloradomesh.MeshClient-aarch64.flatpak`) are published on each version tag for Flatpak-enabled Linux:

```bash
flatpak install --user ./org.coloradomesh.MeshClient-x86_64.flatpak # or -aarch64
flatpak run org.coloradomesh.MeshClient
```

VMware guests and other GPU edge cases: [Flatpak troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md#flatpak-vmwgfx-driver-missing-vmware-on-macos).

**Arch Linux (AUR, third-party):** community package [`mesh-client`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mesh-client) (maintainer `victorix`) — **not** maintained by Colorado Mesh. Prefer [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Colorado-Mesh/mesh-client/releases) AppImage / `.deb` / `.rpm` / Flatpak for official builds. Report packaging issues on the AUR package page; report app bugs on GitHub.

```bash
yay -S mesh-client # or: paru -S mesh-client
```

**macOS (release download):**

- Requires **macOS 13 Ventura** or later.
- **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/…):** download the **arm64 `.dmg`**, open it, and drag **Mesh-client** to **Applications**.
- **Intel Mac:** download the **x64 `.dmg`** (file name includes `x64`, or has no `arm64` suffix), open it, and drag **Mesh-client** to **Applications**.
- If you use the **`.zip`** instead: extract with **[Keka](https://www.keka.io/en/)** or `ditto -xk` — **do not use 7-Zip** (or Finder Archive Utility). Those tools flatten macOS framework symlinks and can cause a launch crash: `Library not loaded: Squirrel.framework`.
- **Official [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Colorado-Mesh/mesh-client/releases) (v5.22.0+):** macOS builds are **Developer ID signed and notarized**. Drag to **Applications** and open normally — you should **not** need `xattr` or Right-click → Open.
- **Unsigned local or fork builds** (`pnpm run dist:mac` without signing secrets, CI artifacts from forks): Gatekeeper may show **"Mesh-client" is damaged and can't be opened** (or **File is damaged and cannot be opened**), especially on **Apple silicon**. That is quarantine on unsigned downloads, not a corrupt file.

If the app is blocked:

1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and scroll to the bottom. If you see "Mesh-client was blocked from use", click **Allow** to run the app.
2. For **unsigned** builds only — if you don't see the Mesh-client entry in Privacy & Security, or the app still won't open after clicking Allow — remove the quarantine attribute:

```bash
xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Mesh-client.app
```

After running `xattr`, check Privacy & Security again (scroll to the bottom); the entry should now appear with an **Allow** button.

See [Troubleshooting; macOS: File is damaged…](docs/troubleshooting.md#macos-file-is-damaged-and-cannot-be-opened), [macOS: Library not loaded: Squirrel.framework…](docs/troubleshooting.md#macos-library-not-loaded-squirrelframework-after-zip-extract), and [this explanation for a similar Electron app](https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin/issues/104#issuecomment-1553914730).

**Building from source / development setup:** see [docs/development-environment.md](docs/development-environment.md) for complete shared requirements, clone/install steps, test harness setup, and detailed macOS/Windows/Linux instructions.

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:** [Node.js 22.13.0+](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm 12+](https://pnpm.io/installation) (repo pins an exact `packageManager` — Corepack, or `npm i -g pnpm` / `npm i -g corepack` on Node 25+). After a pnpm major bump, `pnpm install` / `pnpm run dev` print upgrade instructions if your local pnpm is too old.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Colorado-Mesh/mesh-client
cd mesh-client
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

For OS-specific steps; BLE permissions on macOS, serial port group on Linux, Visual Studio Build Tools on Windows; see [docs/development-environment.md](docs/development-environment.md).

## Usage

### Choosing a Protocol

All three protocols can run at the same time. Use the **MT / MC / RN** protocol switcher at the top of the rail to bring the desired view into focus; the other sessions remain connected in the background. Meshtastic and MeshCore each store last-connection settings and auto-reconnect on startup; Reticulum can **Auto-start** the sidecar from the Connection tab.

### Connecting Your Device

**Meshtastic:**

1. Power on your Meshtastic device
2. Put it in Bluetooth pairing mode (if connecting via BLE)
3. Open Mesh-Client and go to the **Connection** tab, ensure **Meshtastic** is selected
4. Select your connection type (Bluetooth / USB Serial / WiFi/HTTP / WiFi/TCP (fast) / MQTT)
5. Click **Connect** and select your device from the picker
6. Wait for status to show **Configured**; you're connected

**MeshCore:**

1. Power on your MeshCore firmware device
2. In the Connection tab, select **MeshCore**
3. Choose **Bluetooth**, **Serial**, or **TCP** (enter the device's IP address and optional port for TCP; default port 5000)
4. Click **Connect**; the app fetches self info, contacts, and channels from the device
5. Wait for status to show **Configured**; contacts and channels are loaded

**Reticulum:**

1. Select **RN** (Reticulum, yellow) at the top of the rail
2. Open the **Connection** tab and click **Start stack** (enable **Auto-start** to skip this on future launches)
3. On **Network**, generate or import your LXMF identity (the sidecar must be running)
4. On **Connection → Interfaces**, add transports (TCP hub, Auto, or RNode over USB/BLE/Wi‑Fi) and enable them; restart the stack after interface changes when using the full `rns-stack` build
5. Use **Chat** for LXMF DMs (and **Share as paper** / **Scan paper** for offline encrypted handoff); **Games** for Tic-Tac-Toe / Chess / Four in a Row (or Challenge from Peers / Chat); **Call** for LXST voice; **Remote** for rnsh/rncp; **RRC** for hub rooms; **Peers** and **Topology** for path-table visibility; **Nomad Network** for browse + **My Pages** watched-folder hosting

Dev builds need the sidecar binary once: `pnpm run reticulum:sidecar:build`. Packaged releases include it automatically. See [docs/reticulum.md](docs/reticulum.md) and [Troubleshooting — Reticulum](docs/troubleshooting-reticulum.md#reticulum-sidecar-wont-start-or-health-poll-times-out).

### Auto-Reconnect

After a successful connection, Mesh-Client remembers your last device per protocol. On next launch:

- **Serial**: auto-connects silently in the background (Meshtastic and MeshCore)
- **Bluetooth (all platforms)**: sidecar GATT auto-scans on launch and reconnects when the last device is discovered (no user gesture required). On Windows, unpaired radios are paired in the app (PIN prompt) before connecting.
- **WiFi / HTTP / TCP**: remembered Meshtastic HTTP/TCP and MeshCore TCP addresses **auto-connect silently on launch** via `ProtocolAutoConnectCoordinator` (stays alive across tab switches). A one-click **Reconnect** card appears only when auto-connect fails or was cancelled by a manual Connect. Manual Connect cancels any in-flight auto-connect first (`cancelProtocolRfAutoConnect`).
- **MQTT**: auto-reconnects using saved broker settings (Meshtastic protobuf pipeline; MeshCore JSON v1 adapter; select transport when connecting)
- **Reticulum**: with **Auto-start** enabled, the sidecar starts on launch; otherwise click **Start stack** on the Connection tab after opening the app

When both Meshtastic and MeshCore have different saved BLE peripherals, dual-radio wake/startup staggers auto-connect (active protocol first via `mesh-client:protocol`). Sleep/wake reconnect staggers Meshtastic (~4s) then MeshCore (~8s), with up to ~30s dual-radio settle — see [Troubleshooting — macOS sleep / wake](docs/troubleshooting.md#macos-sleep--wake-and-auto-reconnect).

### MQTT

Enter your broker URL, topic, and optional credentials in the MQTT section of the Connection tab. When connected, the section collapses to a compact info card showing the server, client ID, and topic. You can send messages via MQTT without a radio when using **Meshtastic**, or **MeshCore** with brokers other than the public **LetsMesh** presets (Ripple / Custom still use the JSON v1 chat envelope for MQTT-only sends). **LetsMesh** public MQTT targets the **Analyzer** packet-logger model: optional RX summaries to `{topicPrefix}/meshcore/packets` when your radio is connected ([docs/letsmesh-mqtt-auth.md](docs/letsmesh-mqtt-auth.md)); MQTT-only channel chat to LetsMesh without a radio is not supported. **Meshtastic** uses the protobuf MQTT stack; **MeshCore** broker details are in [docs/meshcore-meshtastic-parity.md](docs/meshcore-meshtastic-parity.md). In **MeshCore** mode, the **LetsMesh** / **MeshMapper** / **Colorado Mesh** / **Waev** / **Meshat.se** / **MeshCore.CA** / **EastMesh** / **Ripple Networks** presets fill those fields for the corresponding public networks. The device-signing presets (everything except Ripple / Custom) use the same contract as [meshcore-mqtt-broker](https://github.com/michaelhart/meshcore-mqtt-broker) with JWT `aud` matching the **broker hostname** you connect to (e.g. `mqtt-us-v1.letsmesh.net`, `mqtt.waev.app`, `mqtt1.meshcore.ca`); mesh-client generates tokens from your imported MeshCore identity (`public_key` + `private_key` in config JSON). **Custom** settings also use device signing when the configured server matches a known device-signing broker hostname (e.g. `mqtt.waev.app`); Custom is only non-device-signing for unmatched hosts. Use **Custom** and paste credentials manually if your operator issued different rules.

## Configuration

### Connection Types

**Meshtastic** supports BLE, USB serial, WiFi/HTTP, WiFi/TCP (fast, port 4403), and MQTT:

| Platform | Bluetooth | Serial | HTTP | TCP (4403) | MQTT |
| -------- | --------- | ------ | ---- | ---------- | ---- |
| macOS    | Yes       | Yes    | Yes  | Yes        | Yes  |
| Windows  | Yes       | Yes    | Yes  | Yes        | Yes  |
| Linux    | Yes       | Yes    | Yes  | Yes        | Yes  |

**MeshCore** supports BLE, Web Serial, TCP, and optional MQTT (broker JSON v1 adapter):

| Platform | Bluetooth | Serial | TCP | MQTT (JSON v1) |
| -------- | --------- | ------ | --- | -------------- |
| macOS    | Yes       | Yes    | Yes | Yes            |
| Windows  | Yes       | Yes    | Yes | Yes            |
| Linux    | Yes       | Yes    | Yes | Yes            |

**Reticulum** uses the AGPL sidecar (no Meshtastic/MeshCore MQTT card). Interfaces are configured on the Connection tab after **Start stack**:

| Platform | TCP client | I2P | Auto (discovery) | RNode USB serial | RNode BLE | RNode Wi‑Fi (`tcp://:7633`) |
| -------- | ---------- | --- | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| macOS    | Yes        | Yes | Yes              | Yes              | Yes       | Yes                         |
| Windows  | Yes        | Yes | Yes              | Yes              | Yes       | Yes                         |
