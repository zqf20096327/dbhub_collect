# roam-code

**Local code analysis and ready-to-run checks for coding agents.**

Roam gives your agent a reusable codebase index, pattern findings, candidate
algorithmic alternatives, and checks it can call as it works. It can investigate
code and evaluate changes without building each analysis from scratch.

## Why Roam is different

Your agent can read code, reason about it, and run tools already. Roam adds
reusable local analyses: query indexed connections between files and functions,
inspect a detected pattern with a proposed alternative, or run a scoped check.
The results give your agent something concrete to inspect, test, and build on.

Static checks use local compute, not model calls or a paid Roam API. Your
agent's model usage, including reading those results, is separate. Refresh the
index with `roam index` as the code changes.

Roam is useful before there is a defect or a patch: trace a dependency, compare
an approach, or establish which checks a change will need. Agents use the tools;
people set direction and decide what ships. It complements your editor, search,
tests, security tools, and code review.

<a id="install--first-four-commands"></a>

## Connect your agent

You need **Python 3.10+** and a Git repository. On Linux, macOS, or Windows:

```bash
pip install "roam-code[mcp]"
cd path/to/your/repo
roam init
```

Replace the path with your project. `init` builds the local index and creates
project configuration; use `roam index` if you want only the index. The first
run can download a parser and takes longer than a refresh.

Then **[choose your agent's setup guide](https://roam-code.com/setup#install-mcp)**.
Connect through MCP (a standard way for agents to use tools), or let your agent
call the CLI. Add the usage instructions to its project configuration; connecting
tools alone does not make the agent use them.

Prefer an isolated installation? Use `pipx install "roam-code[mcp]"` or
`uv tool install "roam-code[mcp]"`. If your agent only needs shell commands,
`pip install roam-code` is enough. [Container setup and limits](docs/containers.md).

<details>
<summary>Inspect a first result yourself</summary>

```bash
roam health
roam preflight <symbol>
```

Replace `<symbol>` with a function or class in your project; find it with
`roam search <name>`. Read the returned locations, findings and missing checks,
not just the score. The [historical fresh-install transcript](docs/fresh-install-smoke.md)
shows a recorded example, not current measurements of your checkout.

</details>

## Try a task

Start with code you know. Ask your agent to use Roam to find a function's
definition and references, then inspect the returned locations together.
Follow the [first-result checklist](https://roam-code.com/docs/integration-tutorials#validate-connection)
to confirm the intended repository, connected tools, and any incomplete results.

| What you want to do | What Roam supplies | What the agent still does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Find where to start | An overview, definitions and indexed connections | Read the relevant source and check the connections |
| Evaluate an approach | Pattern findings with alternatives from the algorithm catalog | Check semantics, try a change, test and measure it |
| Check a change | Impact analysis, related-test guidance and configured check results | Run the required tests and report missing evidence |

For example, `roam algo` can pair repeated list searches with a set or lookup-table
alternative. That is a candidate, not a proven improvement: value types, updates,
ordering, duplicates and returned positions can change the answer. Check behavior
and measure performance before adopting it. For its MCP tool, choose the `review`
preset and restart the server; it is not in default `core`.

Findings are leads. Static connections can be incomplete; a suggested test list
is not test coverage, and a good health score is not permission to merge.
[Read the evidence limits](docs/concepts/detector-evidence.md).

## Core commands

<!-- BEGIN auto-count:readme-canonical-mention -->
**Start with these five commands.** Use `understand`, `context`, `retrieve`, `preflight`, and `critique` for everyday exploration and change review. You can discover the rest as you need them: **287 commands (280 canonical + 7 aliases) organised into 7 categories**. An alias is another name for the same command; you do not need to memorize them. Explore the remaining 282 commands when you need more detail.
<!-- END auto-count:readme-canonical-mention -->

| Verb | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `roam understand` | Get an overview of the project and where to start reading |
| `roam context <symbol>` | Read a definition alongside the code that calls it and the code it calls |
| `roam retrieve "<task>"` | Find useful code for a question such as “trace the login flow” |
| `roam preflight <symbol>` | See what a change could affect, including connected code and tests |
| `roam critique` | Review a patch for related code you may have missed; pipe in `git diff`. High-severity findings exit 5 |

<details>
<summary>Discover the wider command surface</summary>

<!-- BEGIN auto-count:readme-sarif-surface-mention -->
The full surface spans **7 categories** — Getting Started, Daily Workflow, Codebase Health, Architecture, Exploration, Reports & CI, and Refactoring. Run `roam --help` for the 5-verb core, `roam --help-all` for every command name, and `roam surface --json` for the machine-readable inventory. Every command accepts `roam --json <cmd>` for structured output and `roam --sarif <cmd>` for CI integration (SARIF 2.1.0, honoured by 39 commands).

</details>

## MCP Server

MCP lets an agent call Roam tools directly. Install with the `[mcp]` extra
above and follow the [client-specific setup](https://roam-code.com/docs/integration-tutorials).
The server command is `roam mcp`; the client starts it for the intended project.

<!-- BEGIN auto-count:readme-default-preset -->
**Default preset:** `core` (17 tools: 16 core + `roam_expand_toolset` meta-tool).
<!-- END auto-count:readme-default-preset -->

Select a wider preset for a named task by setting `ROAM_MCP_PRESET` in the
server's environment and restarting it. `roam_expand_toolset` reports what is
available; it does not switch the running server. See [presets and tool schemas](docs/mcp-tools.md).

When consuming results, check errors, `partial_success`, scan scope, freshness,
and any response handle before calling a check complete. Preserve useful partial
findings, but do not treat missing evidence as a clean result.
[CLI evidence handling](docs/agent-cli.md) · [MCP usage](https://roam-code.com/docs/mcp-usage).

<details>
<summary>Default tools and package configuration</summary>

There are 8 selectable presets (`core`, `review`, `refactor`, `debug`, `architecture`, `compliance`, `compile-curated`, `full`).
Choose by the task; the [preset guide](docs/mcp-tools.md) explains their contents.

<!-- BEGIN auto-count:readme-mcp-core-preset-tools -->
Core preset tools: `roam_alerts`, `roam_ask`, `roam_batch_search`, `roam_coupling`, `roam_dead_code`, `roam_deps`, `roam_diagnose_issue`, `roam_fetch_handle`, `roam_file_info`, `roam_grep`, `roam_metrics`, `roam_prepare_change`, `roam_search_symbol`, `roam_taint`, `roam_understand`, `roam_uses`.
<!-- END auto-count:readme-mcp-core-preset-tools -->

`roam_ask` (CLI: `roam ask`) routes a supported question to a recipe from the
31-recipe registry. It is a deterministic dispatcher, not a model conversation.

<!-- BEGIN auto-count:readme-mcp-tool-list-link -->
The full 246-tool table with descriptions lives in [`docs/mcp-tools.md`](docs/mcp-tools.md).
<!-- END auto-count:readme-mcp-tool-list-link -->

**Which preset ships where.** The Claude Code plugin selects `core` for a
smaller tool list. This repository's own `.mcp.json` selects `full` so agents
working on Roam can test the wider surface. The difference is intentional.

## Integration with AI coding tools

Use the [integration guides](https://roam-code.com/docs/integration-tutorials)
for supported clients and project instructions. Review generated instructions
before adding them to an existing agent configuration.

```bash
roam describe --agent-prompt
```

This prints guidance to inspect and incorporate; it does not establish that
your agent has followed the workflow. The [agent CLI guide](docs/agent-cli.md)
covers bounded calls and incomplete output.

<a id="the-compiler--your-agents-first-token-already-knows-the-answer"></a>

## Context for your agent

Roam's task compiler can attach locally prepared context to a prompt: callers,
recent changes, or source around a reported bug. It makes no model calls.
Optional Claude Code hooks combine that preparation with post-edit checks:

```bash
roam hooks claude --write
```

Run from the initialized project. Undo with
`roam hooks claude --uninstall --write`. Compile-time context injection is
fail-open; the edited-turn Stop gate blocks failing, unavailable, malformed or
incomplete verification. Read the [hook compatibility and check workflow](docs/agent-cli.md#automatic-claude-hooks)
before enabling it. Installation does not prove the hooks executed.

[compile-code](https://github.com/Cranot/compile-code) provides a dedicated
driver for the same preparation-and-verification loop.
[Historical comparisons and losses](docs/measurements.md#agent-workflow-comparisons--mayjuly-2026)
are dated experiments, not a promise for your model or repository.

### Check the work after an edit

`roam verify --auto` chooses checks for changed files. The
[verification workflow](docs/agent-cli.md#check-the-work-after-an-edit) explains
what can run, how missing evidence is handled, and how reviewed exceptions work.
It does not replace your project's required test suite.

## CI/CD integration

Use the [CI integration guide](docs/ci-integration.md) for GitHub, GitLab,
Jenkins, Azure or Bitbucket. Generate configuration explicitly with
`roam ci-setup --platform github --write` or `roam init --with-ci=github`;
plain `roam init` does not change CI configuration.

</details>

## Roam Guard for PRs

`roam guard-pr` gathers a change's review record: what changed, which checks
were required, what ran, and what remains missing. Use `--ci` or `--strict`
when it must gate CI; reporting-only mode can exit 0 with a blocking verdict.

```bash
roam guard-pr --ci --output guard.md
```

The [adoption guide](templates/examples/roam-guard-pr.README.md) covers verdicts,
exit codes, rules, and CI setup. [Verification evidence](docs/concepts/verification-evidence.md)
explains what a saved record establishes. Signed records can reveal later
changes to evidence; they do not authenticate every supplied claim or establish
that all relevant checks ran.

## Best for

Repeated repository investigations, implementation choices, refactor planning,
and change checks in an agent's workflow. Try a real task on your own code and
inspect the evidence, false positives and time involved before adding a gate.

### When NOT to use Roam

Use an LSP for compiler-backed type resolution, ripgrep for raw text search,
and your test runner for runtime behavior. A small script may be quicker to
read directly. Roam complements these tools; it does not replace them.

### What's measured vs advisory

The [measurement record](docs/measurements.md) separates historical agent
comparisons, held-out repair-sibling retrieval results, and unmeasured detector
accuracy. It preserves losses and limitations alongside wins. No general
accuracy or savings claim follows from a passing regression suite.

<a id="tier-1--full-extraction-dedicated-parsers"></a>

## Language Support

Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, C#, PHP, Ruby, Salesforce and more.
The [language support table](docs/language-support.md) lists extractors and
supported constructs. Extraction depth varies by language and framework;
a recognized file extension is not complete semantic or runtime coverage.

## Performance

Indexing cost depends on your source, Git history, machine and parser cache.
Refresh with `roam index` after changes; unchanged source can be reused.
[Historical timings and benchmark results](docs/measurements.md#timing-notes--historical-readme-record)
are context, not a latency promise. Measure the commands your workflow uses.

## How It Works

Roam discovers files, parses source, extracts symbols, resolves references,
and stores the local model in SQLite. Graph analysis, Git history, detector
rules and supported experiments supply different kinds of observations.

[See the architecture](https://roam-code.com/docs/architecture) and
[explore the illustrative code atlas](https://roam-code.com/explore).
Exclude paths with `.roamignore` or `roam config --exclude "*.proto"`.

## How Roam Compares

Choose Roam for callable local code analysis and checks alongside your agent,
not as another coding agent or a replacement for specialist review.
Its MCP inventory is 246 (17 in default core preset); select tools for the task.
[Compare the roles](https://roam-code.com/compare), then evaluate the outputs on
your own repository: resolution, false positives, latency, and usefulness.

## Paid layers (free CLI stays Apache 2.0)

The CLI and MCP server are free under Apache 2.0 for individuals and teams.
Static checks use local compute, not model calls; your agent's model charges
are separate. You do not need a paid service to use Roam with your agents.

- **PR Replay — paid report by request.** A written assessment of an agreed
  change history, reviewed findings, and a founder walk-through. The existing
  [Team and Deep scopes](https://roam-code.com/audit#tiers) define the PR window;
  agree how commits map to those PRs before kickoff. Try the free local sample
  with `roam pr-replay --tier sample`.
  Its default range is `HEAD~5..HEAD`, not necessarily five PRs; your checkout
  needs that history. A replay does not prove that an incident would have been prevented.
- **Roam Review — planned, not available to subscribe to.** A proposed hosted
  pull-request check using Roam's local analysis. The hosted app, installation
  flow, and billing are not built yet.
- **Roam Cloud — planned, not available to subscribe to.** A proposed shared
  history of codebase measurements. The local `roam metrics-push` command exists;
  that does not establish a hosted dashboard. Inspect its payload with `--dry-run`.

source code, credentials, or private reports. Availability and written terms
are agreed before work starts.

## FAQ

**Does Roam send any data externally?**
Not during ordinary local analysis. Roam does not automatically upload source code, indexes, findings, telemetry, or analytics, and it performs no automatic update check. On first use, `tree-sitter-language-pack` downloads a checksum-verified parser bundle and keeps it in a local cache. Explicit features can contact PyPI, GitHub, user-selected URLs, Roam Cloud, or Sigstore services; [`docs/network-boundary.md`](docs/network-boundary.md) lists every built-in trigger, destination, and payload class. Inspect `roam metrics-push` with `--dry-run` before sending its allow-listed payload.

**Can Roam run in air-gapped environments?**
Yes, after installation and parser prewarming. Run `roam index --force` once while connected on each target platform; the retained bundle lets later grammar loads complete without network access. Avoid the explicit network triggers in the [network-boundary inventory](docs/network-boundary.md), use fixture/file inputs and offline-key signing, and enforce egress policy around project commands launched by `roam verify` or hooks.

**Does Roam modify my source code?**
Read-only by default. Creates `.roam/` with an index database. `roam mutate` (move/rename/extract) defaults to `--dry-run`; pass `--apply` explicitly to write changes.

**Can I control where and when the index is built?**
Set `ROAM_DB_DIR` to redirect the SQLite database and its `index.lock` / `index.state` sidecars together, or save a per-project location with `roam config --set-db-dir`. Set `ROAM_NO_AUTO_INDEX=1` to refuse implicit builds: an analysis command needing a missing or incomplete index exits `3` and emits a structured refusal in JSON mode. `roam index` and `roam init` still build when explicitly invoked. Use `roam index` if you only want to build the index; `init` intentionally also creates project configuration. The storage override does not redirect agent ledgers, response evidence, or other requested artifacts. Stop older indexers before upgrading or changing store locations; do not run mixed-version writers against one store.

**How does Roam handle monorepos and multi-repo projects?**
Monorepos: indexes from the root; batched SQL handles 100k+ symbols. Multi-repo: `roam ws init <repo1> <repo2>` builds a workspace overlay DB for cross-repo API edges, then `roam ws resolve` / `ws context` / `ws trace` work across repos.

**Is Roam compatible with SonarQube / CodeScene?**
Yes — they coexist in the same CI pipeline. SARIF output uploads to GitHub Code Scanning.

**Does Roam satisfy SOC 2 / ISO 42001 / EU AI Act on its own?**
No. Configured Roam workflows can produce supporting records: `ChangeEvidence`
packets, a run ledger, and audit-trail records. Read which checks and supplied
decisions were captured, and which evidence is missing. These records do not
authenticate who acted or prove complete coverage. Roam does not certify;
framework applicability and assessment need appropriate specialist review.

**What's the difference between the free CLI and Roam Review / Cloud / PR Replay?**
The CLI and MCP tools are free under Apache 2.0; their static checks run locally
without model calls. Your agent's model usage is separate. PR Replay offers a
free local sample and paid reports with founder review, by agreed scope.
Roam Review and Roam Cloud are planned hosted products, not available to
subscribe to. See [pricing and availability](https://roam-code.com/pricing).

## Limitations

- **Static analysis primarily** — can't trace dynamic dispatch, reflection, or eval'd code. Runtime trace ingestion (`roam ingest-trace`) adds production data but requires external trace export.
- **Import resolution is heuristic** — complex re-exports or conditional imports may not resolve.
- **Limited cross-language edges** — Salesforce, Protobuf, REST API, and multi-repo edges are supported, but not arbitrary FFI.
- **Tier 2 languages** get basic symbol extraction only via the generic tree-sitter walker.
- **Large monorepos** (100k+ files) may have slow initial indexing.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `roam: command not found` | Ensure install location is on PATH. For `uv`: `uv tool update-shell` |
| `Another indexing process owns the workspace` | Wait for the active writer and run `roam doctor`. A live or unprovable owner requires investigation; preserve `.roam/index.lock` and the lifecycle marker. Proven abandoned generations are recovered by the indexer. |
| `database is locked` | Finish the active indexer or watcher, close other database writers, and check for cloud-sync interference. Then retry `roam index`; rebuilding does not bypass a live SQLite lock. |
| `ROAM_NO_AUTO_INDEX` refusal (exit 3) | Run `roam index` explicitly after selecting the intended project and store, or unset the opt-out to restore automatic cold-start builds. JSON refusals distinguish missing and incomplete indexes without opening the database. |
| Unicode errors on Windows | `chcp 65001` for UTF-8 |
| Symbol resolves to wrong file | Use `file:symbol` syntax: `roam symbol myfile:MyFunction` |
| Health score seems wrong | `roam health --explain` for score contributions; use `roam --json health` for structured findings. The architectural score is separate from test and environment health. |
| Index stale after `git pull` or a commit | `roam index` refreshes source and Git metadata, including commits with unchanged file contents. Use `roam index --force` to rebuild derived index data. |
