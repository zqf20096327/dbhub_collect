# 1. What is AgriFlow?

AgriFlow is a **microservice-based agricultural technology platform** designed to connect the complete journey of agricultural produce:

```text
Farmer
   ↓
Produce Listing
   ↓
AI Quality Assessment
   ↓
Price & Demand Intelligence
   ↓
Buyer Matching
   ↓
Supply Aggregation
   ↓
Order Creation
   ↓
Logistics Planning
   ↓
Live GPS Tracking
   ↓
Delivery
   ↓
Order Completion
```

Instead of treating farming, marketplace operations, artificial intelligence, and transportation as separate systems, AgriFlow combines them into a single workflow.

The platform is designed around four major questions:

### 1. What should be sold?

AgriFlow analyzes uploaded produce images and evaluates the visible quality of the produce.

### 2. When should it be sold?

The platform provides price and demand forecasting to help users understand possible market movement.

### 3. Who should buy it?

The buyer-matching layer compares available produce with buyer requirements.

### 4. How should it be delivered?

The logistics service plans routes, tracks vehicles, detects deviations, recalculates routes, and provides ETA information.

---

# 2. Problem Statement

Traditional agricultural supply chains often suffer from fragmented information.

| Problem | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Farmers have limited market intelligence | Poor selling decisions |
| Produce quality is difficult to verify remotely | Buyer uncertainty |
| Small farmers have limited quantities | Difficulty fulfilling bulk orders |
| Buyer discovery is fragmented | Lost procurement opportunities |
| Logistics information is disconnected | Poor coordination |
| Delivery tracking is limited | Low transparency |
| Market data is difficult to interpret | Reactive rather than informed decisions |

AgriFlow addresses these problems by connecting the complete process through multiple specialized services.

---

# 3. Solution

AgriFlow separates the system into independent services.

# 4. Key Features

## 👨‍🌾 Farmer Management

Farmers can:

- Create produce listings
- Add crop information
- Add quantity
- Upload produce images
- View quality analysis
- View market intelligence
- Track orders
- Monitor shipments

---

## 🧪 AI-Based Produce Quality Assessment

The AI service accepts produce images and performs visual analysis.

Example:

```text
Input:
    Produce Image

        ↓

AI Vision Model

        ↓

Quality Analysis

        ↓

Structured Response

Grade: A
Score: 87/100
Condition: Good
Defects: Low
```

The response is validated using Pydantic schemas before being returned to the consuming service.

---

## 📈 Price Forecasting

AgriFlow can use a time-series forecasting model to estimate future prices.

Example:

```text
Input price sequence
        ↓
Chronos forecasting model
        ↓
Future prediction
        ↓
7-day forecast
```

The forecasting service is intentionally separated from the core Spring Boot application so that AI/ML components can evolve independently.

---

## 📊 Demand Forecasting

Demand forecasting estimates future demand based on the supplied time-series information.

```text
Historical / supplied observations
             ↓
      Time-series model
             ↓
      Future demand
             ↓
       Forecast result
```

---

## 🤝 Buyer Matching

The matching service evaluates compatibility between:

```text
Produce
 +
Quantity
 +
Quality
 +
Price
 +
Location
        ↓
Buyer Requirements
```

The system can calculate a compatibility score based on relevant criteria.

---

## 📦 Supply Aggregation

A single farmer may not have enough produce to fulfill a bulk requirement.

Example:

```text
Farmer A → 500 kg
Farmer B → 300 kg
Farmer C → 200 kg
-------------------
Total    → 1000 kg
```

AgriFlow can combine compatible lots into an aggregated supply batch.

This allows smaller producers to participate in larger procurement opportunities.

---

# 8. Service Architecture

## 8.1 Spring Boot — Core Business Service

Directory:

```text
FarmFresh_Backend/
```

Spring Boot acts as the **main business backend**.

Responsibilities include:

- Authentication
- JWT processing
- User management
- Farmer management
- Buyer management
- Produce management
- Orders
- Database persistence
- Business rules
- Core application state

Spring Boot communicates with PostgreSQL using:

```text
Spring Boot
    ↓
JPA / Hibernate
    ↓
JDBC
    ↓
PostgreSQL
```

---

# 8.2 FastAPI — AI Intelligence Service

Directory:

```text
agriflow-farm-intelligence-api/
```

The FastAPI service isolates AI functionality from the main business backend.

Responsibilities:

```text
Image
  ↓
Quality Analysis

Time Series
  ↓
Price Forecast

Time Series
  ↓
Demand Forecast

Produce + Buyer Data
  ↓
Matching

Multiple Lots
  ↓
Aggregation
```

This separation provides an important architectural advantage:

> AI models can be changed without rewriting the main business backend.

---

# 8.3 Node.js — Logistics Service

Directory:

```text
logistics-service/
```

The Node.js service is responsible for logistics execution.

Responsibilities:

- Route planning
- Vehicle tracking
- GPS updates
- Distance calculation
- ETA calculation
- Route deviation detection
- Route recalculation
- Shipment state
- Socket.IO communication

The logistics service is separated because logistics has different requirements from normal CRUD/business operations.

---

# 9. Data Flow

A typical produce transaction flows through the system like this:

```text
                    FARMER
                      │
                      ▼

                              │
                              ▼
                        Live Frontend
```

---

# 10. End-to-End Workflow

## Step 1 — Farmer creates a produce listing

The farmer provides:

```text
Crop
Quantity
Harvest information
Location
Produce images
```

The request is sent to the Spring Boot backend.

---

## Step 2 — Produce is stored

Spring Boot validates the request and stores the produce information in PostgreSQL.

```text
Frontend
   ↓
Spring Boot
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
JPA/Hibernate
   ↓
PostgreSQL
```

---

## Step 3 — AI quality analysis

The produce image is sent to the FastAPI intelligence service.

```text
Image
 ↓
FastAPI
 ↓
Hosted Vision Model
 ↓
Quality Analysis
 ↓
Pydantic Validation
 ↓
JSON Response
```

Example:

```json
{
  "grade": "A",
  "score": 87,
  "quality": "Good"
}
```

---

## Step 4 — Market intelligence

Price and demand prediction services process time-series inputs.

```text
Input observations
        ↓
Chronos model
        ↓
Future predictions
```

The resulting information can be displayed to the farmer.

---

## Step 5 — Buyer matching

The system compares available produce with buyer requirements.

Possible factors include:

```text
Crop compatibility
Quantity
Quality
Price
Distance
Buyer requirement
```

The matching service produces compatible buyer candidates.

---

## Step 6 — Supply aggregation

If a buyer needs more produce than a single farmer can provide:

```text
Farmer A → 500 kg
Farmer B → 300 kg
Farmer C → 200 kg
             ↓
         Aggregation
             ↓
         1000 kg batch
```

---

## Step 7 — Order creation

The final order is maintained by the Spring Boot service.

```text
Buyer
 ↓
Order
 ↓
Spring Boot
 ↓
PostgreSQL
```

---

## Step 8 — Logistics planning

Once an order requires delivery, the logistics service calculates a route.

```text
Farm
 ↓
Collection Point
 ↓
Buyer
```

---

## Step 9 — Live tracking

During transportation:

```text
Vehicle GPS
     ↓
Node.js
     ↓
Location Processing
     ↓
Socket.IO
     ↓
Frontend Map
```

The frontend can update without refreshing the page.

---

## Step 10 — Route deviation

The logistics service continuously compares the vehicle's current location with the planned route.

Conceptually:

```text
Current GPS Position
        ↓
Distance from planned route
        ↓
Threshold exceeded?
     /        \
   No          Yes
   ↓            ↓
Continue     Recalculate
route        route
```

---

# 11. AI/ML Architecture

AgriFlow uses specialized models rather than forcing one model to perform every task.

## 11.1 Produce Quality Analysis

The project uses a hosted vision-language model for image-based produce analysis.

Architecture:

```text
Farmer Image
     ↓
Frontend
     ↓
FastAPI
     ↓
Hosted VLM
     ↓
Structured Quality Result
     ↓
Spring Boot / Frontend
```

The advantage of a hosted model is that the application does not need to deploy a large vision model locally.

---

## 11.2 Price Forecasting

AgriFlow uses:

```text
amazon/chronos-bolt-base
```

for time-series forecasting.

Conceptually:

```text
Price observations
       ↓
Chronos
       ↓
Forecast horizon
       ↓
Future price estimates
```

Important:

> A forecasting model does not magically retrieve historical prices from PostgreSQL unless the application actually supplies that data.

The forecasting endpoint requires a time-series input or another configured data source. Therefore, the README should not claim that AgriFlow automatically possesses a large historical market-price database unless such a database is actually implemented.

---

## 11.3 Demand Forecasting

The same class of time-series forecasting approach can be used for demand.

```text
Demand observations
        ↓
Time-series model
        ↓
Future demand
```

The forecast horizon can be configured according to the request.

---

## 11.4 Buyer Matching

Buyer matching is primarily algorithmic rather than requiring a large language model.

Example conceptual scoring:

```text
Compatibility Score =
    Quality Compatibility
  + Quantity Compatibility
  + Price Compatibility
  + Distance Compatibility
```

The exact weights should be treated as implementation details of the matching service.

---

# 12. Redis & Caching Architecture

Redis can be used as a **fast in-memory data layer**, but it should not replace PostgreSQL.

### PostgreSQL

Use PostgreSQL for:

```text
Users
Farmers
Buyers
Produce
Orders
Persistent business state
```

### Redis

Use Redis for data that changes frequently or is expensive to calculate repeatedly.

Examples:

```text
Vehicle latest location
Current shipment status
Live ETA
Temporary route data
API response cache
Session-related temporary state
Rate limiting
Pub/Sub events
```

Architecture:

```text
              ┌──────────────┐
              │ Spring Boot  │
              └──────┬───────┘
                     │
             Persistent Data
                     │
                     ▼
              ┌──────────────┐
              │ PostgreSQL   │
              └──────────────┘


              ┌──────────────┐
              │   Node.js    │
              └──────┬───────┘
                     │
              Fast-changing data
                     │
                     ▼
                ┌─────────┐
                │  Redis  │
                └─────────┘
```

The key principle is:

> **PostgreSQL is the source of truth; Redis is an acceleration/state layer.**

---

# 13. Authentication & Security

AgriFlow uses JWT-based authentication.

Typical authentication flow:

```text
User
 ↓
Login
 ↓
Spring Boot
 ↓
Validate credentials
 ↓

Verify installations:

```bash
git --version
node --version
npm --version
java --version
mvn --version
python3 --version
pip3 --version
psql --version
```

---

# 17. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CreativeArun/AgriFlow.git
cd AgriFlow
```

---

# 18. Local Development Setup

AgriFlow contains multiple independently runnable services.

You can run them separately during development.

---

## 18.1 PostgreSQL

Create the database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE agriflow;
```

Then configure the database credentials in the Spring Boot configuration.

Example:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/agriflow
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=YOUR_PASSWORD
```

Do not commit your actual password.

---

# 18.2 Spring Boot Backend

Move into the backend:

```bash
cd FarmFresh_Backend
```

Run with Maven Wrapper:

### Linux/macOS

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Windows

```powershell
mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

The backend normally runs on:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

---

# 18.3 FastAPI AI Service

Move into:

```bash
cd agriflow-farm-intelligence-api
```

Create a virtual environment:

### Linux/macOS

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Windows

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the service:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

FastAPI:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

Swagger documentation:

```text
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

---

# 18.4 Node.js Logistics Service

Move into:

```bash
cd logistics-service
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The logistics service runs on the configured Node.js port.

---

# 18.5 Frontend

Move into:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will display the local frontend URL in the terminal.

---

# 19. Environment Variables

Environment variables should be configured independently for each service.

---

## Frontend

Example:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
VITE_AI_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
VITE_LOGISTICS_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

Use the actual variable names implemented in the frontend code.

---

## Spring Boot

Example:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/agriflow
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=YOUR_PASSWORD

jwt.secret=YOUR_SECRET

fastapi.base.url=http://localhost:8000
node.logistics.url=http://localhost:5000
```

---

## FastAPI

Example:

```env
HF_TOKEN=YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN
SPRING_BOOT_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

Only include variables that are actually required by the implementation.

---

## Node.js

Example:

```env
PORT=5000
SPRING_BOOT_URL=http://localhost:8080
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
```

Again, use the exact environment variable names expected by the source code.

---

# 20. Running the Complete System

There are two ways to run AgriFlow.

## Option A — Run services independently

Open four terminals.

### Terminal 1 — Spring Boot

```bash
cd FarmFresh_Backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Terminal 2 — FastAPI

```bash
cd agriflow-farm-intelligence-api
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Terminal 3 — Logistics

```bash
cd logistics-service
npm run dev
```

### Terminal 4 — Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

---

## Option B — Startup Scripts

The repository also contains:

```text
start-all.sh
start-all.bat
```

These scripts are intended to simplify starting the multiple services.

### Linux/macOS

```bash
chmod +x start-all.sh
./start-all.sh
```

### Windows

```cmd
start-all.bat
```

If a startup script fails, run the services individually so that the terminal output clearly identifies which service caused the problem.

---

# 21. API Architecture

AgriFlow uses REST APIs for communication between the frontend and backend services.

---

## Authentication

```http
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
```

Authentication flow:

```text
Frontend
   ↓
Spring Boot
   ↓
Credential validation
   ↓
JWT
   ↓
Frontend
```

---

## Produce APIs

Conceptually:

```http
POST   /api/lots
GET    /api/lots
GET    /api/lots/{id}
PUT    /api/lots/{id}
DELETE /api/lots/{id}
```

---

## Order APIs

```http
POST /api/orders
GET  /api/orders
GET  /api/orders/{id}
```

---

## AI APIs

```http
POST /api/quality/analyze
POST /api/prediction/price
POST /api/prediction/demand
POST /api/matching/lots
POST /api/aggregation/create-batch
```

These endpoints are handled by the AI service or routed through the appropriate application layer depending on the implementation.

---

## Logistics APIs

```http
POST /api/logistics/route
POST /api/logistics/recalculate
POST /api/tracking/location
GET  /api/tracking/{shipmentId}
```

The exact endpoint paths should always be considered subordinate to the actual route definitions in the service source code.

---

# 22. Real-Time Communication

The logistics service uses Socket.IO/WebSocket-style communication for live updates.

Example:

```text
Vehicle
   ↓
GPS Location
   ↓
Node.js
   ↓
Process Location
   ↓
Check Route Deviation
   ↓
Calculate ETA
   ↓
Socket.IO Event
   ↓
Frontend
   ↓
Update Map
```

Example events:

```text
shipment:started
vehicle:location
route:updated
shipment:status
shipment:delivered
route:deviation
```

The key benefit is that the browser does not need to repeatedly reload the page to see shipment updates.

---

# 23. Example User Journey

Consider a farmer selling onions.

## Step 1

Farmer creates:

```text
Crop: Onion
Quantity: 500 kg
Location: Farmer's location
Image: onion.jpg
```

---

## Step 2

Image is sent to AI:

```text
onion.jpg
    ↓
Vision Model
    ↓
Quality Score
    ↓
Grade
```

---

## Step 3

Market intelligence is generated:

```text
Price Forecast
+
Demand Forecast
```

---

## Step 4

Buyer matching identifies compatible buyers.

```text
Farmer's Onion
       ↓
Buyer Requirements
       ↓
Compatibility Calculation
       ↓
Potential Buyers
```

---

## Step 5

Suppose the buyer requires 1000 kg.

```text
Farmer A → 500 kg
Farmer B → 300 kg
Farmer C → 200 kg
```

Aggregation produces:

```text
1000 kg
```

---

## Step 6

An order is created.

```text
Buyer
 ↓
Order
 ↓
Spring Boot
 ↓
PostgreSQL
```

---

## Step 7

Logistics service generates a route.

```text
Farm
 ↓
Collection Centre
 ↓
Buyer
```

---

## Step 8

Vehicle begins transportation.

```text
GPS → Node.js → Socket.IO → Frontend
```

---

## Step 9

If the vehicle deviates from the route:

```text
GPS Position
      ↓
Deviation Check
      ↓
Threshold exceeded
      ↓
Recalculate route
      ↓
Broadcast update
      ↓
Frontend updates map
```

---

# 24. Deployment Architecture

A production deployment can separate each service.

```text
                         INTERNET
                            │
                            ▼
                     ┌─────────────┐
                     │   Frontend  │
                     │   Vercel    │
                     └──────┬──────┘
                            │
              ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
              │             │             │
              ▼             ▼             ▼
        Spring Boot      FastAPI       Node.js
          Backend        AI Service    Logistics
              │             │             │
              ▼             │             ▼
         PostgreSQL         │          Redis
                            │
                            ▼
                     Hosted AI Models
```

The deployed frontend is currently associated with:

```text
https://agri-flow-kappa.vercel.app/
```

The production URLs for the individual backend services should be configured through environment variables rather than hard-coded into the frontend.

---

# 25. Testing

Each service should be tested independently before testing the complete workflow.

## Spring Boot

Run:

```bash
./mvnw test
```

---

## FastAPI

Run:

```bash
pytest
```

If the project contains service-specific test scripts, execute them from the FastAPI service directory.

---

## Node.js

Check the available scripts:

```bash
npm run
```

Then execute the project's configured test command.

---

## API Testing

Useful tools include:

```text
Postman
curl
Swagger / OpenAPI
Browser DevTools
```

FastAPI provides interactive API documentation at:

```text
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

when the development server is running.

---

# 26. Troubleshooting

## PostgreSQL connection failed

Check:

```bash
sudo systemctl status postgresql
```

Then verify:

```text
Database name
Username
Password
Port
Host
```

Default PostgreSQL port:

```text
5432
```

---

## Spring Boot cannot connect to database

Check the datasource configuration:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/agriflow
```

Also verify that PostgreSQL is running.

---

## FastAPI cannot start

Check:

```bash
python3 --version
pip --version
```

Then reinstall dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## `uvicorn: command not found`

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then:

```bash
pip install uvicorn
```

---

## Node.js dependencies fail

Remove existing dependencies:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
```

Then:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## Frontend cannot reach backend

Check:

```text
Frontend API URL
Spring Boot port
FastAPI port
Node.js port
CORS configuration
```

Use browser DevTools:

```text
F12
→ Network
→ Failed Request
→ Request URL
→ Response
```

---

## Produce appears in farmer dashboard but not buyer dashboard

Check the complete data path:

```text
Database
   ↓
Spring Boot API
   ↓
Buyer API
   ↓
Frontend service
   ↓
Buyer component
```

The most common causes are:

1. Different API endpoints being used by farmer and buyer pages.
2. Incorrect authenticated user/role filtering.
3. CORS configuration.
4. Frontend environment variable pointing to the wrong backend.
5. Backend returning an empty filtered result.
6. Deployed frontend calling a local backend URL.
7. Database used by local and production environments being different.

---

# 27. Design Decisions

## Why Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is responsible for the core transactional/business layer.

It is well suited for:

```text
Authentication
CRUD
Transactions
Business rules
Database operations
```

---

## Why FastAPI?

AI workloads are implemented in Python.

FastAPI provides:

```text
Python ecosystem
+
Fast REST APIs
+
Pydantic validation
+
Easy model integration
```

This allows the AI system to remain independent from the Java backend.

---

## Why Node.js?

Logistics involves:

```text
Frequent updates
GPS events
WebSockets
Real-time communication
I/O-heavy operations
```

Node.js is therefore separated as the logistics and real-time service.

---

## Why PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is the primary persistent relational database.

It is suitable for:

```text
Users
Relationships
Orders
Produce
Transactions
Business state
```

---

## Why Redis?

Redis is useful for:

```text
Fast-changing state
Caching
Temporary data
Real-time logistics state
Pub/Sub
Rate limiting
```

It should complement PostgreSQL rather than replace it.

---

## Why Microservices?

The system has clearly different workloads:

```text
Business Transactions → Java
AI/ML → Python
Real-Time Logistics → Node.js
Frontend → React
```

Separating these workloads makes it easier to:

- Develop independently
- Deploy independently
- Scale independently
- Replace individual technologies
- Isolate failures
- Maintain clearer service boundaries

---

# 28. Failure Scenarios

A production system should consider partial failures.

## AI service unavailable

The core marketplace should not necessarily become completely unavailable.

Possible architecture:

```text
Spring Boot
     ↓
AI Service unavailable
     ↓
Return graceful fallback
     ↓
Core marketplace remains accessible
```

---

## Redis unavailable

Redis should generally be treated as an optimization/state layer.

Persistent business data should remain in PostgreSQL.

---

## Logistics service unavailable

The marketplace can continue operating while live tracking is temporarily unavailable.

This is one advantage of separating logistics from the core business service.

---

## External AI provider unavailable

The AI service should return a controlled error instead of crashing the entire platform.

---

# 29. Scalability

AgriFlow can scale services independently.

For example:

```text
              High AI Traffic
                    ↓
              Scale FastAPI
              × × × × ×


              High Order Traffic
                    ↓
             Scale Spring Boot
                 × × ×


              High GPS Traffic
                    ↓
              Scale Node.js
              × × × × ×
```

This is one of the primary benefits of the service-oriented architecture.
