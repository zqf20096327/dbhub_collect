# Data Compare Made Simple

**pgCompare** is a Java-based tool for validating data consistency after replication or migration between databases. It's designed for scenarios like:


- **Data migration from Oracle/DB2/MariaDB/MySQL/MSSQL to Postgres:**  Compare data during or post-migration.

- **Logical replication between same or different database platforms:** Validate data across platforms while minimizing database overhead.

- **Active-Active replication configuration:**  Regularly verify data consistency to mitigate risks.

pgCompare uses hashing to compare table data efficiently. Hash values for primary keys and remaining columns are stored in a repository, reducing storage and network demands. Comparisons are processed in parallel, improving performance.

This open-source project is maintained under the **Apache 2.0 License** and is made available for broader use, testing, and feedback.

# Features

- Supports Oracle, PostgreSQL, DB2, MariaDB, MySQL, MSSQL, and Snowflake.
- Efficient parallel comparisons using hashing.
- Handles batch processing for performance tuning.
- Stores configurations for multiple comparison projects in a central repository.

# Installation

## Requirements

Before initiating the build and installation process, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Java** 21 or later.
2. **Maven** 3.9 or later.
3. **Postgres** 15 or later (for the repository).
4. Supported JDBC drivers (Snowflake, DB2, Postgres, MySQL, MSSQL and Oracle currently supported).
5. Direct Postgres connections (e.g., no pgBouncer).

## Limitations

- Date and timestamp values are compared to the second (format: `MMDDYYYYHH24MISS`).
- Unsupported data types include platform-specific large objects and special-purpose types that cannot be normalized reliably across systems.
- Cross-platform boolean comparisons may require validation because databases render boolean values differently.
- Low-precision numeric types (`float`, `real`) should not be compared directly to higher-precision types (`double`, `numeric`) unless a mapping expression normalizes both sides.
- Low-precision numeric types are cast using `float-scale` (default: 3; Snowflake default: 1). If a higher scale is required, use a map-expression override.
- Different databases can render floating-point values differently. Use `number-cast` and mapping expressions if float columns produce false differences.

# Getting Started

> **Note:** The `main` branch contains active development and may be unstable. For production use, we recommend checking out a stable release tag (for example, `git checkout v0.7.0`). See [Releases](https://github.com/CrunchyData/pgCompare/releases) for available versions.

## 1. Fork the repository

## 2. Clone and Build

```shell
git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:<your-github-username>/pgCompare.git
cd pgCompare
git checkout v0.7.0  # Optional: checkout a stable release
mvn clean install
```

## 3. Configure Properties

Copy `pgcompare.properties.sample` to `pgcompare.properties` and update the connection parameters for your repository, source, and target databases.
By default, the application looks for the properties file in the execution directory. Use `PGCOMPARE_CONFIG` environment variable to specify a custom properties file location.

At minimum, the `repo-*` parameters must be provided in the properties file or through environment variables. Source and target settings can also be stored in the repository in `dc_project.project_config` as JSON (for example, `{"parameter": "value"}`). Certain system parameters, such as `log-destination`, must be specified in the properties file or environment variables.

You can also import/export configuration using the CLI:
```shell
# Export project configuration to properties file
java -jar pgcompare.jar export-config -p 1 --file project-config.properties

# Import properties file to project configuration  
java -jar pgcompare.jar import-config -p 1 --file my-config.properties
```

## 4. Initialize Repository

Run the script or use the command below to set up the PostgreSQL repository:

```shell
java -jar pgcompare.jar init
```

## 5. Discover Tables

Discover and map tables in specified schemas:

```shell
java -jar pgcompare.jar discover
```

# Usage

## Command Line

```shell
java -jar pgcompare.jar <action> <options>
```

Actions:
- **check**:  Recompare the out of sync rows from previous compare
- **compare**:  Perform database compare
- **copy-table**: Copy pgCompare metadata for table.  Must specify table alias to copy using --table option
- **discover**:  Discover tables and columns
- **export-config**: Export project configuration to properties file
- **export-mapping**: Export table/column mappings to YAML file
- **import-config**: Import properties file to project configuration
- **import-mapping**: Import table/column mappings from YAML file
- **init**: Initialize the repository database
- **server**: Run in server mode (daemon that polls work queue for jobs)
- **test-connection**: Test database connections and report status

Options:

   -b|--batch {batch nbr}

   -o|--file {path} File for export/import operations

   --overwrite Overwrite existing mappings during import

   -p|--project Project ID

   -r|--report {file} Create html report of compare

   -t|--table {target table} (supports wildcards for export/import)

   -n|--name {server name} Server name for server mode (default: pgcompare-server)

   --help

## Define Table Mapping

1. Automatic Discovery

    Discover and map tables in specified schemas:

    ```shell
    java -jar pgcompare.jar discover
    ```

2. Manual Registration 

    Insert mappings into `dc_table`, `dc_table_map`, `dc_table_column`, and `dc_table_column_map` tables in the repository.

## Run Data Comparison

```shell
java -jar pgcompare.jar compare --batch 0
```

Batch 0 processes all data. Use `PGCOMPARE-BATCH` or specify the batch number using the `--batch` argument to specify a batch number.

## Recheck Discrepancies

Revalidate flagged rows:

```shell
java -jar pgcompare.jar check --batch 0
```

# Upgrading

## Version 0.7.0 Enhancements

- **SQL Server Binary Support** - SQL Server `binary`, `varbinary`, and `rowversion` columns are normalized using `HASHBYTES('MD5', ...)` instead of falling through to PostgreSQL-specific `md5()` syntax.
- **SQL Server Locale-Safe Number Casting** - SQL Server numeric casts now pin the `en-US` culture for `FORMAT()` so non-English sessions do not produce false differences due to comma decimal separators.
- **Check-Mode Delete Convergence** - `check` now treats rows absent from both source and target as converged and clears the stale finding.
- **Dependency Updates** - Snowflake, SQL Server, DB2, PostgreSQL, and JSON dependencies were refreshed for the 0.7.0 release.

**Note:** No repository schema changes are required to upgrade from 0.6.0 to 0.7.0.

# Advanced Configuration

## Properties

Define properties via a file, environment variables, or the `dc_project` table. Environment variables override file settings and must be prefixed with `PGCOMPARE_`.

Examples:
- File: `batch-fetch-size=2000`
- Env: `PGCOMPARE_BATCH_FETCH_SIZE=2000`

## Tuning Performance

- **Batch size:** Adjust `batch-fetch-size` and `batch-commit-size` for memory efficiency.
- **Threads:** Use loader-threads (default: 4) for parallel processing.
- **Observer throttle:** Enable to prevent overloading temporary tables (observer-throttle=true).
- **Java Heap Size:** For larger datasets, there may be a need to increase the Java Heap size.  Use the options `-Xms` and `-Xmx` when executing pgCompare (`java -Xms512m -Xmx2g -jar pgcompare.jar`). 

## Repository Recommendations

- Minimal requirements: 2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM.
- PostgreSQL settings:
  - shared_buffers=2048MB
  - work_mem=256MB
  - max_parallel_workers=16

## Projects

Projects allow for the repository to maintain different mappings for different compare objectives.  This allows a central pgCompare repository to be used for multiple compare projects.  Each table has a `pid` column which is the project id.  If no project is specified, the default project (pid = 1) is used.

> **Note:** Project 1 (pid=1) is reserved as the default project and is created automatically during repository initialization. Do not delete or reassign this project.

# Viewing Results

## Summary from Last Run

```sql
WITH mr AS (SELECT max(rid) rid FROM dc_result)
SELECT compare_start, table_name, status, equal_cnt+not_equal_cnt+missing_source_cnt+missing_target_cnt  AS total_cnt,
       equal_cnt, not_equal_cnt, missing_source_cnt + missing_target_cnt AS missing_cnt
FROM dc_result r
         JOIN mr ON (mr.rid = r.rid)
ORDER BY table_name;
```

## Out-of-Sync Rows

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(s.table_name, t.table_name) AS table_name,
       CASE
           WHEN s.compare_result = 'n' THEN 'out-of-sync'
           WHEN s.compare_result = 'm' THEN 'missing target'
           WHEN t.compare_result = 'm' THEN 'missing source'
           END AS compare_result,
       COALESCE(s.pk, t.pk) AS primary_key
FROM dc_source s
         FULL OUTER JOIN dc_target t ON s.pk = t.pk and s.tid=t.tid;
```

# Reference

## Properties

Properties are categorized into four sections: system, repository, source, and target. Each section has specific properties, as described in detail in the documentation.  The properties can be specified via a configuration file, environment variables or a combination of both.  To use environment variables, the environment variable will be the name of the property in upper case with dashes '-' converted to underscore '_' and prefixed with PGCOMPARE_.  For example, batch-fetch-size can be set by using the environment variable PGCOMPARE_BATCH_FETCH_SIZE.

### System

#### batch-fetch-size

  Sets the fetch size for retrieving rows from the source or target database.

  Default:  2000

#### batch-commit-size

  Default: 2000

#### batch-progress-report-size

  Defines the number of rows used in mod to report progress.

  Default: 100000000

#### column-hash-method

  Determines how the hash is performed.  Valid values are `database` and `hybrid`.  When set to `database` the column value hash is performed on the source/target database.  For `hybrid` the hash is performed by the pgCompare thread.

  Default:  database

#### database-sort

  Default: true

#### float-scale

  Set the preferred scale used to cast low precision numbers.

  Default: 3

#### job-logging-enabled

  When set to true, log messages are written to the `dc_job_log` table in addition to the standard log destination. This enables viewing job logs through the pgCompare UI. The job must have an associated job ID (either from server mode or standalone job tracking).

  Default: false

#### loader-threads

  Sets the number of threads to load data into the temporary tables. Set to 0 to disable loader threads.

  Default: 0

#### log-level
  
  Level to determine the amount of log messages written to the log destination.

  Default: INFO

#### log-destination

  Location where log messages will be written.

  Default:  stdout

#### message-queue-size

  Size of message queue used by loader threads (number of messages).
  
  Default: 1000

#### number-cast

  Defines how numbers are cast for hash function (notation|standard).  Valid values are `notation` for scientific notation and `standard` for standard number casting.
  
  Default: notation

#### observer-throttle

  Set to true or false, instructs the loader threads to pause and wait for the observer thread to catch up before continuing to load more data into the staging tables.

  Default: true

#### observer-throttle-size

  Number of rows loaded before the loader thread will sleep and wait for clearance from the observer thread.

  Default: 2000000

#### observer-vacuum

  Set to true or false, instructs the observer whether to perform a vacuum on the staging tables during checkpoints.

  Default: true

#### stage-table-parallel

  Default parallel degree to set on staging table.

  Default: 0
