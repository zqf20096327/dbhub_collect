## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and Docker Compose
- 2GB RAM minimum (4GB recommended)
- 10GB disk space for data storage

### Option A: Docker Hub (Fastest)

Pre-built images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/elgon2003/family-vault):

```bash
# Download the compose file and env template
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEADSEC-SECURITY/family-vault/master/docker-compose.yml
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEADSEC-SECURITY/family-vault/master/.env.example
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set SECRET_KEY (run: openssl rand -hex 32)
# Optionally set API_URL if the backend isn't on localhost
docker-compose up -d
```

The frontend image supports runtime API URL configuration via the `API_URL` environment variable. Set it in `.env` to point to your backend (e.g., `API_URL=http://192.168.1.10:8000/api` for a NAS deployment).

### Option B: Build from Source

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DEADSEC-SECURITY/family-vault.git
   cd family-vault
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and change SECRET_KEY and any other settings
   ```

3. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

4. **Access Family Vault**
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Register a new account (first user becomes the organization owner)

That's it! Your Family Vault is now running locally.

## Architecture

Family Vault consists of four main services:

- **Frontend** - Next.js 16 with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend** - Python FastAPI with SQLAlchemy 2.0
- **Database** - PostgreSQL 17
- **File Storage** - MinIO (S3-compatible object storage)

All services run in Docker containers and can be easily deployed together or scaled independently.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| Frontend Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) |
| UI Components | shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS |
| Backend API | Python FastAPI |
| Database | PostgreSQL 17 |
| ORM | SQLAlchemy 2.0 |
| Migrations | Alembic |
| File Storage | MinIO (S3-compatible) |
| Authentication | Zero-knowledge (PBKDF2 + bcrypt) |
| Encryption | Client-side AES-256-GCM + RSA-OAEP key wrapping |
| Email | SMTP (optional, for reminders) |

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and customize:

```bash
# Database
POSTGRES_DB=familyvault
POSTGRES_USER=familyvault
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=change_me_in_production

# MinIO (S3)
S3_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
S3_SECRET_KEY=change_me_in_production
S3_BUCKET=familyvault

# Backend
SECRET_KEY=change_me_to_a_long_random_string
CORS_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:3000"]

# Optional: Email for reminder notifications
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
SMTP_FROM=noreply@familyvault.local
```

### Using External Services

Family Vault can use external PostgreSQL and S3-compatible storage:

```bash
# Use external PostgreSQL
POSTGRES_HOST=mydb.example.com
POSTGRES_PORT=5432

# Use AWS S3 instead of MinIO
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=https://s3.amazonaws.com
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_access_key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
S3_REGION=us-east-1
```

Then remove the `postgres` and `minio` services from `docker-compose.yml`.

## Security

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture

Family Vault is designed so the server **never** sees your plaintext data. All encryption and decryption happens client-side in the browser using the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API). A fully compromised server — database dump, file storage, and application code — reveals nothing but encrypted blobs.

### Key Hierarchy

```
Master Password
│
├─► PBKDF2 (600,000 iterations, salt = email)
│   └─► Master Key (256-bit)
│       ├─► HKDF ("enc") ──► Symmetric Key ── encrypts your RSA private key
│       ├─► HKDF ("mac") ──► MAC Key (reserved for future integrity checks)
│       └─► PBKDF2 (1 iteration) ──► Master Password Hash ── sent to server
│
├─► Per-User RSA-OAEP 2048-bit Keypair
│   ├─► Public key: stored plaintext on server
│   └─► Private key: AES-256-GCM encrypted with Symmetric Key, stored on server
│
└─► Organization Key (AES-256-GCM, 256-bit)
    └─► Wrapped per-member with their RSA public key ── stored in org_member_keys
```

**What the server stores**: encrypted private keys, public keys, encrypted org keys, and encrypted data blobs. **What the server never sees**: your master password, master key, symmetric key, plaintext private key, plaintext org key, or any plaintext item/file data.

### How Data Is Protected

| Data | Encryption | Where |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Item fields (names, IDs, policy numbers) | AES-256-GCM with org key | Encrypted in browser, ciphertext stored in DB |
| File attachments (card images, documents) | AES-256-GCM with org key (unique IV per file) | Encrypted in browser, ciphertext stored in MinIO |
| User's RSA private key | AES-256-GCM with user's symmetric key | Encrypted blob stored in DB |
| Org key (per member) | RSA-OAEP wrapped with member's public key | Wrapped blob stored in DB |
| Master password | PBKDF2 → hash-of-hash → bcrypt | Only bcrypt hash stored in DB |

### Multi-User Key Sharing

When a new member joins an organization:

1. New member generates their RSA keypair on registration
2. An existing member fetches the new member's public key
3. Existing member unwraps the org key with their own private key, then re-wraps it with the new member's public key
4. The newly wrapped org key is stored — the new member can now decrypt all org data

No plaintext keys ever transit the server during this ceremony.

### Authentication Flow

```
Browser                                          Server
  │                                                 │
  ├─ GET /prelogin?email=...  ─────────────────────►│
  │◄──────────────────── { kdf_iterations: 600000 } │
  │                                                 │
  │  derive masterKey = PBKDF2(password, email)     │
  │  derive masterPasswordHash = PBKDF2(masterKey)  │
  │                                                 │
  ├─ POST /login { masterPasswordHash } ───────────►│
  │                                       bcrypt ── │ ── verify
  │◄──── { token, encrypted_private_key, pub_key }  │
  │                                                 │
  │  decrypt private key with symmetric key         │
  │  unwrap org key with private key                │
  │  store keys in memory only (never to disk)      │
  │                                                 │
  ├─ GET /items (Authorization: Bearer token) ─────►│
  │◄──────────────────────── { encrypted fields }   │
  │  decrypt fields in browser with org key         │
```

- The server only receives a **hash-of-hash** — never your password or master key
- Password verification uses **bcrypt** on the master password hash
- Session tokens are **opaque 256-bit random values**, expiring after 72 hours
- Keys are held **in memory only** — closing the browser tab wipes them

### Recovery Key

On registration, a 24-word recovery key is generated and shown once. This key independently encrypts a copy of your RSA private key. If you forget your master password, the recovery key can restore access to your data. **Store it offline** — if both are lost, your data is unrecoverable by design.

### Best Practices

1. **Change the SECRET_KEY** - Use a long random string (`openssl rand -hex 32`)
2. **Use strong passwords** - The master password protects all your data
3. **Save your recovery key** - Write it down and store it physically; it cannot be regenerated
4. **Enable HTTPS** - Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) with SSL certificates
5. **Regular backups** - Back up PostgreSQL database and MinIO data regularly
6. **Keep updated** - Pull the latest Docker images regularly for security patches
