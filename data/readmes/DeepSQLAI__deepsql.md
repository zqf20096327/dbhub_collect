# DeepSQL

![DeepSQL CLI showing suggested DBA, BI and Guardian prompts, connected databases, and brain initialization progress](docs/assets/deepsql-cli.png)

**The database agent for Postgres and MySQL.** Point it at PostgreSQL or MySQL and ask
questions in plain English — schema exploration, query generation, slow query analysis,
index recommendations, generated dashboards.

**You bring the model.** DeepSQL ships with no model provider of its own and no vendor
account to sign up for. You point it at OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, a LiteLLM proxy, or a model
running on your own hardware, and it uses that. Everything else runs in your environment:
database credentials are encrypted in a local vault, and nothing leaves the machines you
control except the prompts you send to the endpoint you chose.

📄 **[Read the whitepaper](https://deepsql.ai/whitepaper)** — the architecture and the
reasoning behind it.

📦 **Latest release: [v1.3.0](https://github.com/DeepSQLAI/deepsql/releases/tag/v1.3.0)** —
DeepSQL Desktop first ship + Agent/Brain/Editor hardening. Notes:
[`docs/releases/RELEASE_NOTES-v1.3.0.md`](docs/releases/RELEASE_NOTES-v1.3.0.md).

## Quick start

### One-liner install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deepsql.ai/install.sh | bash
```

This checks prerequisites, clones the latest release to `~/deepsql`, and guides you
through configuration. See [`scripts/self-host/remote-install.sh`](scripts/self-host/remote-install.sh)
for options (`--yes` for noninteractive, `--branch` for a specific version).

> The script source of truth is [`scripts/self-host/remote-install.sh`](scripts/self-host/remote-install.sh)
> in this repository. `deepsql.ai/install.sh` serves a copy for the homepage CTA.

### Step-by-step

Five steps, in order. Budget about fifteen minutes, most of it waiting on the first build.

### 1. Check you have what you need

- **Docker Engine** with Compose v2 **and buildx** — verify with `docker compose version`
  and `docker buildx version`. Compose delegates builds to buildx and refuses anything
  older than 0.17.0.
- **`git`**, **`curl`** and **`openssl`**
- **~4 GB of memory available to Docker.** The backend JVM is configured with a 3 GB max
  heap, so a smaller allocation fails in ways that look unrelated.
- **An API key for a model provider.** See step 3 — you need this before you start, not
  after.

**On a fresh server, one command does all of that:**

```bash
sudo ./scripts/self-host/bootstrap-server.sh
```

It handles Debian/Ubuntu and Amazon Linux 2023 / RHEL, installs whatever is missing, and
verifies the result before exiting. Worth running even where Docker is already present: a
stock `dnf install docker` on Amazon Linux 2023 ships **neither** the Compose plugin
**nor** a buildx new enough to build, and the resulting failure surfaces much later, at
`docker compose up --build`, naming neither.

### 2. Get the code

There are no prebuilt images and no container registry. Compose builds the backend and
frontend from your checkout.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeepSQLAI/deepsql.git
cd deepsql
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Choose your model

This is the step that matters, and the one thing DeepSQL cannot decide for you.

Open `.env` and set the chat group. Whatever you pick, the provider id stays `openai` —
there is one provider implementation and it speaks OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and every
OpenAI-compatible server. It dispatches on the **shape of your endpoint**, not on a name
you configure.

| Variable | What to put in it |
|---|---|
| `DEEPSQL_CHAT_PROVIDER` | `openai` — always, for every provider below |
| `DEEPSQL_CHAT_API_KEY` | Your key. For a local model, any non-empty string. |
| `DEEPSQL_CHAT_ENDPOINT` | The base URL. **No working default — set it explicitly.** |
| `DEEPSQL_CHAT_MODEL` | Model name, or your Azure *deployment* name |

Pick the one that matches you:

<details open>
<summary><b>OpenAI</b></summary>

```env
DEEPSQL_CHAT_PROVIDER=openai
DEEPSQL_CHAT_API_KEY=sk-your-key
DEEPSQL_CHAT_ENDPOINT=https://api.openai.com/v1
DEEPSQL_CHAT_MODEL=gpt-4o
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Azure OpenAI</b></summary>

An `.azure.com` or `.azure-api.net` endpoint switches authentication to the `api-key`
header automatically. `_MODEL` is your **deployment** name, not the model name.

```env
DEEPSQL_CHAT_PROVIDER=openai
DEEPSQL_CHAT_API_KEY=your-azure-openai-key
DEEPSQL_CHAT_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/
DEEPSQL_CHAT_MODEL=your-deployment-name
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Anthropic</b></summary>

Anthropic serves an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`, so it needs no gateway. It
publishes no embeddings API, so pair it with another provider for embeddings (step 4).

```env
DEEPSQL_CHAT_PROVIDER=openai
DEEPSQL_CHAT_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key
DEEPSQL_CHAT_ENDPOINT=https://api.anthropic.com/v1
DEEPSQL_CHAT_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, TGI — your own hardware</b></summary>

Anything speaking the OpenAI wire format. No key is required, but the variable must be
non-empty.

```env
DEEPSQL_CHAT_PROVIDER=openai
DEEPSQL_CHAT_API_KEY=ollama
DEEPSQL_CHAT_ENDPOINT=http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1
DEEPSQL_CHAT_MODEL=llama3.1
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>LiteLLM proxy</b></summary>

Point at the proxy, authenticate with a virtual key, use your own alias. Chat, embeddings
and brain initialisation are verified end to end against a self-hosted LiteLLM.

```env
DEEPSQL_CHAT_PROVIDER=openai
DEEPSQL_CHAT_API_KEY=sk-your-litellm-virtual-key
DEEPSQL_CHAT_ENDPOINT=http://litellm:4000/v1
DEEPSQL_CHAT_MODEL=your-alias
```

**Name your alias carefully.** `_USE_RESPONSES_API` defaults to `auto`, which decides from
the **model name** rather than from what your endpoint implements. An alias beginning
`gpt-5`, `o1`, `o3`, `o4` or `codex` selects the Responses API. If your gateway does not
serve `/v1/responses`, avoid those prefixes or set `DEEPSQL_CHAT_USE_RESPONSES_API=false`.
</details>

> `DEEPSQL_CHAT_PROVIDER` gates the whole group: with it unset, **no other `DEEPSQL_CHAT_*`
> variable is read**. That is the most common reason a carefully filled-in `.env` appears to
> be ignored.

### 4. Add embeddings (recommended)

Configured independently of chat, so they can point at a different provider, key or
endpoint — which is exactly what you need when your chat model has no embeddings API.

```env
DEEPSQL_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai
DEEPSQL_EMBEDDING_API_KEY=sk-your-key
DEEPSQL_EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT=https://api.openai.com/v1
DEEPSQL_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-large
```

Skipping this is survivable — the app starts and retrieval falls back to keyword-only — but
answer quality drops noticeably, so treat it as part of setup rather than an extra.

**Your embedding model must produce 3072-dimension vectors.** `rag_documents.embedding` is a
single `vector(3072)` column shared by every connection, so `text-embedding-3-small` (1536)
is rejected. Changing width means migrating the column.

### 5. Install and log in

```bash
./scripts/self-host/install.sh
```

The installer generates your JWT secret, the credential-vault encryption key, the vault
DB password, and the DeepSQL Agent provision secret; prompts for the first admin account;
builds the backend, frontend, and DeepSQL Agent images; starts the stack; and verifies
pgvector is live. The **Agent** tab and AI dashboard generation are served by the
`deepsql-agent` Compose service — no host-side agent install is required.

**The first build takes several minutes** — it compiles the Spring Boot backend with Maven
inside the container, bundles the frontend with Vite, and builds the DeepSQL Agent image.
It has not hung. Later builds reuse the Docker layer cache.

Then open **http://localhost:3000** and log in with the admin email and password you entered.

> **Back up `ENCRYPTION_KEY` from `.env` now.** It encrypts every database credential you
> store. Lose it and you re-enter all of them — there is no recovery path.

---

<details>
<summary><b>Prefer to drive Compose yourself?</b></summary>

`.env.example` ships two values empty on purpose — they are validated secrets, not free
text, and the backend refuses to start without them.

```bash
printf 'SECURITY_JWT_SECRET=%s\n' "$(openssl rand -base64 64 | tr -d '\n')" >> .env
printf 'ENCRYPTION_KEY=%s\n'      "$(openssl rand -base64 32)"             >> .env

docker compose up -d --build
```

That builds and starts everything but leaves you unable to log in: there is no seeded
account, self-service signup is disabled, and the wizard's `POST /setup/initialize` is
disabled. The first user is created through a **localhost-only bootstrap endpoint** — set
`SECURITY_ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_ENABLED=true` and `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET` in `.env` and call it
yourself. `install.sh` does exactly this, then turns the flag back off.

## What it does

Your 24/7 DBA and data engineer. It answers BI questions, fixes slow queries, and watches
your schema — all from one shared brain.

- **Answers BI questions.** Ask in plain English. The agent loads your business context,
  resolves the schema, drafts and validates SQL, then executes it read-only — with every
  step you can inspect. The hand-written SQL editor is the only path that can mutate, and
  only for a confirming admin.
- **Fixes slow queries.** Reads `pg_stat_statements` or the MySQL slow log, groups queries
  by fingerprint, ranks them by cost, and flags regressions against their baseline.
- **Index recommendations.** Advises, and can apply them for you — `CREATE INDEX
  CONCURRENTLY` on PostgreSQL, so no table lock.
- **Watches your schema.** Tracks what changed and what needs attention, so drift surfaces
  before it breaks a query or a dashboard.
- **A brain that knows your business.** Teach it your metrics, rules and conventions once —
  MRR, active accounts, currency handling — and every query, dashboard and recommendation
  uses the same governed definitions.
- **Dashboards without the analyst backlog.** An agent writes a single self-contained HTML
  document, rendered in a sandboxed iframe with no network access. It reads data only
  through a read-only query bridge back to the backend — the agent gets creative freedom,
  the database keeps its guard rail.
- **Ask it from anywhere.** The web UI, your terminal, or a Slack channel. The MCP server
  gives coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Claude Desktop) the same capabilities
  over stdio.
- **Postgres and MySQL, in your infra.** One dialect registry, read-only execution, and SSH
  tunnelling to reach databases behind a bastion.

### DeepSQL Desktop (optional)

A thin Electron client for a self-hosted VM — direct TLS or an in-process SSH tunnel —
without bundling a second copy of the web UI.

**Download installers** (macOS, Windows, Linux) from the public page at `/download` on
your DeepSQL instance, or browse
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/DeepSQLAI/deepsql/releases) for `desktop-v*` tags.

To build from source (separate npm project):

```bash
cd desktop
npm install
npm start
```

Requires **Node 22+**. Forward the tunnel to the **frontend container (port 3000)**, not a
host reverse proxy on `:80`. Keep loopback CORS wildcards on the VM
(`http://127.0.0.1:*,http://localhost:*`) or tunnel login fails with a confusing 403 — see
[`desktop/README.md`](desktop/README.md).

## Operating the stack

```bash
./scripts/self-host/status.sh                    # compose ps + health probes
./scripts/self-host/smoke-test.sh                # end-to-end check against the vault DB
./scripts/self-host/seed-demo-data.sh            # seed demo e-commerce database for exploration
./scripts/self-host/uninstall.sh                 # stop and remove containers, keep data
./scripts/self-host/uninstall.sh --purge-data    # also drop the volumes
```

### Demo Database

To explore DeepSQL features without connecting your own database, run:

```bash
./scripts/self-host/seed-demo-data.sh
```

This creates a **demo_shop** e-commerce database with:
- 100 products, 500 customers, 5,000+ orders
- Intentionally suboptimal query patterns (to trigger recommendations)
- Pre-configured slow query analysis and index recommendations
- Sample saved queries in the SQL Editor
- Sample agent conversation history

Alternatively, set `DEEPSQL_SEED_DEMO_DATA=1` in `.env` before running `install.sh` to seed automatically.

Upgrading:

```bash
git pull && docker compose up -d --build
```

### Accessing a remote self-hosted instance (SSH tunnel)

If DeepSQL runs on a server you only reach through a bastion/jump host — common in
locked-down cloud environments — forward the frontend port locally instead of exposing
it to the internet.

**Direct bastion, one hop:**

```bash
ssh -N -L 3100:localhost:3000 -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes <user>@<bastion-host>
```

**Target host is itself only reachable from inside the bastion's network (two hops):**
add a `Host` entry per leg in `~/.ssh/config` and let `ProxyJump` chain them — no
manual double-hop command needed.

```sshconfig
Host my-bastion
    HostName <bastion-ip-or-dns>
    User <bastion-user>
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<bastion-key>

Host deepsql
    HostName <target-host-ip-or-dns>
    Port <target-ssh-port>
    User <target-user>
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<target-key>
    ProxyJump my-bastion
    LocalForward 3100 localhost:3000
    ServerAliveInterval 30
    ExitOnForwardFailure yes
```

```bash
ssh -N deepsql
```

Then open **http://localhost:3100**. Use a non-3000 local port if something on your
machine (often a local Docker container) already binds 3000 — `ExitOnForwardFailure=yes`
makes a port collision fail loudly instead of silently handing you a dead tunnel that
looks connected while your browser actually talks to the wrong service.

If the connection hangs at the TCP handshake rather than failing immediately, check, in
order: the target's firewall/security-group rules for the SSH port, whether the target
host is actually reachable from the bastion (`ssh <bastion> "nc -zv <target> <port>"`),
and only then your local tunnel config — a hung handshake almost always means the
network path is blocked somewhere upstream of your laptop, not a misconfigured tunnel.

### Ports

| Service  | Port | Override                |
|----------|------|-------------------------|
| Frontend | 3000 | `DEEPSQL_FRONTEND_PORT` |
| Backend  | 8080 | `DEEPSQL_BACKEND_PORT`  |
| Postgres | 5432 | `DEEPSQL_POSTGRES_PORT` |
| Valkey   | 6379 | `DEEPSQL_VALKEY_PORT`   |

### Configuration reference

Everything lives in `.env`, documented inline. The variables that matter most:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DEEPSQL_CHAT_PROVIDER`, `_API_KEY`, `_ENDPOINT`, `_MODEL` | The chat model. Required. |
| `DEEPSQL_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`, `_API_KEY`, `_ENDPOINT`, `_MODEL` | Embeddings for retrieval. Optional; without them retrieval is keyword-only. |
| `DEEPSQL_CHAT_TEMPERATURE`, `_API_VERSION`, `_USE_RESPONSES_API` | Optional chat tuning. `_USE_RESPONSES_API` is `true` / `false` / `auto`. |
| `SECURITY_JWT_SECRET` | Signs session tokens. Generate with `openssl rand -base64 64`. |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` — or `ENCRYPTION_KEYS` + `ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID` | AES-GCM key(s) for the credential vault. The backend refuses to start without one. |
| `DB_URL`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD` | The vault database. Compose points these at its own `postgres` service. |
| `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` | `prod` for self-hosting — hardened defaults. |
| `SECURITY_AUTH_ENABLED` | Set `false` only for local development. |
| `SECURITY_ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_ENABLED`, `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET` | Gate the localhost-only first-admin endpoint. |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Browser origins allowed to call the API. |
| `VECTOR_STORE_TYPE` | `pgvector` (the self-hosting default) or `azure`. |
| `EMBEDDING_FAIL_OPEN` | Whether a failed embedding call degrades silently or raises. |
| `SLACK_*`, `EMAIL_*` | Optional Slack bot and SMTP. |

### Telemetry

The backend can report anonymous install and usage counters to PostHog. **No project key
ships with this repository**, so the sink is a no-op unless you configure
`deepsql.telemetry.posthog-project-key` yourself. `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` or
`DEEPSQL_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` disables it outright, as does the admin toggle.

---

## MCP server

`mcp/` exposes 44 tools wrapping the backend API, so agents reuse the same orchestration,
retrieval and guardrails instead of getting raw database credentials. SQL execution is
read-only-enforced before it reaches the backend.

```bash
DEEPSQL_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/ \
DEEPSQL_AUTH_TOKEN=<your-deepsql-token> \
npm run mcp:phase1
```

It has no npm dependencies of its own — `npm run mcp:phase1` is just
`node mcp/deepsql-phase1-server.js`, so it runs straight from a fresh clone.

See [`mcp/README.md`](mcp/README.md) for the CLI, editor configuration and the full tool
table, and [`docs/root/MCP_PHASE1.md`](docs/root/MCP_PHASE1.md) for rollout notes.

---

## Development

Run the stateful dependencies in Docker — PostgreSQL needs the **pgvector** extension, which
is tedious to install by hand — and everything else natively for hot reload.

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres valkey    # requires .env to exist

cd backend && ./mvnw spring-boot:run    # http://localhost:8080/api
npm install && npm run dev              # http://localhost:3000
```

You need **JDK 25** and **Node 22**. Maven comes from the wrapper (`./mvnw`), which pins the
same version CI uses — no separate install.

The backend needs the same environment as the container: at minimum `DB_URL`, `DB_USERNAME`,
`DB_PASSWORD`, `SECURITY_JWT_SECRET`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and the `DEEPSQL_CHAT_*` group.
Authentication is on by default in every profile and there is no `admin`/`admin` shortcut:
either create the first account through the bootstrap flow, or set
`SECURITY_AUTH_ENABLED=false` to let the backend accept unauthenticated API calls while you
work on it.

```bash
npm run lint                # eslint
npm run build               # production frontend bundle
cd backend && ./mvnw test   # backend test suite
```
