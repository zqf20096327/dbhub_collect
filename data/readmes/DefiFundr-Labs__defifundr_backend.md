## 🚀 What is DefiFundr?

DefiFundr is a revolutionary decentralized payroll and invoice management system that bridges the gap between traditional financial systems and blockchain technology. The platform provides a seamless, secure, and transparent solution for businesses to manage employee payments, handle freelancer invoices, and automate salary disbursements across both fiat and cryptocurrency channels.

### 🌟 Features

- **Automated Payroll Management**: Schedule and automate regular salary payments
- **Multi-currency Support**: Pay in both fiat and cryptocurrency
- **Invoice Processing**: Create, manage, and process invoices efficiently
- **Secure Authentication**: PASETO token-based authentication with robust password hashing
- **User Management**: Comprehensive user account management with KYC verification
- **Transaction History**: Detailed tracking of all financial transactions
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Direct interaction with Ethereum-based smart contracts
- **API-First Design**: RESTful API architecture for seamless integration

## 🏗️ Architecture

DefiFundr implements a **Hexagonal Architecture** (also known as Ports and Adapters) to achieve:

- Separation of business logic from external concerns
- Improved testability through clear boundaries
- Greater flexibility in replacing components
- Enhanced maintainability with well-defined interfaces

### Key Components:

- **Core Domain** (internal/core): Business rules and entities
- **Ports** (internal/core/ports): Interface definitions
- **Adapters** (internal/adapters): Implementation of interfaces
- **Infrastructure** (infrastructure/): Cross-cutting concerns

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Make
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DefiFundr-Labs/defifundr_backend.git
   cd defifundr_backend
   ```

2. Install required tools:
   ```bash
   make install-tools
   ```

3. Set up the development environment:
   ```bash
   make docker-up
   ```

4. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   make postgres
   make createdb
   make migrate-up
   ```

5. Generate SQL code:
   ```bash
   make sqlc
   ```

6. Run the server:
   ```bash
   make server
   ```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
DB_SOURCE=postgres://root:secret@localhost:5433/defi?sslmode=disable
SERVER_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8080
TOKEN_SYMMETRIC_KEY=your-secret-key-at-least-32-bytes-long
ACCESS_TOKEN_DURATION=15m
REFRESH_TOKEN_DURATION=24h
```

## 💻 Development

### Running the Application

You can run the application in several ways:

```bash
# Standard mode
make server

# Hot reload mode (recommended for development)
make air

# Using Docker
make docker-up
```

### Available Commands

Run `make help` to see a list of all available commands. Key commands include:

```bash
# Database commands
make postgres         # Start PostgreSQL
make createdb         # Create the database
make dropdb           # Drop the database

# Migration commands
make migrate-up       # Apply migrations
make migrate-down     # Revert migrations
make migrate-create   # Create a new migration

# Development commands

## 📚 API Documentation

DefiFundr provides comprehensive API documentation using Swagger.

1. Generate the Swagger documentation:
   ```bash
   make swagger
   ```

2. Access the Swagger UI:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html
   ```

The API follows RESTful principles with these main endpoints:

- **Authentication**: `/v1/auth/*` (register, login, refresh, logout)
- **Users**: `/v1/users/*` (user management)
- **Transactions**: `/v1/transactions/*` (payment operations)
- **KYC**: `/v1/kyc/*` (verification processes)

For detailed API specifications, see [API_DOCUMENTATION.md](documentation/API_DOCUMENTATION.md).

## 🗄️ Database Management

DefiFundr uses [Goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose) for database migrations and [SQLC](https://sqlc.dev/) for type-safe SQL queries.

### Creating a New Migration

```bash
make migrate-create
# When prompted, enter a descriptive name
```

### Running Migrations

```bash
# Apply all pending migrations
make migrate-up

# Revert the last migration
make migrate-down

# Check migration status
make migrate-status
```

### Generate SQL Code

After adding or modifying queries in the `db/query/` directory:

```bash
make sqlc
```

For more details, see [DATABASE.md](documentation/DATABASE.md).
