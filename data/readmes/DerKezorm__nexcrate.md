# nexcrate

Movies, shows and music in one self-hosted app. A movie or a show can have several versions,
such as Full HD and 4K; music has one version for now. One app instead of Radarr, Sonarr and
Lidarr side by side.

![The library: movies with their versions and states](docs/screenshots/library-movies.png)

Website: [nexcrate.nexapps.dev](https://nexcrate.nexapps.dev)

The screenshots show a throwaway instance with public-domain movies, a few shows and artists,
and made-up releases.

## What it does

- **Versions:** a movie or a show can have several versions, each with its own profile and
  folder. No second instance for 4K. Music has one version for now.
- **Profiles from everyday questions**, with the rules of the
  [TRaSH Guides](https://trash-guides.info) inside: qualities, custom formats, sizes and scores
  as Radarr and Sonarr use them. An expert mode edits every part by hand, and a profile can be
  read from an existing Radarr or Sonarr.
- **Movies, shows and anime** from TMDB, scene numbering from TheXEM, episodes counted through
  for anime, double episodes, specials.
- **Music** from MusicBrainz: artists, albums and the release that fits best, files matched to
  tracks by tags, names and AcoustID fingerprints, tags written on filing.
- **Search** over Newznab and Torznab indexers, entered by hand, read from Radarr, Sonarr or
  Lidarr, or kept up to date from **Prowlarr**, with the decision per version and the reason for
  every release.
- **Downloads** through SABnzbd, NZBGet, qBittorrent, Transmission or Deluge. Torrents are
  hardlinked and seed until their indexer's goal (ratio, seed time), then leave the download
  client while the library file stays; Usenet downloads are moved, failed ones are replaced.
- **Automatic search**, RSS and delay rules per version, with a daily limit and a pause for
  upgrades.
- **Switching over** from Radarr, Sonarr and Lidarr: read their library, indexers, download
  clients and profiles, then take the files over; or start from the folders on disk.
- **Rename** whole libraries with a preview and an undo, **library rules** that pick the target
  folder by genre, certification, tag or kind of series.
- **Calendar** with an iCal feed, **notifications** (ntfy, Gotify, Telegram, Discord, webhook,
  Apprise, e-mail), **Plex, Jellyfin and Emby** told about new files, **backups** with an
  encrypted download.
- **An API for other programs** (`/api/v1`) with keys, an event feed and webhooks.
- **Bazarr** (beta) reads nexcrate as Radarr and Sonarr, live, and the subtitles it writes move
  with their video.
- **Sign-in through authentik** or another OpenID Connect provider, set up with one button, and
  a **second factor** (authenticator app plus recovery codes) for the sign-in with a password.

## Running with Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The bundled `docker-compose.yml` pulls `ghcr.io/derkezorm/nexcrate:latest`. Open
`http://<your-host>:8390` and create the account.

> ⚠️ **Whoever reaches a fresh installation first can claim it.** Until the account exists,
> anybody who can open the page can create it, and it is the only account there is. Create
> it right after the first start, before the port is reachable from other networks. Once the
> account exists, the setup route is closed for good.

### Forgot the password?

There is one account and no other way back in. Whoever controls the server sets a new one:

```bash
docker exec -it nexcrate python -m app.cli reset-password
```

It asks for the new password twice without showing it, and ends every session.

### Sign-in through authentik

Settings › System › Account › "Set up authentik for me": enter the address of authentik and an
API token, and nexcrate creates the signing key, the provider and the application, and binds the
application to the token's own user, so authentik lets nobody else through. The token is used
for this setup only and not stored. Rather without a token: download the blueprint there, apply
it in authentik and enter client ID and secret by hand. Other providers (Authelia, Keycloak,
Pocket ID and more) are entered by hand with the redirect address shown on the page.

Then link your account: nexcrate asks for its password and sends you to the provider once. That
one identity opens nexcrate from then on; every other identity is turned away, however the
provider is set up. Once linked, the sign-in with a password can be switched off. If the
provider is ever gone, start nexcrate with `NEXCRATE_PASSWORD_LOGIN=1` to open it again.

### Second factor

Settings › System › Account › "Second factor": after the password, nexcrate asks for a code from
an authenticator app. Eight recovery codes are shown once. A sign-in through the provider asks
for no code, the provider brings its own. Lost the phone and the codes?

```bash
docker exec -it nexcrate python -m app.cli reset-second-factor
```

### The data directory

Everything lives in `/data` (`./data` next to the compose file): the database, the secret key,
the logs and the backups (`data/backups/`).

> ⚠️ **`/data` belongs on a local disk**, never on an SMB or NFS share. SQLite's locking does
> not work reliably over network file systems, and that is how it loses data. On a NAS use a
> path on an internal volume, not a mounted share.

Back up `secret.key` together with the database. Stored credentials, such as API keys of other
programs, are encrypted with it; without it they have to be entered again.

### Media and downloads

nexcrate files into folders it can see inside its container, and you choose them from a list;
there is no path to type. Mount the folder that holds your downloads and your media, for example:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - /srv/data:/media
```

`/data` is nexcrate's own and is never offered as a media folder.

> ⚠️ **Hardlinks work only inside one mount.** Keep the downloads of your download clients and
> your media folders below one host folder and mount that folder once. With two mounts, even of
> the same disk, every torrent is copied and takes its space twice.

- **Categories:** nexcrate keeps its downloads apart under a category of its own, `nexcrate`: a
  category in SABnzbd and qBittorrent, which nexcrate creates; any category in NZBGet, which takes
  one without setup; a subfolder and, from version 4, a label in Transmission; a label in Deluge,
  whose Label plugin nexcrate switches on.
- **Usenet retention** is read from the news servers set up in SABnzbd and NZBGet; a release older
  than the longest retention is left out. There is nothing to enter.
- **Indexer keys stay inside nexcrate.** nexcrate fetches the NZB or torrent file itself and hands
  the file over; no download client ever sees an indexer key.
- **Prowlarr:** Settings, Indexers, "Prowlarr". Enter its address and API key once; nexcrate
  reads Prowlarr's indexers on saving, on "Sync now" and every 15 minutes, keeps one indexer per
  Prowlarr indexer and searches through Prowlarr. Nothing to set up in Prowlarr, no app entry.
  Prowlarr 1.8.6 or newer. An indexer from Prowlarr is changed in Prowlarr; nexcrate keeps its
  own fields such as the automatic search.
- **Seeding goals:** a torrent indexer can carry a ratio, a seed time and a seed time for season
  packs, taken from Prowlarr, from Radarr, Sonarr or Lidarr, or entered by hand. qBittorrent gets
  them with the torrent; Transmission and Deluge get the ratio, and nexcrate stops them itself
  once the seed time is reached. Without a goal a torrent keeps seeding.
- **Removing finished torrents:** once a torrent is imported and has reached its goal, nexcrate
  removes it from the download client together with its files in the download folder. The
  hardlinked file in the library stays, and nothing inside a media folder is ever removed. A
  switch per download client, on for new clients. Should qBittorrent remove torrents by its own
  share limit rule, the client card says so.
- **Different paths:** when a download client sees the folder under another path, for example
  `/data` instead of `/media`, nexcrate finds the finished download and asks once to confirm the
  mapping.
- **Recycle bin:** a replaced or deleted file waits in `.nexcrate-recycle` inside its root
  folder, seven days by default, and can be taken back from Settings, Files.

### The library on disk

Every title nexcrate owns carries a small file `release.nex` in its folder (for shows in every
season folder, for albums in the album folder): the TMDB, IMDb or MusicBrainz number and per
version the file, its quality and release. Should the database ever be lost, nexcrate reads the
library back from these files without guessing. Plex, Jellyfin and Emby ignore the file.

### Backups

Settings, System, "Backups". nexcrate copies its database weekly at night (or daily, monthly or
never), before every schema change, and when you ask. **Download** turns a copy into an
AES-encrypted ZIP with the database and `secret.key`, protected by a password you choose.
**Restore** takes such an archive and restarts nexcrate, which swaps it in before anything opens
the database; this needs a restart policy such as `restart: unless-stopped`, which the bundled
`docker-compose.yml` sets.

### Settings

All optional, see `.env.example` and `docker-compose.yml`.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXCRATE_DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Database, key, logs, backups |
| `NEXCRATE_SECRET_KEY` | generated in `data/secret.key` | Key for stored credentials |
| `NEXCRATE_COOKIE_SECURE` | `auto` | `auto` follows the scheme of each request, `on` for a reverse proxy that ends TLS, `off` never |
| `NEXCRATE_LOG_LEVEL` | empty | Fixes the log mode: `quiet`, `normal`, `detailed`, `trace` |
| `NEXCRATE_PORT` | `8390` | Port inside the container |
| `NEXCRATE_URL_BASE` | empty | Serve nexcrate under a sub path such as `/nexcrate`; `/api/health` also answers at the root |
| `NEXCRATE_PASSWORD_LOGIN` | empty | `1` opens the sign-in with a password even when it was switched off for authentik |

### Logs

The log is in `data/logs/` and in the interface, with download. There are four modes: `quiet`,
`normal`, `detailed` and `trace`; the two deep ones switch back to `normal` after 30 minutes,
2 hours or 8 hours. Every answer carries an `X-Request-Id` header that finds the lines of that
request. Secrets are masked before a line is written.

## API

The interface uses the same API anybody can use. Documentation: `/api/docs`, the OpenAPI
document: `/api/openapi.json`. Requests that change something need the header
`X-Requested-With: nexcrate`.

Other programs use `/api/v1`, a contract that stays stable while the routes of the interface
follow its pages. It opens with a key from Settings, System, API keys, sent as
`Authorization: Bearer <key>`. A key is shown once and nexcrate keeps only its hash. Three
scopes: `read` (versions, titles and their state, seasons and episodes, the queue, problems,
history, the calendar, ratings, an event feed also as Server-Sent Events), `request` (request
titles, take requests back, freeze, move files into the recycle bin, ask for a search) and
`operate` (retry, remove, clear and assign the files of a stuck download). A program can also
ask to be connected (`POST /api/v1/pairing`) and collect its key once the owner confirms.
Webhooks send the same events signed with HMAC-SHA256.

### Bazarr (beta)

Bazarr only knows Radarr and Sonarr, so nexcrate answers it as both. Switch it on under Settings,
System, Bazarr, make a key with nothing but `read` under API keys, and enter nexcrate in Bazarr
twice, under Radarr and under Sonarr, with the same address, port and key:

| In Bazarr | Base URL |
|---|---|
| Radarr | `/bazarr/radarr` |
| Sonarr | `/bazarr/sonarr` |

With `NEXCRATE_URL_BASE` the sub path comes first, for example `/nexcrate/bazarr/radarr`. Bazarr
keeps a live connection and hears of a new or replaced file within seconds.

- **Every version is an entry of its own** in Bazarr: a movie in 1080p and in 4K shows up twice.
  The version's name comes along as a tag, and Bazarr's tag mapping can give each version a
  languages profile of its own.
- **Subtitles Bazarr writes** are recorded and go where the video goes: renamed with it, into the
  recycle folder with it on an upgrade or a removal. Switching on looks once for subtitles that
  are already next to the files. Versions another Radarr or Sonarr still feeds are left out.
- **Paths:** Bazarr gets the paths as nexcrate sees them. If Bazarr sees the media elsewhere, set
  path mappings in Bazarr.
- **Beta:** nexcrate imitates the part of Radarr's and Sonarr's API that Bazarr reads, tested
  against Bazarr 1.6.2. A Bazarr update may break it until nexcrate catches up.
- Bazarr sends the key in the address, as it does to Radarr; nexcrate's log masks it.
