nexmail brings several IMAP mailboxes together in one place and runs on your own
machine. It is meant for people who already host things at home: one container,
a single SQLite file, no second database, no cloud account, and no service that
gets to see your mail on the way.

Roundcube is webmail bolted onto one mailbox. Thunderbird does not run in a
browser. Commercial clients want to pull your mail onto their servers. nexmail
is the third option — and if you can use Outlook, you should feel at home.

> **Version 0.20.0.** It reads, writes, searches, sorts, labels, sends,
> schedules, prints, answers for you while you are away, keeps a calendar and
> your address books in sync with iCloud or Google, invites people to your own
> appointments, rephrases a draft with an AI service of your choice, backs
> itself up and reaches you when the browser is closed, on the desktop and on
> the phone. It is used daily by its author against real iCloud and IMAP
> mailboxes, and more than 1,900 automated tests watch over it, including more
> than 190 that drive a real browser against a real mailbox. It is still young: try
> it on a mailbox you can afford to have trouble with before you point it at
> the one that matters.

The screenshots below show a throwaway instance filled with invented mail.
Every address in them is under `example.com`, `example.org` or
`example.net`, which RFC 2606 reserves for exactly this purpose.

## What it does

**Mail.** Several mailboxes side by side, plus a merged *All inboxes* view.
Read, reply, reply-all, forward, move, archive, delete, mark, flag, undo. Drag
and drop between folders. Keyboard: `Del` to trash, `E` to archive. Which
folder is the trash or the archive nexmail reads from the server's SPECIAL-USE
flags and from the usual names; where a server has neither, right-click the
folder and pick *Use as* (on a phone: the *…* next to the folder). Folders
created or removed elsewhere show up with the next sync.

**Reading pane, or not.** A button next to the search field switches between
three layouts: the reading pane to the right of the list, or no reading pane at
all, with a message opening either in place of the list or in a window above
it. Without the pane the list gets the full width, a click only selects, and a
double-click or `Enter` opens. What opens after you delete, archive or move
the open message is up to you, as in Outlook: nothing, the next message, the
previous one or the newest (Settings, Appearance).

**A face for every sender.** Each row and the open message start with a round
picture: the contact's photo from your address book, otherwise the sender's
brand logo, otherwise their initials. Brand logos follow BIMI as strictly as
Apple Mail does and are off by default (Settings, Appearance, *Load company
logos*). A logo appears only when the message passed your provider's sender
check, the domain enforces DMARC, and it publishes a mark certificate that
chains up to a known BIMI issuer; the logo is taken from the certificate
itself. The server looks each domain up once a week, your browser never
contacts the sender. Most senders publish no BIMI record and get initials, and
messages synced before 0.20.0 carry no sender check and never get a logo.

**On the phone.** A layout of its own rather than a squeezed desktop: list,
then message, with the folders in a drawer. Swipe a row to archive or delete,
long-press to select several and act on them from a bar within thumb reach.
The calendar shows the month with a dot per calendar and the day's events
below it, or the month as a running list.

**Conversations.** Related messages fold into one row — matched by the reply
chain first, subject only as a fallback and only when sender, subject and a
30-day window all agree. Off by default: grouping wrongly *hides* a message, and
you notice that at the worst possible moment.

**Writing.** A real formatting toolbar (Tiptap), attachments, pasted images,
drafts stored in the mailbox rather than in the browser, and an outbox that
survives a restart. Recipients become address bubbles as you type; nonsense
turns red instead of hiding inside a comma list. Set importance, get a
question when the text mentions an attachment that is not there, and forward
a message as an untouched `.eml` when someone needs the real thing.

**Send later, take it back.** Schedule a message for this evening, tomorrow
morning or any moment; it waits in nexmail's own outbox, visibly, and
cancelling files it as a draft. Undo send holds every outgoing message for a
few configurable seconds first — undo brings it straight back into the
compose window.

![The compose window with its formatting toolbar](docs/screenshots/verfassen-en.webp)

**Search.** Full-text over everything cached, plus `IMAP SEARCH` at the provider
on request. The interface says how far it looked — a search that hides its own
reach lets you conclude a message does not exist.

![Search results, with a line saying which part was covered](docs/screenshots/suche-en.webp)

**Tasks.** Turn a message into a task, tick it off, drag it into order, give it
a due date. The task survives its message: if the mail is moved from your phone,
the task follows it by `Message-ID`; if the mail is deleted, the task stays and
says so.

**Contacts, rules, signatures.** An address book with several numbers,
addresses and postal addresses per contact, the card's photo, vCard import and
export and collection from Sent; connected CardDAV address books (iCloud,
Google or any other CardDAV server) that are read and written back line by
line, with a question instead of an overwrite when a card changed on both
sides, and a vCard file can be imported straight into one of them;
contact groups that expand into their members when picked as a recipient;
rules that run after each sync and only on new mail; signatures per mailbox.

**Housekeeping.** Trash and junk can empty themselves after a number of days —
off by default, measured by how long a message has been in the folder, and
never touching a folder you created yourself. Printing produces a clean
document and goes straight to the print dialog. On a phone, swiping a row
archives or deletes, with the same undo as everywhere else.

| Tasks | Contacts |
|---|---|
| ![The task list](docs/screenshots/aufgaben-en.webp) | ![The address book](docs/screenshots/kontakte-en.webp) |

**Mailbox groups.** Tag mailboxes (`personal`, `work`, `club`) and switch
between them above the folder tree.

**Labels.** Colour a message *Important*, *Work*, *Later*. They are stored as
IMAP keywords on the server, not in nexmail's database, so they outlive nexmail
and show up in Thunderbird and on your phone. Labels another client set appear
here too, with a name and a colour of their own.

**Follow-up.** Park a message until this evening, tomorrow or next week. It
moves into a real *Follow-up* folder on the server and comes back when it is
due — visible from every other client, not a note that only nexmail knows.

**Text templates.** The paragraphs you write again and again, kept once and
dropped into a message from the compose window.

**Out of office.** Per mailbox, with a period and a plain-text note. Every
sender gets it at most once; mailing lists, other automated systems and
delivery failures never get one, and mail that arrived before you left is not
answered retroactively. You can see who received one. Note that nexmail can
only answer while nexmail itself is running — your provider can usually do this
on the mail server, independently of it.

**Meeting invitations.** An `.ics` shows up as a card rather than an
unopenable attachment: title, time in your own time zone, place, organiser.
Accept, tentative or decline goes back as a proper reply, and nexmail remembers
what you answered. *Add to calendar* is a separate button on purpose: saying
yes tells the organiser you are coming, it does not mean you want the entry.

**Your own invitations.** Put people on one of your events and nexmail asks
whether to send the invitation — it never goes out by itself, not when you save
and not when you change something later. Their answers come back into the
attendee list as they arrive, so you can see who is coming without leaving the
app. Delete the event and it offers to tell them; without that the appointment
would stay in their calendars and they would turn up.

**Calendar.** Month, week and day, with your own calendars in nexmail or
connected over CalDAV to iCloud, Nextcloud or anything else that speaks it.
A server on your own network or VPN is refused until the operator allows it
under *Administration → Server*; the same switch covers address books and
subscribed calendars.
Google works too, through the same consent you gave for the mailbox. Recurring
events are stored once and worked out for the window on screen, so a *every
Monday* does not fill the database to the year 2031; *this one, this and
following, all* is asked the way every calendar asks it, because the format
leaves no other answer. A published `.ics` link can be subscribed to
read-only. A calendar can be downloaded as an `.ics` file and events read back
in from one, so moving in or out does not mean retyping anything; events that
are already there are skipped, so reading the same file twice is safe. What
nexmail does not understand in a foreign event travels through
untouched: alarms, attendees and a dozen `X-APPLE-` properties come back out
the way they came in.

Reminders live on the event as a `VALARM`, so what you set here also goes off
on your phone. They reach you through the browser as well, with nexmail closed
— see *Notifications* below.

**Notifications.** nexmail can reach you with the browser closed: an event
reminder that falls due, and mail the sync actually just fetched. Every device
grants permission for itself; what you get notified about belongs to your
account and is the same everywhere. New mail is announced **after** the rules
have run, so a message a rule just filed into junk does not claim to be in your
inbox — and a mailbox's very first sync announces nothing, because at that
point every message is new. Quiet hours drop notifications rather than
deferring them: a reminder delivered at seven in the morning for an event at
eleven last night is not a reminder. On a phone this needs the site on the home
screen; iOS delivers nothing to an ordinary tab, and says nothing about why.

**Google and Microsoft mailboxes.** Both providers stopped accepting a
password for IMAP and SMTP, so nexmail signs in with OAuth. Two levels, kept
apart on purpose: the operator registers one app with the provider, every user
gives consent for their own mailbox. No secret ships with nexmail — the
repository is public, and both providers revoke a key they find in one, so
each operator registers their own. The administration page says so plainly
rather than letting you guess why nothing works.

**Rephrasing with AI, if you want it.** Every user can connect their own AI
service under *Settings*: an address, a key and a model. nexmail knows no
provider; anything that speaks the common chat completions interface works,
from Claude, Gemini or OpenAI to Ollama on a machine in your own network. In
the editor it fixes spelling, translates, or rephrases in one of nine tones,
and shows old and new side by side before anything is replaced. Quotes and
your signature are never sent, and the AI page lists verbatim what went out.
Off by default, and the operator can block it for the whole installation or
for single accounts.

**Moving between mailboxes.** Drag a message from one account to another.
`MOVE` and `COPY` only work inside one connection, so this fetches, appends at
the target, checks that it really arrived, and only then deletes at the source.
That order is the whole safety: the worst case is a message that exists twice,
which you can see and clean up.

**Moving in and out.** Import a Thunderbird `mbox`, or download a folder as
`mbox` or as a ZIP of `.eml` files. What is already there is skipped by
`Message-ID`, so an interrupted import can simply be repeated. Read and
flagged state travels both ways.

**HTML mail, defused.** Server-side sanitising with an allow-list, images
unhooked until you ask for them, and an iframe sandbox without scripts. The same
sanitising runs on what *you* write, on the way out.

When you do ask for the images, **nexmail's server fetches them, your browser
never does**. The sender learns that the message was opened, which is the price
of seeing the pictures in any client, but not your address, your browser or
anything else about you. Allow a sender for good with one click, or switch the
asking off entirely under *Appearance*. Addresses inside your own network are
refused: a message pointing at `http://192.168.x.x/reset` would otherwise make
the server a remote control for your home network.

## What it is not

* **No PGP or S/MIME.** Key management is a project of its own, and half-built
  encryption is worse than none.
* **No Microsoft calendar.** Microsoft speaks no CalDAV; events there need the
  Graph API, which is a client of its own. Mail through IMAP and SMTP works.
* **No out-of-office reply while nexmail is down.** It answers only when the
  container runs. Your provider can usually do this on the server instead,
  independently of nexmail.

## Built with

FastAPI · SQLAlchemy · SQLite · React · Vite · Tailwind CSS · Tiptap · IMAPClient

One container. SQLite instead of Postgres is not a shortcut here, it is a
feature: no second container, no database credentials, and a backup is a copy.

## Running with Docker

```yaml
services:
  nexmail:
    image: ghcr.io/derkezorm/nexmail:latest
    container_name: nexmail
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "5174:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    environment:
      PUID: 1000
      PGID: 1000
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Then open `http://<server>:5174`. On first run you set a username and password.
After that, this route is closed.

> ⚠️ **Until the first account exists, anyone can create it.** There is no
> account that could authenticate at that point — it cannot work any other way.
> Set it up on your home network before you expose it.

The full compose file with every option and the reasoning behind each one is
[`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) in this repository.

### Your mailbox credentials

nexmail asks for them **in its own interface and nowhere else**. You add
mailboxes under *Settings → Mailboxes*. They are stored encrypted and never
leave your server.

![The mailbox list under Settings](docs/screenshots/postfaecher-en.webp)

For iCloud you need an **app-specific password** from `account.apple.com`. Your
normal Apple password is refused, and iCloud reports that with the same message
it uses for a typo. nexmail says so in the connection test, so you do not spend
ten minutes doubting your password.

### What to back up

Everything is under `/data`:

| | |
|---|---|
| `nexmail.db` | mailboxes, messages, contacts, rules, sessions |
| `secret.key` | **the key to every stored mailbox password** |
| `blobs/` | attachments, stored by checksum |

> ⚠️ **`secret.key` and the database belong together.** Without the key the
> database is unreadable. With both, whoever holds them holds your mailboxes.

### Backup and restore

Under *Administration → Backup*. Two things live there, and telling them apart
matters when it counts:

**Restore points** are complete copies next to the database, made automatically
before any schema change and by hand whenever you want, on a schedule if you
like. They are for a failed update or a contact deleted by mistake. If the disk
dies, they die with it.

**A backup** is what you download: an encrypted ZIP, and deliberately **without
the messages**. Those are still in the mailbox on the server, and nexmail
fetches them back after a restore. Measured on a real database: 1890 messages
turn 0.36 MB into 2.79 MB, and the part that cannot be fetched again does not
grow with the mailbox. An archive that grows with your mail is one nobody
downloads.

Restoring happens in two steps. The first only looks: it reports the version,
whether the key is included, and whether the public address in the archive
differs from the one you are using. It has to ask about that one, because
invitation links and the OpenID Connect redirect are built from it — and the
redirect URI registered with your provider is something nexmail cannot change
for you, so the report spells it out.

> ⚠️ **Put `/data` on a local disk, never on an SMB or NFS share.** That is the
> one way SQLite genuinely loses data: its locking does not work reliably over
> network filesystems. On a NAS, use a path on the internal volume.

### Behind a reverse proxy

Set `NEXMAIL_URL_BASE=/nexmail` and nexmail runs under
`https://example.org/nexmail`. It answers every address twice — with and without
the prefix — because proxies are configured both ways.

Set `NEXMAIL_COOKIE_SECURE` to match your setup. `auto` (the default) marks the
session cookie `Secure` when the request arrived over HTTPS. Use `on` only if a
proxy terminates TLS and forwards plain HTTP internally — and never if nexmail
should also be reachable over `http://`, because the browser discards a Secure
cookie sent over http and then nobody gets in.

## Signing in through an external provider

nexmail speaks OpenID Connect: Keycloak, Authentik, Authelia, Pocket ID and
anything else that follows the spec. Add a provider under *Administration →
OIDC*; the redirect URI to register with the provider is shown there with a copy
button.

![The sign-in tab with one registered provider](docs/screenshots/oidc-en.webp)

**Two ways in, and no others:**

1. **An existing link.** You create it while signed in, under *Settings →
   Security → Link*.
2. **An open invitation to exactly that address.** The account is created from
   the invitation, and the invitation is spent.

> ⚠️ **There is deliberately no matching against existing accounts by email.**
> That would be the place where a provider claiming an address it does not own
> could open somebody else's account. An invitation is a decision the operator
> made on purpose.

The address still has to be marked verified by the provider — otherwise a
provider that lets anyone enter any address would be enough to claim an
invitation meant for someone else.

> ⚠️ **The issuer must be one address that both the browser and the server can
> reach.** The browser fetches the sign-in page; the container fetches the
> discovery document and the token. If you run the provider in the same Docker
> network, enter it under the address the *browser* knows, not its container
> name.

## Several people

Invite them under *Administration → Users*. nexmail sends the invitation itself,
which needs an outgoing mail server of its own under *Administration → Server* —
deliberately not the operator's mailbox, so that removing that mailbox does not
take the invitations with it.

The invitation page offers both ways: set a password, or sign in through a
provider. Not everyone has an account with your identity provider, and not
everyone should need a password they will never use.

A forgotten password can be reset through a link sent to the contact address
stored on the account; the link lasts two hours and signs out every session
when it is used. The operator role can be handed on to another user, after
confirming with your own password, so an installation never ends up without
someone who can administer it.

![Administration with users and open invitations](docs/screenshots/verwaltung-en.webp)

Every user has their own mailboxes, contacts, rules and signatures. A guard test
walks the entire route table and checks that no address answers without
authentication and none hands out another user's data.

## Dashboards: read-only API keys

A dashboard such as nexdeck can show how many unread messages are waiting and,
if you allow it, sender and subject of the latest ones. It reads them with an
API key that each user creates for their own mailboxes under
*Settings → API keys*.

**Off by default.** API keys are a way out of nexmail, so the operator decides
whether they exist on an installation at all, with a switch on the same page.
Turning it off stops every key immediately; no key is deleted.

**Each key has two limits, set when it is created.** It sees only the
mailboxes ticked on it, and it has one of two scopes: *count only*, or *count,
sender and subject*. The text of a message is never available through a key.
Keys are stored as hashes and shown once; revoking one takes effect on the
next request.

All addresses are `GET`, answer JSON and expect the key as
`Authorization: Bearer nxm_…`. A browser session does not open them, and a key
opens nothing else.

| Address | Returns |
|---|---|
| `/api/v1/me` | owner, key name and scope (`count` or `headers`), the mailboxes the key may see |
| `/api/v1/summary` | unread messages in the inbox, in total and per mailbox, with `status` `ok` or `sign_in_failed` |
| `/api/v1/messages/latest` | sender, subject, date and read state of the newest inbox messages; needs scope `headers`. Optional: `mailbox=<id>` (repeatable), `limit=1..20` (default 5), `unread_only=true` |

Errors come as `{"detail": "<code>"}`: `api_schluessel_fehlt` and
`api_schluessel_ungueltig` (401), `api_schluessel_abgeschaltet` and
`api_schluessel_nur_anzahl` (403), `postfach_unbekannt` (404). Counts are as
fresh as nexmail's last sync with the mail server.

## Security, honestly

**Two-factor is available and optional.** TOTP with replay protection, ten
single-use recovery codes, and a per-user switch — including for the operator.
On a purely local network it is reasonable to leave it off; reachable from the
internet it is not, and nexmail says so where you make the choice.

**Sessions live on the server, not in a token.** That costs one query per
request and buys *sign out everywhere* with immediate effect. Devices are listed
and can be revoked individually.

![The security tab with two-factor and signed-in devices](docs/screenshots/sicherheit-en.webp)

**Passwords use Argon2id**, sign-ins are rate-limited, and a spent recovery code
stays spent.

**What two factors cannot do — plainly.** Mailbox passwords must be decryptable
on disk, because syncing runs while nobody is signed in. The key sits in
`/data/secret.key`. **Whoever has file access has your mailboxes**, and no login
changes that. Setting `NEXMAIL_SECRET_KEY` moves the key out of the data
directory, which is the one effective lever: a stolen backup alone is then
worthless.

## Development

```bash
# Backend
cd backend && python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
NEXMAIL_DATA_DIR=../data-dev .venv/bin/python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8010

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

```bash
cd backend && python -m pytest        # ~1,470 tests
cd frontend && npm test               # Vitest, no browser
cd frontend && npm run test:ui        # Playwright, two viewports
```

The interface tests run in a real browser against a real IMAP mailbox. That is
why they prove anything — jsdom would not have found a single one of the layout
and rendering faults they were written for.

They only start the Vite server, though. Whatever answers on port 8010 is what
they measure, and a backend left running from yesterday will report faults the
code no longer has. Check `data-dev/logs/nexmail.log` for the last `is ready`
line before you believe a red run, or point the proxy elsewhere with
`NEXMAIL_API=http://127.0.0.1:8011 npm run dev`.
