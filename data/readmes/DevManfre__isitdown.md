**English** · [Italiano](README.it.md)

Self-hosted, containerized monitoring for **other people's** status pages. It polls
the public status pages of the providers you depend on — GitHub, Cloudflare,
Anthropic, npm, anything running Atlassian Statuspage — and messages you when one
of them changes state.

It exists so a single developer or a small team gets early warning about upstream
trouble without keeping five status dashboards open. It notifies on *transitions*,
never on every poll, so a quiet week is a silent week.

Two editions from one codebase: **Light** (polling and notifications only, no
server) and **UI** (the same engine plus a local dashboard, configured at runtime).

The manual, one file per section:

- [3. Configuration](docs/configuration.md) — `config.yml`, runtime settings, secrets, providers, channels, routing, delivery policy
- [4. Docker](docs/docker.md) — images, Compose profiles, volumes and probes, Kubernetes
- [5. Verifying a deployment](docs/verifying.md) — smoke checks, the dashboard, an end-to-end notification, troubleshooting
- [6. HTTP API](docs/api.md) — every route, the metrics, live updates, badges
- [7. How it works](docs/how-it-works.md) — data flow, components, when a notification fires, resilience
- [8. Theming and localisation](docs/theming.md) — themes, `en`/`it`, accessibility
- [9. Development](docs/development.md) — layout, tech stack, live development, tests, releases

Each page has an Italian twin beside it (`docs/<name>.it.md`).

## 1. What it does

Every few minutes IsItDown fetches each provider's status page, normalises the
answer, compares it with what it saw last time, and sends a message only if
something actually changed.

```
GitHub          operational    ████████████████████████████  99.98%
Cloudflare      degraded       ███████████████▁▁▁▁▁████████  99.61%   ← you get a message
Anthropic       operational    ████████████████████████████  99.93%
```

### Core principles

- **No external dependencies at runtime.** No database server, no message broker,
  no cloud account. A JSON file or an embedded SQLite file is enough at this scale.
- **Config-driven.** Adding a provider never means touching code — an entry in
  `config.yml` (Light) or a dialog in the dashboard (UI).
- **Idempotent notifications.** Only state *transitions* notify: operational →
  degraded, degraded → outage, outage → resolved. A restart notifies nothing.
- **Provider-agnostic.** Most providers run Atlassian Statuspage and need no code
  at all; anything else gets a small adapter.
- **Secrets from the environment only.** A token is read from an environment
  variable, never written to a config file, a database, an API response or a log
  line. The UI edition can save one to a `0600` file beside its database, still
  as a variable, so the dashboard can set a credential without a restart.

### The two editions

|  | Light | UI |
|---|---|---|
| Image | `ghcr.io/devmanfre/isitdown:light-latest` | `…:ui-latest` (built `FROM` light) |
| Poller · Adapters · Diff Engine · Notifiers | shared | shared |
| Configuration | `config.yml`, re-read every cycle | SQLite, edited in the dashboard |
| State store | JSON file, atomic writes | SQLite (also carries history) |
| HTTP server | none | Express on :3000 |
| Uptime history and charts | — | 7/30/90-day views, plus a year heat calendar per provider |
| Theme | — | light / dark / system |
| Localisation | notification text | notification text **and** the whole dashboard |
| Footprint | 264MB image, no listening socket | 267MB — the Light image plus one layer |

Both editions run the same core engine. They differ only in what gets injected
into it: where configuration comes from, and where state is kept.

## 2. Quick start

### 2.1 With Docker

**UI edition, without a clone** — one file, two commands. The images are
published to GHCR for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, so this is also the
Raspberry Pi, Unraid, Portainer and Synology path:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevManfre/isitdown/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose --profile ui up -d
# then visit http://localhost:3000
```

Everything the UI edition needs is configured in the dashboard, credentials
included: **Settings → a channel → Value → Salva** applies at once. Put them in a
`.env` next to the compose file instead if you would rather the container own
them — it is optional, and read if present:

```bash
printf 'TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...\nTELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=...\n' > .env
docker compose --profile ui up -d      # recreates the container with the tokens
```

**Light edition** — polling and notifications, nothing listening. This one needs
a `config.yml` to mount, so start from a clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DevManfre/isitdown.git && cd isitdown
cp .env.example .env                # only fill in the channels you will enable
cp config.example.yml config.yml    # edit: providers, interval, channels
docker compose --profile light up -d
docker logs -f isitdown-light
```

Both can run at once; they use separate data volumes.

Contributors building from the source tree add `--build`, which overrides the
pull and builds the image locally instead:

```bash
docker compose --profile ui up -d --build
```

### 2.2 Without Docker

Requires **Node 24** for the build as well as the runtime — `.nvmrc` pins it and
`npm install` refuses anything older, because the runtime's own SQLite driver and
native TypeScript support are load-bearing at build time too. `build:ui`
additionally runs Vite to bundle the dashboard; `build:light` skips that step,
since Light ships no dashboard.

```bash
nvm use                             # or: nvm install 24
npm install
cp config.example.yml config.yml
cp .env.example .env

npm run build:light && node dist/light/index.js     # Light
npm run build:ui    && node dist/ui/server.js       # UI, then open :3000
```

Useful overrides when running locally: `CONFIG_PATH`, `DATA_PATH`, `DB_PATH`,
`PORT`, `LOG_LEVEL` (see [3.3](docs/configuration.md#33-environment-variables)).

## 10. Roadmap

Delivered:

- **v1 — Light edition**: polling, the diff engine, Telegram and generic-webhook
  notifications, `config.yml` with environment-referenced secrets, a JSON state store
  with atomic writes, `ghcr.io/devmanfre/isitdown:light-latest`.
- **v1.1 — UI prototyping**: the dashboard explored in Claude Design and kept in
  `design/claude-design-prototypes/`. Option `3a`, the navigable console, is the
  implementation reference; the dark palette and the longer Italian label lengths were
  validated there rather than discovered later.
- **v1.2 — UI edition**: that design as an Express + vanilla-ES-module dashboard over
  SQLite, with configuration managed at runtime and applied on the next cycle without
  a restart. `ghcr.io/devmanfre/isitdown:ui-latest`, built `FROM` the Light image.
- **v1.3 — history**: per-provider uptime and incident history with status-page daily
  bars and 7/30/90-day views, aggregated server-side and served from `/history`.
- **v1.4 — dark mode and i18n**: token-based light/dark/system theming with a
  persisted preference, and a localised dashboard (`en`, `it`) on top of the localised
  notification messages both editions already share.

Since v1.4 (on `dev`): adapters for AWS, Google Cloud and Azure, conditional
requests so most cycles are a `304`, a per-provider poll cadence, the delivery log
view, a provider removal that can be undone inside a restore window, ntfy and
Gotify alongside the other channels, a year heat calendar per provider,
readiness split from liveness, an integrity check and vacuum on demand, and a
committed Grafana dashboard.

Still open:

- A native review of the Italian strings.

The roadmap that carried the project this far is finished — every row of it
shipped — and is archived at [`docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md`](docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md).
What comes next is being weighed in `ROADMAP_2.md` and `ROADMAP_3.md`, neither of
which commits to anything.

**What IsItDown is.** Both an aggregator of status pages and a monitor of
things that publish none — and every provider says which of the two answers for
it. A status page provider is `declared`: its own page is the record, and a
probe that disagrees is reported as a disagreement rather than as an overrule. A
probe is `observed`: our reading is the record, and a page that contradicts it is
an opinion. The default comes from the adapter and needs no configuration; the
`authority` field is only there for the cases where the operator disagrees with
that default. This was left open for two roadmaps, and leaving it open is why
"what does 93% mean here" had two answers on one screen.

Explicit non-goals: multi-user auth (this is a local, single-operator dashboard),
status pages behind a login, and a packaged mobile app.

## 11. Branch layout and merge policy

The Claude Code tooling (`.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`) and the merge filter itself
(`.mergeexclude`, `.githooks/`, `scripts/`) are tracked on **`dev` only**. On
`main` none of those paths exist — neither in the commit nor in the working tree.
Everything else (source, docs, config) flows normally from `dev` to `main`.

Because the filter is not readable from `main`, it is installed into this clone's
`.git` directory, which every branch shares.

### Setup, once per clone

```bash
git switch dev
scripts/setup-hooks.sh
```

It copies:

| From (`dev`) | To (shared by every branch) |
|---|---|
| `scripts/git-merge-clean` | `$GIT_DIR/merge-clean` |
| `.githooks/*` | `$GIT_DIR/hooks/*` |
| `.mergeexclude` | `$GIT_DIR/merge-exclude` |

and installs the `git mergeclean` alias. Re-run it after changing
`.mergeexclude` or `scripts/git-merge-clean`.

### Merging into `main`

```bash
git switch main
git mergeclean dev        # not `git merge dev`
```

`git mergeclean` merges the branch, drops the paths listed in the exclude list,
commits with the repo's `🔀` subject format, and removes those paths from the
working tree. It refuses to run on a dirty tree. Genuine conflicts outside the
excluded paths stop the run so you can resolve them and `git commit` as usual.

### What enforces it

| Piece | Role |
|---|---|
| `$GIT_DIR/merge-exclude` | the path list |
| `$GIT_DIR/merge-clean` | the merge wrapper (`--sync` purges, `--guard` checks) |
| `$GIT_DIR/hooks/post-checkout` | purges the excluded paths after a branch switch |
| `$GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-merge-commit`, `pre-commit` | abort any commit that would add an excluded path to a branch that does not track it |

A plain `git merge dev` on `main` is refused by the guard hooks — run
`git merge --abort` and use `git mergeclean` instead. `git commit --no-verify`
bypasses the guard if you ever genuinely need to.

### Consequences of keeping the filter off `main`

- **The setup is per clone and cannot be automatic.** Git never runs hooks taken
  from a clone, and a clone that only ever checks out `main` has nothing to
  install from. On a new machine, check out `dev` and run the setup before
  merging anything into `main`.
- **Until the setup is run, nothing is enforced.** A plain `git merge dev` on a
  fresh clone will pull `.claude/` and `CLAUDE.md` into `main` as soon as you
  resolve the conflicts it raises.

### Rules of thumb

- Edit `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.mergeexclude`, `.githooks/` and `scripts/` only
  while on `dev` — on `main` they do not exist.
- The purge only deletes files that `dev` also has and that are byte-identical to
  it, so machine-local files (`.claude/settings.local.json`) and local edits are
  never touched.
