# 🚔 CyberDraft Engine – Automated Letter Generator for Cyber Crime Wing

## 📌 Overview
CyberDraft Engine is a desktop-based automation tool developed to assist law enforcement officers in generating formal investigation letters quickly and accurately.  

The application reduces manual paperwork, minimizes human error, and significantly speeds up communication with Telecom Service Providers (TSPs), banks, and digital intermediaries.

Designed with usability and efficiency in mind, this system streamlines critical workflows involved in cybercrime investigations.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔐 Secure Authentication
- Role-based login system (Admin & Officer)
- Password hashing using **bcrypt**
- Officer profile management

### 📄 Automated Letter Generation
Supports multiple investigation request types:

✅ Telecom Service Providers (Airtel, Jio, Vodafone, BSNL)
- CAF Details  
- Call Detail Records (CDR)  
- IMEI Tracking  
- Aadhar-linked numbers  
- PoS requests  

✅ Intermediary Platforms
- WhatsApp  
- Google  
- Facebook  
- Instagram  
- Twitter  

✅ Banking Requests
- Bulk processing via Excel  
- Transaction and account detail extraction  
- Batch letter generation with progress tracking

## 🏗️ System Architecture

**Frontend:**  
- Python Tkinter (GUI)

**Backend:**  
- SQLite3 (Local Database)

**Libraries Used:**
- `python-docx` → Word document generation  
- `pandas` → Excel data processing  
- `bcrypt` → Password security  
- `tkcalendar` → Date selection (optional)

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Officer logs into the system.
2. Creates or selects a case.
3. Chooses the request type (TSP / Bank / Intermediary).
4. Inputs required details.
5. The system dynamically fills pre-built templates.
6. A formatted `.docx` letter is generated instantly.
