## 🚀 Tech Stack & Architecture

- **TypeORM** — ORM for Entities, Relations, and Migrations.  
- **PostgreSQL** — Relational database for structured, linked data.  
- **Redis (Caching)** — In-memory layer to speed up repeated queries.  
- **Indexing & Unique Indexes** — Improves read performance and prevents duplicates.  
- **Rate Limiting (Throttler)** — Prevents excessive requests and abuse.  
- **Recaptcha Validation (v3)** — Blocks bot activity on sensitive endpoints.  
- **Normalization** — Ensures clean input and consistent database structure.  
- **Modular Architecture** — Each feature is isolated into its own NestJS module.
