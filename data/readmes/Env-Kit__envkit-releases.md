# EnvKit — local development environment for Windows & macOS

**Your local stack, one place.** A free Laragon / XAMPP / Herd alternative.

EnvKit is a desktop app that runs your entire local web-development stack — nginx **or**
Apache, multiple PHP versions, MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, Mailpit, Node.js,
Python, phpMyAdmin, trusted `.test` HTTPS, and PATH sync — from one modern tray app. Build
Laravel, WordPress, PHP, and Node/React/Next.js/Angular sites locally with one-click services and
trusted local SSL. It can even be **driven by an AI assistant** (Claude Code / Desktop, Cursor,
Windsurf, VS Code, Zed, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, PhpStorm/JetBrains) through a built-in MCP server.

## What's new

- **A wave of community-reported fixes (0.32.0-beta.8)** — removed sites stay removed,
  EnvKit never stops a PostgreSQL/MySQL you installed yourself, "Move data directory"
  works across drives with progress, shared (ngrok/Cloudflare) URLs no longer redirect
  back to `.test`, HeidiSQL opens properly, and install buttons show accurate progress.
- **PhpStorm / JetBrains AI support** — "Set up detected clients" now configures Junie
  automatically, so JetBrains IDEs can drive your stack over MCP like the other clients.
- **Per-project Git panel** — each site has a full Git tab: staged/unstaged changes with
  status colours, stage/unstage/discard, commit, branch switch + create, fetch/pull/push with
  ahead/behind counts, and recent history (click a hash to copy).
- **More PostgreSQL versions + custom install** — pick from more Postgres releases, or type any
  version and EnvKit installs it.
- **Broader AI/MCP control** — assistants can now drive far more of the app: create sites, run
  Git actions, manage databases and cron jobs, install services, and change settings.
- **Latest bundled tools** — Git 2.55, GitHub CLI 2.95, and Python 3.12.10.
- **Angular support** — Angular projects are auto-detected and served at trusted `.test`
  HTTPS with live reload, joining Next.js, React/Vite, and any Node/Express app.
- **macOS support** — EnvKit now ships a signed app for **Apple Silicon (arm64)** Macs,
  with the same one-click stack, `.test` HTTPS, and AI/MCP control.
- **MySQL 8** — install Oracle MySQL 8 side-by-side with MariaDB; each version lives in its
  own directory.
- **Custom versions** — type any version of MySQL/MariaDB, nginx, Node.js, MongoDB, Redis,
  PostgreSQL, or Python and EnvKit installs it for you.
- **Self-healing & resilient downloads** — service archives are mirrored on GitHub (no more
  broken installs when an upstream moves), and a corrupt services manifest repairs itself.
- **Faster, cancellable installs** — non-blocking extraction (no UI freeze) and a **Stop**
  button on every install.

## Install

### Windows

Download the latest **`EnvKit-Setup-x.y.z.exe`** from the
[releases page](https://github.com/Env-Kit/envkit-releases/releases/latest) and run it.
(SmartScreen may warn on first run — **More info → Run anyway**; EnvKit is self-signed.)

### macOS (Apple Silicon)

One-line install (downloads the latest macOS build, strips the Gatekeeper quarantine, opens it):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Env-Kit/envkit-releases/main/install.sh | bash
```

Run the same command again any time to update. To uninstall: add `-s -- --uninstall`.

> The installer always fetches the newest release that ships a macOS build. Windows and
> macOS are released independently, so the very latest tag is sometimes Windows-only — the
> script (and the in-app updater) skip past it to the latest Mac build automatically.

Or download **`EnvKit-x.y.z-arm64.dmg`** manually from the
[releases page](https://github.com/Env-Kit/envkit-releases/releases) (pick the newest release
that lists an `-arm64.dmg` asset), open it, and
drag **EnvKit** to Applications. On first launch, **right-click the app → Open** (or run
`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/EnvKit.app`) to get past Gatekeeper — the app
is Developer-ID signed but not yet notarized (notarization is pending on Apple's side; we'll
switch it on as soon as it's available, no action needed on your end).

EnvKit no longer supports Intel Macs — Apple Silicon (M-series) only.

EnvKit **auto-updates** on both platforms: once installed, it checks GitHub for new releases
and installs them in place (Settings → Updates lets you check/download manually). On first
launch a short **onboarding wizard** asks your source — **Load from Laragon** (a guided
detect → import flow, including databases) or **Start fresh** (pick your stack and install
the runtimes it needs).

Upgrading from a previous version? Your data directory, certificates, and settings are
**migrated automatically** on first launch — nothing to do.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 / 11, or
- macOS 12 Monterey or later (Apple Silicon only)

## What EnvKit changes on your system

EnvKit is designed to run side-by-side with whatever you already have installed. For
developers who want the full picture, this is everything it touches (Windows):

- **Windows Defender exclusions.** The installer excludes EnvKit's install folder
  (real-time scanning otherwise locks the freshly installed exe and the first launch
  fails), and the app excludes its own `services` and `tools` folders plus the bundled
  service executables (php, nginx, mysqld, …) so scanning doesn't quarantine or slow
  them. The installer's exclusion is removed on uninstall. Only Microsoft Defender is
  affected; scoped to EnvKit's own folders.
- **Trusted certificates.** Two certificates go into the Trusted Root store: EnvKit's
  code-signing certificate (so auto-updates verify — there is no paid EV/OV cert yet),
  and the local CA that signs the HTTPS certificates for your `.test` sites. The
  code-signing cert is removed on uninstall.
- **hosts file.** One `127.0.0.1 <site>.test` entry per site, removed when the site is
  removed.
- **PATH.** The bundled tools (php, composer, node, git, mysql, redis-cli, …) are added
  to your user PATH (optionally machine PATH) and kept in sync. Settings → Environment
  shows the exact folders and lets you re-sync or opt out.
- **No Windows services, no firewall rules, no drivers.** Services (nginx, PHP, MySQL,
  …) run as child processes of the app: they start when EnvKit starts and stop when it
  quits.

Existing software (PHP, Node, PostgreSQL, nginx installed on your machine) is never
replaced, modified, or uninstalled — EnvKit installs its own copies inside its data
directory and runs them side-by-side. Processes belonging to installed Windows services
or Program Files software are left running; only portable dev stacks that hold the same
ports/locks (Laragon, XAMPP, WAMP) are stopped during an install.

## Highlights

- **Windows _and_ macOS** — one app, the same stack on both (signed build for Apple Silicon).
- **nginx _or_ Apache**, switchable in Settings — PHP via FastCGI on both.
- **Trusted `.test` HTTPS** for every site via an auto-installed local CA.
- **Multiple PHP versions** with **per-site isolation** and **Xdebug on-demand**.
- **Bundled databases & tools** — MySQL/MariaDB (incl. **MySQL 8**), PostgreSQL, Redis,
  **MongoDB**, **Mailpit**, Node.js, **Python**, phpMyAdmin, plus Composer/Git/gh/nvm/ngrok/Cmder
  installers.
- **Custom versions** — install an arbitrary typed version of MySQL/MariaDB, nginx, Node.js,
  MongoDB, Redis, PostgreSQL, or Python.
- **Per-project Git** — a built-in Git panel per site: stage/commit, branches, fetch/pull/push,
  and history, with bundled Git + GitHub CLI.
- **Node / React / Next.js / Angular / Vite dev sites** reverse-proxied at `.test` HTTPS with
  **hot-reload**, plus a **live dev-server output** viewer.
- **Laravel Reverb (WebSockets)** — one-click install, supervise, and proxy per site.
- **Import from Laragon** — projects **and** databases (incl. MySQL → MariaDB transfer).
- **Diagnose & self-heal services** — find port conflicts / stale PIDs / bad configs and
  repair them.
- **AI control via MCP** — let Claude Code/Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, Zed, OpenCode,
  Gemini CLI, or PhpStorm/JetBrains (via Junie) operate your stack: add/remove sites, manage
  MySQL databases, start/stop and diagnose services.
- **Clean PATH, your way** — sync to the **user** or **system (Machine)** PATH, with stale
  entries pruned and **competing stacks (Laragon/XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP/Herd…) auto-removed** so
  nothing shadows EnvKit's `php`/`mysql`/`nginx`.
- **Light/dark, fully translated (EN + AR, RTL)** native UI in the tray.
- **Free to use** (proprietary — not open source) with **silent auto-update**.

## AI access (MCP)

EnvKit ships an MCP server so AI assistants can operate your local stack.

1. Open **Settings → AI** and toggle **Enable MCP server**.
2. Click **Set up AI clients** — EnvKit registers itself **globally** with Claude Code /
   Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, Zed, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, and PhpStorm/JetBrains
   (via Junie), and installs an `envkit` skill. (Or copy the shown URL config into your
   client's `mcpServers` yourself — for the JetBrains AI Assistant chat, paste it in
   Settings → Tools → AI Assistant → Model Context Protocol → Add.)
3. **Restart your AI client**, then ask things like *"start redis"*, *"diagnose why mysql
   won't start, then repair it"*, or *"list my Laravel sites"*.

The endpoint is local-only (`http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp`), bearer-token authenticated, off
by default, and only works while EnvKit is running.
