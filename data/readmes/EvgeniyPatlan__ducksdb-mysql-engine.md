# ducksdb-mysql-engine

An **in-tree DuckDB storage engine for MySQL 9.7**.

Create a table with `ENGINE=DuckDB` and analytical queries against it execute
inside DuckDB's columnar/vectorized engine **automatically** — no
`SECONDARY_ENGINE=` / `SECONDARY_LOAD` ceremony. One server, one SQL interface.

The engine is built into `mysqld` as a MANDATORY storage engine and registers a
small server hook (`handlerton::pushdown_select`, added by the patches in
`server-patches/`) that lets it take over execution of a whole SELECT whose base
tables are all `ENGINE=DuckDB`: the query is regenerated in DuckDB's dialect, run
in DuckDB, and the result streamed back. Anything it can't translate declines
transparently and falls back to normal MySQL execution.

The pushdown covers aggregates, inner/outer joins, derived tables, CTEs, scalar
subqueries, and `IN` / `EXISTS` / `NOT IN` / `NOT EXISTS` predicates — **all 22
TPC-H queries push down and return results identical to InnoDB.** On SF10 the
engine is on par with MariaDB's `ENGINE=DuckDB` (see
[docs/tpch_sf10_mariadb_comparison.md](docs/tpch_sf10_mariadb_comparison.md)).

## Run with Docker

A prebuilt image ships MySQL 9.7 with the engine already built in:

```sh
docker run -d --name mysql-duckdb -p 3306:3306 \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret \
  -v mysql-duckdb-data:/var/lib/mysql \
  evgeniypatlan/test-images:mysql-9.7-duckdb-v0.2.0

mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -psecret -e "
  CREATE DATABASE shop; USE shop;
  CREATE TABLE sales (id INT PRIMARY KEY, region INT, amount DECIMAL(12,2)) ENGINE=DuckDB;
  INSERT INTO sales VALUES (1,1,100),(2,1,200),(3,2,50);
  SELECT region, SUM(amount) FROM sales GROUP BY region;"
```

See [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md) for configuration and persistence,
and [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md) for the full query guide.

## Layout

- `engine/` — the handler (`ha_duckdb`) and the whole-query pushdown
  (`duckdb_pushdown`).
- `common/` — the shared storage/type/DML/transaction/util layer.
- `server-patches/` — the MySQL server patches the engine depends on (applied into
  the build tree by `scripts/build-server.sh`).
- `cmake/` — DuckDB acquisition (prebuilt prefix, or built from source via
  `ExternalProject`).
- `engine/test/` — standalone GoogleTest/CTest unit suite.
- `mysql-test-suite/` — MTR tests (`suite=duckdb`).
- `bench/` — benchmark harness (InnoDB vs the DuckDB engine).

## Build & test

```sh
scripts/build-server.sh     # configure + build mysqld with the engine
scripts/run-mtr.sh          # MTR suite=duckdb
engine/test/run-tests.sh    # unit tests
```

DuckDB is resolved from a prebuilt prefix (`DUCKDB_ROOT` / vendored
`vendor/duckdb-prefix`) when available, otherwise built from source — so a clean
checkout builds with no `DUCKDB_ROOT` set.
