Production-ready **WinUI 3 starter template** for Windows desktop apps: a real app shell with updates, settings, diagnostics, and release automation already wired up.

It is built for teams that want a real app shell instead of a blank canvas: **MVVM**, **Mica window**, **system tray**, **Velopack auto-updates**, **localization**, **logging**, **SQLite**, **typed HTTP client**, and a **release pipeline** already wired up.

## Install the template

```powershell
dotnet new install DevTem.Templates
```

Scaffold a full app:

```powershell
dotnet new devtem-winui -n AcmeDesk --displayName "Acme Desk" --company "Acme" --repo "acme/desk-app" --scheme "acme://"
```

Or add a page to an existing app:

```powershell
dotnet new devtem-page -n Orders
```

## Why DevTem

### DevTem vs. the official blank templates

| Option | Best for | What is missing | DevTem tradeoff |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Official `dotnet new` WinUI blank | Learning WinUI basics | App shell, updates, tray, settings, diagnostics, release automation | Not a production starter |
| Template Studio | Visual scaffolding | Opinionated desktop app starter, release workflow, ready-made working patterns | More wizard-driven, less code-first |
| DevTem | Real-world desktop app starter | Some flexibility in favor of a working baseline | Curated defaults; composable at scaffold time |

DevTem is not trying to compete with the official blank app as a minimal "hello world." It is the production-ready WinUI 3 starter for the workloads that blank templates leave out on purpose.

## What ships out of the box

- WinUI 3 / Windows App SDK on .NET 10
- Mica-based desktop shell with native title bar behavior
- System tray support with single-instance activation
- Auto-updates (Velopack installer + deltas by default; zero-dependency checker or none at scaffold time; native AppInstaller / Store updates for packaged MSIX)
- First-run welcome (installers own setup choices; wizard page available but never auto-opens)
- Packaged MSIX distribution with runtime-adaptive paths, autostart, and protocol (`--distribution msix`)
- 3-language runtime localization (en-US, es-ES, fr-FR; English-only at scaffold time)
- Logging through one facade (Serilog console + file by default; MEL or none at scaffold time)
- Optional Sentry crash reporting (DSN-gated; SDK droppable at scaffold time)
- SQLite data layer and typed HTTP client (each droppable at scaffold time)
- MVVM pattern with CommunityToolkit.Mvvm
- GitHub Actions release pipeline and version tag flow

Every bullet above except MVVM/Mica is a scaffold-time choice: the repo
app shows the all-on reference, `dotnet new devtem-winui --help` lists
the flags, and each scaffold records its picks in a generated
`docs/FEATURES.md` (see `docs/template-features.json` for the schema).

## What's new in 0.0.27-beta

- Clean-scaffold pass from real-app pain: `remove-sample-content.ps1`
  (inverse of `add-page.ps1`), neutral default strings, per-update-mode
  first-run notes, runtime-resolved repo/license links
- `add-page.ps1` heals itself: temp-copy activation for the dormant
  nested template, `--route` probe with remediation, nav-anchor fallback
  for restyled shells (plus a parity hole closed: dormant config is now
  content-compared)
- Runtime hardening kit: dialog uncollapse pattern, 60s picker timeout,
  XAML symbol audit, unit-conversion/change-epoch helpers, DI gate test,
  build-commit surfacing

Earlier releases: full notes in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Quick demo

This repo is both a full sample app and the source of the project template. It demonstrates a working desktop app model that you can customize rather than build from a bare shell.

```text
App shell
├── Home page
├── Settings page
├── Toasts + native update dialogs (check → download → restart)
├── First-run welcome (installers own setup)
├── Tray + toast behavior
├── Update checks + restart prompt
├── Localization + theme persistence
└── Release pipeline ready to use
```

## FAQ

### Why does Check for updates say "only available for installed apps"?

That message is correct when the app runs unpackaged (`dotnet run` or a
loose exe): Velopack can only apply updates to an installed app. Run the
installed build (Start menu entry or `setup.exe` install) for real update
checks. If an *installed* build says it, check
`%LocalAppData%\DevTemWinUi3\Logs` — every check stage is logged there.

### Is this a good WinUI 3 starter template?

Yes. DevTem is designed as a production-ready starter for desktop apps, not a bare sample. It includes the plumbing teams usually end up recreating: update checks, tray integration, app settings, i18n, logging, and release automation.

### Is this better than the official blank WinUI app?

For a real application, yes. The official blank app is the correct starting point for learning WinUI or writing a minimal app from scratch. DevTem is the better starting point when you want a working desktop app foundation from day one.
