# Dispatcher SDK: local task execution and orchestration

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) | [Wiki](wiki/Home.md) | [Docs for coding agents](DocsforAgents/README.md) | [API documentation](docs/SDK.md)

Dispatcher runs Python functions and scripts, controls timeouts and cancellation,
and saves task state, results and notifications in SQLite. An Agent application
can resume queued work after restart and subscribe to completion or recovery
notifications.

Scripts can also run in remote sandboxes. The SDK collects output and artifacts
within configured limits and records the resources that still need cleanup after
an interruption. The core uses only Python's standard library and SQLite.

## What you can do

| Capability | Where it helps |
| --- | --- |
| Execution isolation and control | Run tasks in separate processes. In process mode, timeouts and cancellation terminate the supervised process tree to handle stuck tool calls. |
| Sandbox execution | Run scripts through a pluggable `SandboxBackend`, collect bounded output and artifacts, and persist lifecycle state for cleanup and recovery. The optional OpenSandbox adapter requires its SDK and a separate sandbox service. |
| Durable execution | Save tasks, results, and notifications in SQLite. Queued work remains available when you close and reopen the database. |
| Bounded retries | Configure attempt limits and backoff for retryable failures, avoiding endless reruns. |
| External effect recovery | Save receipts for file writes and API calls registered through the Effect interface. When an interruption leaves the outcome uncertain, wait for the application to verify and resolve it. |
| Multi-step orchestration | Record dependencies, business attempts, and wait conditions. The application decides when to dispatch, rework, or finish. |
| Results and notifications | Read execution results and script logs, and notify the application so its Agent can continue without repeated LLM progress checks. |
| Execution observations | Inspect process state, output bytes, model and tool activity, application progress and structured waits. Heartbeats and logs do not count as application progress. |
| Inherited execution budgets | Carry Run, parent and local deadlines into child work. Recovery retains clock floors and refuses new work while a required clock sample remains unresolved. |
| Managed stall supervision | Run a registered supervisor handler with reserved capacity, memory limits and an original notice budget. Capacity or memory shortages remain visible; the application decides whether to continue or cancel work. |

Dispatcher is a Python SDK embedded in your application. It needs no separate
queue service and is not tied to a particular model or Agent framework.
The optional OpenSandbox adapter
adds the pinned `opensandbox` dependency and requires a separate sandbox service.

## When to use Dispatcher

Use Dispatcher when your Agent application needs to run tools or scripts, limit
execution time, retain task state, or organize tasks into a recoverable workflow.
You can also use it for a single function task without adding notifications or
multi-step orchestration.

Your application defines the work and its acceptance criteria, then decides what
happens next. Dispatcher controls execution, records state and delivers messages.
Keep the host process running while work executes in the background.

Integration boundaries:

- Process mode contains trusted code with timeouts, cancellation, and process cleanup. It does not provide a filesystem, network, or permission sandbox for untrusted code. Agent-generated code still needs application review or an additional sandbox.
- Linux process mode uses subreaper cleanup for detached descendants; other POSIX platforms use process-group cleanup. Native Windows process and script execution uses Job Objects. Earlier native tests passed on Windows 11 x64 (build 10.0.26100.9168) with Python 3.12.10; see [Windows runtime](docs/WINDOWS_RUNTIME.md) for their scope. The acceptance index records native matrix evidence and its scope. Thread mode cannot forcibly stop a blocked handler.
- Resume with the original database and matching handler deployment. Reopening the database does not reset retry budgets or guarantee that interrupted tasks will automatically rerun.
- The SDK cannot undo a write or API call that has already happened. Uncertain outcomes require verification before recovery; arbitrary operations are not guaranteed to happen exactly once.
- `Dispatcher` durably accepts and deduplicates notifications in its built-in inbox. User callbacks remain at-least-once; external calls need idempotency. Use `consume_results` for atomic local SQL and receipt settlement.

The current source version is `0.7.2` and requires Python 3.10+.
Kernel storage uses schema 5; Orchestrator storage uses schema 4. Older databases
need an explicit upgrade. Read [storage and upgrades](docs/STORAGE_AND_UPGRADES.md)
and the [compatibility guide](docs/PUBLIC_API.md) before opening them with this version.

Execution observations and managed supervision are documented in the
[execution guide](docs/EXECUTION_OBSERVABILITY.md). The
[acceptance index](docs/EXECUTION_OBSERVABILITY_ACCEPTANCE.md) records installed-package
and native matrix evidence, applicable skips and validation limits.

## Install

To install from source, run these commands in a Linux terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FlightDan/dispatcher-sdk.git
cd dispatcher-sdk
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install .
```

In Windows PowerShell, activate the environment with `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`.
You can also download a wheel from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/FlightDan/dispatcher-sdk/releases)
and install it with `python -m pip install <path-to-wheel>`.

## Quick start: one managed task

`Dispatcher` owns the runtime, background host, startup deployment checks and
notification inbox. Start with handlers, tasks and stable request IDs. Advanced
workflows can still use the Kernel and Orchestrator APIs below.

```python
from pathlib import Path
import tempfile

from dispatcher_sdk import Dispatcher


def double(payload, context):
    return payload * 2


def main():
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as directory:
        path = Path(directory) / "tasks.sqlite3"
        with Dispatcher(path, {"double": double}) as app:
            task = app.submit("double", 21, request_id="message-42")
            result = task.wait(timeout=10)
            print(result["value"])


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```text
42
```

Use a persistent database path in your application; the temporary directory is
only for this demo. Reopen the same path and call `app.task("message-42")` to
recover the handle. Repeating the same submission and request ID returns the
original task; changing its content raises a conflict. Keep the application
process alive while the context is running. The default is process isolation.

For background results, pass `on_result=callback` to `Dispatcher`. Notifications
are durably accepted before callback processing, and callback failures retry
without rerunning the task. For local application SQL, use
`app.consume_results(mutation)` instead: its `(connection, notification)` callback
commits SQL and the consumed marker together. Neither API promises exactly-once
external API calls. Execution success does not decide business acceptance.

See the [0.7 design and migration notes](docs/DEV_0_7.md) and
[managed application API](docs/MANAGED_APPLICATION.md).

## Advanced integration examples

### 1. Stop a stuck task and its child process on timeout

Tool calls can block or launch additional child processes. Process mode cleans up
the supervised process tree after a timeout so the application can run other tasks.

In this Linux example, a function sleeps for 30 seconds and starts a child that
also sleeps. Its execution timeout is 2 seconds. After checking that the function
process and its child have exited, the example runs a normal task with the same
runtime to verify that it can continue working.

```sh
python examples/isolation_timeout.py
```

Expected output:

```text
timeout: timed_out; handler and child are gone
next task: succeeded
```

<!-- example-platform: linux -->

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
import sys
import tempfile
import time

from dispatcher_sdk.execution_kernel import ExecutionCommandV2, Kernel, RetryPolicy


def sleep_with_child(payload, _context):
    child = os.fork()
    if child == 0:
        time.sleep(30)
        os._exit(0)
    Path(payload["pid_file"]).write_text(f"{os.getpid()} {child}", encoding="ascii")
    time.sleep(30)


sleep_with_child.__execution_kernel_revision__ = "isolation-timeout-v1"


def echo(payload, _context):
    return payload


echo.__execution_kernel_revision__ = "isolation-timeout-v1"


def command(runtime, execution_id, handler_id, payload, timeout_seconds):
    return ExecutionCommandV2(
        execution_id=execution_id,
        idempotency_key=execution_id,
        registry_revision=runtime.registry_revision,
        correlation_id=execution_id,
        causation_id=None,
        handler_id=handler_id,
        handler_contract_version=1,
        retry_policy=RetryPolicy(max_attempts=1),
        timeout_seconds=timeout_seconds,
        payload=payload,
    )


def assert_gone(pid):
    try:
        os.kill(pid, 0)
    except ProcessLookupError:
        return
    raise AssertionError(f"PID {pid} survived timeout cleanup")


def main():
    if os.name != "posix" or not sys.platform.startswith("linux"):
        raise SystemExit("This example requires Linux process isolation.")

    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory(prefix="dispatcher-isolation-") as directory:
        root = Path(directory)
        pid_file = root / "pids.txt"
        handlers = {"sleep": sleep_with_child, "echo": echo}
        with Kernel.open_sqlite(root / "jobs.sqlite3", handlers, isolation_mode="process") as runtime:
            runtime.submit(command(runtime, "timeout", "sleep", {"pid_file": str(pid_file)}, 2))
            timed_out = runtime.run_once()
            assert timed_out.state == "timed_out", timed_out.state
            assert timed_out.result.error.code == "handler_timeout"
            assert pid_file.exists(), "timed-out handler never reached startup"
            pids = [int(value) for value in pid_file.read_text(encoding="ascii").split()]
            assert len(pids) == 2, pids
            for pid in pids:
                assert_gone(pid)
            print("timeout: timed_out; handler and child are gone")

            runtime.submit(command(runtime, "next", "echo", {"message": "reused"}, 2))
            succeeded = runtime.run_once()
            assert succeeded.state == "succeeded"
            assert succeeded.result.value == {"message": "reused"}
            print("next task: succeeded")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The example runs a trusted function and records its PIDs in a temporary directory
for the cleanup checks. It controls the process lifecycle without restricting
the function's filesystem or network access.

</details>

Applications can also cancel tasks explicitly with `runtime.cancel`. Process mode
cleans up the supervised process tree. Thread mode only revokes authority to
publish results and Effects; it cannot forcibly stop a blocked thread.
If an interruption leaves an unresolved external operation, the task may enter
`recovery_required` instead of ending immediately. `ScriptSpec` executions register
an Effect, so check recovery state when a script is interrupted.
See [isolation and lifecycle behavior](docs/PUBLIC_API.md).

### 2. Resume queued work after restart and reconcile interrupted external operations

If your application exits after submission, reopening the same database lets it
claim work that was already queued. The [persistence example](examples/kernel_task.py)
submits a task, closes the runtime, reopens the database, and executes the task,
printing `{'total': 60}`:

```sh
python examples/kernel_task.py
```

If a task writes a file but crashes before saving its operation receipt, rerunning
it directly could duplicate the write. The [recovery example](examples/effect_recovery.py)
exits its worker at this point. The application inspects the file,
confirms the write happened, records that decision with `resolve_effect`, and
resumes execution while verifying there was no second write:

```sh
python examples/effect_recovery.py
```

Register external operations through `context.effects.execute_once`. Committed
receipts can be reused; unresolved operations enter `recovery_required` for the
application to resolve using external evidence. The example uses a controllable
clock to skip the lease wait and operates only on temporary files.

Ordinary execution failures and lease-expiry redelivery share
`RetryPolicy.max_attempts`, which includes the first claim and defaults to 1.
Set bounded attempts and backoff according to whether the task is safe to retry.
Business rework uses explicit new attempts, counted separately from execution
retries and notification redelivery. See the [recovery and retry guide](docs/SDK_RECOVERY.md).

### 3. Choose the next task based on the previous result

Before continuing, reworking, or waiting in an Agent workflow, your application
may need to inspect the previous result. Organize task dependencies within a Run
and explicitly submit the next step after reading that result.

The [dependency example](examples/dependent_tasks.py) first calculates an invoice
total. The application checks the result, passes it to a dependent receipt task,
and explicitly finishes the Run, printing `Invoice total: 60`:

```sh
python examples/dependent_tasks.py
```

A successful dependency does not automatically dispatch its successor, and a
successful task does not automatically finish the Run. Applications can also
register wait conditions, release them when satisfied, or submit a new business
attempt. See [SDK operations and orchestration](docs/SDK.md).

## Integrate with your Agent application

Choose the entry points you need:

| Capability | Entry points and application responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| Function execution and isolation | Register handlers and select isolation with `Kernel.open_sqlite`; set the command timeout and `RetryPolicy`. |
| Scripts and logs | Use `ScriptSpec` to specify source, interpreter, working directory, and log directory; set the timeout with `.command()`. |
| Persistence and recovery | Keep a fixed database path and matching handler deployment. Record external operations with `context.effects.execute_once` and use evidence to `resolve_effect`. |
| Dependencies, waits, and business rework | Create a Run with `Orchestrator`; use `apply_operations` to explicitly submit tasks, dependencies, waits, new attempts, and completion. |
| Background execution | Use `RuntimeHost` for standalone execution or `OrchestratorHost` to drive execution, synchronization, and notifications for orchestration. |
| Application notifications | Associate a conversation or business task through `watch_task`'s `target`. Durably accept and deduplicate notifications in the callback; let the inbox consumer continue the workflow. |
| Activity and child work | Report through `context.activity`, inspect with `task.observe()`, and use `context.budget` and `context.children` for inherited deadlines and child execution. |
| Stall supervision | Configure `task.watch_stall(...)`, subscribe with `app.subscribe_stalls(...)`, and inspect reserved supervisor execution with `app.stall_supervisor_status(...)`. See the observation guide for callback and managed-handler options. |
