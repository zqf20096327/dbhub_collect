Turn YouTube into a cumulative, local-first research system. Acquire VTT
sources, search timestamped evidence with SQLite/FTS5, measure coverage and
freshness, grow the corpus through explicit decisions, then use the result from
the web app, CLI, or a read-only MCP in Claude Code and Codex.

For scientific literature, [Paper Insights](https://github.com/FlorianBruniaux/paper-insights)
is the companion project for arXiv metadata, local FTS5 search, and citations.
It is experimental, with human relevance review still pending. The two
projects keep separate corpora; cross-corpus federation is planned.

[Critical source review](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-22-critical-source-review-design.md)
is a planned extension for both projects. For videos, it will assess added
value and evidential support from inspected timestamped passages, record
coverage limits, and keep editorial selection reversible. Current coverage,
freshness, summaries, and Shorts scores are not quality verdicts; this filter
is not implemented yet.

Every research cycle starts with local evidence. If it is insufficient,
YT Insights presents at most ten YouTube candidates and waits for a separate
approval of one to five exact IDs before acquisition. It then rebuilds the
derived indexes and asks the sufficiency question again. Catalogue search,
FTS5 search, and deterministic exports do not require an LLM.

![yt-insights workflow: preview and acquire VTT sources, build the local catalogue and FTS5 index, assess coverage and freshness, ask whether evidence is sufficient, acquire only approved IDs, then use the corpus through the local web app, CLI, read-only MCP, Claude Code, or Codex.](docs/assets/yt-insights-workflow.jpg)

The diagram reflects the shipped local workflow. Its reviewable branching
version is available as [Mermaid source](docs/assets/cumulative-research-workflow.mmd).
See the [delivery recap](docs/DELIVERY-RECAP.md) for every implemented surface
and the [implementation status](docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md) for SHA-bound
test evidence and remaining external validation.

## Start here

| Goal | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Check a local installation | `uv run yt-insights doctor --json` | Secret-safe dependency, corpus, index, catalog, and optional backend status |
| Preview an acquisition | `uv run yt-insights acquire URL --dry-run --json` | Selected videos and exclusions, with no corpus write |
| Acquire one channel | `uv run yt-insights acquire URL --slug NAME --yes` | VTT and metadata under the configured data root |
| Export one transcript | `uv run yt-insights export video VIDEO_ID --format md` | Sourced VTT, text, or timestamped Markdown |
| Analyze a channel | `uv run yt-insights run https://www.youtube.com/@ChannelName` | Transcripts, structured insights, and an aggregate report |
| Index an existing corpus | `uv run yt-insights catalog import-corpus ./output` | One deduplicated SQLite catalog with durable import errors |
| Build the timestamped search index | `uv run yt-insights index --all` | A derived FTS5 index over every VTT passage |
| Find a sourced passage | `uv run yt-insights search "AI product discovery"` | Ranked excerpts, timestamps, and direct YouTube links |
| Start cumulative research | `uv run yt-insights research start "AI product engineering workflows" --json` | A durable local assessment and a mandatory sufficiency question |
| Resume research | `uv run yt-insights research status SESSION_ID --json` | Revision, evidence, candidates, required action, and the latest 100 acquisition attempts |
| Export an evidence dossier | `uv run yt-insights research export SESSION_ID --output /absolute/path --json` | Deterministic `dossier.md` and `manifest.json`, kept outside source indexes |
| Query from an LLM client | `uv run --extra mcp yt-insights-mcp` | Four read-only corpus, video, and passage tools |
| Open the local web app | `uv run yt-insights serve` | Bilingual FR/EN loopback-only dashboard, search, sources, research decisions, jobs, and exports |

Analysis uses a local or cloud LLM. Catalog import, transcript indexing, and
both search commands do not. Repeated runs reuse analysis caches and avoid
duplicating unchanged catalog artifacts.

Before the first cumulative session, acquire at least one source or import an
existing corpus, then build the timestamped index. A successful
`research start ... --json` returns a `session_id`, a `revision`, coverage and freshness,
plus `required_user_action=confirm_sufficiency_or_refresh`. It never contacts
YouTube.

### Use the web app in five steps

Run `uv run yt-insights serve`, then follow the workflow shown on the dashboard:

1. **Collect:** open **Sources**, preview a video, playlist, or channel, review
   the selected IDs, then confirm the acquisition.
2. **Search:** open **Search** to query the existing transcript passages before
   requesting more sources.
3. **Assess:** open **Research**, describe the question and useful angles, then
   inspect coverage and freshness.
4. **Decide:** mark the evidence sufficient or request discovery. Discovery
   still requires a separate approval of one to five exact video IDs.
5. **Use:** open **Exports** for deterministic dossiers, or query the same corpus
   from Claude Code or Codex through the read-only MCP.

Each task page repeats the relevant three-step instructions. The interface uses
the dark theme by default, remembers a light-theme preference, and stays usable
on a narrow mobile viewport. It starts in French when the browser prefers
French, otherwise in English. The `EN` and `FR` controls persist an explicit
choice. Only interface copy is translated: video titles, transcripts, excerpts,
queries, and dossiers keep their source language. The server remains local to
`127.0.0.1`.

---

## What it's actually for

Point it at a YouTube channel to keep the VTT sources locally, generate one
structured insight file per video, and build an aggregate report across the
channel. The same VTT corpus can be indexed as timestamped passages, searched
from the CLI, or queried by an LLM through MCP while preserving the source link.

The Shorts pipeline uses those transcripts to score the top three moments per
video, with verbatim text and precise timestamps. After you choose one,
`yt-dlp` downloads that segment instead of the full video.

Use it for content research, competitive monitoring, editorial analysis, or
building a searchable source library across several channels. Deterministic
exports in VTT, text, or Markdown can feed an article, a RAG pipeline, or a
dataset without asking an LLM to rewrite the source.

yt-insights uses subtitles already exposed as VTT by YouTube. It does not
download audio for transcription. Audio transcription remains outside the
runtime because it would add media downloads, compute cost, and a second text
source without a demonstrated missing-subtitle use case.

## How it works

### Four local data layers

| Layer | Purpose | Mutation boundary |
|---|---|---|
| VTT and metadata files | Immutable source text, timestamps, and YouTube identity | Added only by explicit acquisition |
| `catalog.sqlite3` | Inventory, memberships, artifacts, import runs, and durable errors | Rebuilt and atomically published from source files |
| `.search/search-v1.sqlite3` | Derived FTS5 passages with timestamped YouTube URLs | Rebuilt and atomically published from VTT files |
| `.research/research-v1.sqlite3` | Sessions, assessments, decisions, candidates, attempts, and events | Updated by the `research` state machine |

`dossier.md` and `manifest.json` are deterministic publications, not a fifth
source layer. They never enter the catalogue or FTS index.

<summary>Key design decisions</summary>

- yt-dlp runs as a subprocess, never imported as a library (subprocess is the stable contract)
- `stop_reason == "max_tokens"` gates writes: truncated responses are never cached, retried on next run
- Insight and Shorts generation send at most 10,000 transcript characters per LLM call. The CLI reports `USED/TOTAL` before each real call and marks truncation without printing transcript content. Cache hits do not call the model or print this line. The full timestamped VTT remains available to the FTS index; long-form LLM analysis is not chunked yet.
- `ThreadPoolExecutor` over asyncio: `httpx.Client` is thread-safe, no event loop needed
- YouTube VTT rolling captions repeat each phrase 2-3x as it scrolls; `vtt_parser.py` tracks first occurrence per unique text fragment, giving clean timestamped segments

</details>

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or later
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) installed in PATH (`brew install yt-dlp` or `pip install yt-dlp`)
- At least one LLM backend (see [Backends](#backends))

---

## Installation

The project is not published on PyPI. Install the checked-out source with
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlorianBruniaux/youtube-video-insights
cd youtube-video-insights
uv sync --extra dev
uv run yt-insights --help
```

Add the optional MCP server when a local LLM client needs to query the index:

```bash
uv sync --extra mcp --extra dev
```

The versioned `uv.lock` fixes the complete application environment. See
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for a standard `venv` and editable-install alternative.

The wheel already contains the compiled web interface. Running it needs Python,
not Node.js:

```bash
uv run yt-insights serve
# Keep the browser closed when starting from an agent or terminal multiplexer.
uv run yt-insights serve --no-open
```

The server binds only to `127.0.0.1` and does not provide remote access, user
accounts, CORS, or a hosted sharing URL. Browser mutations require a per-process
token fetched from the same origin. Stop the process with `Ctrl-C`.

For a machine with no local LLM (no Ollama, no GPU), see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md): it covers every backend option step by step (Anthropic API key, Ollama, cc-bridge, any other OpenAI-compatible provider).

---

## Quick start

```bash
# Use one absolute corpus from any working directory
export YT_INSIGHTS_DATA_ROOT="$HOME/Library/Application Support/yt-insights/corpus"

# Validate the local runtime without changing the corpus or calling an LLM
uv run yt-insights doctor --json

# Preview first. Channel, playlist, and batch acquisition require --yes.
uv run yt-insights acquire https://www.youtube.com/@DevWithAIYoutube --dry-run --json
uv run yt-insights acquire https://www.youtube.com/@DevWithAIYoutube --slug dev-with-ai --yes

# Export source material without an LLM
uv run yt-insights export video VIDEO_ID --format md

# Full pipeline: download subtitles + analyze + aggregate report
uv run yt-insights run https://www.youtube.com/@DevWithAIYoutube

# Re-analyze existing VTT files (no download)
uv run yt-insights run https://www.youtube.com/@DevWithAIYoutube --skip-download

# Regenerate the aggregate report only
uv run yt-insights report

# Suggest Shorts from all existing VTT files
uv run yt-insights suggest-shorts

# Suggest Shorts for a single talk
uv run yt-insights suggest-shorts --vtt output/transcripts/20260423-talk.vtt

# Regenerate the global Shorts index (no LLM call)
uv run yt-insights suggest-shorts --index-only

# Download a specific clip segment (no full-video download)
uv run yt-insights generate-short VIDEO_ID --start 00:05:10 --end 00:05:55 --title "hook-context-engineering"
```

### Local web research flow

`yt-insights serve` exposes the same durable data and workflow as the CLI. The
dashboard starts with a five-step guide and every task page provides contextual
instructions:

1. Preview a YouTube video, playlist, or channel under **Sources**, inspect every
   selected ID, then confirm the background acquisition job.
2. Search the existing transcript index under **Search**.
3. Start a session under **Research** and answer
   `Is the current evidence sufficient?` before any discovery.
4. If discovery is requested, approve one to five exact candidates or cancel.
5. Open the deterministic dossier under **Exports**, or query the read-only MCP
   from an LLM client.

Failed jobs are never resubmitted automatically. A stale session reloads the
durable snapshot and asks for the decision again. If the UI reports that the
search index is unavailable, run `uv run yt-insights catalog import-corpus
CORPUS`, then `uv run yt-insights index --all`, and restart the server.

The interface is available in English and French. With no saved preference, it
follows the browser language. Use the `EN` or `FR` control in the header to
override it. That preference survives reloads and applies to static guidance,
form labels, validation messages, job states, and research decisions. Corpus
content is never machine-translated.

Expected output, with paths shortened to keep the example readable:

```
Resolved backend: backend=ollama endpoint=http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1 model=qwen3:8b
Downloading subtitles from https://www.youtube.com/@DevWithAIYoutube ...
  47 subtitle file(s) downloaded.

Analyzing 47 video(s) with model 'qwen3:8b' ...
Transcript input: 10000/45678 characters (truncated)
  47 insight(s) generated:
    output/insights/<video>.md

Generating aggregate report ...
Resolved backend: backend=ollama endpoint=http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1 model=qwen3:8b
  Aggregate  → output/insights/AGGREGATE_REPORT.md
  Full       → output/insights/FULL_REPORT.md
Done.
```

`data_root` resolves in this order: command override where available,
`YT_INSIGHTS_DATA_ROOT`, `~/.config/yt-insights/config.toml`, then `output`
relative to the current directory. Configure an absolute TOML or environment
path for use from Claude Code, Codex, cron, or unrelated repositories. Explicit
`--corpus-root` and `--database` values on index/search commands override the
derived paths for that invocation.

Set an optional absolute `research_output_root` in the same TOML file, or use
`YT_INSIGHTS_RESEARCH_OUTPUT_ROOT`, to publish canonical dossiers. Without it,
`research export` requires an explicit absolute `--output`.

`acquire` downloads subtitles and metadata. It calls no LLM unless `--analyze`
is present. A channel, playlist, or batch file exits with code 3 before download
unless `--yes` is supplied; `--dry-run` always stops before corpus writes. A
single-video URL does not need `--yes`.

`export video` accepts an exact video ID or supported YouTube URL. `vtt` copies
the source bytes, `txt` emits cleaned transcript text, and `md` includes source
identity, language, canonical URL, SHA-256, and timestamped passages. The
default destination is `<data_root>/exports`; `--output` selects one file and
`--force` is required to replace it.

## Local watch catalog (SQLite)

The catalog commands turn existing outputs or newly discovered video lists into
one local, searchable database. They do not require an LLM.

```bash
# Import an existing multi-channel corpus without modifying its files
yt-insights catalog import-corpus \
  ./output

# Discover the current videos exposed by a channel/playlist through yt-dlp
yt-insights catalog discover \
  https://www.youtube.com/@PragmaticEngineer/videos

# Search title, source, insight text, and cleaned transcripts
yt-insights catalog search "AI product discovery"
yt-insights catalog search "Martin Fowler" --source pragmaticengineer --limit 5

# Inspect stable counts and every persisted collection/import error
yt-insights catalog stats
yt-insights catalog errors
yt-insights catalog errors --run-id 3
```

The default database is `output/catalog.sqlite3` (gitignored). Override it on
any catalog command with `--db PATH`. Canonical videos are unique by YouTube
video ID. Source membership and French/English artifacts remain separate, while
identical artifacts collapse by SHA-256. Every command is safe to rerun: a
second corpus import creates a new audit run but no duplicate video or artifact.

An import continues after malformed files and reports `status=partial`; use
`catalog errors` to see the exact paths and diagnostics. JSON files with the
expected keys but invalid value types are retained for search and explicitly
logged as validation errors.

`catalog discover` currently reuses the repository's unofficial `yt-dlp`
collector. Treat this as a local experimental adapter, not a compliance claim.
For a public or commercial service, review YouTube's Terms and prefer the
official YouTube Data API for search and metadata. The detailed source trade-offs
and phased architecture are in
[`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-26-youtube-newsletter-watch-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-26-youtube-newsletter-watch-design.md).

---

## Local transcript search

The default command indexes a deterministic 50-file slice for quick validation.
Use `--all` to build the full local corpus index. Neither mode sends transcripts
to an LLM or a remote service.

```bash
# Inspect the first deterministic 50-file slice without creating a database
yt-insights index --dry-run

# Build the derived local FTS index (default: output/.search/search-v1.sqlite3)
yt-insights index

# Build the complete corpus index after a disk-space preflight
yt-insights index --all

# Build a more diverse 50-file evaluation slice
yt-insights index --selection representative

# Validate the existing index without scanning transcripts
yt-insights index --status

# Search passages, optionally narrowed to one channel or language
yt-insights search "reliable agents" --channel my-channel --lang en

# Same ranked results as deterministic JSON
yt-insights search "reliable agents" --json
```

Use `--corpus-root`, `--database`, and `--limit` to point at a local corpus or a
derived index. `index --limit` accepts only 1 through 50 in slice mode;
`search --limit` accepts 1 through 20. The VTT corpus remains read-only and the
SQLite database can be rebuilt at any time.

### Prepare a relevance review packet

Copy the tracked template, replace every placeholder with real article subjects
and queries, then prepare a deterministic packet. The command records the Git
commit, observed loaded-source hashes, captured index hash, query-set hash,
ranked passages, timestamps, and source URLs. It never invents human judgments
and keeps the evaluation status `UNKNOWN`.

```bash
cp plans/evidence/2026-08-30-p2-query-template.json /tmp/p2-queries.json
uv run python scripts/prepare_search_relevance_evaluation.py \
  --database /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/search-v1.sqlite3 \
  --queries-file /tmp/p2-queries.json \
  --output /tmp/p2-evaluation-packet.json \
  --commit-sha "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --top-k 10
```

The unedited template is rejected intentionally. See the
[P2 evaluation protocol](plans/evidence/2026-08-28-p2-50-vtt-evaluation.md)
for the 20-result pilot, the 60-to-100-case release gate, and human-review rules.

### MCP access for local LLM clients

Install the `mcp` extra, build an index, then configure the stdio command in the
LLM client:

```bash
uv sync --extra mcp --extra dev
uv run yt-insights index --all
uv run yt-insights catalog import-corpus "$YT_INSIGHTS_DATA_ROOT"
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "yt-insights": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "yt-insights-mcp"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/youtube-video-insights",
      "env": {
        "YT_INSIGHTS_SEARCH_DATABASE": "/absolute/corpus/.search/search-v1.sqlite3",
        "YT_INSIGHTS_CATALOG_DATABASE": "/absolute/corpus/catalog.sqlite3"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The server exposes exactly four read-only tools in this order:
`list_corpora`, `search_videos`, `search_passages`, and `get_passage`. Set both
database variables to absolute paths for a client launched outside the repo.
When one is absent, the server derives it from the configured `data_root`.

---

## Supported sources

| Source type | Example |
|---|---|
| YouTube channel | `https://www.youtube.com/@DevWithAIYoutube` |
| YouTube channel (videos tab) | `https://www.youtube.com/@DevWithAIYoutube/videos` |
| Playlist | `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxxx` |
| Single video | `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ` |

Any URL accepted by yt-dlp works as SOURCE.

---

## Backends

Use `--backend` or `YT_INSIGHTS_BACKEND` when the execution target matters.
Accepted values are `auto`, `ollama`, `mlx`, `cc-bridge`, `anthropic`, and
`openai`. The same option is available on `run`, `report`, `suggest-shorts`,
and `acquire --analyze`.

| Explicit backend | Required configuration | Runtime behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `ollama` | Optional exact `--model`; optional `--base-url http://HOST:11434/v1` | Verifies the model against `/api/tags`; one local worker |
| `mlx` | Exact MLX model name and the `mlx` extra | Loads model and tokenizer lazily in-process; one local worker |
| `cc-bridge` | Local service on port 4141 | Requires a healthy endpoint and a usable completion route |
| `anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Uses only an Anthropic-scoped key |
| `openai` | Explicit `--base-url`, model, and provider key | Calls the named OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

An explicit backend never silently changes provider. `auto` keeps the existing
local-first detection order. Within `auto`, an Explicit endpoint supplied by
`--base-url` or `YT_INSIGHTS_BASE_URL` remains Priority 0 and is selected before
any localhost probe. It short-circuits every automatic probe.

| Priority | Backend | How to activate | Model format |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Explicit endpoint | Set `--base-url` or `YT_INSIGHTS_BASE_URL` | provider-specific |

Automatic detection order when no endpoint was configured:

| Priority | Backend | How to activate | Model format |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | cc-bridge | Start cc-bridge on port 4141 | `anthropic/github_copilot/gpt-5-mini` |
| 2 | Ollama | `ollama serve` | exact requested model, or automatic local selection |
| 3 | Anthropic API | `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...` | `claude-haiku-4-5` |

Backend selection matters only for `run`, `report`, `suggest-shorts`, or
`acquire --analyze`. Acquisition without analysis, indexing, search, export,
and MCP use no LLM. Override model and endpoint via flags:

```bash
yt-insights run <url> --model claude-sonnet-4-6 --base-url https://api.anthropic.com/v1
```

After Ollama has been selected, an explicit `--model` or `YT_INSIGHTS_MODEL`
must match an installed model exactly. If it is missing, the CLI lists the
available names and the corresponding `ollama pull` command. Automatic local
selection happens only when no model was requested. Use both
`--base-url http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1` and `--model` to force Ollama. `--model`
alone keeps the normal detection order, including cc-bridge before Ollama.

**cc-bridge model ID gotcha**: use the gateway format `anthropic/{provider}/{model}` (e.g. `anthropic/github_copilot/gpt-5-mini`) to route directly to the named provider via cc-bridge's stored credentials. A plain model ID (e.g. `claude-haiku-4-5`) uses cc-bridge's `active_route`. The probe requires `/health` to return 200 and the minimal completion to return 2xx or 3xx. A 4xx, 429, or 5xx response falls back to Ollama, then Anthropic when its API key is available.

Use `--backend cc-bridge` with the gateway model ID to force cc-bridge. Use
`--backend mlx --model mlx-community/Qwen3-4B` for direct MLX execution. MLX
selection is explicit because loading a local model is materially different
from probing an HTTP service.

  `acquisition_history_truncated` flag. Each attempt has `attempt_id`, `status`,
  and `items`; each item has `video_id`, `status`, `error_code`, and
  `source_sha256`. `refresh` authorizes discovery, not acquisition.

```

When `research_output_root` is configured, dossiers use
`<root>/<topic-slug>/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<session-id>/`. An explicit `--output`
supports a safe copy into another project. Dossiers are never indexed as
YouTube evidence.

Full-channel automation may place the same `transcripts/`, `insights/`, and
`shorts/` subdirectories under `output/<channel-slug>/`. The corpus scanner
supports both layouts. Flat layouts require the adjacent `.info.json` sidecar
to preserve channel identity.

Example `output/shorts/video.md` entry:

```markdown
## Short 1 - Score : 5/5

**Timestamps :** 00:05:10 -> 00:05:48 (38s)
**Lien direct :** https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID&t=310s
**Hook :** L'IA ne remplace pas le dev, elle remplace le flou
**Rationale :** Formule autonome, tension forte, borne nette sur une chute.

> "Le vrai problème c'est pas le code, c'est la spec. Et ça, l'IA ne peut pas
> l'inventer à votre place."
```

Example `video.json`:

```json
{
  "subject": "How to run local LLMs on consumer hardware",
  "key_points": [
    "RAM and VRAM constraints determine which models are viable",
    "Quantisation (4-bit/8-bit) cuts memory use with minimal quality loss",
    "Instruction-tuned models outperform base models for chat/code tasks"
  ],
  "tools": [
    {"name": "Ollama", "context": "recommended runtime for local deployment"},
    {"name": "Hugging Face", "context": "source for model cards and downloads"}
  ],
  "advice": [
    "Check your VRAM first, then pick the largest model that fits",
    "Read the model card before downloading (usage restrictions vary)"
  ],
  "quotes": [
    "The best model is the one that actually runs on your machine."
  ]
}
```

## Idempotence

Every run is idempotent. If `video.json` already exists for a given VTT file, it is loaded from disk with no LLM call. Interrupt the process at any point: partial runs leave `.tmp.json` orphans at worst, never a corrupt `.json`.

Re-process everything from scratch:

```bash
yt-insights run <url> --force
```

---

## Insight JSON schema

<details>
<summary>Show schema</summary>

The LLM is always instructed to return exactly this structure:

```
subject      string        One-sentence description of the video topic
key_points   string[]      3-5 main points covered
tools        object[]      {name, context}: tools and technologies mentioned
advice       string[]      Immediately actionable recommendations
quotes       string[]      Notable quotes (empty array if none)
```

</details>

---

## Configuration file

```bash
yt-insights config init  # creates ~/.config/yt-insights/config.toml
```

All keys are optional. CLI flags and `YT_INSIGHTS_*` env vars take precedence over the file.

## For AI coding assistants

Load [`llms.txt`](llms.txt) for the tracked, machine-readable project snapshot:
commands, modules, storage model, invariants, generated data, and current gaps.
The architecture rationale and implementation sequence live under
[`docs/superpowers/`](docs/superpowers/).
The [implementation status](docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md) separates delivered
features, conditional work, and reproducible validation commands.

### Portable agent integration status

The repository includes four portable skills, `youtube-acquire`,
`youtube-research`, `youtube-export`, and `youtube-cumulative-research`, plus a
read-only corpus researcher for Claude Code and Codex. The cumulative skill
runs in the main session because discovery and approved acquisition may use the
network and write source files. All four delegate to the packaged CLI or
read-only MCP.

Invoke the skills explicitly. The disjoint routing evaluation rejected the
implicit BM25 hook because every generalizable calibration left either missed
requests or forbidden activations.

On the development workstation, the older digest-approved shared release
`60cbcac…` contains three skills. The fourth cumulative skill exists in this
repository and in the wheel candidate, but it has not been installed globally.
A fresh Codex CLI 0.150.1 canary passed project-local discovery and the two
mandatory human boundaries. The fresh Claude Code canary remains `UNKNOWN`
because the installed CLI is not authenticated. `global_activation_ready`
remains `false`.

The setup command previews by default, refuses different existing files, and
rolls back newly created state if one client registration fails:

```bash
uv run --extra mcp yt-insights setup assistants \
  --client both \
  --data-root "$YT_INSIGHTS_DATA_ROOT" \
  --dry-run

uv run --extra mcp yt-insights setup assistants \
  --client both \
  --data-root "$YT_INSIGHTS_DATA_ROOT" \
  --apply

uv run --extra mcp yt-insights setup assistants \
  --client both \
  --data-root "$YT_INSIGHTS_DATA_ROOT" \
  --verify
```

Install or upgrade only repository skills and native agent files without
reading or changing existing MCP registrations with:

```bash
uv run yt-insights setup assistants --client both --assets-only --dry-run
uv run yt-insights setup assistants --client both --assets-only --apply
uv run yt-insights setup assistants --client both --assets-only --verify
```

`--apply` changes the user-level Claude Code and Codex configuration. Cloning,
installing, or running the default preview changes nothing globally. The
development workstation has not applied this new four-skill transaction. Live
YouTube research and the fresh Claude Code workflow canary remain `UNKNOWN`.
The project-local Codex canary is `PASS`; this is not a global-installation
claim.

The final local delivery at `b62adaa` passed `1,089` Python tests plus `10`
subtests, `155` frontend tests, `4` Playwright flows, Ruff, Astro Check on 51
files, generated-asset verification, packaging, and Mypy on 53 source files.
The current bilingual UI review passes `1,089` Python tests plus `10` subtests,
`162` frontend tests, `6` Playwright flows, Ruff, Astro Check on 57 files, Mypy
on 53 source files, and exact reproduction of the 20 packaged web files.
Hosted GitHub Actions
[run 33494963306](https://github.com/FlorianBruniaux/youtube-video-insights/actions/runs/33494963306)
passed on the same SHA for the web interface, Python 3.11, Python 3.12, and
packaging/runtime. Mypy was run as `mypy src`, not with `--strict`. Human
relevance, live YouTube, and the fresh Claude Code canary remain `UNKNOWN`.
The project-local Codex canary is `PASS`; global activation remains `false`.

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [Delivery recap](docs/DELIVERY-RECAP.md) | Implemented product surfaces, architecture, safety boundaries, validation, and remaining work |
| [Current Claude Code and Codex guide](docs/claude-code.md) | Supported skills, four MCP tools, local commands and verified installation boundary |
| [Ready-to-copy assistant prompts](examples/agent-prompts.md) | Acquisition previews, cited research, article dossiers and deterministic exports |
| [Agent platform architecture](plans/specs/AGENT-PLATFORM.md) | Target behavior, data boundaries, skills, agents and safety rules |
| [Agent-ready runtime plan](plans/2026-08-28-09-agent-ready-runtime.md) | CLI, paths, backends, acquisition, export and MCP work |
| [Claude Code and Codex integration plan](plans/2026-08-28-10-claude-codex-global-integration.md) | Portable skills, native agents, routing evaluation and digest-bound global installation |
| [Hosted service and extension plan](plans/2026-08-28-11-hosted-extension.md) | Conditional browser and remote-access path |

The runtime plan passes the package smoke gate. Cloning or installing this
repository never changes global Claude Code or Codex configuration. Only
`setup assistants --apply` performs that scoped user-level installation.
Until a runtime transaction is approved and applied, use `uv run yt-insights`
and `uv run --extra mcp yt-insights-mcp` from this checkout.

## Claude Code integration

The five historical commands under `.claude/skills/` remain available only for
explicit compatibility calls. Their frontmatter blocks model-triggered
invocation so they do not compete with the portable skills.

Use the portable skills below for new workflows. The historical commands and
example remain as a compatibility reference.

### Agent

`youtube-corpus-researcher` is a read-only native agent for source-backed corpus
research. It uses `youtube-research` and the MCP, returns timestamped evidence,
and cannot acquire videos, rebuild indexes, or write exports. The historical
`yt-video-analyst` remains in the repository but is not the supported implicit
dispatcher.

### Skills

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `youtube-acquire` | Previews and acquires one video, playlist, or channel through the packaged CLI |
| `youtube-research` | Searches the local catalogue and timestamped passage index without writes |
| `youtube-export` | Exports an existing video as VTT, text, or sourced Markdown |
| `youtube-cumulative-research` | Assesses local evidence, asks before discovery and exact-ID acquisition, reassesses, then optionally exports a dossier |

Historical explicit-only compatibility commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/yt-get-transcript` | Downloads the VTT, checks cache first, retries with browser cookies on 429 |
| `/yt-get-insights` | Runs insight analysis on an existing VTT, reads from cache when already processed |
| `/yt-get-shorts` | Suggests the top 3 Short moments, presents them for your choice, downloads the chosen clip |
| `/yt-run-pipeline` | Runs transcript, insights and Shorts selection in sequence for a single video |
| `/yt-add-channel` | Processes a channel into `output/<slug>/`, rebuilds the Markdown/YAML indexes, then refreshes the SQLite catalog |

### How it works

1. Invoke one of the four portable skills explicitly.
2. Acquisition runs `doctor`, then a dry-run preview before any multi-video write.
3. Research uses the four read-only MCP tools and returns timestamped sources.
4. Cumulative research asks whether local evidence is sufficient and keeps discovery separate from candidate approval.
5. Export uses existing corpus artifacts and performs no LLM call.
6. Historical Shorts commands remain explicit and download a clip only after confirmation.

Each skill respects the same idempotence as the CLI: a VTT already on disk is not re-downloaded, a cached insight JSON triggers no LLM call.

### Example session

Explicitly invoke the historical pipeline when you need its Shorts workflow:

```
You:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfupYzLjFGc

Agent: VIDEO_ID = nfupYzLjFGc
       Cache: no transcript, no insights, no shorts yet.
       What do you want? (transcript / insights / shorts / everything)

You:   everything

Agent: [/yt-get-transcript] → output/transcripts/1200-commits-600-PRs.fr.vtt (42KB)

       [/yt-get-insights]
       Subject: 7 months solo, 1200 commits, 600 PRs, 50 releases
       Key points: solo dev velocity, AI-assisted release pipeline, PR review automation...
       Notable quote: "Je pensais que l'IA allait coder à ma place. Elle m'a surtout appris à
       mieux découper le travail."

       [/yt-get-shorts]
       Option 1 | Score 5/5 | 00:00:56 → 00:01:45 (49s)
       Hook: "1 200 commits, 600 PRs en 7 mois, seul dev"
       Verbatim: "Les chiffres c'est 7 mois à peu près, 1 200 commits..."

       Option 2 | Score 5/5 | 00:03:47 → 00:04:47 (60s)
       Hook: "Une plateforme de zéro en 5 semaines, seul"
       Verbatim: "La première version était en prod au bout de 5 semaines..."

       Option 3 | Score 4/5 | 00:07:12 → 00:08:05 (53s)
       Hook: "L'IA ne code pas à ta place, elle t'oblige à mieux découper"
       Verbatim: "Ce que j'ai découvert c'est que le vrai gain..."

       Which option? (1/2/3 or custom timestamps)

You:   2

Agent: Downloading segment 00:03:47 → 00:04:47...
       Clip saved: output/clips/plateforme-5-semaines-seul_000347.mp4 (1.8MB)
```

Run the pipeline on any video, skip any step you have already done. The agent never re-downloads a cached file or re-runs an LLM call unless you ask it to.

## Contributing

Open a PR. No CLA is required. Run `uv sync --extra mcp --extra dev`, then the
following checks before submitting a change:

```bash
pnpm --dir web install --frozen-lockfile
python scripts/verify_web_build.py
pnpm --dir web test
pnpm --dir web check
pnpm --dir web test:e2e
uv run --extra mcp --extra dev pytest -q
uv run --extra dev ruff check src tests scripts
uv run --extra dev mypy src
uv lock --check
git diff --check
```

`verify_web_build.py` copies the declared frontend inputs into a temporary
checkout and builds there. This keeps generated or injected source files out of
the repository. CI also rejects tracked and untracked checkout mutations. When
changing the frontend, run `pnpm --dir web build` explicitly to refresh the
packaged assets, inspect them, then run the verifier before the other gates.
