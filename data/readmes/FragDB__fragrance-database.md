## Quick Start

### Python

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load all files
fragrances = pd.read_csv('fragrances.csv', sep='|', encoding='utf-8')
brands = pd.read_csv('brands.csv', sep='|', encoding='utf-8')
notes = pd.read_csv('notes.csv', sep='|', encoding='utf-8')
translations = pd.read_csv('translations.csv', sep='|', encoding='utf-8')

# Join fragrances with brands
fragrances['brand_id'] = fragrances['brand'].str.split(';').str[1]
df = fragrances.merge(brands, left_on='brand_id', right_on='id', suffixes=('', '_brand'))

# Translate gender to any language
trans = translations.set_index('id')
df['gender_ru'] = df['gender'].map(lambda x: trans.loc[x, 'ru'] if x in trans.index else x)

# Brand country in Japanese
print(df[['name', 'name_brand', 'country_ja', 'gender_ru']].head())
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
const { parse } = require('csv-parse/sync');
const fs = require('fs');

// Load files
const fragrances = parse(fs.readFileSync('fragrances.csv', 'utf-8'), { columns: true, delimiter: '|' });
const brands = parse(fs.readFileSync('brands.csv', 'utf-8'), { columns: true, delimiter: '|' });
const translations = parse(fs.readFileSync('translations.csv', 'utf-8'), { columns: true, delimiter: '|' });

// Build lookup maps
const brandsMap = new Map(brands.map(b => [b.id, b]));
const transMap = new Map(translations.map(t => [t.id, t]));

// Get fragrance with translated fields
const frag = fragrances[0];
const [brandName, brandId] = frag.brand.split(';');
const brand = brandsMap.get(brandId);
const genderRu = transMap.get(frag.gender)?.ru || frag.gender;

console.log(`${frag.name} by ${brandName} (${brand?.country_ru}), ${genderRu}`);
```

### SQL (PostgreSQL)

```sql
-- Import
COPY fragrances FROM 'fragrances.csv' DELIMITER '|' CSV HEADER ENCODING 'UTF8';
COPY brands FROM 'brands.csv' DELIMITER '|' CSV HEADER ENCODING 'UTF8';
COPY translations FROM 'translations.csv' DELIMITER '|' CSV HEADER ENCODING 'UTF8';

-- Join and translate gender to Russian
SELECT f.name, b.name AS brand, b.country_ru, t.ru AS gender_ru
FROM fragrances f
JOIN brands b ON SPLIT_PART(f.brand, ';', 2) = b.id
JOIN translations t ON f.gender = t.id;
```

## Companion Parquet Datasets — User Reviews, News, and Community Comments

FragDB ships with **three Apache Parquet datasets** containing **4.9 million rows** of user-generated content and editorial coverage — the largest publicly-organized corpus of fragrance reviews and perfumery journalism. Use them for NLP, sentiment analysis, recommendation systems, market research, or training language models on fragrance-specific text.

### `comments.parquet` — 5.0 Million User Reviews in 23 Languages

The world's largest collection of structured fragrance reviews. Every entry includes the perfume ID (joinable with `fragrances.csv`), author username, posting date, full review text, avatar URL, and language code.

- **4,986,774 user reviews** covering every major perfume in the database
- **23 languages** — English (1.88M reviews), Russian, Portuguese, Spanish, Korean, Turkish, Japanese, Polish, Italian, Hungarian, Serbian, Swedish, German, Hebrew, Ukrainian, French, Arabic, Greek, Czech, Chinese, Romanian, Mongolian, Dutch
- **Coverage:** 69.8% of all fragrances in the database have at least one review (97,817 of 140,230 PIDs)
- **Deterministic global primary key** — stable comment IDs survive re-scrapes
- **Zero duplicate rows**; every `pid` joins `fragrances.csv` except 48 reviews (0.001%) on 10 perfumes no longer in the catalogue
- **Independent UGC per language** — each language is genuine localized content, not machine translation
- **8 fields:** `pid`, `lang`, `comment_id`, `author`, `date`, `text`, `avatar_url`, `gradient_class`
- **PyArrow large_string format** — combined corpus exceeds 32-bit string offset limit

**Use cases:** sentiment analysis · review classification · recommendation systems · perfume similarity from text · language detection benchmark · multilingual NLP training corpus · fragrance market research · author network analysis · trend detection by language

### `news.parquet` — 25,619 Editorial Articles (2008–2026)

Two decades of professional fragrance journalism. Every article includes title, author, full text (plain + HTML), category, related perfumes/brands/perfumers, publication date, and main image. Foreign keys to fragrances, brands, and perfumers make this a powerful resource for content-based recommendation and knowledge graph construction.

- **25,619 editorial articles** from 2008 to 2026 — the complete public archive
- **30+ categories** — top: New Fragrances (34.1%), Fragrance Reviews (23.9%), Niche Perfumery (10.2%), Designer Brands, Interviews, History, Industry News, Niche Houses, and more
- **Bilingual storage** — `text` (plain) for NLP / search, `text_html` (preserved markup) for rich display
- **Linked entities** — `related_pids[]`, `related_brands[]`, `related_perfumers[]` as JSON arrays
- **125,890 PID references** — all but 175 (0.14%) resolve; those point to perfumes no longer in the catalogue
- **Modern + archived** — 60.3% archived legacy articles, 39.7% modern fully-dated articles
- **16 fields:** `nid`, `title`, `category`, `author`, `url`, `is_archived`, `date_unix`, `description`, `text`, `text_html`, `main_image`, `article_images`, `related_pids`, `related_brands`, `related_perfumers`, `comments_count`
- **List fields stored as JSON-encoded strings** — never null (empty = `"[]"`)

**Use cases:** content recommendation · article search engine · perfume knowledge graph · trend analysis · author influence study · category classification · entity linking · timeline analysis · industry research · niche perfumery research · fragrance journalism corpus

### `news_comments.parquet` — 276,483 Threaded Community Comments

Community discussions attached to editorial articles, with threading support for replies. Joinable with `news.parquet` via `nid`.

- **276,483 threaded comments** across **22,891 articles** (89.4% of news articles have at least one comment)
- **5.5% reply rate** — threaded conversations with reply detection (`is_reply` flag)
- **100% populated timestamps** — `date_unix` parsed for every comment
- **9 fields:** `nid`, `comment_id`, `is_reply`, `author`, `date`, `date_unix`, `text`, `avatar_url`, `gradient`
- **Zero foreign key orphans** against `news.parquet.nid`

**Use cases:** community engagement analysis · threaded discussion mining · reply network construction · comment sentiment · author activity profiles · temporal analysis of community responses

### Quick Start — Reading Parquet Datasets

```python
import pyarrow.parquet as pq
import pandas as pd

# Read user reviews
reviews = pq.read_table('comments.parquet').to_pandas()
print(reviews.head())
print(f"Total reviews: {len(reviews):,}")
print(f"Languages: {reviews['lang'].nunique()}")

# Join with CSV fragrance metadata
fragrances = pd.read_csv('fragrances.csv', sep='|')
reviews_with_frag = reviews.merge(fragrances, on='pid', how='left')

# Read news articles
import json
news = pq.read_table('news.parquet').to_pandas()
# Parse JSON-encoded list fields
news['related_pids_list'] = news['related_pids'].apply(json.loads)
news['related_brands_list'] = news['related_brands'].apply(json.loads)
print(news[['nid', 'title', 'category', 'date_unix']].head())

# Read news comments and join with articles
news_comments = pq.read_table('news_comments.parquet').to_pandas()
discussion = news_comments.merge(news[['nid', 'title']], on='nid')
print(discussion[['nid', 'title', 'author', 'text']].head())
```

Full schema, field types, and audit statistics are documented in [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md).

## Data API — per-record access

**The whole catalogue, one record at a time.** A metered HTTP API over the same database we
sell as files. You pay per record returned, at the level of detail you ask for. No
subscription and no seats: top up a balance, fetch what your application needs, cache it as
long as you like.

**[fragdb.net/api →](https://fragdb.net/api)** · [OpenAPI spec](https://fragdb.net/api/v1/openapi) · [Sign up](https://fragdb.net/register) · [FAQ](https://fragdb.net/faq) · [Terms](https://fragdb.net/legal#api-access)

### Endpoints

```
GET  /api/v1/fragrances/{id}        one record
GET  /api/v1/brands/{id}            one brand
GET  /api/v1/notes/{id}             one note
GET  /api/v1/perfumers/{id}         one perfumer
POST /api/v1/{collection}/batch     up to 100 ids in one call
GET  /api/v1/index                  the full index, gzipped JSONL
GET  /api/v1/release                current release label and date — free
GET  /api/v1/account                balance, limits, usage — free
```

Detail level is chosen with `?level=list|basic|full`.

**There are no list endpoints.** `/api/v1/fragrances?limit=50` answers 404, by design. You
enumerate the catalogue with the index file — id, name, brand, year and change status — search
it on your side, and fetch whole records only for the hits you need. The index costs no units
and needs a paid key: five downloads a day, and an unchanged index answers 304.

### Detail levels

| Level | Units | Per record | What comes back |
|-------|------:|-----------:|-----------------|
| `list`  | 1 | $0.0025 | id, brand, name, year, gender, rating with vote count, and a thumbnail |
| `basic` | 2 | $0.005  | plus the photo, the collection, review count, main accords with their strength and the credited perfumers |
| `full`  | 4 | $0.01   | the note pyramid as published, seven vote blocks, description, pros and cons, related fragrances, and every label translated inline |

1 unit = $0.0025. Top-ups are multiples of $50, from $100 up to $5,000 — $100 buys 40,000
units. Paid units do not expire while the account is open. Minimum spend is $100 (40,000
units) per 180 days, $16.67 a month, counted from the first top-up. Payment in BTC, ETH, TRX,
XMR or USDT.

### Try it before you pay

Sign up and a free test key appears straight away. It costs nothing, charges nothing and
serves 5 sample records at every level — enough to write your parser against the real shape
of a response before you pay for anything.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your test key>" \
  "https://fragdb.net/api/v1/fragrances/f_9kwkhn9yqx?level=full"
```

That id is one of the five public samples, so the call works on a test key.

Already bought a database file? You get 500 units for 30 days to try the API. (The 500 units
come with a file purchase, not with signing up.)

### Limits

10 requests per second and 300 per minute on a key · 20 per second on an account · 100 ids per
batch call · 50,000 charged records per account per UTC day · 5 index downloads per day · 5
keys per account. Call the API from your server, never from a browser.

### How it sits next to the files

The API serves the same catalogue that is sold as files, refreshed about three times a month.
Every response carries the release label and its date, and `GET /api/v1/release` tells you
which release you are on.

Ids are permanent: a record withdrawn at its source stays available with its last known
content and a status flag.

Reviews, news articles and community comments are **not** in the API — those stay in the
downloadable files described in this README.

## What's New in v5.16

- Data update: 139,501 → **140,230** fragrances (+729), **8,316** brands (+44), **3,126** perfumers (+10), **2,606** notes (+10)
- **Reviews, news and news comments are refreshed for the first time since June.** Reviews 4,643,851 → **4,986,774** (+342,923), editorial articles 24,440 → **25,619** (+1,179), news comments 263,798 → **276,483** (+12,685). The three parquet files in the Full tier are new, not carried over
- Photos: 622,513 → **623,790**
- **New: a Data API** — per-record HTTP access to the same catalogue, priced per record. See the section above
- Figures on this page are measured against the v5.16 files: review coverage, the language split, PID reference resolution, the archived/modern article split and the reply rate all moved with the new parquet
- Sample files unchanged: the schema did not move between v5.15 and v5.16, so the 10-record previews in `samples/` are byte-identical

## What's New in v5.15

- Data update: 137,789 → **139,501** fragrances (+1,712), **8,272** brands (+25), **3,116** perfumers (+6), **2,596** notes (+4: 7 new, 3 retired)
- **Full source recrawl** (10 Sep 2026) — every field class re-read, not only the new tail
- **Three note IDs retired** — the source merged case duplicates: `n473` → `n2661` (Heather), `n653` → `n2646` (Icing Pink), `n813` → `n2660` (Hazelnut Cocoa Spread). No fragrance references the retired IDs
- Photos: 615,066 → **622,513**
- **Figures on this page restated from the release files.** The records badge and the full-database totals had stayed at v5.10, and the notes row showed 2,588 while v5.14 shipped 2,592. The notes figure is now the row count of `notes.csv` — the number fragdb.net shows. Review coverage and foreign-key figures are measured against this catalogue
- Reviews, news and news comments: the same parquet files as v5.14
- Sample files unchanged: the schema did not move between v5.14 and v5.15, so the 10-record previews in `samples/` are byte-identical

## What's New in v5.14

- Data update: 137,147 → **137,789** fragrances (+642), **8,247** brands (+37), **3,110** perfumers (+8), **2,586** unique note names (unchanged — the notes reference only moves on a full crawl)
- Photos: 613,933 → **615,066**
- Sample files unchanged: the schema did not move between v5.13 and v5.14, so the 10-record previews in `samples/` are byte-identical. They show structure, not freshness.

## What's New in v5.13

- Data update: 136,682 → **137,147** fragrances (+465), **8,210** brands (+35), **3,102** perfumers (+12), **2,588** notes (+2)
- **Clean incremental delta** (19 Aug 2026) — no perfume changed its canonical URL and none disappeared; the previous full recrawl had 59 such moves, so this cycle is pure growth
- **Field coverage flat** across all 30 columns (max movement 0.22 pp) — new entries arrive slightly less complete than the catalog average, which is normal for fresh pages, not a regression
- **New note `Kiwano`** shipped with all 22 translations on its first cycle, instead of waiting for the next full recrawl
- **Free sample refreshed** — the 10-record CSV samples in `samples/` rebuilt from v5.13 data

## What's New in v5.12

- Data update: 135,308 → **136,682** fragrances (+1,374), **8,175** brands (+82), **3,090** perfumers (+33), **2,586** notes (+13)
- Covers two upstream releases (v5.11 and v5.12); the previous public snapshot was v5.10
- **Full source recrawl** (9 Aug 2026) — every field class re-read, not just the new tail; 784 records that a resume-scan bug had frozen since May are current again
- **Notes multilingual 100%** — every note translated across all 22 languages, verified with a strict per-language check
- **Free sample refreshed** — the 10-record CSV samples in `samples/` rebuilt from v5.12 data

## What's New in v5.9

- Data update: 134,022 → **134,577** fragrances (+555), **8,036** brands, **3,046** perfumers, **2,567** notes
- **154 brand names canonicalized** — parser restored the `Fragrance(s)` suffix stripped by an old bug ("Demeter" → "Demeter Fragrance", "Lacoste" → "Lacoste Fragrances", …); brand IDs unchanged
- **URL hygiene**: note-pyramid anchors normalized to one domain (300K `beta.` → `www.`), photo cache-busters stripped
- **Free sample refreshed** — the 10-record CSV samples in `samples/` rebuilt from v5.9 data

### Schema (stable since v5.4)
- **Perfumer transliterations in 9 languages** (ru, uk, ja, zh, ko, ar, he, el, mn); `perfumers.csv` 42 columns

### From v5.3 (unchanged)
- **23 languages** — all labels, note names, accords, countries, statuses translated
- **translations.csv** — vocabulary file for gender values and voting labels
- **Compact notes pyramid** — `note_id,opacity,weight` (name/icon via notes.csv JOIN)
- Each note name variant (Rose, Damask Rose, Turkish Rose) has its own ID
- **Gender & voting fields** use translation IDs instead of English text

See [DATA_DICTIONARY.md](DATA_DICTIONARY.md) for complete field documentation with parsing examples.
