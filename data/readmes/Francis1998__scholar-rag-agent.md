Load a small paper corpus, ask comparison or hypothesis questions, and inspect
the passages and run history behind the response. Scholar RAG Agent is a
**local-first Python toolkit and FastAPI service** for building inspectable
literature workflows, with SQLite persistence and optional model-provider adapters.

The default setup works without model credentials. Its fake adapter demonstrates
the workflow; it does **not** produce a scientific summary or validate a hypothesis.

## Start offline

With Python 3.11+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Francis1998/scholar-rag-agent.git
cd scholar-rag-agent
uv sync --extra dev
uv run python scripts/demo_local.py
```

The demo explicitly uses the fake model, ingests a synthetic fixture into a
temporary database, and prints a run ID, `DONE` state, planner trace, and cited
placeholder answer. Its temporary database is removed on exit.

Next, use the [Quickstart](QUICKSTART.md) to start the API with an isolated
database and empty provider keys. The interactive API documentation is at
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`; this is not a paper-chat or PDF-upload UI.

## Compare selected papers before generating

![Measured synthetic offline research worksheet](docs/assets/research-worksheet.gif)

`POST /research/worksheet` inspects each question against each selected paper,
so one paper's global ranking does not crowd another out of the worksheet.
It returns retrieved passages, not generated answers or scientific judgments.
The [complete guide](docs/guides/RESEARCH_WORKSHEET_GUIDE.md) includes API/Python
examples, fixed bounds, privacy, and reproduction of this measured illustration.

## Export cited sources to a reference manager

![Measured synthetic offline saved bibliography export](docs/assets/saved-bibliography.gif)

`GET /runs/{run_id}/bibliography` downloads BibTeX from only the completed saved
answer's cited chunks, deduplicated by exact document ID in frozen rank order.
Add `?format=json` for captured metadata, cited-chunk mappings, and explicit
conflict/empty-citation warnings. No current corpus, model, or DOI service is
consulted. Metadata is unverified; review before import, not by compiling LaTeX.
The [complete guide](docs/guides/SAVED_BIBLIOGRAPHY_GUIDE.md) includes offline
API/Python usage and reproduction of this actual-output illustration.

## Inspect a recorded run

To inspect retrieval **without creating a run**, use `POST /retrieve` or
`await container.runner.preview(...)`. The [retrieval preview guide](docs/guides/RETRIEVAL_PREVIEW_GUIDE.md)
includes a reproducible offline GIF, Python/API examples, exact chunk/rank/path
and context-digest contracts, scope, and errors. This is the shared `/query`
context preparation, not semantic entailment or a promise about a changed corpus.

To block answer generation below a chosen distinct-document count, use
[`min_evidence_documents`](docs/guides/MINIMUM_EVIDENCE_DOCUMENTS_GUIDE.md).
Previews with an unmet minimum keep their passages; queries with an unmet
minimum preserve a diagnostic and snapshot without generating. Operational
preview failures return errors, not partial evidence. Passing a count is not
proof of scientific support.

![Synthetic offline evidence-export walkthrough](docs/assets/evidence-export.gif)

This generated animation illustrates the synthetic offline evidence-export demo,
not a live research UI or a real model's scientific findings. Follow the
[demo reproduction instructions](docs/DEMO.md) to inspect the actual output.

Forgot the run ID? `GET /runs?limit=20` discovers persisted runs with bounded
query previews and creation-ordered pagination. Its recorded state is not a
liveness claim; see [run history and restart recovery](docs/guides/RUN_HISTORY_GUIDE.md).

`GET /runs/{run_id}/export?format=json|markdown` reconstructs a completed run from
stored evidence, without another retrieval or generation call. Keep the query,
plan, answer, claims, exact source chunks, trace, and nonsecret model provenance
together for review. The saved context survives corpus changes and restart; this
is not a guarantee of identical output from a new LLM run or a signed audit record.

`POST /runs/{run_id}/reviews` records a bounded human judgment and comment in a
separate SQLite table. `GET /runs/{run_id}/reviews` reads retry-safe, paginated
history after restart without changing the saved answer or events. Acceptance is
an opinion, not factual verification or an authenticated approval. See the
[review guide and actual-output offline GIF](docs/guides/ANSWER_REVIEWS_GUIDE.md).

![Measured synthetic offline corpus-drift report](docs/assets/corpus-drift.gif)

`GET /runs/{run_id}/corpus-drift` compares frozen chunk/document identities and
exact field digests with current persisted chunks in one read-only transaction.
It reports changed or missing evidence without retrieval, generation, or event
writes. “Unchanged” means matching chunk fields, not whole-paper equality or
scientific validity. The [guide](docs/guides/CORPUS_DRIFT_GUIDE.md) includes bounded
API/Python usage and reproduction of this actual-output offline illustration.

## What actually runs

The API uses a hand-written **Observe -> Decide -> Act** state machine, not
LangGraph. Pydantic validates settings and schemas; HTTPX connects optional live
providers; SQLite stores documents, graph data, and durable run events.

| Stage | Default behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Ingest | `/ingest/text` normalizes text into fixed-size overlapping chunks and indexes entity co-mentions |
| Plan | Keyword-based intent analysis creates bounded retrieval tasks and a rationale trace |
| Retrieve | Deterministic HyDE template expansion, hash-vector cosine retrieval, BM25, and reciprocal rank fusion |
| Expand | Bounded traversal of an entity co-mention graph; paths are retrieval aids, not reasoning proofs |
| Rerank | Lexical overlap via `AdaptiveReranker`, not a learned cross-encoder |
| Generate and check | A routed provider or the fake adapter; claim/source-ID mapping with token-overlap checks |
| Record | SQLite events and frozen evidence for completed-run exports |

`DenseRetriever` uses `HashEmbeddingModel`: deterministic lexical hash vectors,
**not learned semantic embeddings**. Installing optional ML dependencies does not
switch the API to semantic embeddings or cross-encoder reranking. MMR, multi-HyDE,
query rewriting, screening checklists, metadata boosts, paper chat memory, and
most other cataloged helpers require explicit library integration.

For the exact wiring and storage lifecycle, see [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md).
For current model IDs, per-provider overrides, routing, and dated official
sources, use the [provider model guide](docs/guides/PROVIDER_MODELS_GUIDE.md).
`/query` requests the reasoning route; the default-provider setting is not a
universal override. Provider availability depends on your account and credentials.

## Boundaries to understand

- **A citation is not verification.** `CitationGrounder` checks token overlap and
  source IDs, not factual correctness or entailment. Review original passages,
  opposing evidence, and warnings even when `grounded` is true.
- **This is not a complete review platform.** Supporting/counter-evidence tasks
  do not constitute a systematic review, novelty proof, or medical decision.
  The offline demo is a plumbing demonstration, not a quality evaluation.
- **Local-first is not production-hardened.** There is no built-in authentication,
  tenant isolation, or PDF-upload endpoint/UI. Keep the API on loopback.
- **Evidence exports contain source text.** Queries, documents, answers, and
  local metadata may be sensitive. Live providers receive retrieved context;
  review permissions and content before transmitting or sharing anything.

Read [Safety](SAFETY.md) before using non-synthetic material.

## Offline evidence extractors

Clinical and statistical cue extractors are **opt-in Python helpers**, not
additional `/query` stages or clinical assessments. Browse the
[categorized cue guides](docs/README.md#clinical-and-statistical-evidence-cues)
for study-design, outcome, statistical, and reporting cues. Each guide retains
its usage examples and illustration; these heuristics do not validate findings.

Existing cue illustrations remain available without interrupting the introduction:

## Quality gates

```bash
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy src/
uv run pytest tests/ -v --cov=src --cov-fail-under=70
```

[CI](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on Python 3.11 and 3.12.
[Security Scan](.github/workflows/security.yml) also audits dependencies and runs
Bandit. Passing these checks is not a scientific-accuracy benchmark.
