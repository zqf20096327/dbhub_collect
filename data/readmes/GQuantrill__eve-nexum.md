## Quick start

Get a local Nexum running in about ten minutes. You'll need:

- **Docker** with Compose.
- **An EVE Online developer application** — register at [developers.eveonline.com](https://developers.eveonline.com) (free, ~2 minutes). Use `http://localhost/auth/callback` as the callback URL and enable the scopes listed in [EVE developer app scopes](#eve-developer-app-scopes).

Clone and configure:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GQuantrill/eve-nexum.git
cd eve-nexum
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and set, at minimum:

```dotenv
EVE_CLIENT_ID=…           # from your EVE developer app
EVE_CLIENT_SECRET=…       # from your EVE developer app
EVE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost/auth/callback
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost
PG_PASSWORD=…             # any strong password

# Generate each with `openssl rand -hex 32` and paste the result:
SESSION_SECRET=…
TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=…
```

Leave `CORP_ID` unset for now — that opens login to any EVE character. To restrict to one or more corps or alliances later, see [Corp & alliance mode](#corp--alliance-mode).

Build and start the stack. On first run an `importer` service downloads the EVE Static Data Export and populates Postgres (a one-off, a few minutes) before the server boots; later runs detect the data is already there and skip straight through:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

Open <http://localhost> and click **Log in with EVE Online**. That's it.

**Next steps**

- Restrict logins to your corp or alliance, set up roles, locking, merges, or Discord notifications → [Corp & alliance mode](#corp--alliance-mode).
- Production deployment (TLS via Traefik, a public URL, periodic SDE refreshes, upgrades) → [Installation](#installation).
- Something not coming up → [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Features

### Mapping

- **Interactive map** — drag systems, draw connections, set wormhole class/type/status per connection. Snap-to-grid, optional minimap.
- **Seed a map from a region** — when creating a map you can optionally pick an EVE region (searchable). The new map is pre-populated with every system in that region, laid out from CCP's 2D star-map projection (a Dotlan-style layout where stargate-connected systems sit adjacent), with all in-region stargate connections pre-drawn. Leave the region blank for an empty map. Requires solar-system coordinates in the SDE tables — see [Installation](#installation).
- **Wormhole intel** — per-connection mass status (stable / destabilized / critical), end-of-life flag with countdown, K162-aware static identification, frig-hole and gas-site auto-tagging from sig type.
- **Rolling calculator** — plan and track collapsing a hole from its connection panel. It models the ±10% wormhole mass variance, so every call is made against the worst case: a hatched band marks the uncertain-collapse zone and each pass button is colour-forecast safe / may-collapse / will-collapse. Define a roller ship (cold + prop-on mass, or pull your currently-flown ship from ESI), then click each pass to step through — it tracks which side the roller is on, warns loudly when a risky pass would strand it on the far side, and asks to confirm a pass that would collapse the hole. Shows an "≈ N more passes" estimate with undo/reset, and the cumulative mass syncs live to everyone viewing the hole.
- **Wormhole type picker** — searchable popover for assigning the exact wormhole type to a connection; statics quick-info on hover shows destination class, mass, lifetime.
- **Multi-select bulk operations** — shift-click to select multiple systems/signatures, then bulk-assign type, delete, or rename.
- **PNG export** — render the current map (with sig counts, connections, status) to a PNG for sharing.
- **Map PNG / clipboard** — copy or download the current chain as an image for pings.
- **Wormhole sig aging** — wormhole signatures tint by their position in the WH type's known lifetime (yellow ≥50%, orange ≥90%, red past expected close). K162s stay neutral since the lifetime isn't knowable from this side.
- **Broken-chain detection** — deleting a wormhole signature severs the connection it backed instead of leaving two now-separate chains silently joined. Rather than removing the link (which loses the chain), it's *quarantined*: kept on the map but rendered severed — red dashed with a ✂ marker, stale labels dropped — and excluded from routing, so a collapsed chain is obvious instead of looking complete to a quick glance. The connection panel offers a one-click restore, and the link auto-un-breaks if a sig backs it again or a pilot jumps it.
- **Orphan cleanup** — a right-click canvas action sweeps away orphaned systems (no live connection, or only broken ones) in one go, while always protecting your home system and any locked systems. Shows a live count and confirms before removing; every removal is undoable.
- **Auto-remove aged wormholes** — opt-in per map (Connections section of the sidebar). A server-side sweep periodically removes wormhole signatures older than their type's maximum lifetime and quarantines any connection they backed. Because it runs server-side on a fixed cadence (`LAZY_WH_SWEEP_MINUTES`, default 15), it keeps synced and corp chains current even when nobody has the map open. K162s are aged against the 48h maximum WH lifetime; codes with no known lifetime are left alone.

### Personal, Corp & Alliance maps

- **Personal / Corp / Alliance scopes** — every user has personal maps that are always private. In corp mode each corp also gets shared corp maps (cross-corp visibility is opt-in via `CORP_MAP_SHARED`). In alliance mode there's a third scope above corp: **alliance maps** every member of the alliance can see, managed by the `alliance_admin` role, with cross-alliance sharing opt-in via `ALLIANCE_MAP_SHARED`. A corp inside an alliance still keeps its own corp-private maps without listing every member corp in `CORP_ID`. See [Corp & alliance mode](#corp--alliance-mode).
- **Multi-character accounts** — link several characters (alts) to a single account and switch the active character from the in-app switcher with no re-login, since each character's token is already stored. Linking merges that character's maps onto the account; the per-account map cap is enforced only at creation, so nothing is lost on link. You can also follow an alt's live (or last-known) location and route from it while flying your main, and unlink a character at any time — an unlinked character keeps its own data and becomes a standalone account again on its next login. The currently-active character can't be removed (switch away first).
- **Share a personal map with a character, corp, or alliance** — owners can grant edit access to a specific EVE character, an entire corp, or an entire alliance from the map sidebar. Recipients can edit signatures, structures, notes, and topology like a corp member but can't rename, delete, or re-share the map. Grants target raw EVE IDs, so they take effect on the recipient's very first Nexum login — no pre-registration required. The map appears in their switcher under a distinct "Shared" badge. Personal maps only; corp maps are already shared via membership. On a restricted deployment you can only share with an entity your corp/alliance holds at **positive standing** (see [Admitting friends without editing `.env`](#admitting-friends-without-editing-env)), and a **"Also let them log in"** option can admit the recipient to the login allow-list in the same step — otherwise a shared-but-unlisted corp's members still couldn't sign in to see it.
- **Multi-map support** — each character (or corp) can maintain multiple independent maps up to configured limits (`MAX_USER_MAPS` / `MAX_CORP_MAPS`).
- **Real-time collaboration** — edits propagate live to everyone viewing the same map. Adding/moving/removing systems, drawing or retyping connections, renaming or locking the map, signature and structure changes, and merges all appear for other viewers within moments — no refresh. Delivered over a per-map Server-Sent Events stream (access-checked, so you only ever receive events for maps you can see), with your own changes echo-suppressed and an automatic resync on reconnect. Purely additive: if the stream drops, editing still works exactly as before.
- **Merge maps** — fold one map's contents into another. The destination is the source of truth: existing systems are kept and only missing systems and connections are added, while signatures, structures, and notes are merged in (each toggleable in the merge dialog). New systems are aligned into the destination's existing layout near the systems they connect to, rather than dumped off to one side. Corp maps must be explicitly opted in — separately as a merge **source** and/or **destination** — and any merge touching a corp map is recorded in the audit log. See [Merging maps](#merging-maps) for the roles involved.
- **Cross-map sync** — opt-in (Map Controls → *Sync system data across my maps*). When the same EVE system appears on several of your maps, adding or editing its signatures and anomalies on one map copies them to the same system on your others — personal maps sync with your other personal maps, corp maps with the corp's other maps. Non-destructive: missing entries are inserted and blank fields filled, but data you've already entered is never overwritten and nothing is ever deleted (deletes and overwrite-paste removals stay local). Matches by EVE system id, so custom systems are skipped.
- **Map locking** — admins can freeze a corp map's topology. Systems, connections, and the map name lock for non-admins, but signatures, structures, and per-system notes stay editable so ops can continue while the layout is pinned. The toolbar shows an amber 🔒 chip while the lock is active, and passive location tracking won't auto-add new systems on a locked map.
- **Role-based access** — `admin` / `full` / `edit` / `readonly`. Roles only restrict corp-map actions; every user owns their personal maps regardless of role. See [Roles](#roles) for the full matrix.
- **External API** — generate a long-lived API key (🔑 in the toolbar) to read and drive your maps from your own tools and scripts: read maps, subscribe to a live event stream, and (with a write key) push signatures/anomalies/structures. Account-scoped, acts as a chosen character, role-gated, topology stays human-only, revocable. See [External API](#external-api).

### System intelligence

- **System panel** — per-system cards for signatures, structures, NPC stations, notes, killboard, and activity charts; cards are reorderable via drag-and-drop and persist per-user.
- **Signature management** — paste EVE scan results directly; tracks created/updated age per signature; auto-deletes sigs missing from a re-paste; bulk type assignment for multi-select.
- **Structure import** — paste EVE overview data to import player-owned structures.
- **Activity charts** — 24-hour rolling history of jumps, ship/pod kills, and NPC kills, polled hourly from ESI. The poller persists **every k-space system** (not just ones a Nexum user has opened), so chart data accumulates cluster-wide and survives server restarts.
- **Sovereignty & station data** — live alliance/corp/faction sov info and NPC station services with in-game waypoint/destination actions.
- **Killboard pane** — recent zKillboard activity per system; recent kills also bubble up as highlights on the map. NPC-only kills (CONCORD, rats, etc.) are hidden by default with a toggle to include them.
- **Live kill feed** — a single server-side consumer reads zKillboard's live **R2Z2 ephemeral** feed and, for a kill at or above an ISK threshold in a system on a *currently-viewed* map, pulses that system's node and prepends a row to the **Kill Log** panel (top-bar skull icon). A rolling in-memory buffer backfills the log on open — filtered to the map's systems, with no extra zKillboard requests — so it scales to any map size. Corp/alliance maps can additionally push kills to a Discord webhook. Opt-in via `KILL_FEED`; see [Live kill feed](#live-kill-feed-opt-in).
- **Standings overlay** — your EVE contact list (personal, corp, and alliance — fetched via ESI on login and re-pullable on demand from the sov header) drives a chain-wide visual layer. Sov holders show inline P/C/A pills with EVE-palette colour tiers; killboard rows tint red when a hostile actor is in the chain or a blue gets killed, blue when a friendly scores or a hostile dies; structures resolved via ESI tint by their owner corp's standing; sov-holder systems on the map gain a coloured halo. Nothing is sent off-instance — all logic runs against your own contacts.
- **Chain effect summary** — at-a-glance view of all wormhole effects currently present in the chain.

### Live ops

- **Scout connections** — Thera and Turnur public Eve-Scout connections surfaced into the sidebar so you can jump straight to known holes.
- **A0 sun detection** — auto-flags systems with A0 (yellow) suns visible via ESI for capital-friendly skirmish planning.
- **Ice belt systems** — Empire-space systems that spawn ice anomalies get a ❄ icon. Static list in `server/data/ice-belt-systems.json` (sourced from the EVE University wiki), resolved to `eve_system_id` at startup against the SDE. Null-sec ice tracking will come later via the scraped respawn feed.
- **Storm tracking** — active null-sec storms (Electric / Gamma / Exotic / Plasma) from the community-maintained [EveScout Rescue stormtrack](https://evescoutrescue.com/home/stormtrack.php) feed surface as a colour-coded ⚡ icon on matching system nodes, with a tooltip showing last report and reporter. Refreshed every 30 minutes. (ESI doesn't expose stellar phenomena yet; this scrapes the public community feed and will swap to ESI when CCP ships one.)
- **Proximity alerts** — incursions, pirate insurgencies, **and hostile-sov-holder systems** (any sov-holding system where you've set the corp or alliance to a negative standing) appear as a toolbar chip showing the closest threat in jumps. Configurable threshold with browser notification + audio ping when you cross into the zone.
- **Watchlist** — a personal, hand-edited list of holes you're hunting, in a dedicated left-side panel. Watch a specific system (name / J-code), a **wormhole type** (matched against statics, connections, and scanned signatures map-wide), or a **characteristic** (shattered, a system effect, frigate holes). Each entry has its own marker icon + colour and an optional note; matches are highlighted on the map and chime once when they appear. A "show on map" button pans/zooms to a match, expanding to a clickable list when an entry matches several. Stored per-user, so it follows you across devices and maps.
- **Inbound K162 alert** — when a signature's wormhole type is set to K162 anywhere on the map, a toast + browser notification + distinct audio ping fire immediately. K162 means "the other side opened this hole", so it's a strong intel signal that something just connected into your chain.
- **Configurable notifications** — a **Notifications** sidebar section lets you choose, per event (inbound K162, proximity threats, watchlist matches), whether it fires a desktop notification and/or a sound — each independently toggled. Defaults preserve the behaviour above (K162 and proximity on both channels; the watchlist keeps its chime and can opt into a desktop notification). Settings sync across your devices.
- **Discord notifications** — push corp chain intel to a Discord channel so alerts land even when nobody's watching the tab. Fires server-side on an inbound K162 and on a new wormhole connection, scoped to corp maps and configured per corp via a webhook URL (`DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`). Admins can narrow which regions and maps notify from the **Discord** tab in the admin panel. Best-effort and rate-limit-aware; bulk operations like region seeding never spam the channel. See [Discord notifications](#discord-notifications).
- **Voice announcements** *(experimental)* — an optional on-device announcer speaks live intel aloud so you don't have to watch the sidebar: a character or alt logging in / out, incursions or lawless (low/null-sec) systems entering your proximity threshold, recent kills in range, and a new chain saved by another viewer. The text-to-speech runs **entirely in your browser** — no server round-trip, nothing sent off-instance, works offline once the voice model is cached — and generation runs off the UI thread so it never janks the map. English-only, on by default with independent per-event toggles and a pick-and-preview voice (US/UK). Configured in the **Announcer** sidebar section.
- **Chain exit summary** — sidebar widget that counts every K-space exit currently on the map by security class (HS / LS / NS) as coloured chips, and pinpoints the nearest gate route to Jita ("Nearest Jita: 7j via Amarr") so loot runs and logistics planning don't need a manual route check.
- **Route planner** — server-side BFS over stargates + your live chain, so a route through a wormhole hop is a single click.
- **Jump-drive range overlay** — pick a staging system (search any low/null system by name, or right-click one on the map) and Nexum highlights every low/null system within jump range of it, colour-banded by ship class (Black Ops, Carrier, Super, Jump Freighter) at your Jump Drive Calibration level; a sidebar list gives the full reachable set with light-year distances and the map dims everything out of range so the reachable cluster stands out. Connections can also be tagged **Cyno Jump** (purple dotted, "CJ") to record a bridged route, auto-annotated with the star-to-star distance and which classes can make it — especially handy for black-ops staging. Needs 3D system coordinates in the SDE tables (`solar_systems.pos_x/y/z`, populated by `setup-db` or `scripts/backfill-coords.ts` — see [Installation](#installation)).
- **Location tracking** — opt-in live character location dot in the toolbar plus per-map "you are here" indicator.
- **Pilot presence** — see where everyone *viewing the same map* is right now: a blue dot (pilot name on hover) marks each other viewer's current system, live as they jump. Unlike fleet dots it covers anyone with the map open, not just your fleet. Opt-in via location sharing, scoped to maps you can see, and ephemeral (nothing stored).
- **Online status** — toolbar dot shows whether each user is currently logged into EVE Online.

### Productivity & UX

- **Command palette** — `Cmd/Ctrl + K` opens a fuzzy search across systems, sigs, and actions (jump to system, set waypoint, toggle panes).
- **Home hotkey** — jump the viewport back to the home system from any panel.
- **Recent-kill highlights** — systems with kills in the last hour get a coloured halo so you can see fresh activity at a glance.
- **User stats modal** — per-character totals: jumps, signatures by type, broken down by day/week/month/year/forever, plus a 30-day daily sparkline of scanning activity with hover tooltips.
- **Server status widget** — live Tranquility server status, player count, and ESI health in the toolbar.
- **Demo map** — the landing page mounts a non-editable demo map so visitors can see what the tool does before logging in.
- **Collapsible sidebar** — Map Options, Connections, Proximity Alerts, Stale System Fade, and Shortcuts each expand or collapse independently. Per-section open/closed state persists per browser via `localStorage`.
- **European date format** — DD-MM-YYYY everywhere a date is displayed (chart axes, relative-time fallbacks for events older than a month). ISO timestamps are still used in CSV exports for spreadsheet sortability.
- **Multi-lingual** — the entire UI is translated into nine languages: English, Deutsch, Français, Español, Português, 简体中文, 한국어, 日本語, and Русский. The language is auto-detected from the browser (regional locales like `es-MX` or `en-GB` map to the base language) and can be changed any time from the in-app language switcher; the choice persists per browser. The public landing and comparison pages are localised too.

### For corporations & alliances

These features only matter once `CORP_ID` or `ALLIANCE_ID` is set — see [Corp & alliance mode](#corp--alliance-mode) for the full configuration.

- **Multi-corp deployments** — `CORP_ID` accepts a comma-separated list of corporation IDs. One Nexum instance can host several corps; each corp's maps stay scoped to its own members unless `CORP_MAP_SHARED=true`.
- **Alliance-wide maps** — `ALLIANCE_ID` adds a third map scope above corp: **alliance maps** every member of the alliance can see. Login is admitted if a character's corp is in `CORP_ID` **or** their alliance is in `ALLIANCE_ID`, so a whole alliance is permitted without listing every member corp. Set `ALLIANCE_MAP_SHARED=true` to share alliance maps across a coalition of listed alliances. A corp inside the alliance still keeps its own corp-private maps (derived from the members' corp at login).
- **Alliance admin role** — a dedicated `alliance_admin` tier sits above `admin`: it manages alliance maps and every member's role across the whole alliance (a superset of the corp admin), while corp admins stay scoped to their own corp. Only an alliance admin can create/delete/lock alliance maps or grant the `alliance_admin` role. The bootstrap `ADMIN_CHAR_ID` is pinned to `alliance_admin` when `ALLIANCE_ID` is set.
- **User access control** — decide who can sign in beyond the immutable `.env` core: a database login allow-list managed in the admin area, optional auto-admit of friendly corps/alliances by in-game standing, and a standings viewer — all with live session re-validation. See [Admitting friends without editing `.env`](#admitting-friends-without-editing-env).
- **Admin dashboard** — a dedicated `#/admin` page with five tabs: Users, Maps, Reports, Discord, Audit log. Admins reach it from the toolbar's Admin button. The Users tab has a member search and a **Roles?** explainer.
- **User management** — change roles, block / unblock, and force an ESI corp-membership re-check on demand. Self-block / self-demote and changes to `ADMIN_CHAR_ID` are guarded against. Anyone who has left every listed corp is auto-blocked on the next login or recheck.
- **Map management** — admins see every corp map (solo maps are excluded by design) with owner avatar, corp ticker, system / connection counts, lock state, and last-active time. Force-lock, force-unlock, and force-delete are one-click each.
- **Users report** — per-character last-login, systems added / deleted, structures added, signatures broken down by type, and last-corp-activity timestamps. Every column sortable, filterable by activity (logins / signatures / structures) and time window (24h / week / month / year / all), exportable as CSV.
- **Systems report** — aggregate corp-map signatures with a sig-type donut, daily / monthly activity line chart (bucketing adapts to the window), and a sortable wormhole-type breakdown.
- **Audit log** — every admin action (role change, block, force-lock, force-unlock, force-delete, ESI corp change, auto-block on departure, corp-map merge as source/destination) is recorded with actor, target, old → new value, and timestamp. Exportable as CSV.
- **Corp ticker resolution** — corp IDs in the Users and Maps reports are resolved to in-game tickers via ESI (`/v5/corporations/{id}/`), with a 1-hour in-memory cache to keep the report loads cheap.
- **Per-character attribution** — sigs, structures, and system add / delete actions are recorded with the user who made them, so reports can answer "who has been scanning what" with no manual logging.

### Admitting friends without editing `.env`

Historically the only way to let someone log in was to add their corp/alliance to `CORP_ID` / `ALLIANCE_ID` and restart. Now those env lists **seed a database login allow-list** on boot, and admins manage the rest live:

- **The `.env` core is immutable.** Every `CORP_ID` / `ALLIANCE_ID` entry becomes an allow-list row marked as env-sourced. Those rows can't be changed or removed from the admin area — only by editing `.env` — so a mistaken (or compromised) admin can never lock out or open up the deployment's core. Editing `.env` and rebooting reconciles the core exactly.
- **Add friendly corps, alliances, or individual characters** to the allow-list from the admin area without touching `.env` or restarting. Their members can then log in; what they can actually *see* is still governed separately (a newly-admitted guest defaults to read-only and sees only maps explicitly shared with them).
- **Positive standing is required** (for corp/alliance targets; individual characters are exempt). You can only admit a corp or alliance your deployment holds at **positive** standing in-game. An alliance installation reads the alliance's contacts; a corp installation reads the corp's own contacts — and because a corp's contact list can hold an alliance standing, **a corp installation can admit a whole friendly alliance too**, gated on the corp's own standing toward it. Neutral (0) and negative (−5 / −10) are refused.
- **Auto-admit friends by standing (optional, off by default)** — instead of adding corps one by one, you can flip a switch so that anyone your corp/alliance holds at a chosen in-game standing (**+10 only**, or **+5 and above**) may log in automatically. An alliance installation reads the alliance's contacts; a corp installation reads the corp's own contacts and matches the pilot's corp, character, or alliance (so a corp can auto-admit a whole friendly alliance). Only positive standings qualify (neutral and negative never do), and it needs your contacts synced first (a director-role character has to sync them via the **Sync standings** button, which pulls only the corp/alliance contact lists). Turning it off reverts to the explicit allow-list.
- **Standings viewer** — a popout on the access page lists your deployment's corp/alliance contacts grouped by standing band (**+10 / +5 / 0 / −5 / −10**) with name, ticker, and standing, so you can see at a glance who the standings auto-admit would let in.
- **Access is re-checked on live sessions, not just at login.** The login gate runs once at sign-in, so Nexum continuously re-validates who's already signed in: removing a grant, tightening the standings settings, or syncing standings **immediately** logs out anyone the gate no longer permits (instead of waiting out their 7-day session). A periodic sweep also refreshes each logged-in pilot's corp/alliance from ESI, so someone who **leaves an admitted corp is evicted without having to log in again** (an ESI outage is fail-safe — it never mass-evicts). When a session is revoked, the browser drops back to the login screen on its next request. The bootstrap `ADMIN_CHAR_ID` is never locked out.

Every allow-list change is written to the [Audit log](#corp--alliance-mode).

## Wormhole bookmarks

Generate a consistent, paste-ready name for a wormhole and drop it straight into your in-game bookmark, so your Locations window reads the same way for everyone in the chain.

**How to use it.** In the signatures pane, every wormhole signature row has a copy button. Click it and the generated name is copied to your clipboard — alt-tab into EVE, bookmark the hole, and paste the name into the bookmark's name field. The exact text that was copied is shown in a toast.

**Choosing the format.** The name is built from a token template you can change in the sidebar under **Map Options → Signature bookmark** (it's saved to your account, so it follows you across devices). Hover the field's label to see the full token list. The default is:

```
{sig} {dest_type} {size}        →  e.g.  ABC-123 C5 M
```

**Available tokens** (any token that can't be filled in just disappears, and extra spaces are collapsed, so partly-scanned holes still come out tidy):

| Token | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `{sig}` | `ABC-123` | Full signature ID |
| `{sig_letters}` | `ABC` | First three characters of the ID |
| `{type}` | `D382` | Wormhole type code |
| `{dest_type}` | `C5`, `HS` | Destination class |
| `{size}` | `S` / `M` / `L` / `XL` | Hole size (from max jump mass) |
| `{mass}` | `3.0` | Total mass, in billions of kg |
| `{age}` | `2h` | Hours since the sig was first seen |
| `{name}` | | The signature's name field |
| `{notes}` | | The signature's notes field |

> Tip: `{age}` reflects when the signature was *first scanned*, so it reads `0h` right after you add a hole — useful for re-copying an older bookmark later, but most people leave it out of the default.

## External API

Read **and drive** your maps programmatically — pull the live chain into a fleet bot, auto-import scan results from an intel tool, run a "is home open to highsec?" checker, or your own scripts. Authenticated with a long-lived **API key** you generate, instead of a browser session.

> **Turning it off (self-hosters).** Set `DISABLE_EXTERNAL_API=true` in the server environment to switch this whole surface off. Every `/api/v1` request then returns `403` — reads, writes, and the live event stream alike — and the app disables API-key creation (the 🔑 toolbar button greys out with an "API keys disabled" tooltip). Already-issued keys stop working but aren't deleted, so setting it back to `false` (the default) restores them without re-issuing. Only affects inbound API access — it doesn't touch the app's own UI or outbound Discord / webhook pushes.

**Generate a key.** Click the 🔑 icon in the toolbar (next to the language switcher). Give it a name, pick which of your characters it **acts as** (the key can do exactly what that character can — same maps, same role), choose its **access** (see scopes below), and optionally set an expiry. The key is shown **once** at creation — copy it then; it's stored only as a hash and can't be retrieved again. Revoke any key from the same panel and any tool using it loses access immediately.

**Scopes** (each includes the ones above it):

| Scope | Can |
|---|---|
| **Read only** | Read maps, systems, signatures, anomalies, structures |
| **Read + live events** | …plus subscribe to the live event stream |
| **Read + write content** | …plus add / edit / delete signatures, anomalies, and structures |

Writes are limited to **per-system content**. Map **topology** (adding/moving systems, drawing connections, rename, lock) is deliberately human-only — no key can change it.

**Authenticate.** Send the key as a Bearer token:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer nxm_…" https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/maps
```

**Read endpoints** (any scope):

| Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/maps` | Maps visible to the key's account |
| `GET /api/v1/maps/:mapId` | Full map — systems + connections |
| `GET /api/v1/maps/:mapId/systems/:systemId/signatures` | Scanned signatures in a system |
| `GET /api/v1/maps/:mapId/systems/:systemId/anomalies` | Cosmic anomalies in a system |
| `GET /api/v1/maps/:mapId/systems/:systemId/structures` | Player structures in a system |
| `GET /api/v1/maps/:mapId/events` | **Live event stream** (SSE) — needs *Read + live events* |

**Write endpoints** (need *Read + write content*; gated by the bound character's role just like the app):

| Endpoint | Does |
|---|---|
| `POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/maps/:mapId/systems/:systemId/signatures[/:sigId]` | Add / edit / remove a signature |
| `POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/maps/:mapId/systems/:systemId/anomalies[/:anomId]` | Add / edit / remove an anomaly |
| `POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/maps/:mapId/systems/:systemId/structures[/:structureId]` | Add / edit / remove a structure |

Writes go through the exact same path as the app — so they fan out over the [event stream](#live-event-stream), trigger the inbound-K162 Discord notice, and cross-map sync just like a human edit.

### Live event stream

`GET /api/v1/maps/:mapId/events` is a [Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) stream of the same live edits the web client receives — so a tool can stay in sync without polling. It needs a key with the **Read + live events** scope (a plain read key gets `403`). On connect it sends a `presence.snapshot`, then one JSON event per edit; lines beginning `:` are heartbeat/keep-alive comments.

```bash
curl -N -H "Authorization: Bearer nxm_…" \
  https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/maps/<mapId>/events
```

Each `data:` line is a JSON object with a `type` and a type-specific payload. The published event types (the public contract):

| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `system.add` / `system.update` / `system.remove` | A system was added, changed (status, notes, position, activity), or removed |
| `connection.add` / `connection.update` / `connection.remove` | A connection was drawn, retyped (mass/EOL/type), or deleted |
| `sig.changed` / `anom.changed` / `structure.changed` | A system's signatures / anomalies / structures changed |
| `map.meta` / `map.resync` | Map metadata (name, lock) changed / clients should refetch |
| `presence.snapshot` / `presence.update` / `presence.leave` | Who's viewing the map and where (ephemeral) |

> Single-process delivery: the stream is served in-memory by one instance, the same as the in-app live sync. A multi-replica deployment would need the documented Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY` swap — see the realtime-sync notes.

**Scope and safety.** Keys are **account-scoped** — a key can do everything its account can within its scope, so treat it as a secret. Writes are capped at per-system content (never topology) and are still gated by the bound character's role, so a key acting as a `readonly` corp member can't write a corp map. Keys can be given an expiry, record a *last used* time so you can spot a stale or leaked key, and are one-click revocable. Share-link tokens are never returned through the API.

## Installation

### Option 1 — Docker (recommended)

**Prerequisites:** Docker with Compose, an EVE Online developer application ([developers.eveonline.com](https://developers.eveonline.com)).

**1. Clone and configure**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GQuantrill/eve-nexum.git
cd eve-nexum
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in the required values:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PG_PASSWORD` | Yes | PostgreSQL password |
| `NODE_ENV` | Optional | Set to `development` for local dev (auto-derives `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` from `SESSION_SECRET` and relaxes session-cookie settings). Defaults to `production` in Docker, where missing `SESSION_SECRET` / `EVE_CLIENT_ID` / `EVE_CLIENT_SECRET` will fail fast at boot. |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Yes | Random secret — run `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Yes (production) | 64 hex chars used to encrypt stored EVE OAuth tokens at rest — run `openssl rand -hex 32`. **Do not change after first boot** — rotating this key makes existing stored tokens unreadable and forces every user to re-login. In development the key is auto-derived from `SESSION_SECRET` if unset. |
| `EVE_CLIENT_ID` | Yes | From your EVE developer app |
| `EVE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes | From your EVE developer app |
| `EVE_CALLBACK_URL` | Yes | Must match the callback registered in your EVE app — e.g. `https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback` |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Yes | Public URL of the app — e.g. `https://yourdomain.com` |
| `DOMAIN` | Traefik only | Bare hostname for the Traefik router rule — e.g. `nexum.yourdomain.com` |
| `CORP_ID` | Optional | Restricts logins to specific EVE corporations. **Comma-separated list** of corporation IDs — anyone whose corp is not admitted is rejected at the OAuth callback (unless their alliance is in `ALLIANCE_ID`). Leave empty/unset to allow any EVE character to log in. Example single corp: `98000001`. Example multi-corp: `98000001,98000002`. **On boot this list _seeds_ the login allow-list** (see [Admitting friends without editing `.env`](#admitting-friends-without-editing-env)): the env-seeded entries are the immutable "core" — additional corps, alliances, or individual characters are admitted live from the admin area without editing `.env` or restarting. Removing a corp from `CORP_ID` removes its core entry on the next boot. |
| `ALLIANCE_ID` | Optional | Restricts logins to specific EVE alliances, and adds the **alliance map** scope. **Comma-separated list** of alliance IDs. A character is admitted if their corp is in `CORP_ID` **or** their alliance is in `ALLIANCE_ID`, so a whole alliance can be permitted without listing every member corp. Like `CORP_ID`, this seeds the immutable core of the login allow-list. The list also forms the coalition for `ALLIANCE_MAP_SHARED`. Example: `99000001` or `99000001,99000002`. |
| `ADMIN_CHAR_ID` | When `CORP_ID` or `ALLIANCE_ID` is set | EVE character ID of the bootstrap admin. Forced to the top role on first login (`alliance_admin` when `ALLIANCE_ID` is set, otherwise `admin`) and cannot be demoted or blocked by other admins. **Not a membership exemption** — this character still has to be in a listed corp or alliance to log in. See [What happens when a user leaves the corp](#what-happens-when-a-user-leaves-the-corp). |
| `DEFAULT_USER_ROLE` | Optional | Role **new** users are created with on a corp/alliance instance. Default `readonly` (an admin then promotes them). Set to `edit` to let every admitted member edit maps as soon as they log in (`full` is the tier just above `edit`). Existing users keep their current role. Limited to the editing tiers — `admin` / `alliance_admin` can never be granted by default and must be assigned per-user; any other value falls back to `readonly`. |
| `CORP_MAP_SHARED` | Optional | `1` / `true` to share every corp map across every listed corp. Default (`false`) scopes corp maps to the corp that created them — Corp A's chain stays invisible to Corp B even when they share a deployment. Only enable when all listed corps explicitly trust each other. |
| `ALLIANCE_MAP_SHARED` | Optional | Alliance counterpart of `CORP_MAP_SHARED`. `1` / `true` makes every alliance map visible to every listed alliance (coalition mode). Default (`false`) scopes each alliance map to its owning alliance. |
| `CORP_MAP_TIME` | Optional | Grace period (days) for the map-cleanup sweeps, which run hourly in restricted mode. **Corp/alliance maps** are deleted once untouched for this long. **Personal maps** are deleted only when their owning account can no longer log in (left every admitted corp/alliance, dropped below the standings threshold, or was blocked) *and* the map has been untouched this long — an active member's idle personal maps are never removed. Default `30`. |
| `MAX_USER_MAPS` | Optional | Max number of personal maps per user. Default `5`. |
| `MAX_CORP_MAPS` | Optional | Max number of corp maps per corp. Default `5`. |
| `MAX_ALLIANCE_MAPS` | Optional | Max number of alliance maps per alliance. Default `5`. |
| `INCLUDE_DEMO_MAP` | Optional | `1` / `true` (default) seeds a starter **Demo Map** on each user's first login so the canvas isn't blank. Set to `0` / `false` to give new users an empty map instead. |
| `LAZY_WH_SWEEP_MINUTES` | Optional | Cadence (minutes) of the lazy wormhole-removal sweep, which removes aged-out WH sigs and quarantines the connections they backed on maps that have opted in. Default `15`. Set to `0` to disable the sweep entirely. |
| `ACCESS_REVALIDATE_MINUTES` | Optional | Cadence (minutes) of the login-access re-validation sweep, which logs out any live session the access gate no longer permits — e.g. a pilot who dropped below the auto-admit standing or left an admitted corp. Restricted deployments only. Default `60`. Set to `0` to disable the periodic sweep (an admin settings change still evicts immediately). |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | Optional | Discord webhook(s) for corp-intel notifications (inbound K162, new connections). One URL fires for **every** corp map; for multi-corp deployments use `corpId=URL` pairs (comma-separated) to route each corp to its own channel — e.g. `98000001=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/…,98000002=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/…`. Personal maps never notify. Leave unset to disable. Which regions/maps actually notify is then filtered per corp in the admin **Discord** tab. See [Discord notifications](#discord-notifications). |

#### EVE developer app scopes

When registering your application at [developers.eveonline.com](https://developers.eveonline.com), enable the following scopes:

| Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `esi-location.read_location.v1` | Read character's current solar system |
| `esi-location.read_ship_type.v1` | Read character's active ship |
| `esi-location.read_online.v1` | Read character online status |
| `esi-ui.open_window.v1` | Open windows in the EVE client |
| `esi-ui.write_waypoint.v1` | Set destinations and add waypoints |
| `esi-universe.read_structures.v1` | Read player-owned structure info |
| `esi-corporations.read_structures.v1` | List the **corporation's** Upwell structures for use as jump-planner endpoints. Only succeeds for a character with the in-game **Station Manager** or **Director** role; the sync no-ops for anyone else. Any corp member can then read the structures a role-holder pulled. |
| `esi-corporations.read_corporation_membership.v1` | Read corporation member list |
| `esi-characters.read_corporation_roles.v1` | Read character's corporation roles |
| `esi-characters.read_contacts.v1` | Read the character's personal contact list (standings) — used to colour-tag hostile / friendly entities in the Standings card, Killboard, Sov holder, and map node halos. |
| `esi-corporations.read_contacts.v1` | Read the **corporation's** shared contact list. Only succeeds for characters with the in-game **Contact Manager** role; the call is gracefully skipped for anyone else. When it does succeed, the entire corp benefits from the pulled standings until the next refresh. |
| `esi-alliances.read_contacts.v1` | Read the **alliance's** shared contact list. Requires the character to be in the alliance executor corp with the right role; almost always denied for normal members, and that's fine — the call no-ops without breaking login. |
| `esi-clones.read_clones.v1` | **Opt-in — off by default.** Read where the character's medical clone and jump clones are. Two uses: location tracking needs it to tell a **clone jump from a flown jump**, so a death clone or jump clone no longer draws a wormhole between the system you left and the one you woke up in; and it powers the **Clones** panel showing where your clones sit relative to the chain. Read-only, and never exposed to anyone but the character themselves. **Add it to your EVE application first, then set `ESI_CLONES_SCOPE=true`** — the app does not request it otherwise. Asking for a scope your application lacks makes SSO reject *every* login with `invalid_scope`, so this is never enabled for you automatically. While it's off, clone-jump detection and the Clones panel simply stay dormant and nothing else changes. |
| `esi-wallet.read_corporation_wallets.v1` | **Opt-in — off by default, and never requested at login.** Reads the wallet journal of the corporation nominated by `ISK_MAPS_CORP_ID` so that ISK donations can raise a pilot's personal map limit (see **ISK for extra maps** below). Unlike every other scope here this one is NOT part of the login request: it is granted once, by an admin, through *Admin → Maps → Connect wallet reader*, and only for the single character in `ISK_MAPS_READER_CHAR_ID`. That character needs the in-game **Accountant** or **Junior Accountant** role in the recipient corporation or ESI answers 403. No ordinary user is ever asked for wallet access, and a deployment whose EVE application lacks the scope cannot have its logins broken by it. |
| `esi-fleets.read_fleet.v1` | Read the character's current fleet composition (members + their solar systems) so fleet-mates show up as purple dots on the map with a hover tooltip listing names. Member-list reads require the character to be the **fleet boss**; wing/squad commanders see "in a fleet, no member visibility" and the UI degrades silently. |

#### ISK for extra maps

A public deployment can let pilots raise their **own** personal map limit by donating ISK
to a corporation you nominate. It is off by default, and it is ignored entirely when
`CORP_ID` or `ALLIANCE_ID` is set — a corp or alliance install manages its own limits and
never sees the option.

How it works: the recipient corporation's wallet journal is polled, each `player_donation`
is matched to the donating character's Nexum account, and the account's cap becomes

```
MAX_USER_MAPS + floor(total donated / ISK_MAPS_PRICE) * ISK_MAPS_PER_GRANT + admin adjustment
```

Entitlement **accumulates** rather than counting donations, so two half payments earn a
grant and one double payment earns two.

Setting it up, in this order:

1. Add `esi-wallet.read_corporation_wallets.v1` to your EVE application and let it propagate.
2. Set `ISK_MAPS_ENABLED`, `ISK_MAPS_CORP_ID` and `ISK_MAPS_READER_CHAR_ID` (see `.env.example`), then restart.
3. Go to **Admin → Maps → Connect wallet reader** and log in as the reader character.

Things worth knowing before you turn it on:

- **The reader character needs the in-game Accountant or Junior Accountant role** in the
  recipient corporation. Without it ESI returns 403 and nothing is credited.
- **Crediting takes up to an hour.** EVE publishes corporation wallets hourly; polling
  faster just re-reads the same cached page. The donation modal says so.
- **Only donations made after you connect the reader count.** ESI still returns 30 days of
  history, and crediting it retroactively would be a surprise.
- **A donation from a character not linked to any account is held, not lost.** It appears
  under Admin → Maps for you to assign, and is credited automatically if the donor links
  that character later.
- **If the reader stops working** — token revoked, role removed, character leaves the corp —
  the admin page says so. Watch it: ESI only keeps 30 days, so a reader left broken for
  longer than that loses those donations permanently.

#### One-command deploy scripts

Not comfortable with Docker commands? The repo ships small scripts that run the whole **pull → build → restart** cycle for you, so both first setup and later updates are a single command from the repo root — no need to remember the `docker compose` lines below.

**Use the scripts for _your_ operating system — Linux/macOS _or_ Windows, not both.** They do the same thing; the `.sh` and `.ps1` versions are just for different shells.

**Linux / macOS** — run the `.sh` scripts:

| Run this | Use it for | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `./build-traefik.sh` | **The live / public site** (fronted by Traefik) | `git pull`, then build + `up -d` with **both** compose files |
| `./build.sh` | **Local / dev** (no Traefik) | `git pull`, then a plain build + `up -d` |

**Windows** — run the `.ps1` scripts in PowerShell:

| Run this | Use it for | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `.\build-traefik.ps1` | **The live / public site** (fronted by Traefik) | `git pull`, then build + `up -d` with **both** compose files |
| `.\build.ps1` | **Local / dev** (no Traefik) | `git pull`, then a plain build + `up -d` |

Each script **stops if a step fails**, so a broken pull or build never restarts the site with a bad image. On the **first** run it also downloads EVE's static data (a few minutes) — that's the importer described under **Build and start the stack** below; nothing is stuck.

> **On your public server, always use `build-traefik`.** A plain build without the Traefik overlay 404s the live site. The plain `build` scripts are for local/dev only. (Traefik setup is covered under **Reverse proxy** below.)
>
> First run on Windows may need `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process RemoteSigned`; on Linux/macOS the `.sh` files are already executable (`chmod +x` is preset).

**2. Build and start the stack**

The server depends on the EVE Static Data Export (SDE) tables (`map_stargates`, `solar_systems`, `item_types`, …) at boot — without them, route-graph initialisation throws and the container crash-loops. A dedicated `importer` service handles this: it runs once after Postgres is healthy, downloads the SDE (~hundreds of MB from CCP, a few minutes; logs progress per table), populates the static tables, then exits. The server waits for it to finish (`service_completed_successfully`) before booting, so a single command brings everything up in the right order.

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

The app will be available on port `${WEB_PORT:-80}` (defaults to `80`).

The import is self-skipping: on every later `up` or restart the importer sees the static tables are already populated and exits in a second without re-downloading. So the two commands above are also your update flow — or just run one of the [one-command deploy scripts](#one-command-deploy-scripts) above. To force a re-import (e.g. after a CCP SDE drop), see [Updating the SDE](#updating-the-sde) below.

The importer also stores each system's universe coordinates and CCP's 2D star-map projection (`position` / `position2D`), which power the [Seed a map from a region](#features) feature.

**3. Reverse proxy (optional)**

To front the stack with Traefik for TLS and a public URL, add `DOMAIN=nexum.yourdomain.com` to your `.env`, then:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.traefik.yml up -d
```
Traefik will handle TLS termination and HTTP→HTTPS redirects. The `docker-compose.traefik.yml` overlay assumes a Traefik network named `traefik-public` and a cert resolver named `letsencrypt`.

> **Tip — avoid retyping the overlay.** Every `docker compose ...` command below uses the standard form. If you run with the Traefik overlay, either prefix each command with `-f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.traefik.yml`, or set it once per shell session:
> ```bash
> export COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.traefik.yml
> ```
> After that, plain `docker compose ...` automatically loads both files. Add the export to `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc` if it's the only deployment on that host.

**4. Reaching Postgres from the host (optional)**

By default Postgres is internal to the compose network — nothing on the host can connect to it. To expose it for backups, a `psql` client, or a monitoring probe, set `PG_HOST_BIND` and add the `docker-compose.dbhost.yml` overlay:
```bash
PG_HOST_BIND=127.0.0.1 docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dbhost.yml up -d
```
It binds **loopback only** (`127.0.0.1:5432`) by default, so the port is reachable from the host machine but not from the network. `build-traefik.sh` adds this overlay automatically whenever `PG_HOST_BIND` is set, so under a secrets manager you just put `PG_HOST_BIND=127.0.0.1` in your secrets — no local compose edit. Set `PG_HOST_BIND=0.0.0.0` only if you deliberately want it on all interfaces (rarely a good idea).

App-schema migrations (`users`, `maps`, `map_signatures`, etc.) layer on automatically the first time the server boots — no manual step.

> **Schema ownership.** The one-shot importer (`server/scripts/setup-db.ts`) creates only the **static/SDE** schema and its indexes (`solar_systems`, `map_stargates`, `item_types`, …) — it must not depend on app columns the server migration adds later, since the importer runs *before* the server boots. **App-table indexes are owned by `server/src/migrate.ts`**, which creates them after the app columns are guaranteed to exist. (Keeping an app-table index in the importer would crash a fresh bootstrap on a missing column.)

#### Updating the SDE

The static data (systems, stargates, item types, dogma — everything CCP ships in the Static Data Export) is imported into Postgres at first boot and kept current from there. Here's how it stays up to date, how to force it, and how to check which build you're on.

**Automatic (the default — you normally do nothing).** The server checks once a day (default **11:30 UTC**, just after the 11:00 downtime when CCP publishes the new export) — plus a catch-up a few minutes after every restart, so a deploy that missed the daily slot, or a build CCP publishes off-cycle, doesn't leave you stale for ~24h. The check is cheap: a single `HEAD` request reads the build number from CCP's "latest" redirect (`…/eve-online-static-data-<build>-jsonl.zip`) and compares it to the build recorded in the `sde_meta` table. If — and only if — the build changed, the server downloads the new export, re-seeds the static tables, reloads its in-memory route graph in place, then **deletes the downloaded zip** so it doesn't sit on disk. No new build, no download; a re-seed needs no restart.

The re-seed is upsert-only (`ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` on every table), so it's safe — your user data (maps, signatures, structures, sessions, etc.) lives in other tables and is never touched.

Tune it via `.env`:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `SDE_AUTO_UPDATE` | `1` (on) | Set to `0` to disable the daily check entirely. |
| `SDE_CHECK_UTC` | `11:30` | Time of day (HH:MM, UTC) to run the check. |

**Forcing an update now** (e.g. to test, right after a known CCP drop, or if you disabled the daily check). Run the importer with `FORCE_SDE_IMPORT=1` — it downloads the latest export and re-seeds regardless of the recorded build:

```bash
# Docker
docker compose run --rm -e FORCE_SDE_IMPORT=1 importer
```

```bash
# Local development (Postgres on localhost)
cd server && FORCE_SDE_IMPORT=1 yarn setup-db
```

**Checking which build you're on.** `GET /api/sde/version` is public and browser-callable — it reports the build this instance is running against the latest CCP currently offers, so you can confirm an update landed (or see that one is pending):

```jsonc
// GET /api/sde/version
{
  "installed":   "3365090",                  // build imported into this DB (null if never seeded)
  "installedAt": "2026-05-29T11:29:00.000Z", // when that build was imported
  "latest":      "3368760",                  // latest build CCP offers (null if CCP unreachable)
  "latestCheckedAt": "2026-06-02T11:30:00.000Z", // when THIS endpoint last queried CCP (cached)
  "upToDate":    false,                       // true | false | null (unknown)
  "autoUpdate":  true,                        // is the daily auto-update enabled?
  "autoCheck": { "at": "2026-06-02T11:30:12.000Z", "result": "updated" } // last auto-update run (null until one fires)
}
```

`installed` vs `latest` are directly comparable — both are CCP build numbers from the same source the importer uses. `upToDate` is `null` ("unknown") rather than a misleading `false` when either build can't be determined (CCP unreachable, or a never-seeded DB).

Two timestamps that are easy to confuse: **`latestCheckedAt`** is when *this endpoint* last asked CCP for the latest build (cached — a single `HEAD`, 1 h on success / 5 min after a failure, so the endpoint is cheap to poll). **`autoCheck`** is when the *auto-updater* itself last ran and what it did (`updated` / `unchanged` / `error` / `skipped`) — that's the field to watch to confirm the daily check is actually firing. It's `null` until the first check runs in the current process. For the full picture, the server also logs each run under the `sde-update` tag (`docker compose logs server | grep sde-update`).

#### Refreshing wormhole types

Mostly automatic. Wormhole stats (destination class, mass limits, lifetime, mass-regen) are derived live from the imported SDE dogma, so a CCP **rebalance** flows in on the next daily re-seed with no action — no `extract-wormholes`, no rebuild.

The only thing the SDE can't provide is `src` ("where can this WH appear") — community knowledge curated in `data/wormholes.json`. When CCP adds a **brand-new WH type** (rare — usually a major expansion), it auto-appears in `/api/wormholes/types` with its derived stats and an empty `src`, and the server logs it as needing curation. To fill in `src`, add the code to `data/wormholes.json` and rebuild:

```bash
# Optional: scaffold any new codes (preserves existing curation, fills new
# entries with placeholder src). Then edit data/wormholes.json by hand.
docker compose run --rm \
  -v "$PWD/server:/app" -w /app -e NODE_ENV=development \
  --entrypoint sh server -c "yarn install --frozen-lockfile && yarn extract-wormholes"
docker compose build server && docker compose up -d
```

See [Static data files](#static-data-files) for what `extract-wormholes` does and the fields involved.

#### Live kill feed (opt-in)

Flags recent high-value kills on your mapped systems and feeds a **Kill Log** panel (top-bar skull icon). A single server-side consumer reads zKillboard's live **R2Z2 ephemeral** feed; for a kill at or above a value threshold in a system on a *currently-viewed* map, it pulses that system's node and prepends a row to the log. It also keeps a rolling in-memory buffer of recent high-value kills, and opening the log **backfills from that buffer** (filtered to the map's systems) — no extra zKillboard requests, so it scales to any map size. Corp/alliance maps can additionally push kills to a Discord webhook (**Admin → Discord**).

**Off by default.** Enable and tune via `.env`:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `KILL_FEED` | `0` (off) | Set to `1` to run the consumer. While off the whole feature is inert — nothing flashes and the Kill Log stays empty (the buffer is only filled by the running consumer). |
| `KILL_FEED_CONTACT` | — | A reachable contact (email or URL) — it builds the zKillboard `User-Agent`. Required by zKill fair-use; a blank UA is Cloudflare-blocked. |
| `KILL_FEED_MIN_ISK` | `50000000` | Only kills at or above this ISK value are flagged, logged, and buffered. |
| `KILL_FEED_RECENT_SECONDS` | `900` (15 min) | How long a node stays flagged after a kill lands there. |
| `KILL_FEED_BACKFILL_SECONDS` | `10800` (3 h) | How long the in-memory buffer retains kills — i.e. how far back the Kill Log shows on open. |

Fair-use: the consumer is a single poller that stays under zKill's 15 req/s limit and waits ~10 s between checks when the feed is caught up. The Kill Log **backfill is served entirely from the in-memory buffer** — no per-system zKillboard requests — but it therefore only contains kills seen **since the server started**, filling in over the first few hours of uptime. On boot the consumer logs `[killFeed] live kill feed enabled …` (or `disabled …`), plus a periodic heartbeat and a line per forwarded kill (`… | grep killFeed`).

#### Upgrading an existing deployment

Pulling a new Nexum release into a running instance:

- **App-schema changes apply automatically.** New columns and tables (e.g. the map-merge `allow_as_merge_source` / `allow_as_merge_destination` flags, the solar-system coordinate columns) are added by the migration that runs on every server boot — just rebuild and restart:
  ```bash
  docker compose build && docker compose up -d
  ```

#### Backup & restore

Two scripts under `scripts/` handle the Postgres database for a docker-compose deployment. Both read `PG_USER` / `PG_DB` from your `.env`, so they stay in sync with the running stack. Paths are configurable via env vars (`NEXUM_PROJECT_DIR`, `NEXUM_BACKUP_DIR`, `NEXUM_KEEP`, `NEXUM_FORCE`).

**Backup** — `scripts/backup-db.sh` runs `pg_dump`, gzips it, writes atomically, and prunes to the last `NEXUM_KEEP` (default 7). Safe under cron:
```bash
# one-off
./scripts/backup-db.sh
# daily at 05:00, as the user that owns the compose project
0 5 * * *  /opt/eve-nexum/scripts/backup-db.sh >> /var/log/nexum-backup.log 2>&1
```

**Restore** — `scripts/restore-db.sh` restores a dump (a given file, or the most recent in `NEXUM_BACKUP_DIR`). It's **destructive** (the dumps are `--clean --if-exists`, so it drops & recreates the dumped objects), so it prompts for confirmation and stops the server for the duration:
```bash
./scripts/restore-db.sh                                   # newest backup
./scripts/restore-db.sh /var/backups/nexum/nexum-2026-06-02.sql.gz
NEXUM_FORCE=1 ./scripts/restore-db.sh <file>              # skip the prompt (cron/automation)
```

The dump includes the EVE SDE tables (systems, stargates, dogma, …) alongside your user data — simplest and self-contained. The app schema applies on the next server boot and the SDE re-seeds if missing, so a restore heals itself even against a newer build.

### Option 2 — Local development

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, Yarn, PostgreSQL 16.

**1. Clone and configure**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GQuantrill/eve-nexum.git
cd eve-nexum
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `NODE_ENV=development` and point `PG_HOST=localhost` in your `.env`.

**2. Install dependencies**

```bash
cd server && yarn install
cd ../web   && yarn install
```

**3. Start the server**

```bash
cd server
yarn dev
```

**4. Start the frontend**

```bash
cd web
yarn dev
```

The frontend is available at `http://localhost:5174`. The Vite dev server proxies `/api` and `/auth` to `http://localhost:3001`.

> The server needs the EVE SDE imported into Postgres before it will boot — run `cd server && yarn setup-db` once (downloads the latest SDE and populates the static tables, including system coordinates).

## Corp & alliance mode

When `CORP_ID` and/or `ALLIANCE_ID` is set, Nexum operates in **restricted mode** — only members of the listed corporations or alliances can log in. The user roles described below apply only in restricted mode; open deployments (neither set) treat every authenticated character as a normal user with full access to their own maps.

### Allowing multiple corporations

`CORP_ID` accepts a comma-separated list of corporation IDs. Every character logging in is checked against this list via ESI; anyone whose corp is not included (and whose alliance isn't in `ALLIANCE_ID`) is bounced to the landing page with `?error=not_in_corp`.

```dotenv
# Single corp
CORP_ID=98000001

# Two (or more) corps sharing the same deployment
CORP_ID=98000001,98000002,98000003
```

### Alliance mode

Set `ALLIANCE_ID` to permit whole alliances without enumerating every member corp. A character is admitted if their corp is in `CORP_ID` **or** their alliance is in `ALLIANCE_ID`, so the two lists are additive — you can run alliance-only, corp-only, or a mix.

```dotenv
# Permit an entire alliance (no need to list its corps)
ALLIANCE_ID=99000001

# A coalition of alliances
ALLIANCE_ID=99000001,99000002
```

Alliance mode adds a **third map scope above corp**: `personal → corp → alliance`.

- **Alliance maps** are visible to every member of the owning alliance and are created / deleted / locked / renamed only by the `alliance_admin` role. Set `ALLIANCE_MAP_SHARED=true` to make every alliance map visible across all listed alliances (coalition mode); the default keeps each alliance's maps to its own members.
- **Corp maps inside an alliance** still work without a `CORP_ID` list — a corp map is derived from the creator's corp at login and stays visible to same-corp members only. This lets each corp keep private chains while the alliance shares its own maps above them.
- **`alliance_admin`** is a superset of `admin`: it administers users and maps across the entire alliance, whereas a corp `admin` stays scoped to its own corp. Only an alliance admin can grant the `alliance_admin` role or block another alliance admin. `ADMIN_CHAR_ID` is pinned to `alliance_admin` while `ALLIANCE_ID` is set.

### How corp & alliance map visibility works

By default (`CORP_MAP_SHARED=false`), **corp maps are scoped to the corp that created them**. If Corp A creates a corp map, only members of Corp A can see it — Corp B's members never know it exists, even though they share the deployment. This is the safer default for alliance-shared instances where each corp wants to keep its chain intel private.

Set `CORP_MAP_SHARED=true` to make every corp map visible to every listed corp. Only do this when all listed corps explicitly trust each other.

**Alliance maps** follow the same pattern one scope up: by default an alliance map is visible only to its owning alliance; `ALLIANCE_MAP_SHARED=true` shares every alliance map across all listed alliances (coalition mode).

Personal maps are **always private to their owning user**, regardless of corp, alliance, or the `*_MAP_SHARED` flags. Leaving a corp or alliance does not transfer ownership.

### Roles

Roles are stored per-user in the database. New users default to `readonly`; an admin must promote them.

Rules differ for personal (solo) maps, corp maps, and alliance maps. Personal maps are scoped to a single user; corp and alliance maps are shared infrastructure and gated more tightly.

**Personal maps** — every user can create their own personal maps (up to `MAX_USER_MAPS`) and edit everything inside them, regardless of role. A `readonly` user is "readonly" only with respect to other people's maps; their own personal map is theirs.

**Shared-in personal maps** — when another user has shared their personal map with you (or with your corp), you can edit signatures, structures, notes, and topology regardless of your global role — the grant is an explicit invitation by the owner. You cannot rename the map, delete it, generate a public share link, or change who else has access; those stay with the owner. Lock state still applies: if the owner is also an admin and locks the map, your topology edits are frozen the same as a locked corp map.

**Corp & alliance maps:**

| Role             | View | Edit signatures / structures / notes | Edit systems / connections / rename | Create / delete / lock **corp** map | Manage corp users | Create / delete / lock **alliance** map | Manage alliance users |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `readonly`       | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| `edit`           | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| `full`           | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| `admin`          | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (own corp) | ✗ | ✗ |
| `alliance_admin` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (whole alliance) |

Editing rights on an alliance map follow the same tiers as a corp map (a `readonly` alliance member can view but not edit; `edit`/`full`/`admin` can edit). Only `alliance_admin` can create, delete, lock, or rename an alliance map, or grant the `alliance_admin` role. `alliance_admin` is a strict superset of `admin` — the difference is reach (the whole alliance vs a single corp), not editing capability.

The character whose ID matches `ADMIN_CHAR_ID` is always given the top role on login (`alliance_admin` when `ALLIANCE_ID` is set, otherwise `admin`) and **cannot be demoted or blocked** by other admins. Leave it set even after you've promoted other admins — it's the recovery path against an admin demoting themselves or being blocked by mistake.

### Map locking

Admins can lock any corp map from the **Admin → Maps** page. A locked map keeps accepting **signatures, structures, and per-system notes** from any user with normal edit permission, but rejects topology mutations — system add/move/remove, connection add/edit/delete, and map rename are all frozen for non-admins. The toolbar shows an amber 🔒 Locked chip next to the map name while the lock is active.

A locked map also stops auto-growing from passive location tracking: even an admin walking through EVE won't sprout new systems on a locked chain (admins can still add manually via the canvas right-click). This is intentional — locking is what you do when you want the layout pinned, including against your own movements.

`force_lock_map` and `force_unlock_map` actions are written to the audit log.

### Merging maps

Merging folds a **source** map's contents into a **destination** map. The destination is treated as the source of truth — its systems are never overwritten; only missing systems and connections are added, with signatures, structures, and notes merged in (each toggleable in the merge dialog). Open it from the map sidebar's **Merge Maps** section.

**Who can merge what** — solo and corp maps are gated differently:

- **Solo maps** — you can always merge *from* or *into* a personal map you own, or one that's been shared with you. No special role needed; it's your map (or an explicit grant).
- **Corp maps** are opt-in and gated by role:

| Action | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Use a corp map as a merge **source** | The map has **Allow as merge source** enabled. Any corp member who can view it may then merge *from* it. |
| Use a corp map as a merge **destination** | The map has **Allow as merge destination** enabled **and** the user has `edit` / `full` / `admin` (the same write access as any other corp-map edit). Locked corp maps are excluded for non-admins, since a merge changes topology. |
| Toggle either flag | `full` or `admin` only. |

Both flags default to **off** — a corp map is neither a merge source nor destination until a `full`/`admin` member turns it on. The two toggles live in the same **Merge Maps** sidebar section and are independent: a map can be a source, a destination, both, or neither. The toggles only appear on corp maps; solo maps ignore them.

Every merge that involves a corp map on either side writes an audit entry (`corp_map_merge_source` / `corp_map_merge_destination`) recording who performed it and the source → destination map names. The merge runs in a single transaction, so a failure leaves the destination untouched (no audit entry either).

### What happens when a user leaves the corp

The corp membership check runs **at login**, and a periodic background sweep re-checks each live session's corp/alliance against ESI (cadence `ACCESS_REVALIDATE_MINUTES`, default 60 min). So a pilot who leaves an admitted corp is logged out within that window **without having to log out first** — and, of course, their next login attempt is also rejected. An ESI outage is fail-safe: the sweep falls back to the stored affiliation and never mass-evicts. Admins can also manually block a user (see below), which prevents login entirely regardless of corp membership.

#### …including `ADMIN_CHAR_ID`

The corp gate is fail-closed and **does not exempt `ADMIN_CHAR_ID`**. If your bootstrap admin character leaves every corp listed in `CORP_ID`, their next login is rejected just like anyone else's, and because they can no longer log in there's no in-app path to recover. This is intentional — a former member walking out of corp with admin keys is exactly who you *don't* want signing back in. To recover you have three options:

1. Move the character back into one of the listed corps in-game and log in again.
2. Edit `.env` to add their new corp to `CORP_ID` and restart the server.
3. Edit the `users` table directly (last resort).

If you want a permanent break-glass, run a second `ADMIN_CHAR_ID`-eligible character in a corp you control and don't plan to leave.

### Discord notifications

Corp and alliance maps can push chain intel into a Discord channel so alerts reach people who aren't watching Nexum. It fires **server-side**, so it doesn't depend on anyone having the map open.

**Set up in the app, not `.env`.** Webhooks are configured **per corp/alliance in the admin panel** (**Admin → Discord**) — paste a Discord webhook URL and it takes effect immediately, no restart. The URL is stored server-side, never sent to the browser, and masked in logs. There's a separate webhook per event type, so you can route each to its own channel (leave one blank to disable that type).

> Create the webhook in Discord (**Channel → Edit → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook**), copy the URL, and paste it into the matching field in **Admin → Discord**.

**What fires:**

- **New connection** — a connection is drawn between two systems. When it reveals a **k-space exit** at or above a configurable minimum security, it upgrades to a routing embed (exit system/region/security, ship-size limit, jumps from home, nearest hub).
- **Inbound K162** — a signature's wormhole type is set to K162 (something just connected into the chain).
- **Kills** — high-value kills in the map's systems, if the [live kill feed](#live-kill-feed-opt-in) is enabled. Each org sets its own minimum ISK.

**Scope and behaviour:**

- **Corp and alliance maps only.** Personal maps never notify — their scanning stays private.
- **Bulk operations are excluded.** Seeding a region or merging maps creates many connections at once and deliberately does *not* post to Discord; only interactive edits do.
- **Best-effort.** A webhook failure (Discord down, timeout, rate-limit) is logged and dropped — it never affects the edit that triggered it. Delivery is paced, honours Discord's rate limits, and only ever posts to Discord-owned webhook hosts.

**Filtering (admin).** The **Discord** tab lets an admin narrow what each org notifies without touching the webhook:

- **Regions** — notify for all regions (default), or only a chosen allowlist. The wormhole's system region is checked at send time; for a new connection, either endpoint's region qualifies.
- **Wormhole type / class / size** — restrict which holes trigger the chain notifications.
- **Excluded maps** — every map notifies by default; tick maps to exclude them.
- **K-space exit minimum security** and **kill minimum ISK** — thresholds for the exit-routing embed and the kill alerts.

These settings only ever *subtract* from the default, and new maps are always included automatically, so nothing silently goes dark.

> **Legacy `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`.** Superseded by the per-org settings above. If it's still set, on boot the server does a one-time seed of that URL into any org rows that don't yet have a connections webhook (fills blanks only, never overwrites) — so an old single-webhook deployment keeps working and migrates in place. Once you've confirmed your webhooks in **Admin → Discord**, remove `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` from `.env`.

### Admin operations

Admins reach the dashboard from the **Admin** button in the toolbar, which lands them at `#/admin/users`. The page has five tabs:

- **Users** — role select, block / unblock, recheck corp via ESI.
- **Maps** — every corp map across every listed corp. Force-lock, force-unlock, force-delete. Solo maps are deliberately excluded — they belong to individual users.
- **Reports** — placeholder for future ops reports.
- **Discord** — per-corp notification filters: a region allowlist and per-map exclusions (see [Discord notifications](#discord-notifications)).
- **Audit log** — last 200 admin actions, newest first.

Each tab is also reachable at its own hash route (`#/admin/maps`, `#/admin/audit`, …). All mutating actions write to the `admin_audit` table with the actor, target, old value, and new value.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/admin/users` | Full user list with role, corp ID (and resolved corp ticker from ESI), blocked status, last login, and activity counts. |
| `PATCH /api/admin/users/:id/role` | Change a user's role to one of `admin`, `full`, `edit`, `readonly`. Cannot demote yourself or the `ADMIN_CHAR_ID` character. |
| `POST /api/admin/users/:id/block` | Block a user from logging in. They keep their existing session until next login, then get bounced with `?error=blocked`. Cannot block yourself or `ADMIN_CHAR_ID`. |
| `POST /api/admin/users/:id/unblock` | Reverse a block. |
| `POST /api/admin/users/:id/recheck-corp` | Hits ESI for the target user's current corp without waiting for their next login. If they've left every corp in `CORP_ID`, they're auto-blocked. Useful when a known departure needs to take effect immediately. |
| `GET /api/admin/maps` | Every corp map with owner, corp ticker, system / connection counts, lock state, last active. |
| `POST /api/admin/maps/:id/lock` | Freeze a corp map's topology. Signatures/structures/notes remain editable; see [Map locking](#map-locking). |
| `POST /api/admin/maps/:id/unlock` | Reverse a lock. |
| `DELETE /api/admin/maps/:id` | Force-delete a corp map regardless of who owns it. |
| `GET /api/admin/audit` | The 200 most recent admin actions (role change, block, unblock, corp change, auto-block-on-departure, force-lock, force-unlock, force-delete). |

#### What admins **cannot** do

- Demote themselves (use another admin).
- Demote or block the character whose ID is in `ADMIN_CHAR_ID` — that character is the safety hatch.
- Force-terminate an existing live session. A blocked user stays signed in until they log out or their session cookie expires; the next login then fails. If you need someone offline *right now*, blocking + revoking their EVE OAuth in CCP's developer panel is the immediate path.

## Analytics & telemetry

**By default a self-hosted Nexum reports to no one.** No analytics, no tracking, no phone-home. Both of the following are off until *you* turn them on, and neither sends any user, character, or map data.

### Frontend analytics (Google Tag Manager) — off by default

The web build only loads Google Tag Manager if you provide a container ID at build time via `VITE_GTM_ID`. Leave it unset (the default) and the built site contains no analytics whatsoever — no GTM, no Google Analytics, nothing.

To enable it **for your own deployment**, set your own container ID in `.env` and rebuild the web image:

```bash
VITE_GTM_ID=GTM-XXXXXXX        # in .env
docker compose build web && docker compose up -d
```

Only ever use a container ID you own. The ID is inlined at build time, so a rebuild is required to change it.

### Deployment telemetry (version ping) — opt-in

So the project can gauge how many people self-host, which versions are live, and roughly how much they're used, the server can send a tiny **opt-in** ping. It is **off by default**, and when enabled it sends, once a day:

- the app **version** (e.g. `0.1.0`)
- a **random per-instance id** (generated once, stored locally), so repeat pings count as one install
- two **aggregate counts**: the number of **maps** and the number of **users** on the install

That's the entire payload. The counts are plain totals — it contains **no** character names, corp IDs, map contents, per-user detail, or settings, and the receiver **does not store your IP**. There are two ways to opt in:

```bash
# 1. the flag — sends to the project's default collector
NEXUM_TELEMETRY=1                                  # in .env

# 2. …or just set a collector URL. Populating this is itself treated as opt-in,
#    so you don't also need the flag. Point it at the project's or your own.
NEXUM_TELEMETRY_URL=https://eve-nexum.com/api/telemetry
```

Leave **both** unset (the default) and the server never makes the call. The receiving endpoint (`POST /api/telemetry`) exists on every deployment but stays empty unless instances are pointed at it.

---

## Static data files

Some pre-computed lookups live in `server/data/` as plain JSON, derived once from the EVE Static Data Export (SDE). They're committed to the repo so a fresh install works without an extra step. You only need to regenerate them when CCP releases an SDE drop that adds or changes the underlying data.

The SDE tables themselves (systems, stargates, dogma, …) are imported into Postgres separately and kept current automatically — see [Updating the SDE](#updating-the-sde) for how that works, how to force it, and the `GET /api/sde/version` endpoint for checking which build you're on.

> **A0 sun systems** (`typeID 3801`, "Sun A0 (Blue Small)") used to live here as `data/a0-systems.json`. They're now flagged on `solar_systems.is_a0` directly by the SDE importer (from `mapStars.jsonl`) and served via `GET /api/systems/a0`, so they refresh automatically on every SDE re-seed — no committed file, no manual regen. Note this is the in-game A0 classification (`typeID 3801`), not the SDE's `statistics.spectralClass` field; the two don't agree.

### `data/wormholes.json`

Per-wormhole-type metadata for every connection signature (T405, R943, K162, …) keyed by the in-game 3-letter code, served via `GET /api/wormholes/types` (the client uses it for the wormhole type picker, sig aging tints, and the WH-type info popover).

The numeric stats are **not** read from this file at runtime — the server derives them live from the imported SDE dogma each time it builds the spec list (and rebuilds after every re-seed), so CCP rebalances apply automatically. The deterministic fields and their dogma sources:

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| `dest` | dogma attribute `1381` (`wormholeTargetSystemClass`) |
| `total_mass` | dogma attribute `1382` (`massWormholeTotal`) |
| `max_mass_per_jump` | dogma attribute `1383` (`massWormholeMaxJumpable`) |
| `mass_regen` | dogma attribute `1384` (`massWormholeMassRegeneration`) |
| `lifetime` | dogma attribute `1503` (`wormholeMaxStableTime`, seconds — converted to hours) |

What this file **does** provide is the one thing CCP doesn't encode anywhere: the `src` array — "where can this wormhole appear" is community/observation knowledge, not data. (`static` and `sibling_groups` live here too but aren't currently served.) The schema follows the [exodus4d/Pathfinder](https://github.com/exodus4d/pathfinder) shape — that project is the original source of the file and is bundled at the repo root for licensing/attribution. A brand-new WH code auto-appears with derived stats and an empty `src`, logged as needing curation; fill it in here and rebuild.

**`extract-wormholes` (optional maintainer helper).** Regenerates this file from the imported SDE — preserving existing `src` / `static` / `sibling_groups` and scaffolding new codes with placeholders — so you have a starting point to curate. The server no longer depends on the stat fields it writes; it's purely for maintaining `src`. Run it after a fresh `yarn setup-db`:

```bash
cd server
PG_HOST=localhost yarn extract-wormholes
```

Or inside Docker via a one-off container (matching the SDE refresh recipe in the Troubleshooting section):

```bash
docker compose run --rm \
  -v "$PWD/server:/app" \
  -w /app \
  -e NODE_ENV=development \
  --entrypoint sh \
  server -c "yarn install --frozen-lockfile && yarn extract-wormholes"
```

The script prints three lists at the end:

- **New codes** since last run — these have `src: []` and `static: false` filled in as placeholders; review them against CCP's patch notes (or the WH's in-game description) and edit by hand.
- **Orphaned codes** — present in old JSON but absent from current SDE. Usually means CCP removed the type (very rare).
- **Unmapped destination classes** — printed only if CCP adds a new class enum we don't know about; if you see this, extend `CLASS_MAP` at the top of `scripts/extract-wormholes.ts`.

K162 is special-cased: it has no single destination class (it's the "return side" of every other connection), so it isn't in dogma; the server serves it from this file verbatim.

Rebuild and restart (`docker compose build server && docker compose up -d`) after editing the file so the new `src` is baked into the image.

The frontend is a fully static SPA after build. In production it is served by nginx, which also proxies all `/api/*` and `/auth/*` requests to the API server. The voice announcer's model and ONNX runtime are self-hosted same-origin (baked into the web image), so it needs no third-party CDN at runtime.

## Troubleshooting

The stack has three services — `web` (nginx), `server` (Node API), and `postgres`. Most issues are isolated to one of them; figure out which is failing first, then pull its logs.

### 1. Which service is failing?

```bash
docker compose ps
```

Look at the **STATUS** column:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Up` / `Up (healthy)` | running normally |
| `Restarting` | crashing on boot — see logs |
| `Exit 1` | failed to start — see logs |
| (missing) | never started — `docker compose up -d` |

You can also probe each layer directly:

```bash
# Web (nginx serving the SPA + proxying /api & /auth)
curl -I http://localhost           # expect HTTP/1.1 200

# Server (Express API)
curl http://localhost:3001/health  # expect {"ok":true}

# Database
docker compose exec postgres pg_isready -U "$PG_USER" -d "$PG_DB"
```

If `curl :3001/health` fails but `docker compose ps` shows the server `Up`, the container is running but the app crashed inside it — check its logs.

### 2. Viewing logs

```bash
# Live tail for one service (Ctrl-C to exit)
docker compose logs -f server
docker compose logs -f web
docker compose logs -f postgres

# Last 200 lines, then exit
docker compose logs --tail=200 server

# Everything in time order across all services (useful for race conditions)
docker compose logs -f --timestamps
```

Server logs are tagged by subsystem — grep for the prefix to narrow the noise:

```bash
docker compose logs server | grep -E '\[(auth|maps|admin|standings|ghost-sites|storms|activity|incursions)\]'
```

### 3. Common failure patterns

| Symptom | Likely cause | Where to look |
|---|---|---|
| `Migration failed:` in server logs, container restarts | DB unreachable or wrong creds | `docker compose logs postgres`; verify `PG_*` in `.env` |
| Login redirect loop / `Authentication failed` | `EVE_CALLBACK_URL` in `.env` doesn't match the URL registered on the EVE Developer app | server logs (`[auth]` lines) |
| Login works but cookies don't persist | `FRONTEND_URL` mismatch, or reverse-proxy stripping `Cookie` header | browser DevTools → Application → Cookies; server logs |
| Blank page on the SPA | nginx serving 404 for `/index.html`, build artifacts missing | `docker compose logs web`; rebuild with `docker compose build web` |
| `502 Bad Gateway` from nginx | `server` container is down | check `docker compose ps`; then server logs |
| Admin page / Reports tab not visible | role isn't `admin` (or `canViewReports`), `CORP_ID` is unset for admin routes | DevTools → Network → `/auth/me` response shows `role` and `canViewReports` |
| ESI features stale (kills, structures, sov) | ESI rate-limited or down | server logs; `https://esi.evetech.net/ui/` for service status |
| Storm / ghost-site lookups not appearing | scraper fetch failed (502 fallback used) | server logs (`[storms]` / `[ghost-sites]`) |

### 4. Local-dev variant

In local-dev mode (`npm run dev` in `server/` and `web/` separately) there are no containers — logs stream straight to the terminal you started them from. Browser-side errors appear in DevTools Console; network failures show in DevTools Network. The Vite dev server proxies `/api` and `/auth` to the local API, so a 502 in the browser network tab means the API process exited.

### 5. Health-check shortcuts

```bash
# Count the rows the server should have populated at boot
docker compose exec postgres psql -U "$PG_USER" -d "$PG_DB" \
  -c "SELECT 'solar_systems' AS t, COUNT(*) FROM solar_systems
      UNION ALL SELECT 'map_regions',  COUNT(*) FROM map_regions
      UNION ALL SELECT 'item_types',   COUNT(*) FROM item_types;"

# Decode a session cookie's user id (paste cookie value as $SID)
docker compose exec postgres psql -U "$PG_USER" -d "$PG_DB" \
  -c "SELECT sess->>'userId' AS user_id, expire FROM sessions WHERE sid = '$SID';"
```

If `solar_systems` is empty the SDE import never ran — check the importer's logs (`docker compose logs importer`) and re-run it with `docker compose run --rm -e FORCE_SDE_IMPORT=1 importer`.
