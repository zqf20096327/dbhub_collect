> **engram** `/ˈen.ɡræm/` — _neuroscience_: the physical trace of a memory in the brain.

Your AI coding agent forgets everything when the session ends. Engram gives it a brain.

A **Go binary** with SQLite + FTS5 full-text search, exposed through CLI, HTTP API, MCP, and an interactive TUI. It works with any MCP-compatible agent, including Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Codex, VS Code (Copilot), Antigravity, Cursor, and Windsurf.

No Node.js, Python, or Docker is required: one binary, one SQLite file.

```
Agent (Claude Code / OpenCode / Gemini CLI / Codex / VS Code / Antigravity / ...)
    ↓ MCP stdio
Engram (single Go binary)
    ↓
SQLite + FTS5 (~/.engram/engram.db)
```

## For agents

Treat Engram as a curated project memory, not a transcript sink. Use this operating contract throughout the session.

1. **Orient before writing.** Start with `mem_current_project` to confirm the resolved project and its source. At the start of related work, use `mem_context` and `mem_search` to recover the relevant history.
2. **Search before repeating.** Before revisiting a decision, bug, convention, or request that may already be known, search with focused terms. Search results are previews, not the complete record.
3. **Retrieve progressively.** Use `mem_search` for candidates, `mem_timeline` when surrounding session context matters, and `mem_get_observation` before relying on a full observation.
4. **Save significant knowledge deliberately.** Save completed bug fixes, decisions, discoveries, configuration changes, patterns, and durable user constraints with `mem_save`. Do not capture raw tool output or every conversational turn.
5. **Keep evolving knowledge stable.** Give an evolving topic a stable `topic_key` such as `architecture/auth-model`; reuse it to update that topic rather than creating competing memories. Use `mem_suggest_topic_key` when the key is unclear.
6. **Leave a handoff.** Before ending a session, save a `mem_session_summary` with the goal, instructions, discoveries, accomplished work, next steps, and relevant files.
7. **Recover after compaction.** Persist the compacted handoff with `mem_session_summary` first. Then call `mem_context` to recover recent session history before continuing.

### A useful memory is structured

```markdown
**What**: Added retry-safe upload handling.
**Why**: Retries could create duplicate records.
**Where**: internal/upload/handler.go
**Learned**: Reuse the request id as the idempotency key.
```

Use a short, searchable title and a fitting type with that content. The full [Memory Protocol](DOCS.md#memory-protocol) defines the durable-save rules and session-summary shape.

### Choose MCP tools by intent

Tool availability can vary by MCP profile. Start with the intent, then use your client's tool discovery mechanism (such as `ToolSearch`) only when a deferred tool is needed.

| Intent | Start with |
| --- | --- |
| Confirm the project and recover recent work | `mem_current_project`, `mem_context` |
| Find prior knowledge without repeating work | `mem_search` |
| Inspect a result in enough detail | `mem_timeline`, `mem_get_observation` |
| Save or refine durable knowledge | `mem_save`, `mem_update`, `mem_suggest_topic_key` |
| Preserve the user's request | `mem_save_prompt` |
| Hand off or close a session | `mem_session_summary`, `mem_session_start`, `mem_session_end` |
| Review stale knowledge or memory relationships | `mem_review`, `mem_judge`, `mem_compare` |
| Diagnose project or store state | `mem_doctor` |

For parameters and the complete, current tool reference, see [the full documentation](DOCS.md).

## Quick start

### Install

For production use and security support, install the latest stable release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/engram/releases). Release candidates are prerelease validation and feedback builds; choose one only when you accept prerelease risk. See the [Release Policy](docs/RELEASE-POLICY.md) before upgrading.

Homebrew remains on the stable v1.20.0 line:

```bash
brew install gentleman-programming/tap/engram
```

For Windows, Linux, source builds, and all installation methods, see [Installation](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

### Set up your agent

Run the setup command for the agent you use, then restart that agent. `engram setup` writes the applicable MCP and integration configuration; it does not require you to start a server for the usual stdio-only setup.

| Agent | Setup |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `claude plugin marketplace add Gentleman-Programming/engram && claude plugin install engram` |
| Pi | `engram setup pi` |
| OpenCode | `engram setup opencode` |
| Gemini CLI | `engram setup gemini-cli` |
| Codex | `engram setup codex` |
| Antigravity CLI | `engram setup antigravity-cli` |
| Windsurf | `engram setup windsurf` |
| Qwen Code | `engram setup qwen` |
| Kiro | `engram setup kiro` |
| Cursor | `engram setup cursor` |
| VS Code (Copilot) | `engram setup vscode-copilot` |
| Kilo Code | `engram setup kilocode` |
| Kimi Code | `engram setup kimi` |
| CommandCode | `engram setup commandcode` |
| Another MCP-compatible agent | [Manual MCP setup](docs/AGENT-SETUP.md#any-other-mcp-agent) |

See [Agent Setup](docs/AGENT-SETUP.md) for per-agent configuration, plugin behavior, manual MCP setup, compaction resilience, and troubleshooting. Pi users can also find the package at [`gentle-engram`](plugin/pi/README.md).

## Local first, portable when needed

Engram keeps memory local by default. The local SQLite database is authoritative; Git Sync exports portable compressed chunks for sharing across machines, and Engram Cloud is optional, project-scoped replication/shared access with browser visibility.

| Need | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| Local memory and the runtime model | [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| Share memory with Git | [Git Sync reference](DOCS.md#git-sync-chunked) |
| Use optional Cloud replication | [Engram Cloud](docs/engram-cloud/README.md) |
| Diagnose or recover Cloud operations | [Cloud troubleshooting](docs/engram-cloud/troubleshooting.md) |

For an existing local database, use the guided upgrade sequence. If the dry run reports changes, apply them before bootstrap; otherwise continue directly to bootstrap.

```bash
engram cloud upgrade doctor --project <project>
engram cloud upgrade repair --project <project> --dry-run
engram cloud upgrade repair --project <project> --apply # only when the dry run reports changes
engram cloud upgrade bootstrap --project <project>
engram cloud upgrade status --project <project>
```

See the [Cloud upgrade reference](DOCS.md#cloud-upgrade-flow) for apply, rollback, and recovery details.

### Project-aware reads

Project-aware reads use the canonical current project when no selector is supplied: an explicit project, then `ENGRAM_PROJECT`, then cwd detection. Use `--all` in the CLI or `all_projects=true` in HTTP for an intentional global read; do not combine either with an explicit project. `engram context` retains its positional project as an alias for `--project`. `GET /sync/status` supports one resolved project and rejects `all_projects=true` because its provider cannot aggregate status.

## Terminal UI

```bash
engram tui
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/tui-dashboard.png" alt="TUI Dashboard" width="400" />
  <img width="400" alt="TUI recent observations" src="assets/tui-recent.png" />
  <img src="assets/tui-detail.png" alt="TUI Observation Detail" width="400" />
  <img src="assets/tui-search.png" alt="TUI Search Results" width="400" />
</p>

Navigate with `j`/`k`, use `Enter` to drill in, `c` to copy content to the clipboard, `/` to search, and `Esc` to go back. The TUI uses the Catppuccin Mocha theme.
