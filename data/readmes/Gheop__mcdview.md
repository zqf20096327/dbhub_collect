Turn a SQL data model into one self-contained HTML page you can open, share
and explore: an overview of every table, click one to isolate it with its
relations, field-level detail, search. No server, no build step, no
dependencies — the page opens straight from `file://`.

*Overview → rearrange → click a table to isolate it with its related tables →
search. [Open the live, interactive version.](https://gheop.github.io/mcdview/exemples/chinook.html)*

### The same tool renders a model right here

`mcdview model.sql --to-mermaid` emits a Mermaid `erDiagram` that GitHub and
GitLab draw natively — no image, no hosting:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    categorie {
        serial id PK
        text nom
        text slug
    }
    produit {
        serial id PK
        text nom
        bigint prix
        integer categorie_id FK
        text sku
    }
    client {
        serial id PK
        text nom
        text email
        text telephone
    }
    commande {
        serial id PK
        integer client_id FK
        date passee_le
        bigint total
        text statut
    }
    ligne {
        serial id PK
        integer commande_id FK
        integer produit_id FK
        integer quantite
        numeric remise
    }
    avis {
        serial id PK
        integer produit_id FK
        integer client_id FK
        integer note
        text commentaire
    }
    categorie ||--o{ produit : ""
    client ||--o{ commande : ""
    commande ||--o{ ligne : ""
    produit ||--o{ ligne : ""
    produit ||--o{ avis : ""
    client ||--o{ avis : ""
```

## What you get

- **Explore any model.** Overview grouped by schema, click a table to isolate
  it with its neighbours, field detail (types, NOT NULL, DEFAULT, PK 🔑,
  clickable FK 🔗, indexes, comments), search by table *or column*, drag to
  rearrange (links follow live, positions remembered), force-directed relayout,
  a minimap and level-of-detail for big models, light/dark toggle, SVG export,
  `#schema.table` permalinks, keyboard shortcuts (`/` search, `r` rearrange,
  Esc overview). One HTML file, works offline.
- **Eight input formats.** PostgreSQL and ~15 dialects (MySQL/MariaDB, SQLite,
  SQL Server, Oracle…) via [sqlglot](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot);
  pgModeler `.dbm`, dbdiagram.io `.dbml`, Prisma, MySQL Workbench `.mwb`,
  Rails `db/schema.rb`, Mermaid `erDiagram`, Drizzle `schema.ts`.
- **Diff two versions.** `--diff old` colors what was added, removed and
  changed (tables, columns, foreign keys, indexes), detects renames, and can
  write a JSON summary (see below).
- **Mermaid export.** `--to-mermaid` for a diagram that renders in any
  Markdown file.
- **Live database.** `--db postgresql://…` / `mysql://…` reads a running
  schema (CLI only).
- **Zero dependency by default.** Python stdlib in, vanilla JS out. Hostile
  input is HTML-escaped and DoS-budgeted; the upload surface is hardened
  (XML/zip caps, converter timeouts).
- **Tested at scale.** 13,408 real-world schemas, synthetic models to 5000
  tables, zero crashes.

### Compare two versions

`mcdview new.sql --diff old.sql` — added tables/columns/FKs in green, removed
in red (kept, struck through), changed in amber, with a legend and a "show
only what moved" filter:

[![mcdview diff: added, removed and changed tables highlighted](docs/diff.webp)](https://gheop.github.io/mcdview/exemples/boutique-diff.html)

## Install

```bash
pipx install mcdview                 # the CLI, isolated
pipx install "mcdview[dialects]"     # + sqlglot for MySQL/SQLite/… input
```

Or run the script straight from a checkout — it has no dependency of its own:
`./mcdview.py model.sql`. The `.dbm`/`.dbml`/`.prisma` inputs still need their
external converter in the PATH (see [Dialects](#dialects)).

## Usage

```bash
mcdview model.sql                    # (or ./mcdview.py from a checkout)
./mcdview.py model.sql
./mcdview.py model.sql -o explorer.html --titre "My project"
./mcdview.py model.dbm          # pgModeler model (needs pgmodeler-cli)
./mcdview.py model.dbml         # dbdiagram.io model (needs @dbml/cli)
./mcdview.py schema.prisma      # Prisma schema (needs prisma)
./mcdview.py model.mwb          # MySQL Workbench model (native, no tool)
./mcdview.py db/schema.rb       # Rails schema (native, no tool)
./mcdview.py diagram.mmd        # Mermaid erDiagram (native, .mmd/.md)
./mcdview.py schema.ts          # Drizzle ORM schema (native, no tool)
./mcdview.py --db postgresql://user:pw@host/db   # dump a live database (CLI only)
./mcdview.py new.sql --diff old.sql              # compare two versions of a model
```

Then open the generated HTML file in a browser.

`--diff BASELINE` compares the main model against an older one (each may be
any supported format) and colors the result: tables, columns and foreign keys
that were **added** show green, **removed** ones red and struck through
(kept on the diagram so you can see what went), **changed** ones amber. A
legend appears at the bottom with per-category counts and a "N touched"
button that hides the unchanged tables to frame just what moved. Handy for
reviewing a migration before running it.

`--db` reads the schema straight from a running database instead of a file:
`postgresql://…` shells out to `pg_dump -s`, `mysql://…` to `mysqldump
--no-data`. It is a **command-line-only** feature — never wire it behind a
public service, since it would let a caller point the process at any host it
can reach (SSRF).

A `.dbm` input needs `pgmodeler-cli` in the PATH: mcdview delegates the
SQL generation to it (pgModeler resolves its relationships at export time),
and reuses the table positions drawn in the model.

In the page:

- **wheel**: zoom, **drag**: pan;
- **hover a table**: lights up its foreign-key links;
- **click a table**: isolates it with its related tables (the others fade
  out, the view re-frames) and shows its detail on the right — fields,
  types, NOT NULL, DEFAULT, PK 🔑, clickable FK 🔗, table and column
  comments, list of referencing tables; the URL gets a `#schema.table`
  permalink that reopens straight on that table;
- **drag a table** to rearrange the diagram, the links follow live;
- **"rearrange" button**: a force-directed relayout that spreads the tables
  to unclutter the links (disabled above 400 tables, where it would be slow);
- **schema chips** (bottom-left, when there are several schemas): click to
  frame that schema's zone;
- **Escape** or "overview": back to the full, re-framed overview;
- **search** with table name autocompletion.

## Options

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-o, --sortie FILE` | Output HTML file (default: `<sql>.html`) |
| `--titre TEXT` | Title shown in the page (default: file name) |
| `--dbm FILE` | Reuse table positions from a pgModeler model instead of automatic layout |
| `--fk-audit REGEX` | Tag as "audit" the FKs whose constraint name matches: hidden by default, shown back with a checkbox |
| `--lang {fr,en}` | Language of the page UI (default: `fr`) |
| `--dialect NAME` | Input SQL dialect (default: `auto`); non-PostgreSQL needs `sqlglot` |
| `--home-url URL` | Wrap the header logo in a link to this URL |
| `--logo FILE` | Replace the header logo with this image (svg/png/jpg…, shown 22×22) |
| `--credit TEXT` | Attribution badge text, bottom-right; defaults to `mcdview` (linking mcdview.dev) unless `--no-credit` |
| `--credit-url URL` | Make the `--credit` badge a link to this URL |
| `--no-credit` | Do not place the attribution badge |
| `--db URL` | Read a live database's schema instead of a file (`postgresql://…` via `pg_dump`, `mysql://…` via `mysqldump`); CLI only |
| `--diff BASELINE` | Compare against an older model (any supported format); added/removed/changed tables, columns and FKs are colored |
| `--summary FILE` | With `--diff`: also write a JSON summary of the changes (counts + change list) to `FILE` |
| `--to-mermaid` | Output a Mermaid `erDiagram` (paste in a `.md`; GitHub/GitLab render it) instead of the HTML page |
| `--to-dico` | Output a Markdown data dictionary (one section per table: column / type / key) instead of the HTML page |
| `--to-preview` | Output a static SVG snapshot of the diagram (a social / OpenGraph card) instead of the HTML page |
| `--watch` | Regenerate the page whenever the input file changes (Ctrl-C to stop); file input only |
| `--diagnose` | Print a JSON diagnosis of the input (status ok/no_table/anomaly/error, dialect, counts, anomalies) instead of a page; exits 0 even on failure |
| `--lint` | Check the schema against rules (missing PK, unindexed FK, naming…) and print JSON violations instead of a page — a finer CI gate than `--diagnose` |
| `--fail-on {error,warning,info}` | With `--lint`, exit non-zero when a violation of at least this severity is found |

Without `--dbm`, mcdview computes an automatic layout: one zone per schema,
tables arranged in balanced columns, related tables pulled together.

## Dialects

PostgreSQL uses the built-in parser (no dependency). For any other dialect,
`pip install sqlglot` and mcdview reads it — MySQL/MariaDB, SQLite, SQL Server
(`tsql`), Oracle, DuckDB, Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, ClickHouse, Trino,
Spark, Hive. `--dialect auto` (the default) uses the PostgreSQL parser first
and, when it finds no table, tries several sqlglot dialects and keeps the one
that parses the most tables; pass `--dialect mysql` (etc.) to force one. Model files are read through an upstream converter (an optional dependency,
like the SQL dialects): pgModeler `.dbm` via `pgmodeler-cli`,
dbdiagram.io `.dbml` via `@dbml/cli`, and Prisma `schema.prisma` via the
`prisma` CLI. MySQL Workbench `.mwb`, Rails `db/schema.rb`, Mermaid `erDiagram`
(`.mmd`/`.mermaid`/`.md`) and Drizzle ORM `schema.ts` are read **natively**
(no external tool needed). Other proprietary formats (Navicat,
ERwin, Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler…) have no reliable converter: export
their SQL instead (Workbench-style Forward Engineer), which mcdview reads.

`--fk-audit` is for models where every table carries audit columns
(`created_by`, `modified_by`...) pointing to a users table: those FKs turn
that table into a hub linked to everything and clutter the graph.

## What mcdview reads from the DDL

- `CREATE TABLE [schema.]table (...)`: columns, types, NOT NULL, DEFAULT
  (tables without an explicit schema go to `public`);
- primary keys, inline (`CONSTRAINT ... PRIMARY KEY`) or added afterwards
  (`ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ... PRIMARY KEY`, `pg_dump -s` style);
- `ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ... FOREIGN KEY ... REFERENCES ...`,
  including composite keys and targets without an explicit column list
  (resolved against the target's primary key);
- partitions (`PARTITION OF`, `ATTACH PARTITION`): hidden from the diagram,
  their constraints are carried back to the parent table;
- `COMMENT ON TABLE` and `COMMENT ON COLUMN`.

A `pg_dump -s` dump works as is. Views, functions and data are ignored.

## Use it in CI

mcdview prints machine-readable output and sets an exit code, so it fits a
pipeline with no browser:

- **Gate a schema.** `mcdview schema.sql --lint --fail-on warning` checks the
  model against rules (missing primary key, unindexed foreign key, naming) and
  exits non-zero on a violation of that severity or worse. Use `--diagnose` for
  a JSON status that never fails when you only want a report.
- **Publish artifacts.** `--to-mermaid` writes a Mermaid `erDiagram` for a
  Markdown page, `--to-dico` a Markdown data dictionary, `--to-preview` a static
  SVG card. Commit them or attach them to a release.

To publish to the hosted instance ([mcdview.dev](https://mcdview.dev/)) from
CI — push a schema, get a shareable link back — two integrations are maintained
in their own repositories:

- GitHub Action — [`Gheop/mcdview-action`](https://github.com/Gheop/mcdview-action):
  `uses: Gheop/mcdview-action@v1`
- GitLab CI/CD component — [`gitlab.com/Gheop/mcdview`](https://gitlab.com/Gheop/mcdview):
  `include: component: gitlab.com/Gheop/mcdview/mcdview@~latest`

## Examples

Each example ships as a `.sql` in `exemples/`; the browsable pages are
rebuilt by CI on every push:

| Model | | Contents | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Médiathèque** — fictional French library, shows schemas zones, comments and audit FKs | [open](https://gheop.github.io/mcdview/exemples/mediatheque.html) | 12 tables, 3 schemas, 21 FKs | [mediatheque.sql](exemples/mediatheque.sql) |
| **Pagila** — DVD rental store (the PostgreSQL classic), with a partitioned `payment` table | [open](https://gheop.github.io/mcdview/exemples/pagila.html) | 16 tables, 22 FKs | [Pagila](https://github.com/devrimgunduz/pagila) (BSD) |
| **Northwind** — trading company, the historic Microsoft sample | [open](https://gheop.github.io/mcdview/exemples/northwind.html) | 14 tables, 13 FKs | [northwind_psql](https://github.com/pthom/northwind_psql) |
| **Chinook** — digital music store | [open](https://gheop.github.io/mcdview/exemples/chinook.html) | 11 tables, 11 FKs | [chinook-database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database) (MIT) |

The real-world schemas are trimmed to their DDL (no data); each file keeps
its source and license in a header comment. To regenerate, e.g.:

```bash
./mcdview.py exemples/mediatheque.sql --titre "Médiathèque (démo)" --fk-audit '_idmodificateur_fk$' --lang en
./mcdview.py exemples/pagila.sql --titre "Pagila (DVD rental)" --lang en
```

## Development

Plain Python 3, no dependency. All the rendering lives in
`templates/explorateur.html` (inline CSS/JS); the data is injected as JSON
in place of `__DONNEES__`.

### Tested at scale

The harness under `tests/` last ran mcdview over **13,408 model files**:
9,913 `.sql` plus native `.ts` (Drizzle), Mermaid, Rails `schema.rb` and
MySQL Workbench `.mwb`, harvested from public GitHub repositories, plus
synthetic models up to 5000 tables. Results: **zero crashes and zero
timeouts** (2 s per-file budget). Every loadable schema produced a valid
page (DOM-verified on a sample in headless Chrome); MySQL and SQLite `.sql`
inputs are detected and get a clear hint. Median page build: 3 ms; worst
case (a 5.7 MB model): 1.3 s. Separately, pgModeler `.dbm` models convert
through pgModeler's CLI in a frozen-image CI job (a `--fix-model` repair
pass catches models saved by older versions).

Model data (names, types, comments, defaults) is HTML-escaped and the JSON
data island escapes every `<`, so a hostile schema cannot inject markup or
script into the page — this matters when generating pages from files you did
not write. `tests/test_securite.py` checks the escaping and a ReDoS/DoS time
budget on hostile inputs (`tests/malveillant/`).

`tests/tester.py` runs mcdview end-to-end on every committed example and
every pgModeler sample model, checks pinned table/FK counts and times each
run; `tests/grand_banc.py` runs the whole local corpus (`--strict` fails on
any exception, `--dbm` adds the pgModeler models, `--chrome N` DOM-validates
N sampled pages); `tests/rapatrier.sh`, `tests/moissonner.py` and
`tests/generer_synthetique.py` fill the local, uncommitted corpus.
`tests/test_dialectes.py` parses committed non-PostgreSQL fixtures, including
`tests/dialectes/boutique.mariadb.sql` — a frozen `mysqldump --no-data` dump
(backtick quoting, named inline `CONSTRAINT` FKs, a composite primary key)
that pins the exact SQL a `--db mysql://…` run feeds the parser, so the
`--db` path stays covered without a live server. The pre-commit hook
(`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`) runs the pinned regression, the
security suite and the strict corpus campaign.

## Changelog

### v0.34.2 — Right SQL dialect on large MySQL and Prisma models (2026-09-23)

- `--dialect auto` now chooses the dialect on the whole file. On files over
  25 KB it used to decide on the first 25 KB, cut mid-statement, and could pick
  the wrong one: tables went missing (some MySQL dumps showed none at all) and
  column types were rewritten (`VARCHAR(191)` shown as `text(191)`, `BOOLEAN`
  as `integer`). Across the test corpus, 36 files regain 2,406 tables and none
  loses any.
- A MySQL dump with a stray `[word] word` inside a comment is no longer taken
  for SQL Server.
- A Prisma schema with a `mysql` or `sqlite` provider is parsed straight in that
  dialect instead of trying up to seven in turn: about 100 ms less per run.
- Parsing non-PostgreSQL SQL is about twice as fast overall (median 92 ms to
  21 ms per file on the corpus). If you already converted a Prisma schema to SQL
  yourself, pass `--dialect mysql` (or `sqlite`) to skip the dialect trial.
- Some MySQL and SQLite models now render differently: more tables, and column
  types as written in the DDL.

### v0.34.1 — Smoother pan, hover and drag on large models (2026-09-23)

- Panning and zooming no longer re-read every table to repaint the minimap: a
  pan move on a 5000-table model drops from ~23-42 ms to ~0.1 ms.
- Hovering a table only restyles its own links instead of redrawing them all
  (55 ms to under 1 ms on 5000 tables).
- Dragging a table only reroutes that table's links on each frame (53 ms to
  ~6 ms per frame on 5000 tables).
- A full link redraw is ~8-12% faster. Across the 186 models of 100+ tables in
  the test corpus, no interaction got slower, and every generated page renders
  exactly as before.

### v0.34.0 — Clickable foreign-key links (2026-09-10)

- Click a foreign-key link to see its detail in the right panel, the way a table
  does: the two endpoints (child column → parent column), the deduced
  cardinality in crow's-foot notation (one-to-one when the FK column is unique,
  one-to-many otherwise), and the carrier column. The clicked link is
  highlighted.
- Referential actions (`ON DELETE` / `ON UPDATE`) are now parsed and shown when
  the model declares them, from PostgreSQL, the sqlglot dialects, MySQL
  Workbench `.mwb`, and Rails `add_foreign_key`.

### v0.33.3 — Favicon and input robustness (2026-09-05)

- Generated pages now carry an inline favicon (a still SVG data URI), so the
  tab shows the mcdview mark — or your `--logo` on a white-label page — with no
  network request and no `/favicon.ico` 404, even opened offline.
- A non-UTF-8 model file (a legitimate latin-1 SQL dump) is now read instead of
  crashing the reader; every reader tolerates invalid bytes.
- A malformed `.dbm` (valid XML but unexpected structure) no longer crashes page
  generation while reading table positions; such a table falls back to the
  automatic layout.

### v0.33.2 — Logo glass glint (2026-09-04)

- The logo's magnifier glass now catches a light glint that sweeps across it,
  matching the mark used on the website. Still declarative SVG (CSS animation,
  clipped to the glass) and dropped under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### v0.33.1 — New animated logo (2026-09-04)

- The header logo (and the attribution stamp) is the new official mark — a
  magnifier inspecting two linked tables — with a packet that circulates along
  the foreign key, and a slight "focus" zoom of the tables (clipped to the
  glass) when you hover it. It is declarative SVG only (SMIL + CSS, no script),
  self-contained, and honors `prefers-reduced-motion`: the motion is dropped for
  viewers who ask their OS for reduced motion.

### v0.33.0 — Crow's-foot cardinalities (2026-09-04)

- A new **cardinalities** toolbar button draws crow's-foot markers on the
  foreign-key links, deduced from the schema with no extra input: the child
  (FK-holding) end is *many*, the referenced end is *one* — mandatory when the
  FK is NOT NULL, optional (a ring, `0..1`) when it is nullable. Join tables
  read as N-N through their two links. Off by default; hovering or isolating a
  table turns its markers blue and shows a short label (`*`, `1`, `0..1`) at each
  end. The link now leaves the tip of the marker. The SVG export includes the
  markers when they are on. Added a regression test (`tests/test_cardinalites.py`).

### v0.32.1 — Search lists matching tables before columns (2026-09-02)

- Typing a table name that several tables share (e.g. `etabli` →
  `etablissement`, `etablissementindividu`, `etablissementtelephone`) now lists
  all the matching tables. The search datalist put each table's columns right
  after it, so one table's columns crowded its siblings out of the browser's
  suggestion popup. All table names are now inserted before any column name.

### v0.32.0 — Attribution stamp on by default (2026-09-02)

- The bottom-right `mcdview` stamp (linking mcdview.dev) is now on by default on
  every page, not only branded ones. `--no-credit` removes it; `--credit TEXT`
  sets a custom label. `composer_page` gains a `tampon` parameter (default on) so
  a caller that already shows mcdview's branding can drop the stamp. The
  published example pages set `--no-credit` (they are the official showcase).

### v0.31.0 — Export the page with your layout baked in (2026-09-02)

- New **HTML (with layout)** export in the export menu: download a
  self-contained copy of the page with the tables where you arranged them. It
  writes your positions into the data island of a clean copy, so the file is the
  same size as a freshly generated one — not a dump of the rendered page. The
  layout now travels with the file, not just in your browser's localStorage.
  Added a regression test (`tests/test_export_html.py`).

### v0.30.1 — Convert more real-world Prisma schemas (2026-09-02)

- Prisma schemas that `prisma migrate diff` refused now convert. The schema is
  preprocessed first, without changing the tables, columns or foreign keys read
  from it: `@id` is dropped from `view` blocks (Prisma forbids a primary key on
  a view), a missing datasource `url` is filled in (the diff never connects),
  and wrong-provider native types (`@db.Int` in a postgresql schema) are
  stripped. Added an edge-case fixture and a preprocessing test.

### v0.30.0 — Undo a layout change (2026-09-02)

- Rearranging or dragging tables can be undone. Press Ctrl+Z, or the new **undo**
  button (shown only when there is something to undo), to put the previous
  overview layout back — the boxes glide to their old spots. The button walks a
  small stack, so several changes undo in turn. This is runtime state only
  (positions), nothing added to the HTML file. Added a regression test
  (`tests/test_undo.py`).

### v0.29.2 — Parse pre-2012 Rails schema.rb options (2026-09-01)

- A Rails `db/schema.rb` written with the old hashrocket option syntax
  (`create_table "x", :id => false`) no longer gets a phantom `id` primary key
  on its `id: false` tables. The native parser only recognised the modern hash
  form (`id: false`); it now reads both, so schemas from before ~2012 (and their
  join tables) come out right. Added a legacy fixture and test.

### v0.29.1 — Remember the collapsed detail panel (2026-09-01)

- Folding the detail panel is now remembered across loads (localStorage, like
  the theme). A page reopened with the panel folded starts folded and skips the
  open-then-close intro, instead of replaying it every time — the annoyance when
  the same page is reloaded in an iframe or a time-lapse viewer. A first,
  never-seen visit still plays the intro. Added a regression test
  (`tests/test_panneau.py`).

### v0.29.0 — Edge-anchored links, self-reference loops (2026-09-01)

- Links attach to the box side facing the other table (left/right when side by
  side, top/bottom when stacked) instead of running box-centre to box-centre. No
  more edges starting inside a table or cutting straight through it; the layout
  reads like a proper ERD.
- A self-referencing foreign key (e.g. `reports_to`) now draws a small loop on
  the table's corner, so the hierarchy is visible — the old routing collapsed it
  to an invisible point.
- The hovered or isolated table's links are painted above the tables, so a
  highlighted relationship is never hidden behind a box. The SVG export uses the
  same anchoring. Added a headless-Chrome regression test (`tests/test_liens.py`).

### v0.28.2 — Fix the theme toggle and a stuck audit-FK checkbox (2026-09-01)

- The theme button no longer needs two clicks to reach dark from a light OS. It
  cycled system → light → dark, but "system" and "light" look identical on a
  light OS, so the first click seemed to do nothing. A click now always changes
  the visible theme, skipping any step that would look the same.
- The "audit FKs" checkbox is hidden again when a model has no audit FKs. A
  `#hud label { display: flex }` rule overrode the `hidden` attribute, so the
  checkbox showed even with nothing to toggle.

### v0.28.1 — Fix links pointing into space when saved positions load (2026-08-31)

- A viewer who had dragged tables saw the FK links briefly point into empty
  space on the next open. Restoring the saved layout re-applied each box's
  position after the page had settled, so the boxes animated from their
  auto-placement spot to their saved spot and the first links were drawn against
  them mid-slide. The restore now jumps the boxes into place with no animation,
  so the links are correct from the first paint. Added a headless-Chrome
  regression test (`tests/test_positions.py`).

### v0.28.0 — Auto attribution badge on branded pages (2026-08-31)

- A branded page (`--logo` or `--home-url`) now carries a discreet clickable
  `mcdview` badge by default, linking to https://mcdview.dev. Branding drops the
  header link back to mcdview, so the badge keeps the attribution. An explicit
  `--credit` still sets its own text and url; a plain, unbranded page stays bare.
- New `--no-credit` opts out of the badge, even on a branded page.

### v0.27.1 — Fix SVG export from a zoomed-out diagram (2026-08-31)

- SVG export now always draws full table boxes. Exporting while the diagram was
  zoomed out (header-only, level-of-detail view) sized each box to its header
  alone, so the columns spilled out with no background or border and the FK
  links anchored to the header center. The export reflows to full detail before
  measuring, so its output no longer depends on the current zoom level.

### v0.27.0 — `--to-dico` data dictionary on the CLI (2026-08-30)

- `--to-dico` outputs a Markdown data dictionary (one `## schema.table` section
  with a `column / type / key` table) instead of the HTML page — to `-o` if
  given, else stdout. Same content as the in-page **export → Markdown**, now
  scriptable for a docs/CI pipeline like `--to-mermaid` and `--to-preview`.

### v0.26.2 — Auto-dismiss the hint banner (2026-08-30)

- The transient hint banner (e.g. "No probable missing FK", "No match", a
  cycle/type/ref count) now clears itself after ~2.6 s, so it no longer sits
  over the menus that open below it. The join-path prompts stay put until you
  pick the two tables.

### v0.26.1 — Parse inline-opening multi-line CREATE TABLE (2026-08-30)

- The built-in PostgreSQL parser now reads a `CREATE TABLE` whose `(` is
  followed by columns on the same line and whose body continues on later lines
  (closing `)` elsewhere) — e.g. `CREATE TABLE t (id int,\n  FOREIGN KEY …\n);`.
  Previously it sat between the two fast passes and was silently dropped in a
  mixed file (only rescued by sqlglot when the whole file had zero
  regex-parseable tables). The single-line pass now extends to the statement's
  closing `);` within a bounded window (a C-level search, no copy), so the
  ReDoS/DoS budget is unchanged (the orphan-openers stress stays ~0.4 s).

### v0.26.0 — SVG preview, view deep-links, schema lint (2026-08-30)

- `--to-preview` emits a static SVG snapshot of the diagram (auto-layout,
  schema-colored headers, columns, FK links) — a social/OpenGraph card image.
- **View deep-links**: a generated page reads its query string —
  `?focus=<table>` isolates a table, `theme=dark|light` forces the theme,
  `audit=show` reveals audit FKs, and `hubs` / `cycles` open on that analysis —
  so a precise view can be embedded in a doc.
- `--lint` checks the schema against rules (missing primary key, unindexed
  foreign key, disconnected table, non-`lower_snake_case` names, FK without a
  target) and prints JSON violations (rule, table, column, severity);
  `--fail-on error|warning|info` turns it into a CI gate.

### v0.25.1 — Firefox fit fix; grouped export menu (2026-08-30)

- Fix a Firefox regression where the diagram's foreign-key edges could appear at
  their provisional positions before the initial fit settled. The edges now stay
  hidden until a real re-fit runs — re-fit is also retried on `window.load` and
  by the safety timeout (which now re-fits, not just reveals), and it is skipped
  once the viewer has panned or zoomed, so it never resets a view in use.
- The SVG, Markdown and DOT exports are grouped under one `⬇ export` dropdown
  to declutter the toolbar.

### v0.25.0 — Graph analysis: join paths, impact, cycles, hub heatmap (2026-08-30)

- **Join path** (`⇢ jointure`): pick two tables and mcdview highlights the
  shortest foreign-key path between them and writes the `SELECT … JOIN … ON …`
  skeleton (copy button included) — the "how do I join these?" answer.
- **Impact analysis**: from an isolated table, "▲ depends on" / "▼ depended on
  by" highlight everything it reaches upstream (its dependencies) or downstream
  (what would break if you change it), following FKs transitively.
- **Cycles** (`↻ cycles`): highlight tables sitting on a circular foreign-key
  dependency (Tarjan SCC), including self-references — a schema smell that
  breaks insert ordering and dumps.
- **Hub heatmap** (`◉ hubs`): shade every table by its number of FK relations,
  so the central hub tables stand out at a glance, with a degree badge.
- **Model summary** (`∑ résumé`): tables, FKs, schemas, average columns, the
  most-referenced table, orphan tables (no FK) and how many sit on a cycle.
- **Enriched search**: `type:<sql type>` highlights every table with a column
  of that type, `ref:<table>` highlights the tables that reference it, and a
  plain query now falls back to a fuzzy (subsequence) name match.
- **Text exports**: a Markdown data dictionary (`⬇ MD`) and a Graphviz DOT
  graph (`⬇ DOT`), alongside the existing SVG export.
- **Copy DDL**: an isolated table's panel reconstructs its `CREATE TABLE`
  (columns, primary key, foreign keys) to the clipboard.
- **Probable missing FKs** (`≈ FK ?`): flags `<x>_id` columns with no declared
  foreign key when a table named `<x>` exists — a heuristic hint to review.
- **Print stylesheet**: printing (or saving to PDF) drops the interactive
  chrome and lays the diagram and panel out on white.
- All are pure client-side, single-file, zero-dependency, and available in the
  English UI too.

### v0.24.9 — Detect FKs declared inside CREATE TABLE (2026-08-30)

- Foreign keys written inside the `CREATE TABLE` body are now detected: a
  column-level inline `col int REFERENCES other(id)`, a table-level
  `FOREIGN KEY (col) REFERENCES other(id)` (single or composite), a column-less
  `REFERENCES other` that leans on the target's primary key, and
  self-references. Previously only `ALTER TABLE ... ADD ... FOREIGN KEY`
  (pg_dump style) was read, so hand-written schemas showed 0 FKs and every
  table floated unlinked. The sqlglot path already handled these; this fixes
  the built-in PostgreSQL parser.
- `--diagnose` gained a soft `disconnected_tables` anomaly (several tables and
  not one FK), which is almost always a parser gap rather than a real model.
- Leading-comma DDL style (`,\n  col TYPE`, common in hand-written schemas) now
  parses: the comma leading each entry no longer hides the column, its
  primary key, or a table-level foreign key.

### v0.24.8 — Version stamp moved into the detail panel (2026-08-30)

- The version stamp now sits discreetly in the detail panel's bottom-right
  corner, like a signature, instead of the bottom-left corner where it pushed
  the schema legend up. It rides with the panel: hidden while the panel is
  collapsed (the default), shown when the panel is open.

### v0.24.7 — Discreet version stamp (2026-08-30)

- Each generated page now shows which mcdview built it, faintly in the
  bottom-left corner (below the schema legend). Handy when a diagram was saved
  or shared a while ago: you can tell at a glance which version produced it,
  since old pages are never regenerated in place.

### v0.24.6 — Columns in the isolated view on huge models; no edge flash (2026-08-30)

- On very large models (over 800 tables) the diagram builds header-only nodes
  to stay fast, so a table showed as a name pill even when you zoomed in or
  isolated it — its columns only appeared in the side panel. Isolating a table
  now re-injects the columns into the focused table and its neighbours (a
  handful of nodes), so the isolated view reads like it does on a small model.
  Returning to the overview strips them back to header-only, keeping the
  overview cheap.
- No more edge flash on first paint (Firefox): the FK edges stay hidden until
  the initial refit routes them against settled boxes, then fade in over ~120
  ms. The tables show immediately (no cold-start blank screen), and a safety
  timeout reveals the edges even if the animation frame is starved (background
  tab) so they can never stay hidden.

### v0.24.5 — Deterministic, flash-free panel intro (2026-08-30)

- The panel intro now plays the same way on every load: the page starts with
  the panel collapsed (no flash of the panel before it tucks away), shows it
  open, then slides it shut over ~1.8s. The collapsed/open choice is sticky
  within the session (the toggle) but no longer remembered across loads — a
  past click can't make the intro silently skip or the panel snap shut.

### v0.24.4 — Firefox initial-fit fix (2026-08-30)

- Firefox computed the first zoom-to-fit before layout settled, so a freshly
  opened page showed the tables mis-scaled and the FK links mis-routed until
  the first hover. The fit is now recomputed after fonts are ready and two
  frames have painted (a no-op in Chrome, the correction Firefox needs).
- The panel intro-close now animates reliably (the slow transition is
  established a frame before the transform changes, so it no longer snaps shut
  instantly on some browsers).

### v0.24.3 — Intro reveal for the detail panel (2026-08-30)

- On first load the detail panel shows open (so its purpose is visible), then
  slides shut over ~2s to the collapsed default — clicking a table or the
  toggle cancels the intro and keeps the panel open. Skipped when a preference
  is remembered or the URL opens straight on a table.

### v0.24.2 — Collapsible detail panel (2026-08-30)

- The detail panel can be collapsed to give the diagram the full width. It
  starts collapsed and a table click auto-reveals it; once you use the toggle,
  your choice sticks (collapsed stays collapsed on later clicks, open stays
  open) and is remembered for next time.

### v0.24.1 — Soft-faded diagram edges (2026-08-30)

- The viewport edges fade softly, so a foreign-key link to a table currently
  off-screen (after panning) fades out at the border instead of stopping hard
  in mid-air (it used to read as "a link leading to nothing").

### v0.24.0 — Robustness, --diagnose, and a big corpus sweep (2026-08-30)

- Swept mcdview over **~15,000 real-world files** across every format; fixed
  every crash found: a phantom `REFERENCES` column from a wrapped FK, and
  several sqlglot AST edge cases (exotic defaults, constraint/comment/index
  nodes) — plus a safety net so no sqlglot AST shape can crash the tool.
- The built-in PostgreSQL parser reads single-line `CREATE TABLE t (a int);`.
- Faster `--dialect auto` on large non-PostgreSQL files (dialect picked on a
  prefix, ~4–6× less parse time).
- Rails FK columns resolve against the real columns and handle irregular
  plurals (people→person); Drizzle `pgTableCreator` factories are supported.
- `--diagnose` prints a JSON verdict (status, dialect, counts, anomalies) and
  never fails — for a hosting service to flag problematic uploads.

### v0.23.3 — Single-line DDL, --version (2026-08-30)

- The built-in PostgreSQL parser now reads a single-line / compact
  `CREATE TABLE t (a int, b numeric(10,2));` (no newline after the open paren),
  not only the `pg_dump` `(\n` layout. Before, such DDL only parsed when
  sqlglot was installed. Body splitting is depth- and string-aware, so a comma
  or paren inside a type or a `'literal'` never splits a column; still linear,
  still within the DoS budget.
- `--version` prints the installed version.
- `--db` is now covered end-to-end in CI (against a throwaway PostgreSQL
  service), not only manually.

### v0.23.2 — Index diff on the sqlglot path (2026-08-30)

- Indexes and unique constraints are now extracted on the sqlglot path too
  (`CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX`, `ALTER … ADD CONSTRAINT … UNIQUE`, inline `UNIQUE`).
  Previously only the built-in PostgreSQL parser read them, so a single-line
  `CREATE TABLE …` (which routes to sqlglot) reported no index changes in a
  diff. MySQL `UNIQUE KEY` is picked up as a bonus.

### v0.23.1 — Installable from PyPI (2026-08-30)

- Published to PyPI: `pipx install mcdview` (extra `[dialects]` pulls in
  sqlglot). The HTML template and logo ride along as bundled data; running the
  script straight from a checkout keeps working unchanged. Releases publish
  automatically on a version tag via PyPI Trusted Publishing (no stored token).
- Fixed a backslash inside an f-string expression that broke the Mermaid export
  on Python 3.9–3.11 (only 3.12+ tolerated it).

### v0.23.0 — Big-model UX, SVG export, richer diff (2026-08-29)

- **Big models:** a level-of-detail mode (table names only when zoomed out), a
  clickable **minimap**, and header-only table nodes above 800 tables (≈20×
  fewer DOM nodes) make a 1000+ table schema usable.
- **SVG export:** a toolbar button downloads the diagram as a portable SVG for
  docs and slides.
- **Diff:** indexes and unique constraints are now diffed too (shown in the
  panel, counted in the JSON summary); renames are detected by column overlap,
  not just an exact match.
- **Multiple input files** are merged into one model (`mcdview a.sql b.sql`),
  cross-file foreign keys resolved.
- **Quality of life:** dragged/rearranged positions are remembered
  (localStorage), a light/dark toggle, keyboard shortcuts (`/`, `r`, Esc), and
  `--watch` to regenerate the page on every save.
- Indexes and unique constraints (`CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX`, `ADD CONSTRAINT …
  UNIQUE`) are parsed and shown in the detail panel.

### v0.22.2 — Security and correctness audit (2026-08-29)

- **XSS fix:** a schema fill-color from a `.dbm` was injected into the page
  unescaped — a hostile model could run script in a viewer's browser. The
  color is now escaped like all other model data (and `ech()` now escapes
  single quotes too, closing attribute-breakout).
- **ReDoS fix:** the Mermaid and Rails block extraction backtracked
  catastrophically on crafted input (a ~20 KB `.mmd` took ~18 s); both now use
  a bounded string search, and the DoS-budget test covers every parser, not
  just PostgreSQL.
- **Phantom-PK fix:** a `DEFAULT 'PRIMARY KEY'`, a `CHECK` or an inline comment
  mentioning the words no longer marks a column as a primary key (regression
  from the inline-PK support).
- **Hardening:** `url_sure` now strips tab/newline/control chars before the
  scheme check (`java\tscript:` is neutralized); the XML DTD guard scans the
  whole document; malformed `.mwb`/`.dbm` inputs exit cleanly instead of
  dumping a traceback.
- **Perf:** the primary-key regexes are precompiled and guarded (~130 ms off a
  5000-table parse); the column search suggests columns only on models under
  300 tables (avoids a ×10 datalist blow-up).
- Internals: a `nouvelle_fk` factory joins `nouvelle_table`/`nouvelle_colonne`;
  new `tests/test_parser.py`; dead code removed.

### v0.22.1 — Inline primary keys, revamped README (2026-08-29)

- The PostgreSQL parser now recognises a column-level primary key
  (`id serial PRIMARY KEY`), not only a separate `PRIMARY KEY (...)` line or
  an `ALTER TABLE`. The column gets its 🔑 and the constraint no longer leaks
  into the displayed type.
- README rebuilt around an animated demo, a live-rendered Mermaid diagram and
  a diff screenshot.

### v0.22.0 — Mermaid export (2026-08-29)

- `--to-mermaid` renders the model as a Mermaid `erDiagram`. Pasted into a
  Markdown file, GitHub and GitLab render it natively — a static diagram in
  the README, no hosting needed (the interactive page stays the way to explore
  a big model). See [docs/diagrams.md](docs/diagrams.md) for the four examples.

### v0.21.0 — Diff polish, rename detection, column search (2026-08-29)

- The diff detail panel now shows a retyped column as `old → new` (the old
  type struck through).
- Small single-schema models lay out as a roughly square block instead of a
  tall vertical band.
- Rename detection: a table dropped and one added with the same set of column
  names is shown as a rename ("renamed from X", amber) rather than a
  remove+add pair, and a foreign key untouched apart from the rename stays
  unchanged. The JSON summary carries `renamed_from`.
- Search now matches column names too (`table.column` or a bare column name):
  it isolates the table and highlights the row.

### v0.20.2 — JSON diff summary (2026-08-29)

- `--summary FILE` (with `--diff`) writes a machine-readable JSON summary of
  the changes: per-category counts (tables/columns/FKs added, removed,
  changed) and the change list, with the previous type kept for retyped
  columns (`"was": "numeric(10,2)"`). Lets a caller show change badges or a
  version timeline without parsing the HTML.

### v0.20.1 — Diff legend counts and "touched only" filter (2026-08-29)

- The diff legend now shows how many tables were added, changed and removed,
  and a "N touched" button hides the unchanged tables to frame just the ones
  that moved. "Overview" / Escape brings everything back.

### v0.20.0 — Schema diff (2026-08-29)

- `--diff BASELINE` compares the model against an older version (any supported
  format on either side) and colors the diagram: tables, columns and foreign
  keys that were added (green), removed (red, struck through, kept on the
  diagram), or changed (amber). A legend shows the key. Useful to review a
  migration visually before applying it.
- Internals: the seven parsers now share a single `charger()` dispatch and the
  `nouvelle_table` / `nouvelle_colonne` factories, so every format flows
  through the same code — which is what makes the diff work across all of them.

### v0.19.3 — Harden the untrusted-upload surface (2026-08-29)

- Model XML (`.mwb`, `.dbm`) is refused if it declares a DTD or entities, the
  vector for entity-expansion ("billion laughs") and XXE attacks the stdlib
  XML parser does not block on its own.
- The `.mwb` archive is read through a size cap, so a tiny file cannot
  decompress into gigabytes (zip bomb).
- Every external converter (`pgmodeler-cli`, `dbml2sql`, `prisma`,
  `pg_dump`/`mysqldump`) runs under a timeout and is killed if it hangs.
- `tests/test_securite.py` covers all four (generated on the fly, like the
  ReDoS bombs). This matters for a service that renders files it did not write.

### v0.19.2 — Fuller Mermaid erDiagram parsing (2026-08-29)

- A crow's-foot cardinality (`o{`, `}o`) is no longer mistaken for an entity
  block, which previously invented a phantom one-letter table.
- Attribute comments (`int id PK "SERIAL"`) become column comments, shown in
  the detail panel; `%%` comment lines and a `direction` directive inside an
  entity block are ignored instead of read as columns; comma-separated
  attribute keys (`PK, FK`) are accepted.
- Validated on 113 real erDiagram files (raw `.mmd` and inside Markdown
  fences): 918 tables, 1002 FKs, zero bogus columns.

### v0.19.1 — Links follow tables during "rearrange" (2026-08-29)

- "Rearrange" now redraws the FK links on every frame while the tables glide
  to their new positions, instead of leaving them behind and snapping them
  into place once the CSS transition ends.

### v0.19.0 — Read a live database via --db (2026-08-28)

- `--db postgresql://…` / `--db mysql://…`: dump a running database's schema
  (`pg_dump -s` for PostgreSQL, `mysqldump --no-data` for MySQL/MariaDB) and
  render it, no intermediate file needed. The positional model argument
  becomes optional; the page title defaults to the database name.
- MySQL passwords go through the `MYSQL_PWD` environment variable, never on
  the process command line.
- FK constraint names are now recovered on the MySQL/sqlglot path (they hang
  off the wrapping `CONSTRAINT` node), so `--fk-audit` works on MySQL and
  MariaDB models too.
- **Command-line only.** This feature must not be exposed on a public
  service: it would let a caller make the process connect to any host it can
  reach (SSRF). The hosted site keeps taking uploaded files only.

### v0.18.0 — Drizzle ORM schema.ts input (2026-08-28)

- Read Drizzle ORM `schema.ts` natively: each `pgTable`/`mysqlTable`/
  `sqliteTable` becomes a table, its `type("col")` fields columns (with
  `.primaryKey()`/`.notNull()`), and `.references(() => t.col)` the foreign
  keys; commented-out definitions are ignored

### v0.17.0 — Mermaid erDiagram input (2026-08-28)

- Read Mermaid `erDiagram` natively, raw `.mmd`/`.mermaid` or inside a
  ```` ```mermaid ```` fence in a `.md`: entities become tables, attributes
  columns (PK marker → key), each relationship an FK from the crow's-foot
  ("many") side to the "one" side

### v0.16.0 — Rails schema.rb input (2026-08-28)

- Read Rails `db/schema.rb` natively (the `create_table` / `add_foreign_key`
  DSL is regular): the implicit `id` primary key, column types, and foreign
  keys (default column resolved by singularizing the target table)

### v0.15.0 — MySQL Workbench .mwb input (2026-08-28)

- Read MySQL Workbench `.mwb` models natively — the file is a zip whose
  `document.mwb.xml` (GRT object tree) is parsed with the standard library,
  no external tool: schemas, tables, column types, primary and foreign keys

### v0.14.0 — Prisma schema input (2026-08-28)

- Read Prisma `schema.prisma` models, converted to SQL by `prisma migrate
  diff`; the schema's provider (postgres/mysql/sqlite/sqlserver) is detected
  automatically, MongoDB schemas are reported as unsupported
- The PK/FK parsers now accept double-quoted constraint names
  (`CONSTRAINT "x_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ...`), as emitted by Prisma and modern tools

### v0.13.0 — DBML input (2026-08-28)

- Read dbdiagram.io `.dbml` models (converted to SQL by `@dbml/cli`), the
  same upstream-converter pattern as `.dbm`
- The FK parser now also reads unnamed constraints (`ADD FOREIGN KEY ...`
  without `CONSTRAINT name`), which dbml2sql and some dumps emit

### v0.12.0 — Attribution badge, safer link URLs (2026-08-28)

- `--credit TEXT` / `--credit-url URL`: a slanted rubber-stamp attribution
  badge (mcdview logo + text) in the bottom-right corner, off by default;
  text escaped, optional link
- `--home-url` and `--credit-url` now reject dangerous URL schemes
  (`javascript:`, `data:`…), keeping only http(s)/mailto/relative links

### v0.11.0 — SQL Server routing and ALTER ADD COLUMN (2026-08-28)

- SQL Server DDL (`[bracket]` identifiers) is routed to the sqlglot tsql
  parser instead of being mangled by the PostgreSQL parser
- `ALTER TABLE ... ADD [COLUMN] name type` columns are now read, not just
  the ones inside the `CREATE TABLE` body
- Both found by running the content-invariant test over a larger, more
  dialect-diverse harvested corpus

### v0.10.1 — Case-insensitive key matching (2026-08-28)

- PK/FK column names are matched to columns case-insensitively (unquoted SQL
  identifiers are case-insensitive), so a `PLAYERID` primary key on a
  `playerID` column shows its 🔑 instead of being dropped as a phantom —
  found by the content-invariant test on a wider harvested corpus

### v0.10.0 — Header logo link and custom logo (2026-08-28)

- `--home-url URL`: the header logo becomes a link (e.g. back to the
  hosting site); URL escaped, nothing changes when the option is absent
- `--logo FILE`: replace the header logo with your own image (svg/png/jpg…),
  embedded as an `<img>` data URI so a third-party SVG cannot run scripts

### v0.9.5 — Parser fixes from content-invariant testing (2026-08-28)

- Strip quoting from column names in PK/FK lists, so a `` `id` `` or
  `"timestamp"` primary key no longer becomes a phantom (unmatched) key
- Read quoted table/schema names (`CREATE TABLE "accounts"`), so double-quoted
  DDL (e.g. Drizzle output) is parsed instead of dropped entirely
- Route obviously non-PostgreSQL files (backticks) to sqlglot rather than
  letting the regex parser mangle them
- New `tests/test_invariants.py`: checks the parsed model is internally
  consistent (no empty types, no phantom PK columns, FK endpoints exist)

### v0.9.4 — Auto-dialect tries several parsers (2026-08-28)

- When PostgreSQL yields no table, `--dialect auto` now tries several sqlglot
  dialects and keeps the one parsing the most tables, instead of guessing a
  single one — recovers files that were mis-detected (a 28-table model was
  read as the wrong dialect and dropped entirely)

### v0.9.3 — Square overview for huge schemas (2026-08-28)

- The automatic layout now sizes each schema's column height for a roughly
  square zone, so a large single-schema model no longer stretches into an
  unreadable horizontal band (a 1066-table model went from a 41:1 strip to
  1.4:1); small models are unchanged

### v0.9.2 — Dialect polish (2026-08-28)

- The detected dialect is shown in the toolbar counter for non-PostgreSQL
  models (e.g. `12 tables · 21 FK · mysql`)
- sqlglot column types are lowercased to match the PostgreSQL parser
  (`INT(11)` → `int(11)`), keeping string literals intact

### v0.9.1 — Isolated view no longer overlaps (2026-08-28)

- When isolating a table, the star of related tables now sizes its radius to
  the tables involved and runs a de-overlap pass (centre kept fixed), so a
  large neighbour (e.g. a 40-column table) no longer covers the isolated one

### v0.9.0 — Multi-dialect input via sqlglot (2026-08-28)

- Read MySQL/MariaDB, SQLite and ~15 other dialects through the optional
  `sqlglot` backend (PostgreSQL stays dependency-free); `--dialect` flag,
  `auto` sniffs and falls back. On the harvested corpus, files that produced
  no page dropped from 257 to 18
- Dialect fixtures and test (`tests/test_dialectes.py`), sqlglot wired into
  CI and the pre-commit hook

### v0.8.5 — Hosted at mcdview.dev (2026-08-28)

- Link to the hosted service at [mcdview.dev](https://mcdview.dev/): upload a
  `.sql` or `.dbm` and get a shareable link, no install needed
- README badges (hosted, demo, CI, license), repository homepage and topics
  for discoverability

### v0.8.4 — Rearrange no longer overlaps big tables (2026-08-28)

- The rearrange layout now sizes each edge to the two tables it links (a
  constant target was pulling wide tables into each other), reins in weakly
  linked tables with a gravity term and a bounded repulsion range, and ends
  with a de-overlap pass — a 69-table model went from 60 overlapping pairs
  to zero, in a compact frame

### v0.8.3 — Own the pgmodeler-cli image, reliable .dbm CI (2026-08-28)

- `docker/pgmodeler-cli/` + `image.yml` build and publish
  `ghcr.io/gheop/pgmodeler-cli` (Fedora 44 + pgModeler 1.2.2, plus a `-node`
  variant for `container:` jobs); the tag is the pgModeler version baked in
- The CI `.dbm` job now runs inside that pinned image (fixed version → stable
  counts) and is blocking instead of best-effort

### v0.8.2 — Tolerate pgmodeler-cli fix-model segfault (2026-08-28)

- `--fix-model` on pgmodeler-cli 1.2.2 writes the repaired `.dbm` in full,
  then segfaults while freeing the model (memory-layout dependent, systematic
  in containers). mcdview now judges the repair by the output file, not the
  exit code, so old `.dbm` models convert inside a container

### v0.8.1 — CI test pipeline (2026-08-28)

- CI now runs on every push and pull request: Python error linting
  (`ruff --select F,E9`, `py_compile`), the pinned regression, the security
  suite, the strict corpus campaign, HTML structure validation and a
  headless-Chrome DOM check on the generated example pages; deploy to Pages
  only runs on `main` after the tests pass
- `tests/valider_html.py` validates a page's structure and data island
- A best-effort `.dbm` job installs pgmodeler-cli on the runner (never
  blocks a PR)

### v0.8.0 — Rearrange button (2026-08-28)

- "Rearrange" button: a dependency-free force-directed relayout
  (Fruchterman-Reingold) that spreads tables to reduce link crossings —
  on a 69-table model with its audit FKs hidden, crossings dropped from
  662 to 217. Disabled above 400 tables (the O(n²) pass would freeze the tab)

### v0.7.0 — Hover, permalinks, hardening (2026-08-28)

- Hover a table to light up its links; `#schema.table` permalinks that
  reopen on the right table; DEFAULT values in the detail panel; table
  comments as tooltips; a table/FK counter in the toolbar
- Security: all injected model data is HTML-escaped and the JSON island
  escapes `<`, closing an XSS vector; the CREATE TABLE body is now bounded
  by string search instead of a lazy regex, killing a ReDoS (a 830 KiB
  malformed file went from 13 s to 0.3 s)
- Security test suite and a strict corpus campaign wired into the
  pre-commit hook

### v0.6.1 — .dbm repair fallback (2026-08-28)

- When pgmodeler-cli refuses a `.dbm` (saved by an older pgModeler), mcdview
  now retries through `--fix-model` before giving up — on the harvested
  corpus this takes the refusal rate from 136/296 down to 2/296
- Campaign results published in the README ("Tested at scale")

### v0.6.0 — Schema legend, large-scale campaign (2026-08-28)

- Schema legend: one colored chip per schema (name + table count) in the
  bottom-left corner, click to frame that schema's zone; hidden when the
  model has a single schema
- A clear hint when the input is MySQL or SQLite DDL instead of PostgreSQL
- Performance: pre-sorted BFS starts (layout of a 5000-table model drops
  from 894 ms to 56 ms), precompiled column regexes, tables built in one
  DocumentFragment and links redrawn in a single DOM write
- Large-scale harness (`tests/moissonner.py`, `tests/grand_banc.py`):
  hundreds of real-world schemas harvested from GitHub plus synthetic
  models up to 5000 tables, per-phase timings and DOM validation

### v0.5.0 — Draggable tables, test bench (2026-08-28)

- Tables can be dragged around the diagram, links redraw live; a table
  moved in the overview keeps its new home position
- Regression/benchmark runner (`tests/tester.py`) over the examples, the
  pgModeler sample models and an optional local corpus of big real-world
  schemas (GitLab: 1066 tables parsed in ~0.7 s), plus a pre-commit hook

### v0.4.0 — pgModeler .dbm input, CI-built pages (2026-08-28)

- A `.dbm` pgModeler model can be passed directly as input: the SQL is
  produced by `pgmodeler-cli` and the table positions drawn in the model
  are reused
- The example pages are rebuilt by GitHub Actions on every push instead of
  being committed
- Code comments, docstrings and CLI output translated to English

### v0.3.0 — Wider DDL support, real-world examples (2026-08-28)

- The parser now accepts unqualified tables (defaulting to the `public`
  schema), an opening parenthesis on its own line, primary keys declared
  via `ALTER TABLE` (`pg_dump -s` style), composite foreign keys, FK targets
  without a column list, and partitioned tables (partitions are folded into
  their parent)
- 3 real-world example models with browsable pages: Pagila, Northwind,
  Chinook

### v0.2.0 — English UI (2026-08-28)

- `--lang {fr,en}` option: language of the generated page's interface
  (search box, help text, detail panel labels)
- The live demo now uses the English UI

### v0.1.1 — Public release (2026-08-28)

- Fictional library demo (`exemples/mediatheque.sql`) with a live version
  on GitHub Pages
- README in English, screenshot
- Published on GitHub

### v0.1.0 — First standalone version (2026-08-27)

- Automatic table layout (one zone per schema, balanced columns, related
  tables pulled together) — the pgModeler `.dbm` becomes optional
- `--titre`, `--fk-audit`, `--dbm`, `-o` options
- SVG logo, "audit FK" checkbox hidden when no FK matches
