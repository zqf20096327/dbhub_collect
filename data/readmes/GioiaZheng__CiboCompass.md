🚀 Full-stack mobile app for international students in Italy

CiboCompass is a **full-stack mobile application** designed to help users understand restaurant menus and make informed food choices across cultures.

The system combines a **React Native (Expo) frontend** with a **Go-based backend API**, supporting real-time dish information, personalized ratings, and offline-resilient rating submission.

# Highlights

- 📱 Cross-platform mobile app built with React Native + Expo  
- ⚙️ Backend API implemented in Go with SQLite persistence  
- 🌍 Cultural-aware exploration based on nationality  
- 💾 Offline-resilient rating queue with local caching and idempotent delivery  
- 🎯 User-centered design following HCI principles

# System Design

### Data Flow

1. User searches or selects a dish in the mobile app  
2. App sends request to backend API  
3. Backend retrieves dish data from SQLite  
4. Response returned to mobile client  
5. User submits rating  
6. Rating stored locally and added to a durable submission queue  
7. Pending feedback is retried on app start or foreground events  

---

### Design Decisions

- **Offline-resilient rating delivery**  
  Ratings remain visible locally without network connectivity. Pending feedback
  is persisted in `AsyncStorage`, retried with the same idempotency key, and
  collapsed to the newest queued value for a dish/nationality pair. The
  [current state machine](docs/offline-sync-state-diagram.md) documents the
  implemented guarantees and their limits.

  This is not yet full multi-device synchronization: the API has no stable
  actor identity or monotonic client sequence, and the backend stores aggregate
  counters rather than per-actor rating state. The
  [versioned sync protocol design](docs/offline-rating-sync-design.md) defines
  the migration required before making that claim.

- **Lightweight backend (Go)**  
  Chosen for efficient concurrency and low overhead.

- **REST API design**  
  Stateless endpoints for scalability and easy integration.

- **SQLite database**  
  Simple and fast for development and local persistence.

  The backend uses one bounded `database/sql` pool with eight open and four
  idle connections. Foreign-key enforcement, a five-second busy timeout, and
  WAL journaling are applied to every physical connection. Result rows are
  closed before dependent ingredient queries so the read path remains safe
  even when the pool is constrained to one connection.

  This is a correctness-oriented local policy, not a published throughput
  claim. QPS and P99 latency will only be reported with a reproducible workload
  and benchmark configuration.

### Offline Sync State

The implemented offline rating lifecycle is documented in
[docs/offline-sync-state-diagram.md](docs/offline-sync-state-diagram.md). The app
stores user ratings and pending feedback submissions locally with
`AsyncStorage`, then retries idempotent delivery when the app has an opportunity
to sync. Ordering across requests and devices is intentionally listed as a
non-guarantee until the [versioned protocol](docs/offline-rating-sync-design.md)
is implemented.

### Future Improvements

- Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL for scalability  
- Add authentication system (JWT-based users)  
- Introduce recommendation engine (collaborative filtering)  
- Implement actor-scoped, versioned rating synchronization  
- Deploy backend with Docker and cloud services

# API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint        | Description              |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------|
| GET    | /v1/dishes     | Fetch dish information   |
| POST   | /v1/dishes     | Create a dish            |
| GET    | /v1/dishes/:dishName | Fetch dish details for a nationality |
| POST   | /v1/dishes/:dishName/feedback | Submit dish feedback |

# Tech Stack

| Layer        | Technology |
|--------------|------------|
| **Frontend** | React Native, Expo |
| **Backend**  | Go (Golang), REST API |
| **Database** | SQLite |
| **UX**       | HCI principles, usability testing |

# Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GioiaZheng/CiboCompass.git
cd CiboCompass

npm install
npm run check
```

Create a local `.env` from `.env.example`, then set the backend address for the
client you are running:

| Client | `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` |
| --- | --- |
| Web or iOS simulator | `http://localhost:4000/v1` |
| Android emulator | `http://10.0.2.2:4000/v1` |
| Physical device | `http://<development-machine-LAN-IP>:4000/v1` |

For example:

```dotenv
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/v1
```

`EXPO_PUBLIC_` values are included in the client bundle, so this setting must
contain an endpoint only, never credentials or secrets. Reload the app after
changing it.

Start Expo:

```bash
npm run start
```

Expected output:

```text
Starting project at .../CiboCompass
Metro waiting on exp://...
› Press a │ open Android
› Press i │ open iOS simulator
› Press w │ open web
```

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
go run ./cmd/api
```

Expected output:

```text
starting development server on 0.0.0.0:4000
```

# Why This Project

Food is one of the biggest barriers for international students.

This project focuses on:

- reducing language friction in menus  
- improving decision-making with structured food data  
- adapting recommendations across cultural preferences
