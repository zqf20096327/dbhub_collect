# Field Theory UI

Local-first web interface for exploring your X/Twitter bookmarks. Built on the [fieldtheory CLI](https://github.com/afar1/fieldtheory-cli).

**Read-only** · **Zero cloud** · **Dark mode**

  <img src="public/field-theory-cover-image.png" alt="Field Theory UI — interactive dashboard powered by natural language" width="720" />
</p>

- Search, filter, and explore thousands of bookmarks with full-text search
- Ask natural language questions and get interactive dashboards back
- See how your interests evolve over time, who you bookmark, and what repos you're collecting

## Quick Start

**Requires:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20+ and [fieldtheory CLI](https://github.com/afar1/fieldtheory-cli) v1.2.0+ with synced bookmarks.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Gitmaxd/field-theory-ui.git
cd field-theory-ui
npm install
./start.sh
```

Open [http://localhost:3939](http://localhost:3939). The start script builds, launches, and prints a QR code for mobile access on your local network.

## Chat

Chat is an AI-powered interface for querying your bookmarks. It operates in two modes with increasing capability, backed by a [LangChain](https://langchain.com) ReAct agent that autonomously selects tools to answer your questions.

### Standard Mode

Works out of the box with no API keys. Uses [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), or built-in pattern matching (first available) to translate natural language into API calls against your bookmark collection.

### Pro Mode

Adds a LangChain ReAct agent with tool calling and interactive dashboards -- charts, tables, KPI cards, and follow-up buttons rendered as live React components via [OpenUI](https://github.com/nicholasgasior/openui). Enable it by adding an API key:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
# Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY in .env
```

A PRO toggle appears in the Chat input bar when a key is detected. The agent auto-detects your provider and selects the appropriate model (`anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6` or `openai:gpt-5.4-mini`, overridable via `CHAT_MODEL`). When using Anthropic, the system prompt is cached across agent invocations to reduce latency and token cost on multi-step queries. Pro mode markdown responses include Copy and Download actions for extracting LLM-generated analysis.

### Agent Tools

The Pro mode agent has access to the following tools and autonomously decides which to call, in what order, chaining up to 8 tool invocations per query:

| Tool | Source | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `execute_sql` | Local database | Sandboxed read-only SQL against your bookmarks database. Features FTS5 full-text search, custom date parsing functions (`parse_twitter_date_ymd`), live schema introspection, automatic retry on query failure (up to 5 attempts), and automatic LIMIT injection. All queries are validated: SELECT-only, no DML/DDL, single-statement. |
| `TavilySearch` | Live web | Real-time internet search via [Tavily](https://tavily.com). Returns up to 5 results per query. The agent uses this to research topics beyond your bookmarks, verify trends with current data, or supplement local results with external sources. Activated when `TAVILY_API_KEY` is set. |

When both tools are available, the agent queries your bookmarks first for local context, then searches the web for current information, then synthesizes both sources in its response.

**Example prompts showing tool usage:**

> **Database only:** "Build a dashboard comparing my top 5 categories by volume over the last 6 months" -- the agent writes aggregation queries via `execute_sql` and renders an interactive OpenUI dashboard with charts and KPI cards.
>
> **Web search only:** "What are the latest developments in AI agent frameworks?" -- the agent calls `TavilySearch` for current web results and responds with a markdown summary of its findings.
>
> **Combined (local + web):** "Research the topics I've been bookmarking about AI agents and tell me what I'm missing" -- the agent queries your bookmarks via `execute_sql` to map your AI agent content, then uses `TavilySearch` for current developments, then synthesizes the gaps between what you've saved and what's happening now.
>
> **Combined (verification):** "I bookmarked several posts about Rust -- is it still gaining traction?" -- the agent pulls your Rust bookmark data for context, searches the web for current adoption metrics, and compares the two.

### Streaming

Pro mode streams responses in real time with step-level progress indicators ("Thinking...", "Querying database...", "Generating response..."). Text responses stream with progressive markdown rendering and a blinking cursor. Dashboard responses render progressively during streaming as the OpenUI Renderer assembles interactive components in real time. Both Anthropic and OpenAI token formats are handled natively.

### UX Details

The input auto-expands up to 7 lines (Shift+Enter inserts a newline). The **Surprise Me** button fetches a random bookmark from your collection.

## Development

```sh
npm run dev              # Vite dev server with HMR
npm run server           # API server only (port 3939)
npm run build            # Production build
npm run typecheck        # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint             # ESLint
npm test                 # Vitest
npm run generate:prompt  # Regenerate OpenUI component reference for Chat Pro
```

<summary><strong>CLI Compatibility</strong></summary>

| CLI Version | Released        | Status                                                   |
| ----------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| ~~1.0.x~~   | Apr 3, 2026     | Unsupported -- missing required columns                  |
| ~~1.1.0~~   | Apr 4, 2026     | Unsupported -- missing engagement columns                |
| 1.2.x       | Apr 4-5, 2026   | Compatible (schema v3)                                   |
| **1.3.x**   | **Apr 8, 2026** | **Recommended** -- quoted tweets, conversation threading |

The UI validates the schema on startup. Optional columns from newer CLI versions degrade gracefully. Date parsing handles both Twitter-style and ISO 8601 formats.

For full feature coverage, upgrade to v1.3.x:

```sh
npm update -g fieldtheory
ft sync --gaps
```

<summary><strong>API Endpoints</strong></summary>
