# FastClaw — AI Teammate

FastClaw is a single-tenant AI teammate platform you deploy as a service and connect to Slack and/or Telegram.

In Slack, you can mention it (the default agent name is Grail):

`@Grail do so and so`

In Telegram (DM or group), you can address it via `/grail ...` (or @mention in groups).

## Demo

Re-record the assets: see the `FastClaw-Demo-Video` repo.

## These Are The Things FastClaw Can Do

1. Recap long threads into action items (and attach a markdown report).
   - ![Thread recap](assets/demo/variants/grail-v01-thread-recap.gif)
2. Coordinate incident response: summarize state, owners, next steps.

3. Review PRs and call out risk areas with concrete suggestions.

4. Triage support requests and propose the next best actions.

5. Safely run operational commands with guardrails and in-Slack approvals.
   - ![Guardrail approval](assets/demo/variants/grail-v08-guardrail-approval.gif)

FastClaw will:

- Acknowledge quickly (queues a job).
- Inject the last **N** recent messages as context (configurable).
- Work through tasks **one-at-a-time** from a SQLite-backed queue.
- Reply back in the originating thread/chat.
- Optionally use Slack MCP tools to fetch more context beyond the last N messages.
- Optionally use Web MCP tools (Brave search + fetch).
- Persist durable notes under `/data/context/` and a rolling session memory summary.
- Enforce local guardrails for risky actions and request human approval in-chat when needed.

This repo is Rust-first (server + Slack MCP server), and uses the open-source Codex CLI app-server for the agent runtime.

Note: the `Dockerfile` downloads a pinned Codex release (`CODEX_VERSION` build arg). Update that version periodically if you want newer Codex behavior.

## Deploy On Railway (Recommended)

1. Create a new Railway project from this repo.
2. Add a **Volume** mounted at `/data` (required for persistence).
   - Keep replicas at **1**. This template uses SQLite on the mounted volume and is intended to run single-replica.
3. Set environment variables:
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (required)
   - Slack (optional):
     - `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` (required if using Slack; can also be stored in SQLite if `GRAIL_MASTER_KEY` is set)
     - `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` (required if using Slack; can also be stored in SQLite if `GRAIL_MASTER_KEY` is set)
   - Telegram (optional):
     - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` (required if using Telegram; can also be stored in SQLite if `GRAIL_MASTER_KEY` is set)
     - `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (required if using Telegram; can also be stored in SQLite if `GRAIL_MASTER_KEY` is set)
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (recommended)
   - `GRAIL_MASTER_KEY` (optional; required only if you want to store secrets (OpenAI/Slack) via the dashboard, encrypted in SQLite). Generate with: `openssl rand -hex 32`
   - `BASE_URL` (optional; used only to render full URLs in the dashboard, e.g. the Slack events URL)
4. Deploy.

After deploy:

- Slack events endpoint is `POST /slack/events`
- Slack interactive endpoint is `POST /slack/actions` (optional, for approval buttons)
- Telegram webhook endpoint is `POST /telegram/webhook`
- Dashboard is `GET /admin` (Basic Auth: `admin:<ADMIN_PASSWORD>`)

## Slack App Setup (Bring Your Own App)

This template is intentionally “single workspace per deployment”.

1. Create a Slack App in your workspace.
2. Use the provided manifest: `slack-app-manifest.yaml`
3. Set the request URL in the manifest to:
   - `https://<your-railway-domain>/slack/events`
4. (Optional) If you want clickable approval buttons, set interactivity request URL:
   - `https://<your-railway-domain>/slack/actions`
5. Install the app to your workspace.
6. Copy:
   - **Signing Secret** -> `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` (or store it in `/admin/settings` if `GRAIL_MASTER_KEY` is set)
   - **Bot User OAuth Token** -> `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` (or store it in `/admin/settings` if `GRAIL_MASTER_KEY` is set)

## Telegram Setup (Bring Your Own Bot)

1. Create a bot with `@BotFather`, copy the token.
2. Set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` (env var or `/admin/settings` if `GRAIL_MASTER_KEY` is set).
3. In `/admin/settings`, enable Telegram.
4. Set the Telegram webhook:

```bash
curl -sS "https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/setWebhook" \
  -d "url=https://<your-service-domain>/telegram/webhook" \
  -d "secret_token=${TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET}"
```

Telegram history note: the Bot API can’t fetch arbitrary chat history, so FastClaw injects Telegram context from messages it has previously received (stored in SQLite).

## Dashboard

`/admin/settings` lets you configure:

- Slack context size (last N messages)
- model + reasoning knobs
- permissions mode (`read` vs `full`)
- command approval mode + guardrails behavior
- Slack user allow list + channel allow list
- Slack MCP tool enable/disable
- web MCP tool enable/disable
- context writes enable/disable
- shell network access toggle (full mode only)
- Telegram enable + allow list

If `GRAIL_MASTER_KEY` is set, you can also store `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`, and `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` encrypted in SQLite from the dashboard.
Telegram secrets can also be stored the same way.

`/admin/auth` lets you optionally log in with ChatGPT via a device code flow (writes tokens to `/data/codex/auth.json`). This is useful if you don't want to provide an API key.

`/admin/tasks` shows the queue, and lets you cancel queued tasks and retry failed tasks.

`/admin/approvals` shows pending approvals (commands, cron proposals, guardrail proposals).

`/admin/guardrails` lets you edit command guardrails (allow/require_approval/deny).

`/admin/memory` shows per-conversation rolling memory summaries (and lets you reset them).

`/admin/context` lets you view/edit `/data/context` files (including `AGENTS.md` and `INDEX.md`).

## Persistence Layout

Mount a volume at `/data`.

FastClaw stores:

- `/data/grail.sqlite` (queue, settings, session mapping)
- `/data/context/` (durable notes)
- `/data/context/AGENTS.md` (default instruction “constitution” for the agent)
- `/data/codex/` (`CODEX_HOME` for Codex app-server rollouts/state)

## Permissions Model

- `read`: no command execution; no context writes.
- `full`: command execution is allowed (with sandboxing); context writes allowed (restricted to `/data/context`).

Even in `read`, FastClaw can respond and (optionally) use Slack MCP tools to fetch more Slack context.

## Local Development

You’ll need:

- Rust toolchain
- `codex` on your PATH (or set `CODEX_BIN`)
- Slack + OpenAI credentials

Run:

```bash
cd grail
export ADMIN_PASSWORD=dev
export SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=...
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
cargo run -p grail-server
```
