Drop in PDFs, Office files, code, images, audio, or video. OpenIntelligence reads
them, builds a private searchable index, and answers questions about them with
citations you can tap and check.

The app icon includes light and dark appearances, so it follows the device's appearance setting.

**It runs on your device.** Ingestion, indexing, retrieval, ranking, and
verification are all local. Nothing is uploaded to make search work. There is no
account, no server of mine, and no third-party AI service anywhere in the path.

On iOS and macOS 27+, you can optionally allow Apple **Private Cloud Compute** to
write the final answer, but only after you have seen how much would be sent
and why. Every answer carries a badge showing where it actually ran, read
from an execution receipt rather than from what was requested.

## Why it exists

Most document AI asks you to upload your files somewhere first. If those files
are medical, legal, financial, or simply yours, that is the whole problem.

This is a bet that a genuinely good retrieval engine fits on an iPhone, and that
an answer is more trustworthy when you can see what it was built from.

## What it does

| | |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Reads real documents** | PDFs with tables and figures, Office files, code, plain text, images, audio, and video. Pages, Numbers and Keynote are not readable and must be exported first. Vision handles OCR when a PDF's text layer is unreliable. |
| **Searches two ways at once** | Meaning-based vector search and keyword BM25 run together, then fuse and re-rank. Hunting a part number and asking a conceptual question both work. |
| **Shows its work** | A live pipeline view names each stage as it runs, and every claim links back to the excerpt behind it. |
| **Explains its own vocabulary** | Every figure it shows defines itself where it sits, in a plain register and a technical one. Tapping `38 TOPS` says what the number is, and says that it is a per-chip rating rather than a measurement. |
| **Answers offline** | Airplane mode included. |

### Quality modes

**Standard** answers in one pass — best for lookups and direct questions. It is
the only mode with a measured accuracy baseline: **0.410 exact-match across 83
cases drawn from 40 real research papers** (QASPER), local-only.

> **Withdrawn 2026-08-21.** This previously read "80% across 20 ground-truthed
> cases with zero hallucinations". That figure came from a synthetic corpus
> written alongside its own questions, from a run now flagged in
> `BenchmarkRuns/PROGRESSION.md` as averaging 7 seconds per case, below the
> threshold at which generation almost certainly did not execute. The replacement
> is a harder external set and a worse number. See
> [How OpenIntelligence Works, section 08](Docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md).

**Deep Think** runs 4–8 sequential reasoning sessions over rotating context
windows, passing compressed findings forward before synthesising. It stops early
once it stops learning.

**Maximum** lifts the session ceiling for questions that span a whole library.

> Neither Deep Think nor Maximum has a score against `Benchmarks/rag_eval_v1.jsonl`
> yet. Their reasoning chain was broken until mid-2026, so the question this
> architecture exists to answer — *does more compute buy more correctness?* —
> is still open. Please don't cite a Deep Think accuracy figure; none has been measured.

## How it works

```
Import    →  extract → chunk → embed → index (vectors + full-text)

Question  →  expand → hybrid search → fuse → re-rank → diversify
          →  expand to parent sections → pack context → answer → verify
```

Dense vector similarity and BM25 keyword matching run in parallel, merge through
Reciprocal Rank Fusion, get re-ranked by a cross-encoder, then pass through MMR
so the context is diverse rather than five phrasings of one paragraph. Answers
face verification gates that check the response is genuinely grounded in the
retrieved text before you see it.

Measured on a physical A18 Pro: **27 tokens/sec on-device**, **86 tokens/sec on
PCC**, time-to-first-token 2.2–3.2s. The PCC figure was measured from an Xcode 27
build, which is what App Store builds have been since 5.2.

### Routing, and what the badge means

The model picker is a policy, not a hint:

- **On-Device** never uses PCC. Not for planning, not for synthesis.
- **PCC** requests Private Cloud Compute, with a declared local fallback if a gate or quota blocks it. Since 5.2 the App Store build carries the PCC paths compiled in, so the fallback is taken only when an entitlement, availability, quota, network or consent gate actually blocks the route.
- **Hybrid** decides per query, based on the evidence actually retrieved.

Cloud consent is requested only for a real, finalised evidence envelope — never
at launch, never speculatively. Retrieval and verification stay local regardless
of which model writes the answer.

There is no separately selectable "3B" or "20B" on-device model here, because the
public SDK exposes no such selector. Apple's larger on-device model is real and
managed by the OS; no app can choose or observe it.

## Documentation

The engineering docs are unusually detailed, and label every claim with how it
was verified — source-read, build-checked, test-covered, or confirmed on a
physical device. Where something is unproven, it says so.

**If you are reading one thing, read this:** [How OpenIntelligence Works](Docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md). Every stage of both pipelines in order, with the reason each one exists and what breaks without it. Written at two levels, plain English and technical, side by side.

**Start here for everything else:** [Documentation Atlas](Docs/README.md)

**Architecture**
- [System Architecture](Docs/OPENINTELLIGENCE_ARCHITECTURE_ATLAS.md) — import-time and query-time pipelines
- [Retrieval Pipeline](Docs/RETRIEVAL_PIPELINE.md) — hybrid search, RRF, re-ranking
- [Ingestion Pipeline](Docs/INGESTION_PIPELINE.md) — semantic chunking, OCR fallbacks, metadata
- [Privacy & Routing](Docs/PRIVACY_AND_ROUTING.md) — local-first guarantees and the routing protocol

**Apple platform specifics**
- [Apple Foundation Models](Docs/Engineering/APPLE_MODELS.md) — token budgets, guided generation
- [Apple Document Intelligence](Docs/Engineering/APPLE_DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE.md) — Vision, PDFKit, Speech
- [Private Cloud Compute](Docs/Engineering/PRIVATE_CLOUD_COMPUTE.md) — enclave constraints, native integration

**Honest limits**
- [Hard Limits](Docs/Engineering/HARD_LIMITS.md) — token boundaries, model caps, memory ceilings
- [Limitations](Docs/LIMITATIONS.md) — what is slow, what is missing, what is unverified
- [Evaluation Framework](Docs/EVALS.md) — how accuracy is measured
- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) · [User-facing changelog](Docs/USER_CHANGELOG.md) · [Roadmap](Docs/ROADMAP.md)

**Contributing agents:** [RepoOS Command Center](Docs/RepoOS/00_REPO_COMMAND_CENTER.md) routes
repository work through canonical evidence, safe edit boundaries, and required tests.

## Building

**Requirements:** macOS 26 or later with Xcode 26+, iOS 26.0 deployment target,
Apple Silicon (M1+ / A17 Pro+) for usable Neural Engine throughput. Xcode 27 is
needed for the iOS/macOS 27 paths — Core AI embeddings and native Private Cloud
Compute — which compile out below that SDK.

```bash
# iCloud sets extended attributes that break codesign — clear them first
/usr/bin/xattr -cr .

# Simulator smoke build
./scripts/build_simulator_smoke.sh

# Quality-mode benchmark matrix, 20 cases per mode
python3 scripts/run_quality_matrix.py --app <path to the built OpenIntelligence.app>

# Guard against iCloud conflict copies before any signing work
./scripts/check_icloud_conflicts.sh
```

The benchmark denies PCC by default so runs reproduce offline, and reports
`Measured` separately from `Unmeasured` rather than scoring an empty run as a
failure.

> This repository lives in iCloud Drive, so builds need a `-derivedDataPath`
> outside `~/Documents`, and `.git` is redirected through `.git.nosync`.

## Large documents

500+ page PDFs go through a streamed, batched ingestion pipeline with page-level
checkpointing, so a long import survives memory pressure and app restarts instead
of starting over.

## Status

Shipping on the App Store for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. **5.4 is live on both platforms**, released
2026-09-24 from build 478. Developed against a
[public roadmap](https://gunzino.notion.site/OpenIntelligence-Public-Roadmap-e4446012bb8940e6b78a745aee688075)
synced from the same database the work is planned in.

**Private Cloud Compute shipped in 5.2**, live on both platforms since 2026-09-10, and execution is
confirmed on a physical device. The release pipeline enforces the claim rather than trusting it:
every archive is checked with `nm -u` for `PrivateCloudCompute` symbols, against a live
`SystemLanguageModel` count as a control so a dead binary cannot pass the gate vacuously. The
version stamped on the archive decides which way the gate points: below 5.2 any PCC symbol fails the
build, from 5.2 zero PCC symbols fails it, so the binary cannot silently contradict this page in
either direction. Edge cases, quota exhaustion, mid-stream network transitions and background
consent, are still unverified and tracked as open items rather than quietly assumed.

Releases are produced by **Xcode Cloud**, never from the maintainer's Mac. This is not a
preference. That Mac runs a beta macOS, every local archive stamps a prerelease
`BuildMachineOSBuild` into `Info.plist`, and App Store *ingestion* rejects that with ITMS-90111 even
though `altool --validate-app` returns VERIFY SUCCEEDED and processing reaches `VALID`. Validation
is not ingestion. Xcode Cloud builds on Apple's released images, so the stamp comes out clean.

That is also where the toolchain question above is settled. Xcode Cloud runs one workflow,
`Default`, pinned to the **Xcode 27 release**, build `27A266a`, on macOS `Latest Release`, with two
archive actions. Xcode 27 ships Swift 6.4, which compiles the `#if compiler(>=6.4)` sites in,
and `ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh` fails in seconds if a 5.2-or-later version ever meets a Swift
earlier than 6.4 runner.

GitHub Actions ran releases for one stretch in August 2026, as a fallback after the free Xcode Cloud
allowance ran out, and was retired on 2026-08-28 once paid Xcode Cloud capacity was in place. Its
workflow no longer exists.
