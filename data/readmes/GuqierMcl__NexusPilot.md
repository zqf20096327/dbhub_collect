**NexusPilot** is a multi-database workbench for developers and data teams. Its agent works from real connection state, engine-native objects, and data results to explore different data models in natural language and act through controlled workbench tools. It is built on **Tauri v2**, **React 19**, and **Rust**, with a local **AI Runtime** sidecar powered by **Bun + Elysia + the Vercel AI SDK**.

---

## ✨ Core Capabilities

- **Natural-language data agent** — use Ask, Query, and Agent modes to describe data questions or multi-step tasks in natural language. The agent works from real connection state, engine-native objects, and data results to query, explore, explain, and operate on data according to each source's capabilities.
- **Controlled agent tool execution** — the agent uses data sources through restricted workbench tools instead of opening hidden connections outside the application. Every operation is checked against driver capabilities, resource type, and risk level; SQL and Redis writes currently use risk analysis and approval flows, with strong confirmation for high-risk actions.
- **Multi-source connections and object exploration** — manage relational, key-value, and analytics sources in one connection tree, with more data models designed to fit the same capability system. Each engine exposes its own object hierarchy and available operations instead of being forced into one table abstraction.
- **Engine-aware query and operation workspaces** — use interaction surfaces adapted to each source. Current workflows include context-aware query editing, multi-statement results, saved queries, and Redis Key, typed-value, and TTL operations; new sources can add native workflows without pretending to be SQL or tables.
- **Data inspection and safe mutations** — inspect content through views appropriate to the current resource. Reading, filtering, paging, and mutation entry points follow source and resource capabilities; supported writes use previews, stable identity, preconditions, or transactions to reduce accidental and concurrent overwrites.
- **Engine-native object management** — inspect and manage the objects and structures each source actually owns. Current relational drivers provide table inspection, structured design, and DDL previews, while ClickHouse adds native workflows for databases, tables, views, projections, and data-skipping indexes.
- **Bring-your-own models with a local AI Runtime** — manage providers, models, and credentials in the local AI Runtime, synchronize the models.dev catalog, and configure custom OpenAI-compatible providers. The agent reuses workbench connections through a controlled bridge; the frontend never stores LLM credentials, and the workbench remains usable without AI.
- **End-to-end encrypted device sync** — use NexusPilot Cloud to synchronize saved connections and folders across authorized devices, with device authorization, conflict handling, and Recovery Key recovery. Cloud stores ciphertext rather than plaintext credentials, while the local workbench and AI Runtime remain independently usable.

## 🗄️ Supported Databases

| Database | Data model | AI tool integration | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PostgreSQL** | Relational | ✅ Integrated | ✅ Supported |
| **MySQL** | Relational | ✅ Integrated | ✅ Supported |
| **SQLite** | Relational | ✅ Integrated | ✅ Supported |
| **Redis** | Key-value | ✅ Integrated | ✅ Supported |
| **ClickHouse** | Columnar analytics | ✅ Integrated | ✅ Supported |
| **Oracle** | Relational | ✅ Integrated | ✅ Supported |

> This matrix describes the public availability of connection drivers; it does not imply identical operations across database engines. “AI tool integration” means the AI Runtime can use the driver’s currently registered connection, object, or data tools through the workbench connection runtime—not that every read, write, or management operation is enabled. Exact capabilities depend on the engine, server version, connection permissions, and runtime capability model.

## 📦 Installation

Download the latest installer from the [official release page](https://nexuspilot.dev/releases).

| Platform | Package |
|---|---|
| Windows (x86_64) | NSIS installer (`.exe`) |
| macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon) | `.dmg` / `.app` |
| Linux (x86_64) | `.deb` / `.rpm` |

## 🚀 Quick Start (development)

Prerequisites: **Bun ≥ 1.3** (required — not pnpm/npm/yarn) and a **Rust toolchain**.

```bash
bun install

bun run dev:all         # desktop app + AI Runtime together
# or individually
bun run tauri dev       # Tauri desktop app (Vite on port 1420)
bun run ai-runtime:dev  # local AI Runtime sidecar (port 8787)
```

### Verify before submitting

```bash
bun run tsc --noEmit        # frontend type-check
bun run ai-runtime:test     # AI Runtime tests
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- --check
cargo clippy --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- -D warnings
```

## 🧱 Architecture

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 19 · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS v4 · shadcn/ui |
| Desktop shell | Tauri v2 |
| Backend | Rust · SQLite (metadata) · sqlx / redis / clickhouse drivers |
| AI Runtime | Bun · Elysia · Vercel AI SDK (local sidecar) |
| State | Zustand · TanStack Query · React Router |

```text
Frontend (React)
  ├─ Workbench UI ── Tauri IPC ──► Rust backend ──► database drivers
  └─ Agent UI ── /v1/runs · /health · /v1/events ──► AI Runtime ── AI SDK ──► LLM APIs

Rust backend ── WebSocket Bridge ◄──► AI Runtime (tool execution)
```

The **AI Runtime** is a local sidecar that owns provider/model configuration, run execution, history, and live events. LLM credentials never leave it, and AI database tools execute through the same Rust connection runtime your UI uses.

Optional **NexusPilot Cloud** connection sync is a separate, commercial service. It is not required for local database connections, queries, or the AI Runtime.

> Keep your Recovery Key safe. If all authorized devices and the Recovery Key are lost, encrypted Cloud sync assets cannot be recovered.

## 🤖 AI Providers

NexusPilot uses a bring-your-own-provider model. Configure a supported provider and model in the local AI Runtime, then provide credentials through the app's provider settings.

- The AI Runtime automatically synchronizes the provider and model catalog from [models.dev](https://models.dev), caches the metadata locally, and refreshes it in the background.
- If the remote catalog is temporarily unavailable, the last usable local catalog remains available; custom providers and models can also be configured when needed.
- LLM credentials are managed by the local AI Runtime and are not stored in the frontend.
- AI requests are sent to the provider selected by you and may incur provider usage costs.
- Database tools operate through the workbench connection runtime and use explicit capability and approval boundaries for changes.
- You can use the database workbench without enabling AI features or NexusPilot Cloud.
