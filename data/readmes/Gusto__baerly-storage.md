# baerly-storage

**A database with no server. No daemon. No database runtime. Just your app and a bucket.**

A document database that lives _in_ an S3/R2 bucket you already own. No new vendor to clear, nothing resident to keep running, and an API small enough for an open-weights LLM to zero-shot.

```text
before: client → app handler → database server  (a server)
after:  client → app handler → S3/R2 bucket     (just storage)
```

The trick is to cram the entire database execution layer inside an HTTP
request. There is no server, daemon, or coordinator: each read or
write runs as library code inside your request handler, the bucket
holds the data, and the protocol supplies the commit rules.

The load-bearing operation is narrow — one conditional create of the next
log object commits a write. When the request ends, baerly-storage is gone. Poof!

- **An API small enough to hold in your context.** No DDL, no raw SQL —
  8 verbs and a ~12k-token surface you can hand to an LLM or a
  non-engineer and walk away.
- **Idle rounds to zero.** No database process to keep warm, and no
  per-app database floor across a fleet of small internal tools.
- **No data hostage.** `baerly export --target=postgres` gives you a
  per-collection SQL snapshot. Crossing the envelope is the graduation
  signal; the data exit is mechanical.
- **No new vendor.** Your S3/R2 bucket cleared security review years
  ago; every hosted alternative means a fresh vendor review and an IT
  ticket for a new managed-DB SKU.
- **Nothing to go down.** No resident service in your critical path, one
  fewer failure domain. Servers that don't exist can't go down.
- **Built like git.** Content-addressed snapshots, immutable numbered log
  entries, and one conditional log create as the commit, per collection.

## Quick start

```sh
pnpm create @gusto/baerly-storage@latest
```

The wizard asks for a project name, target, and starter, then prints the
dev command. First run needs no bucket credentials: local dev uses local
storage and serves the UI plus `/v1/*` from one origin.

For a runnable multi-tab demo see
[`examples/react-node/`](./examples/react-node); for the full set of
production-shaped scaffolds see [`examples/`](./examples).

## In code

The public surface is a small document API. The scaffolds wire `db` on
the server and `useQuery` in React; the calls look like this:

```ts
// server — writes land in your object-storage bucket
await db.collection("tickets").insert({ title: "Onboard Alex", status: "open" });

// client — reactive over your trusted handler, across every open tab
const open = useQuery((c) => c.collection("tickets").where({ status: "open" }).all(), []);
// open.status → "loading" | "refreshing" | "ok" | "skipped" | "error"
// open.data is present for "ok" / "refreshing"
```

Application auth and tenant choice stay explicit in the handler. What
disappears is the database service and its surrounding machinery:

```diff
- docker-compose.yml
- init.sql
- prisma/schema.prisma
- migrations/0001_initial.sql
- RLS policies
- DATABASE_URL secret
- connection pool (pgbouncer)
- pager rotation
-
+ // baerly.config.ts
+ export default defineConfig({
+   app: "tickets",
+   tenant: "main",
+   collections: { tickets: {} },
+   target: "cloudflare",
+   auth: "none", // dev; production supplies a verifier
+ });
```

Ordinary schema shape changes are TypeScript or config edits — no DDL, no
SQL strings, no generated migration ceremony.

## Cheat sheet

```ts
// reads — Collection or, after a modifier, Query
db.collection("tickets").get(id); // by id
db.collection("tickets").where({ status: "open" }).all();
db.collection("tickets")
  .where((q) => q.gte("count", 1))
  .count();

// writes — by id on Collection, bulk on Query
db.collection("tickets").insert({ status: "open", title: "ship it" });
db.collection("tickets").update(id, { status: "closed" }); // merge-patch
db.collection("tickets").where({ status: "closed" }).delete();
```

## How it works

**The hard part of a database-in-a-bucket is the commit.** A bucket can
store objects; it cannot run a transaction coordinator. So one writer must
win each race, and every reader must be able to tell what won. [S3's strong consistency][s3-strong] makes object
storage usable as shared state; conditional writes supply the
one-writer-wins operation.

Concretely, a write drops new immutable objects in the bucket and then
creates the next numbered log entry for that collection with
create-if-absent (`If-None-Match: "*"`). Two writers racing the same slot
cannot both win; the loser reads the winner and retries at the next slot.
That create _is_ the commit. There is no resident coordinator: each
request reads bucket state, tries that create, and leaves no required
process behind. A read follows `current.json` to the snapshot and folds
the committed log tail into rows.

baerly-storage shares the immutable-artifact foundation of table formats
like Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake, but commits with a narrower step: no
metadata-pointer swap and no separate coordinator — just that one log
create. See [prior art and lineage](docs/spec/prior-art.md) for how it
relates to Iceberg, Delta Lake, Litestream, and Turbopuffer.

Each collection has its own ordered log, so **writes are per-collection
linearizable** — the `If-None-Match` log create linearizes every commit.
Cross-collection writes are unordered and non-atomic; that boundary is
part of the contract (see [When (not) to use it](#when-not-to-use-it)).

The durable contract is the bucket layout plus the conditional-write
rules. Another language could speak it by writing the same layout and
honoring the same rules. See
[`storage-compatibility.md`](./docs/spec/storage-compatibility.md).

### Security model

Bucket credentials never leave the server. Browsers talk only to your
trusted handler, which authenticates the caller, chooses the tenant
prefix, and applies the protocol against the bucket. Production recipes
support Cloudflare Access and JWKS bearer verification; shared-secret
auth is for service-to-service calls and dev. See
[`client-auth.md`](./docs/guide/client-auth.md).

## When (not) to use it

Before you count rows or price reads, ask one question:

> Can the app's most important work be done from one collection?

If yes, baerly-storage may fit; then check query shape, atomicity, size,
and cost. A todo list, a single board's kanban, an event's RSVPs, one
channel's chat — each maps to one collection. The shape is narrow on
purpose: production-shaped for small workloads with a specific access
pattern, not a general-purpose database. If the core screen is a view
_across_ many collections, users, or tenants ("my pull requests," "all
code search," a cross-org dashboard), baerly-storage
should not be the only query engine for it.

It is **deliberately not** a few things:

- **No SQL, no joins.** Equality + dotted-path predicates, operators
  added one at a time. The small surface is part of the contract.
- **Not a D1 / Postgres replacement.** Those are graduation targets, not
  competitors — baerly-storage keeps the experiment cheap until you know
  whether it's worth graduating.
- **Browser-direct multi-writer is out.** Trusted server-side app code is
  the design center.
- **Realtime is long-poll first.** Polling is always correct; a WebSocket
  tier would be a future opt-in.

None of these are apologies — baerly-storage names its envelope so
graduation is a feature, not a surprise: `baerly export
--target=postgres` makes the exit mechanical.
The shape test lives in
[workload-fit.md](./docs/about/workload-fit.md); the numeric envelope in
[graduation.md](./docs/about/graduation.md).
