# Mino — your own AI agent

Mino remembers what matters, uses tools to get work done, and turns repeatable work into verified workflows that run on schedule.

It is a single Go binary with a local SQLite state file. Conversations, memory, playbooks, schedules, costs, and the audit trail stay under your control.

Mino is built for more than chat:

- remember decisions and facts across conversations
- give the agent real tools with explicit boundaries
- teach a task once and run it reliably every day
- receive completed work through the dashboard or Telegram
- use cloud, OAuth, OpenRouter, or local models

## Quickstart

**No Go, no dependencies — just download and run:**

```bash
# Linux (x86-64)
curl -L https://github.com/H4fizWasabie/mino-agent/releases/latest/download/mino-linux-amd64 -o mino
chmod +x mino
./mino

# macOS (Apple Silicon)
curl -L https://github.com/H4fizWasabie/mino-agent/releases/latest/download/mino-darwin-arm64 -o mino
chmod +x mino
./mino

# macOS (Intel)
curl -L https://github.com/H4fizWasabie/mino-agent/releases/latest/download/mino-darwin-amd64 -o mino
chmod +x mino
./mino
```

Windows: download `mino-windows-amd64.exe` from the [releases page](https://github.com/H4fizWasabie/mino-agent/releases/latest), rename to `mino.exe`, run in terminal.

**Or build from source (needs Go 1.25+):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/H4fizWasabie/mino-agent.git
cd mino-agent
go build -o mino .
./mino
```

Browser opens → fill one form → done. No build tags, no CGo, no system dependencies.

**Want it available everywhere?**

```bash
sudo cp mino /usr/local/bin/
mino
```

See `.env.example` for a copy-paste template.

## Providers

Mino works with any OpenAI-compatible API. Configure via the dashboard or `~/.mino/providers.json`:

### API key

```json
{
  "providers": [
    {
      "name": "my-provider",
      "priority": 1,
      "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
      "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
      "small_model": "gpt-4o-mini"
    }
  ]
}
```

Set the key in the dashboard onboarding form, or write to `~/.mino/auth.json`:

```json
{
  "my-provider": {
    "type": "api_key",
    "key": "sk-..."
  }
}
```

For OpenRouter, use the OpenRouter base URL and model slug. The optional
`:provider` suffix pins a discount provider route (e.g.
`deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731:deepinfra`); the `provider_routing` list
forces the same set. By default Mino never falls back outside that list
(`allow_fallbacks: true` opts into arbitrary hosts — keep it off for
privacy-safe routing).

Optional `transport` field declares the wire family explicitly — `openai`
(default), `anthropic`, or `codex` — it is never guessed from the URL. The
Codex OAuth login writes it automatically.

```json
{
  "providers": [
    {
      "name": "openrouter",
      "priority": 1,
      "base_url": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
      "api_key_env": "MINO_OPENROUTER_KEY",
      "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731:deepinfra",
      "small_model": "deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731:deepinfra",
      "provider_routing": ["DeepInfra"],
      "small_provider_routing": ["DeepInfra"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### OAuth (no API key needed)

Mino ships with OAuth configs for Claude, Codex (ChatGPT), GitHub Copilot, and xAI/Grok. Login from the Settings page — no API key required.

### Local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM)

```json
{
  "providers": [
    {
      "name": "ollama",
      "priority": 1,
      "base_url": "http://localhost:11434/v1",
      "api_key_env": "",
      "model": "llama3.1:8b",
      "small_model": "llama3.1:8b"
    }
  ]
}
```

Empty `api_key_env` means no auth. Works with any OpenAI-compatible local server.

## Recommended installs

Mino runs with none of these, but a few helper binaries make it noticeably better:

| Tool | What it does | Install |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **rtk** (Token Killer) | The `bash` tool rewrites noisy commands (`ls`, `cat`, `git log`…) through RTK to shrink tool output — fewer tokens, cheaper turns | Debian/Ubuntu: `curl -fsSL https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk/releases/download/v0.43.0/rtk_0.43.0-1_amd64.deb -o rtk.deb && sudo dpkg -i rtk.deb` — other platforms from the [releases page](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk/releases) |
| **markitdown** | URL fetch pipes HTML through markitdown for clean Markdown (tables, headings, links) instead of stripped plain text; the fileingest extension uses it too | `pip install markitdown` (make sure `markitdown` is on `PATH`) |
| **composio** | Hosted MCP gateway: Gmail, Google Drive, Slack and many more services become `MCP_composio_*` tools — no local install, just a key | Get a key at composio.dev, then drop the config below into `~/.mino/mcp.d/` |

```json
{"name": "composio", "url": "https://connect.composio.dev/mcp", "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer ck_..."}}
```

All three degrade gracefully — Mino works without them, but noisy commands and web pages eat more tokens.

### Host privileges (optional)

To let Mino manage host state itself (install packages, write native service definitions, restart its own
service — the `install_package` / `write_unit` / `restart_service` tools), install the sudoers
command whitelist once, as root: `sudo MINO_HOME=/home/mino/.mino mino setup-privileges`.
On Linux this grants the mino user exactly six command shapes as root (apt-get install/remove -y,
systemctl restart/daemon-reload, `install -o root -g root -m 0644` from `~/.mino/tmp` to
/etc/systemd/system, `rm -f /etc/systemd/system/*`) — never a shell, never ALL. macOS uses
unprivileged Homebrew and per-user launchd; Windows uses native package/service commands. Without
the Linux whitelist, privileged tools refuse every op with a clear boundary message, and `bash`
refuses `sudo` outright.

> **Platform note:** Mino's core tools run natively on Linux, macOS, and Windows (issue #233).
> Package installation, native service definition, service discovery/restart, shell execution,
> browser opening, system checks, and update restart use the host's native commands. Existing
> raw systemd content remains a Linux-only compatibility mode; new calls should use the neutral
> service definition fields. Windows native service files currently support executable, arguments,
> and restart policy; environment and working-directory fields are rejected explicitly until a
> safe native mapping is added.

## A task failed — now what?

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `(stopped after N iterations: ...)` | The turn stalled or reached the hard 60-iteration ceiling | Check the stated reason and checkpoint, then send `continue`; `MINO_MAX_ITERATIONS` is the base budget and useful progress may extend it automatically. Repeated work gets a self-repair prompt after two identical call/result outcomes |
| Reply cuts off mid-sentence, or Mino repeats itself | `MINO_MAX_TOKENS` too small for the output | Raise `MINO_MAX_TOKENS` (16384 works well) |
| Mino forgets earlier context in long chats | `MINO_MAX_HISTORY_TURNS` too low | Raise it — 10 is a good ceiling |
| Tool errors, wrong results, or a tool that exists but is never used | Missing helper binary, or the model needs a clearer instruction | Install rtk/markitdown above; check the dashboard traces page or `MINO_HOME/traces/` and `MINO_HOME/audit.jsonl`, then retry with a more specific instruction |
| Playbook run failed | A stage didn't write its declared outputs, hit the stage iteration cap, or reported a contract deviation | Look in `MINO_HOME/playbooks/<name>/runs/<timestamp>/stages/`, `MINO_HOME/traces/`, and `MINO_HOME/audit.jsonl` for the stage evidence, then ask Mino to "check the playbook run" |

When in doubt: retry with a clearer instruction, check the provider key still works, and check `mino update` for a newer build.

## Power tuning

The defaults are deliberately conservative. If tasks keep hitting limits, raise these in your environment. The reference VPS deployment runs `MINO_MAX_ITERATIONS=30`, `MINO_CONTEXT_CHARS=1000000`, and `MINO_MAX_HISTORY_TURNS=10`.

| Env | Default | What it limits | When to raise |
|-----|---------|----------------|---------------|
| `MINO_MAX_ITERATIONS` | 25 | Base tool-call budget per turn; useful progress can extend a turn to the hard 60-iteration ceiling | Long tasks that are still making progress extend automatically; stalled turns stop earlier |
| `MINO_MAX_TOKENS` | 16384 | Output tokens per model call | Replies truncate or the model stalls |
| `MINO_CONTEXT_CHARS` | 100000 | Context window budget for history + tool output | Long sessions or playbooks lose early context |
| `MINO_MAX_HISTORY_TURNS` | 5 | Conversation turns kept in context | Mino forgets earlier turns in long chats |
| `MINO_BASH_TIMEOUT` | 2m | `bash` tool runs | Slow commands time out |
| `MINO_CODING_TIMEOUT` | 2m | Coding tool runs | Big repos time out |
| `MINO_SYNC_TIMEOUT` | 5m | File syncs | Large file transfers time out |

Playbook stages retain their stage contracts and run under the same hard 60-iteration harness ceiling — if a run burns through it, the fix is usually in the playbook's stage contract, not the env.

dashboard_universe.go— universe graph topology (Living Field)
telegram.go          — Telegram bot gateway (threaded section-split delivery)
mcp.go               — MCP bridge (stdio + HTTP servers)
skill.go             — skill loader (SKILL.md files)
extensions.go        — HTTP extension protocol
playbook.go          — playbook management, capture_playbook (teach → compile), scheduling
playbook_workspace.go— playbook run engine: durable runs, write-attributed verification, retry policy
post_mortem.go       — failure-evidence extraction for failed runs (CTX-017)
audit_playbook.go    — design-time contract risk-flags (CTX-018)
adapters.go          — working memory and patterns
reminder.go          — persistent one-time reminders with Telegram delivery
db.go                — SQLite schema and migrations (tool-catalog FTS5, schema v9+; legacy semantic-memory tables retired #407)
config.go            — environment variable → Settings
update.go            — self-update from GitHub releases (the only production deploy path; see docs/emergency-deploy.md for the manual lane)
deploy.sh            — VPS bootstrap only (user, oauth, units, DB backup); never pushes binaries
```

Playbooks are filesystem workspaces with `stages/NN-name/CONTEXT.md` contracts
(`Inputs`, `Process`, `Tools`, `Outputs`). The recommended way to author one is
**capture_playbook**: run a task once, then compile it into a playbook from the
audit evidence — real tool calls, real outputs, nothing improvised. Each run
gets an isolated workspace with verified outputs: a stage only passes when its
declared outputs were written by that stage's own tool calls. Each LLM stage
adds its declared capabilities to the normal tool surface; those declarations
guide the model but do not remove its always-available or sliding tools. The
attempt mechanically flags undeclared output targets or verification failures
to the trace, audit log, and owner outbox without blocking execution. Read-only stages retry on failure; destructive stages fail
loud and never double-execute. Calling `run_playbook` advances a run one
stage at a time — verify what's in progress, hand back the next stage's
contract — whether triggered from chat or fired by a schedule with a
synthetic instruction and no owner present.
Playbooks are autonomous-only — if a task needs the owner mid-way, it is a
conversation, not a playbook. See [docs/playbooks-design.md](docs/playbooks-design.md).

## Free AI stack

Mino can run entirely on free tiers:

- **LLM**: Any free model via OpenRouter or OpenCode Zen
- **Image gen**: Cloudflare Workers AI (free tier, ~10k images/day) with [Pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai) fallback (free, no key)
- **Web search**: Tavily (free tier: 1000 searches/month)
- **URL fetch**: pipes HTML through readability extraction

## Extensions

External tools connect via HTTP. Create `~/.mino/extensions.json`:

```json
[
  {"name": "my-tool", "url": "http://localhost:9100"}
]
```

Mino discovers tools via `GET /tools` and proxies calls via `POST /execute`.

### cost-watch — the price guardian

Mino watches its own wallet. Fetches the OpenRouter endpoints price catalogue
hourly (model-agnostic — derived from your own `providers.json`, persisted to
`cost-catalogue.json`), and a `--check` timer pages Telegram when a
promotional price expires. **Alert-only by policy (REL-01): it pages the
owner — it never changes the brain.** Ask mino *"how much am I paying?"* and
it answers with live prices via `system_check`'s cost block or
`cost_watch_status` / `cost_watch_check` / `cost_watch_refresh`.
Install: see `extensions/cost-watch/README.md`.

### minowrap — universal tool adapter

Add any CLI command as a tool in one JSON line:

```json
[
  {"name": "disk_usage", "description": "Show disk usage for a path", "run": "df -h {path}"},
  {"name": "deploy", "description": "Deploy the app", "run": "curl -X POST https://api.example.com/deploy"}
]
```

Template args like `{path}` auto-generate JSON Schema. Mino discovers them on next `reload_plugins` call.

## MCP servers

Drop JSON configs in `~/.mino/mcp.d/`:

```json
{"name": "fs", "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/dir"]}
```

Tools are prefixed as `MCP_<server>_<tool>`.

### mino-memory — expose the graph to any agent

Build from `extensions/mino-memory` and register:

```json
{"name": "mino-memory", "command": "/path/to/mino-memory"}
```

Exposes `memory_remember` (identical output to the in-loop `remember` tool:
intent-ranking, BFS expansion, provenance and conflict flags) and
`memory_path`. Read-only bridge to the dashboard's `/api/memory/remember`,
localhost-bound — any external agent gets the same retrieval quality as mino
itself, no memory-file scraping.
