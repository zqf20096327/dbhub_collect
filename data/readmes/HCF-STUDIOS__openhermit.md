# OpenHermit

**Agents, but operable.**

Open-source platform for deploying fleets of AI agents as production services — durable state, sandboxed execution, managed at scale, and the channels you already use.

Built by [**Amiko**](https://heyamiko.com) — an agent-agnostic infrastructure platform for the AI era.

## Why OpenHermit

Most CLI-based agents (Claude Code, OpenClaw, Hermes, …) keep their state in files: memories as markdown, sessions as JSONL, skills as folders, secrets as dotfiles. That's perfect for one human at one machine — but it falls apart the moment you stop being one human. Running an internal agent platform for your team, a SaaS where every customer gets their own agent, or a swarm of specialized roles? Files scatter, secrets leak, fleet operations turn into SSH-and-pray.

OpenHermit makes one core design choice: **separate internal state from external state.**

- **Internal state** — sessions, memories, instructions, skills, MCP servers, schedules, secrets, users — lives in shared **PostgreSQL**, scoped by `agent_id`.
- **External state** — the workspace files an agent is currently working on — lives in a per-agent **sandbox**. Pick the backend that fits your deployment: a self-hosted Docker container, or a cloud sandbox provider like [E2B](https://e2b.dev) or [Daytona](https://www.daytona.io).

Once internal state is centralized, fleet operations become trivial:

```bash
hermit skills enable standup-digest --all                       # roll a skill out to every agent
hermit mcp enable mcp_github --all                              # add an MCP server to every agent
hermit instructions append rules "Never share PII." --all       # push a rule to every agent
hermit config secrets set OPENROUTER_API_KEY sk-... --agent main  # rotate a secret
```

## Features

- 🚪 **Gateway control plane** — single Hono server. Agents start, attach, detach without orchestration. Admin UI at `/admin/`.
- 🐘 **Postgres-backed state** — sessions, memories, instructions, skills, MCP, schedules, secrets — durable behind Drizzle.
- 🐳 **Sandboxed execution** — per-agent sandbox: self-hosted Docker, E2B, or Daytona. Code runs isolated from the gateway, with the same exec interface across backends.
- 💬 **Channels included** — Telegram, Discord, Slack adapters, package-installed Signal / WeChat / WhatsApp, plus CLI and Web UI. Enable, disable, reconfigure at runtime.
- 🛠 **Skills & MCP servers** — install centrally, enable per-agent or fleet-wide, audit from one place.
- ⏱ **Schedules & automation** — cron and one-shot jobs with timeout, concurrency policy, and error backoff.
- 👥 **Multi-user with roles** — owner / user / guest. Identity reconciliation across CLI, web, and channels.
- 🔌 **Multi-protocol transport** — HTTP sync, inline SSE streaming, durable SSE, WebSocket RPC.
- 🔬 **Deep Research** — durable, session-attached research runs: an LLM-drafted plan you review and approve, a bounded search/read/extract loop with hard budgets, and a final report whose every finding cites server-verified evidence excerpts. Pause, refine, resume; runs survive restarts. Requires a configured web provider (Tavily or Exa recommended; the default Defuddle provider works but scrapes Google results). Current limitations: HTML/text sources only (PDFs are reported as unsupported), web-only sources (no uploaded files or MCP yet), manual resume after an unclean restart. **Note: research runs are model-intensive — see [cost and model selection](#deep-research-cost-and-model-selection) before your first run.** Design: [Deep Research Design](docs/deep-research-design.md).

---

## Deep Research: cost and model selection

A research run is a pipeline of model calls — planner, per-iteration action
decisions, one evidence extraction per source read (these are the big ones:
each carries up to a 200 KB page snapshot ≈ 50k input tokens), and synthesis.
Budgets are hard caps per depth; typical runs land well under them, but plan
for the worst case:

| Depth | Model calls | Input tokens | Output tokens | e.g. gpt-5-mini | e.g. gemini-3-flash | e.g. claude-sonnet-4-5 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `quick` | ≤ 22 | ≤ 250k | ≤ 40k | ~$0.14 | ~$0.25 | ~$1.35 |
| `standard` | ≤ 40 | ≤ 500k | ≤ 80k | ~$0.29 | ~$0.49 | ~$2.70 |
| `thorough` | ≤ 72 | ≤ 900k | ≤ 120k | ~$0.47 | ~$0.81 | ~$4.50 |

Dollar figures are worst-case at list prices. Search costs are separate but
small (Tavily's free tier of ~1,000 credits/month easily covers testing).

**Free model tiers are usually not enough.** The binding constraint is
per-minute/per-day token quotas, not intelligence — a single extraction call
can be ~50k input tokens, which blows through e.g. Google AI Studio's free
tier mid-run (you'll see a 429 quota error surfaced on the run). Use a paid
key, or a topped-up OpenRouter account (~$5 covers many standard runs).

**What a model needs to handle research well:** disciplined JSON output
(every phase is validated, with one repair attempt), a context window of
64k+ tokens for extraction, and `model.max_tokens` of at least ~16k so long
extraction/synthesis answers don't truncate. Suggested configurations
(verified registry ids; prices per Mtok in/out):

| Provider / model | Price | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `openai` / `gpt-5-mini` | $0.25 / $2 | Best price/reliability balance for research phases |
| `google` / `gemini-3-flash-preview` | $0.50 / $3 | Fast; needs a **paid-tier** key; keep `thinking low` |
| `anthropic` / `claude-haiku-4-5` | $1 / $5 | Very reliable JSON discipline |
| `anthropic` / `claude-sonnet-4-5` | $3 / $15 | Highest report quality; use for runs that matter |
| `openrouter` / `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1` | $0.15 / $0.75 | Cheapest credible option; 32k context is tight for big pages |

Set with:

```bash
hermit config set model.provider openai
hermit config set model.model gpt-5-mini
hermit config set model.max_tokens 16384
hermit config secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY sk-...
```

### Local models (no subscription)

Any OpenAI-compatible local server works — Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp
`--server`, vLLM — via a custom endpoint:

```bash
# Ollama example. Research needs long context: raise it from Ollama's default.
OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=65536 ollama serve   # in another terminal: ollama pull qwen3:32b

hermit config set model.provider ollama
hermit config set model.model qwen3:32b
hermit config set model.base_url http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1
hermit config set model.api openai-completions
hermit config set model.max_tokens 16384
hermit config secrets set OLLAMA_API_KEY ollama   # any non-empty value; local servers ignore it
```

Honest expectations for local runs:

- **Model size matters.** The phases demand strict JSON against non-trivial
  schemas. 27B+ models (`qwen3:32b`, `gemma3:27b`, `llama3.3:70b`) are
  workable; 7–8B models fail validation often enough to be frustrating even
  with the built-in repair attempt and advisory-field tolerance.
- **Context is the hard requirement.** Extraction feeds up to ~50k tokens of
  page snapshot; with a small context window the page gets cut and evidence
  quality drops. Configure 64k+ (`OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH`, `--ctx-size`, …).
- **Time adds up.** A quick-depth run is ~15–25 sequential-ish calls, several
  with huge prompts. On CPU-only or modest-GPU hardware expect a run to take
  an hour or more where a hosted model takes minutes.
- Web search is unaffected — pair a local model with Tavily's free tier (or
  the keyless default provider) for a fully subscription-free setup.

## Architecture

![Architecture](docs/assets/openhermit-architecture-diagram.png)

- **Admin** — CLI + Web UI for deploying and operating agents.
- **Client** — Web and CLI for end-users to chat with agents.
- **Channels** — Telegram, Discord, Slack, and package-installed adapters such as Signal, WeChat, and WhatsApp wired into any agent.
- **Gateway** — API, auth, routing, agent lifecycle, schedules.
- **Agent** — Model loop, tools / skills / MCP, sandboxed workspace (Docker / E2B / Daytona).
- **Storage** — PostgreSQL for every kind of internal state.

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g openhermit
```

This installs both `hermit` and `openhermit`.

For local development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HCF-S/openhermit.git
cd openhermit
npm install
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Configure DATABASE_URL, GATEWAY_ADMIN_TOKEN, GATEWAY_JWT_SECRET.
hermit setup

# Start the gateway and the end-user web app.
hermit gateway start
hermit web start

# Check platform health.
hermit status
hermit doctor

# Create and start an agent.
hermit agents create main
hermit agents start main

# Chat through the CLI.
hermit chat --agent main
```

The gateway defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:4000` and serves the admin UI at `/admin/`. The end-user web app runs on `http://127.0.0.1:4310`.

## API Overview

Agent execution routes are exposed under `/api/agents/{agentId}`:

- `POST /api/agents/{id}/sessions`
- `GET /api/agents/{id}/sessions`
- `POST /api/agents/{id}/sessions/{sessionId}/messages`
- `POST /api/agents/{id}/sessions/{sessionId}/messages?wait=true`
- `POST /api/agents/{id}/sessions/{sessionId}/messages?stream=true`
- `GET /api/agents/{id}/sessions/{sessionId}/events`
- `POST /api/agents/{id}/sessions/{sessionId}/approve`
- `POST /api/agents/{id}/sessions/{sessionId}/checkpoint`
- `DELETE /api/agents/{id}/sessions/{sessionId}`
- `ws://host/api/agents/{id}/ws`

Admin and owner-facing management endpoints live under `/api/admin/...` and `/api/agents/{agentId}/...`. Channel webhooks land at `POST /api/agents/{id}/channels/{namespace}/webhook`.

See [docs/transport-protocol.md](docs/transport-protocol.md), [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md), [docs/mcp-servers.md](docs/mcp-servers.md), and [docs/channel-adapter.md](docs/channel-adapter.md).

## Internal State

All durable internal state is scoped by `agent_id` where applicable:

| Store | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| Agents | Registered agents, runtime config, security policy, workspace dirs |
| Sessions | Metadata, status, participants, working memory, descriptions |
| Session events | User, assistant, tool, error, channel, and introspection events |
| Memories | Long-term memory with PostgreSQL FTS plus ILIKE fallback |
| Instructions | Agent identity, behavior, and rules included in prompts |
| Users | Users, identities, roles, and merge links |
| Sandboxes | Per-agent sandbox rows (docker / e2b / daytona) with lifecycle and runtime state |
| Skills | Skill library and per-agent/global assignments |
| MCP servers | External MCP server definitions and assignments |
| Channels | Built-in and external channel rows with encrypted tokens |
| Channel credentials | Encrypted channel-owned auth state such as WhatsApp Web / Baileys credentials |
| Secrets | Per-agent provider/integration secrets, encrypted at rest |
| Schedules | Cron/once jobs and run history |

Secrets and channel-owned credentials are encrypted with `OPENHERMIT_SECRETS_KEY` (AES-256-GCM); without that key the gateway falls back to per-agent `secrets.json` for local dev secrets, but DB-backed channel credentials are unavailable. The only per-agent files on disk are the workspace at `~/.openhermit/workspaces/{agentId}/`; enabled skills are synced into each backend's own `<agent_home>/.openhermit/skills/system/` (bind-mounted for docker, uploaded via SDK for e2b/daytona).

## Development

```bash
npm run dev:gateway          # Gateway and admin UI API at http://127.0.0.1:4000
npm run dev:web              # End-user web app at http://127.0.0.1:4310
npm run dev:cli              # CLI from source
npm run dev:studio           # Drizzle Studio for the configured database
npm run typecheck            # Type-check all workspaces
npm test                     # Build and run test suites
```

Important environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `DATABASE_URL_TEST` | Test PostgreSQL connection string used by `npm test` |
| `GATEWAY_ADMIN_TOKEN` | Bearer token for admin APIs and CLI management |
| `GATEWAY_JWT_SECRET` | JWT signing secret for user/device tokens |
| `GATEWAY_HOST` | Gateway listen host, default `127.0.0.1` |
| `GATEWAY_PORT` / `PORT` | Gateway port, default `4000` |
| `OPENHERMIT_SECRETS_KEY` | AES-256-GCM key used to encrypt `agent_secrets` and channel tokens at rest |
| `OPENHERMIT_TOKEN` | CLI token, usually the admin token |
| `OPENHERMIT_GATEWAY_URL` | Gateway URL, default `http://127.0.0.1:4000` |
| `OPENHERMIT_AGENT_ID` | Default CLI agent ID, default `main` |
| `OPENHERMIT_WEB_PORT` | End-user web app port, default `4310` |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` / `AWS_REGION` | Standard AWS credential chain — used when `attachments.storage.provider = s3` |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL (e.g. `https://xyz.supabase.co`) — required when `attachments.storage.provider = supabase`. Treated as part of the credential bundle since it embeds the project ID |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` or `OPENHERMIT_ATTACHMENT_SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` | Supabase secret API key (`sb_secret_…`) — required when `attachments.storage.provider = supabase`. Never stored in gateway config. The legacy service-role JWT still works. (`OPENHERMIT_ATTACHMENT_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` is deprecated) |

### Attachment storage backends

The gateway supports three storage providers. The provider is selected in the gateway config (DB-backed, edited via the admin UI at `/admin/config` — JSON tab — or seeded from `gateway.json` on first boot), and **credentials live in env, not config** — only secrets go in env; non-secret pointers (provider, bucket, region, prefix, endpoint, root) live in the gateway config.

#### Local disk (default)

No config block needed; defaults to `~/.openhermit/attachments`. To override the root, set this under `attachments.storage`:

```json
{
  "attachments": { "storage": { "provider": "local", "root": "/srv/openhermit/attachments" } }
}
```

#### S3 (or any S3-compatible service: R2, MinIO, B2)

Install the SDK on the gateway: `npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`. Credentials come from the AWS default chain (env vars / IAM role / IRSA).

```json
{
  "attachments": {
    "storage": {
      "provider": "s3",
      "bucket": "oh-attachments",
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "prefix": "prod",
      "endpoint": "https://abc.r2.cloudflarestorage.com",
      "forcePathStyle": false
    }
  }
}
```

#### Supabase Storage

Install the SDK on the gateway: `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`. Set `SUPABASE_URL` and a Supabase secret API key (`sb_secret_…`) in env as `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (or `OPENHERMIT_ATTACHMENT_SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`) — the project URL embeds the project ID and is treated as part of the credential bundle. The legacy service-role JWT still works; the older `OPENHERMIT_ATTACHMENT_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` var is deprecated.

```json
{
  "attachments": {
    "storage": {
      "provider": "supabase",
      "bucket": "attachments",
      "prefix": "agents"
    }
  }
}
```

Optional `attachments.limits.maxBytes` overrides the default 25 MB cap. Every successful upload is materialized into the sandbox; if the sandbox is down the row is marked `failed` and `attachment_fetch` re-materializes on first read.

## About Amiko

OpenHermit is the open-source agent infrastructure layer of [**Amiko**](https://heyamiko.com) — an agent-agnostic platform that integrates identity, productivity, social, and economic infrastructure into one coherent system where humans and AI agents coexist.

Amiko is organized around four connected layers:

- **Identity** — persistent, evolving user representation that powers personalization across all agents
- **Productivity** — agent capability integration across tools, services, and environments
- **Social** — 24/7 social continuity through AI twins, personality-driven matching, and agent-curated feeds
- **Economy** — native wallet infrastructure, token utility, and agent-mediated value exchange

OpenHermit provides the production runtime that makes this possible: durable state, sandboxed execution, multi-channel delivery, fleet management, and the access policy system that governs how agents act on behalf of users.

Amiko is agent-agnostic by design — bring your own agent or create one on the platform. Both paths lead to the same social graph, the same identity layer, and the same economic rails.

Learn more at [heyamiko.com](https://heyamiko.com).
