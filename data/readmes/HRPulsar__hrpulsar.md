## Quick Start

### Self-Hosted (Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HRPulsar/hrpulsar.git
cd hrpulsar
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set JWT_SECRET, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, and an email provider
# (SMTP_* or RESEND_API_KEY) — sign-up confirmation links arrive by email
docker compose -f docker-compose.self-hosted.yml up -d --build
```

Open http://localhost and create your account. See the
[Self-Hosted Deployment Guide](docs/SELF_HOSTED.md) for details.

### Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HRPulsar/hrpulsar.git
cd hrpulsar
docker compose up -d          # Start PostgreSQL + Redis
make install-dev               # Install dependencies
make migrate                   # Run database migrations
make run                       # Start backend (8100) + frontend (3100)
```

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | Python 3.14+ / FastAPI |
| Frontend | Next.js 16 / React 19 / TypeScript |
| Database | PostgreSQL 17 + pgvector |
| Cache | Redis 7 |
| AI/ML | Direct SDKs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini) + pgvector |
| UI | shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS |
| Deploy | Docker Compose (self-hosted) |

## API Documentation

After starting the backend, visit http://localhost:8100/api/docs (development) for interactive Swagger UI. In the self-hosted Docker setup, Swagger is served through the reverse proxy at http://localhost/api/docs.
