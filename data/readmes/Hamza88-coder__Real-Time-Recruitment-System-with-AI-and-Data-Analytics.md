# Real-Time Recruitment System with AI and Data Analytics

## Overview

In this project, we simulate job offers and CVs using **Llama** to generate synthetic data, which is sent to **Kafka** for real-time processing. Afterward, **Ray** is used for classification of CVs, job offers, and other data. The data is then processed by **Spark** to extract information in JSON format, which is saved in **Delta Tables** for further analysis in **Databricks**. 

From Databricks, the data is moved to **Snowflake** for storage and transformation with **dbt**. **Pinecone** and **Redis** are utilized for data indexing and caching, respectively, while a **Flask** server is set up for machine learning model deployment. Additionally, the system is integrated with a chatbot based on **FISS**.

We also have a segmentation process, where data flows from **Postgres** to **Spark** and finally to **Tableau** for visualization.


# Dataset Simulation

- **Job Offers**: Leveraged web scraping on platforms like LinkedIn and other job boards to collect data on job postings. This includes job titles, companies, locations, descriptions, requirements, and more.

- **CV Data**: Incorporated a pre-existing database of CVs containing information such as names, skills, professional experiences, educational backgrounds, and languages.

- **Offer Simulation**: Generated simulated job offers using Llama (via the Groq API), enriching the dataset with synthetic postings tailored to various industries and locations.

- **Machine Learning Model Deployment and User Interface**:
  - **[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)**: Provides the system's user interface where users can upload a CV and receive job offers recommendations, or upload a job offer and receive candidate recommendations. It also allows users to interact with the CVs of recommended candidates through a chatbot.

- **Data Segmentation**:
  - **[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)**: Used for storing data before segmentation.
  - **[Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)**: Handles data segmentation of candidate profiles.
  - **[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/)**: Visualizes the segmented data for insights from the data warehouse.
  - **[Apache NiFi](https://nifi.apache.org/)**: Orchestrates and automates the segmentation process, ensuring smooth data flow and transformation.

- **Chatbot Integration**: 
  - **[FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)**: A vector database that allows recruiters to interact with and discuss candidate CVs recommended by the system.

- **Programming Language**: 
  - **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**: The primary language used for the development and deployment of the system.

# Dashboards Created by Analyzing Our Data Warehouse

This project includes several interactive dashboards created by analyzing data extracted from our Data Warehouse. Each dashboard presents key insights based on the collected and processed data.

## Dashboard 1: Job offers distribution by city

## Notes and Suggestions
## Integration of Ray for Stream Classification (Offer/CV or Other)

We have integrated Ray into the architecture for stream classification, aiming to differentiate between offer/CV streams and other types. However, this approach has not been fully implemented at this stage.

For a production-ready solution, if we want to connect our system to a job portal, it is essential to have a dedicated component responsible for stream classification. This component would ensure that streams are processed and classified accurately, enabling smooth interaction with external systems.
