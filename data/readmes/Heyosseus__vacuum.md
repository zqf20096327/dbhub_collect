![Vacuum — a PostgreSQL monitoring and tuning dashboard for Laravel](art/hero.png)

**A PostgreSQL monitoring dashboard for Laravel — and a schema linter for the pipeline that ships it.**

Vacuum reads what PostgreSQL already knows about itself — `pg_stat_user_tables`, `pg_stat_user_indexes`, `pg_stat_activity`, `pg_stat_database`, `pg_stat_statements`, `pg_class` — and turns it into a page that says what is wrong, what it is costing you, and the statement that would put it right.

It shows you that statement. It never runs it.

**It does not need a production database to be useful.** `vacuum:lint` reads the catalog rather than the statistics, so it has something to say against the empty Postgres container your test job already starts: a foreign key with no index behind it, a primary key that stops accepting rows at two billion, a table nothing can address a single row of. One line in the workflow you already have —

```yaml
- run: php artisan vacuum:lint --format=github
```

— and the finding arrives as an annotation on the pull request that introduced it, on the line that introduced it. See [Linting the schema](#linting-the-schema).

> **Status: 1.2.0.** The public API is frozen — see [What semver covers](#what-semver-covers). A breaking change to the rule contracts, `Finding`, the value objects, the configuration keys or the `--format=json` documents now requires a major version.

## Quick start

```bash
composer require heyosseus/vacuum
php artisan vacuum:install
```

Then open `/vacuum`. That is all of it: the installer publishes the config and asks one question, and everything Vacuum reads is already being kept by the server.

![How Vacuum works: six catalogs PostgreSQL maintains, thirteen rules, and a finding carrying the statement that fixes it](art/how-it-works.png)

Already running a Filament panel? `php artisan vacuum:install --filament` puts the same data inside it — see [Inside Filament](#inside-filament).

**In a pipeline there are two commands, and they answer different questions.** `vacuum:check` runs the full advisor against a database that has been *running* — see [In your pipeline](#in-your-pipeline). `vacuum:lint` runs against one that has only been *migrated*, which is what a test job actually has — see [Linting the schema](#linting-the-schema). The first belongs on a schedule against staging; the second belongs in `require-dev`, on every push.

## What it tells you

| Rule | Finds |
| --- | --- |
| `wraparound` | Tables nothing has frozen, on their way to shutting the database down |
| `multixact-wraparound` | The same road, on the other clock: tables whose row locks nothing has frozen |
| `autovacuum-disabled` | A server with autovacuum switched off and left off |
| `dead-tuples` | Tables carrying more deleted-but-unreclaimed rows than they should |
| `stale-statistics` | Tables the planner is reasoning about from numbers that are no longer true |
| `table-bloat` | Tables whose files are much larger than the rows inside them |
| `unused-index` | Large indexes no query has ever read |
| `duplicate-index` | Indexes that are an exact copy of another index on the same table |
| `invalid-index` | Indexes every write maintains and no query is allowed to use |
| `cache-hit-ratio` | A database going to disk more often than it should |
| `idle-in-transaction` | Transactions opened and then abandoned |
| `blocked-session` | Sessions stuck waiting on somebody else's lock |
| `slow-statement` | The shapes of query that cost the most per run |

Every finding carries a severity, what the problem costs you, and — where a single statement would fix it — the SQL to run. Findings roll up into a health score out of 100, which is computed *from the findings themselves*, so the grade can never disagree with the list beneath it.

![The score: 100, minus 25 for unused-index and 15 for cache-hit-ratio, leaves 60 and a grade of D](art/scoring.png)

Most of those rules describe a database that is slower than it could be. `wraparound` describes one that **stops**: PostgreSQL counts transactions in 32 bits, and a table nothing freezes drags the whole cluster toward the end of that count, at which point the server refuses every write until it is shut down and vacuumed in single-user mode. It gives no warning of its own, and it does not slow down first.

PostgreSQL has **two** of those clocks, and either one running out stops the cluster. The second counts *multixacts* — the objects it allocates when more than one transaction holds a lock on the same row at once, which is ordinary on a table with foreign keys pointing at it or one read with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`. It has its own horizon (`autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age`, 400 million by default, twice the transaction one) and autovacuum advances it separately. A table under a lock-heavy workload can therefore be perfectly healthy on `wraparound` and be the table that stops your database. `multixact-wraparound` watches that clock. The remedy is the same `VACUUM (FREEZE, ANALYZE)` — only the seeing had to be added.

## Learn

The advisor tells you what is wrong. **Learn**, at `/learn`, tells you why — using your own tables as the worked example.

Every explainer on the internet already exists. None of them can say *"this is happening in your `orders` table right now"*, and that sentence is the entire point: a lesson that names no table of yours is a blog post and belongs somewhere else.

Thirteen lessons across five tiers. Each renders in four bands — what is going on, what is going on **here**, what to do about it, and a statement to go and run. Band three is a **decision tree**: a lesson that says "it depends" and stops has failed you, so this is what it depends on, with your own tables sorted onto the branch they landed on.

The fillfactor lesson is the sharp example. A poor HOT-update share has two unrelated causes with two unrelated remedies, and they are indistinguishable in the ratio alone — a page with no room left, or an indexed column changing. The tree separates them, so a table whose real problem is an index on `updated_at` is not told to lower its fillfactor, which would not move it an inch.

| Tier | Lessons |
| --- | --- |
| Eloquent & Laravel | `unindexed-foreign-keys`, `n-plus-one`, `soft-deletes`, `framework-tables`, `timestamps-and-hot`, `chunking-large-tables`, `json-columns`, `transactions-and-locks` |
| Storage & MVCC | `row-versions`, `fillfactor` |
| Indexes | `unused-indexes` |
| Maintenance | `dead-tuples` |
| Advanced | `heap-page` |

The Eloquent tier sorts first because it is the on-ramp: you arrive fluent in `$model->update()` and have never heard of a heap, so the first thing you meet is your own ORM, and each lesson there points down into the PostgreSQL material underneath it.

Two of them earn their place immediately. **`unindexed-foreign-keys`** — PostgreSQL indexes a primary key and a unique constraint and creates *nothing* for a foreign key, where MySQL does. So `$table->foreignId('customer_id')->constrained()` leaves every `$customer->delete()` sequentially scanning the child table while holding a lock, and the cost never shows up where you look for it. **`n-plus-one`** is written from the database's side, which nothing else does: the database never sees your loop, it sees one statement executed a hundred thousand times, each one fast. Its signature is an enormous call count with a trivial mean time — which is exactly why every dashboard that ranks by slowest query is structurally blind to it.

Laravel is recognised **in the schema, by convention**: `deleted_at` is what `SoftDeletes` adds, `jobs` and `sessions` are what `artisan` generated, a `jsonb` column is what a cast maps onto. Vacuum never loads your application's classes to find out — a monitoring package that boots the app it monitors can be brought down by a model that throws in its constructor. The lessons say so rather than claiming to have read your model: the catalog can prove a column exists, and cannot prove which trait put it there.

Learn reads the catalog and the statistics views only, needs no extension and no superuser, and is **on by default**. Nothing in it writes — band four hands you a statement, exactly as the dashboard does, and never runs one.

```php
// config/vacuum.php
'learn' => [
    'enabled' => env('VACUUM_LEARN_ENABLED', true),
],
```

## Requirements

- PHP 8.3+
- Laravel 11, 12 or 13
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Filament 4 or 5 — optional, only if you want the UI inside a panel

`pg_stat_statements` is optional. Without it, Vacuum says so on the page rather than quietly showing you an empty panel.

## Installation

```bash
composer require heyosseus/vacuum
php artisan vacuum:install
```

`vacuum:install` publishes the config and asks one question: serve the UI as the standalone Blade dashboard, or inside a Filament panel? Answer Blade (the default) and you are done — open `/vacuum`. Prefer to do it by hand? `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=vacuum-config` and open `/vacuum` is the whole of the Blade path.

### The standalone dashboard

The health grade, and the findings that produced it — worst first, each with the statement that would put it right.

![Vacuum's standalone dashboard: the health grade and the findings that produced it](art/blade-overview.png)

Open any table to see its full profile — size, dead rows, freeze age, how it is read and written, and the findings against it, again worst first.

The built-in SQL console runs every statement inside a read-only transaction that is always rolled back. See [The SQL console](#the-sql-console).

## Inside Filament

If your app already runs a [Filament](https://filamentphp.com) v4 or v5 panel, Vacuum can live inside it rather than at a separate `/vacuum` URL — the same data the Filament way.

**Filament is an optional peer.** The package never requires `filament/filament`; the plugin's classes load only when your app already has it, so nothing changes for a Blade-only install.

```bash
composer require heyosseus/vacuum
php artisan vacuum:install --filament
```

On the Filament path the installer finds your panel provider (`app/Providers/Filament/*PanelProvider.php`) and registers the plugin on it for you. It edits that file by **parsing it, not matching text** — it locates the `return $panel …;` chain with PHP's own tokenizer, backs the file up, splices in the plugin, and runs `php -l` on the result; if anything looks wrong it restores the backup and prints the one line to add by hand instead. It will not silently edit a file it cannot parse, and in a non-interactive shell it prints rather than writes unless you pass `--force`.

The one line it adds:

```php
->plugin(\Heyosseus\Vacuum\Filament\VacuumPlugin::make())
```

Then set the UI mode so the standalone Blade routes stand down and the same data is not reachable by two different doors:

```env
VACUUM_UI=filament
```

Authorization is shared, not duplicated: the plugin's `canAccess()` calls the same [`Vacuum::auth()`](#who-may-look) callback the Blade dashboard uses. One gate governs both.

### What the panel gives you

Everything lands in one **Vacuum** navigation group:

- **Overview** — the health story at a glance: the score and its grade, database vitals (size, table count, cache-hit ratio, live sessions), and charts for findings by severity, the largest tables, and how much index space is read versus never touched. Beneath them, the findings themselves, worst first — each with the statement that would put it right, shown and copied with one click, never run — and a live view of any vacuums PostgreSQL is running at that moment.
- **History** — where the database has been and where it is heading: the health line over time, what is newly wrong, what has cleared, and what is forecast to cross critical. Appears only when history is switched on — see [History over time](#history-over-time).
- **Tables** — a read-only resource over `pg_stat_user_tables` with native Filament sort, search, filter and pagination, and a drill-down carrying the same profile and findings as the Blade table page.
- **Indexes**, **Sessions**, **Statements** — the same read-only treatment over `pg_stat_user_indexes`, `pg_stat_activity` (live, polling) and `pg_stat_statements`. The last hides itself where the extension is not installed.

Every surface asks that one `Vacuum::auth()` callback, and every one opts out of Filament's tenant scoping — the catalogs Vacuum reads belong to the server, not to any one tenant — so the panel is at home in a multi-tenant install rather than throwing on a relationship these read-only models have no reason to carry.

![The Overview page inside a Filament panel: health, database vitals, and charts](art/filament-overview.png)

Beneath those charts sit the findings themselves, worst first, each with the statement that would fix it. The read-only resources over `pg_stat_user_indexes`, `pg_stat_activity` and `pg_stat_statements` come with native Filament sort, search, filter and pagination.

> **The SQL console stays on the Blade UI for now.** It is not yet a Filament page, and `VACUUM_UI=filament` stands the standalone routes down, so if you rely on the console keep the Blade UI until a later release brings it inside the panel.

Flags for scripted installs: `--blade` / `--filament` skip the prompt, `--panel=<name>` picks one panel out of several, `--force` applies the edit without confirming.

## Who may look

**Vacuum opens in `local` and refuses everywhere else.** A forgotten configuration should lock the door, not publish the shape of your database.

To let anyone else in, register a callback — typically in `AppServiceProvider::boot()`:

```php
use Heyosseus\Vacuum\Vacuum;

Vacuum::auth(fn (Request $request) => $request->user()?->isAdmin() === true);
```

This is a callback rather than a Laravel gate on purpose. A gate is skipped entirely for a guest unless its first parameter is nullable, so the `fn ($user) => …` everyone writes would silently deny a developer who is not logged in, on their own laptop, where the dashboard is most useful.

If you authorize on the user, keep session middleware in the stack, or `$request->user()` will be null:

```php
'middleware' => ['web', 'auth'],
```

Vacuum appends its own authorization middleware to whatever you list, so the dashboard cannot be exposed by emptying that array.

## Which database

By default Vacuum inspects your application's default connection, which must be PostgreSQL — it refuses anything else rather than reporting nonsense.

```env
VACUUM_CONNECTION=pgsql_readonly
```

Point that at a role granted `pg_monitor` and nothing else. Vacuum never needs write access, and giving it none is the cheapest safety net you will ever configure.

## In your pipeline

The dashboard only tells you something if somebody opens it. The same rules run from a terminal:

```bash
php artisan vacuum:check
```

It exits **non-zero when the advisor finds something critical**, so a migration that ships a duplicate index fails the build, and a staging database drifting toward wraparound fails the nightly job, whether or not anybody was looking.

![The output of php artisan vacuum:check in a terminal](art/cli-check.png)

```bash
php artisan vacuum:check --fail-on=warning   # critical, warning, info, or never
php artisan vacuum:check --format=json       # score, grade, deductions, findings
```

Two things worth knowing. It **never writes** — the remediation is printed for you to read and decide on, exactly as it is on the page. And if Vacuum is disabled it **fails rather than passing**: a check that goes green because it never looked is worse than no check at all.

## Linting the schema

`vacuum:check` reads what the database has been *doing*, and a pipeline's database
has not done anything. A Postgres container ninety seconds old with the migrations
freshly applied has no dead tuples, no bloat, no freeze age and no statements —
so most of the rules find nothing, and a perfect score on a database nobody has
ever used is exactly the kind of green number this package exists to argue against.

`vacuum:lint` asks the questions that *are* answerable there:

```bash
php artisan vacuum:lint
```

![vacuum:lint in a pipeline: the workflow step on the left, and the finding as an annotation on the pull request diff on the right](art/lint-in-ci.png)

| Rule | Finds |
| --- | --- |
| `unindexed-foreign-key` | Foreign keys PostgreSQL created no index for, which `->constrained()` never does |
| `foreign-key-type-mismatch` | A key referencing a different type, so the index exists and cannot be used |
| `narrow-primary-key` | A primary key too narrow to keep counting -- `integer` or `smallint` -- that stops accepting rows the moment it runs out of values |
| `missing-primary-key` | Tables nothing can address a single row of |
| `unindexed-morphs` | A polymorphic pair with no composite index leading on the type |
| `json-not-jsonb` | `json` where `jsonb` was almost certainly meant |

Every one of them is true the moment `php artisan migrate` finishes, so this belongs
in `require-dev` and in the job that already runs your tests.

It **defaults to failing on a warning**, where `vacuum:check` defaults to critical.
The two commands mean different things by the word: a warning from `check` is a
database drifting, and a build should not go red because bloat grew overnight. A
warning from `lint` is a schema that was wrong the moment somebody typed it.

```bash
php artisan vacuum:lint --fail-on=critical   # critical, warning, info, or never
php artisan vacuum:lint --format=json        # score, grade, deductions, findings
```

Schema findings are scored on their own and are **not** part of the dashboard's
health score. Adding rules to that score would silently re-grade every existing
installation on a `composer update`, and a grade that moves for a reason nobody
asked for is worse than one rule fewer.

### Adopting it on a schema that predates it

Run `vacuum:lint` on a five-year-old application and it will find a great many
things. That is accurate and completely useless: nobody is going to fix four
hundred findings this afternoon, and a build that is red for reasons nobody
intends to act on is a build people learn to ignore.

So write down what is already there, and let the linter tell you only what is new:

```bash
php artisan vacuum:lint --generate-baseline
```

That writes `vacuum-baseline.json`. **Commit it.** From then on the outstanding
findings are excused and anything new fails the build, which is the only question
worth asking of a legacy schema.

A baseline matches on the rule and the subject and on nothing else, so rewording a
rule — or making it more serious in a later release — never invalidates the file
you committed. When an entry stops matching anything, because somebody fixed it,
`vacuum:lint` says so as an `Info` finding rather than quietly carrying it: a
baseline nobody prunes becomes a place the next defect hides.

```bash
php artisan vacuum:lint --no-baseline     # report everything, baseline or not
php artisan vacuum:lint --baseline=path   # somewhere other than the default
```

The score is computed over what is left after suppression, and the count of what was
suppressed is printed with the text output, carried as `suppressed` in the JSON document,
and emitted as a `::notice` for `--format=github`. A number that quietly ignored four
hundred findings would be the kind of green this package exists to argue against —
and the pull request is the one place that number matters most.

### On the pull request

`--format=github` emits GitHub Actions workflow commands, so each finding lands as
an annotation on the diff rather than in a log nobody opens.

```yaml
- run: php artisan vacuum:lint --format=github
```

Findings are traced back to the migration that introduced them by parsing
`database/migrations` with PHP's own tokenizer — the same technique the Filament
installer uses, and with the same refusal to guess. A migration whose table name is
a variable, or that does not parse, yields no anchor; the finding is still
reported, without a file and a line.

**If you have run `php artisan schema:dump --prune`, expect few anchors.** That flag deletes
`database/migrations` after squashing the schema into `database/schema/*.sql`, so the files
that declared your columns are gone and there is nothing left to trace to. Plain
`schema:dump` keeps the migrations and is unaffected. The findings are the same either way;
only the annotations lose their line numbers.

## History over time

Vacuum is point-in-time by default: every page and every `vacuum:check` reads the database as it is this instant. Switch history on and it records a snapshot on a schedule, so it can tell you which way a number is *moving* — bloat that is growing, a freeze age climbing since the last time anything froze it, a cache-hit ratio measured over the last hour rather than over the life of the server.

A forecast is drawn only through the climb since the most recent reset. Both of the numbers worth projecting are sawtooths — `age(relfrozenxid)` falls to nearly nothing every time a table is frozen, bloat falls on every `VACUUM FULL` — and a line fitted across one of those falls describes a future the database does not have. The one direction a wraparound forecast must not err in is the optimistic one.

```env
VACUUM_HISTORY_ENABLED=true
```

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=vacuum-migrations
php artisan migrate
```

Then take a snapshot on a schedule — hourly is a sensible default:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schedule;

Schedule::command('vacuum:snapshot')->hourly();
```

Or let Vacuum register that for you: leave `VACUUM_HISTORY_SCHEDULE` at its default and it schedules the command itself. Set it to `null` when you would rather wire it up by hand.

**This is the package's only write path, and it never touches the database it inspects.** Snapshots are written with ordinary Eloquent to your application's own database — the published migration's tables live there — while the inspected server is still only ever read, read-only, through the same rolled-back transaction everything else uses. Point `VACUUM_HISTORY_CONNECTION` at a different connection to keep the history somewhere else again.

Once two snapshots exist, four things a single reading cannot say become available:

- **Interval-accurate numbers.** `cache-hit-ratio` and `slow-statement` are lifetime averages until history can difference two snapshots; then they report what the database actually did *over the last interval*. That is also what quietly clears the false alarm a one-off `VACUUM FULL` leaves behind in the slow-statement list.
- **Direction.** Each finding is marked climbing, easing or new, so a bloat figure inside its threshold but rising reads differently from the same figure holding steady.
- **A forecast.** For the numbers that only climb — freeze age, table size — Vacuum fits the recent trend and projects when it will cross the line that makes it critical: *wraparound-critical in about nine days at the current rate*. It stays silent unless it has enough snapshots and the points genuinely sit on a line; a guess wearing the clothes of a measurement is worse than nothing.
- **What changed.** The findings that are new since the previous snapshot, and the ones that have cleared.

Inside Filament this is a **History** page in the Vacuum group; on the Blade dashboard it is a **history** tab. Both appear only while history is on. Snapshots older than `VACUUM_HISTORY_RETENTION_DAYS` (90 by default) are pruned as each new one is taken.

## The SQL console

Off by default. Off means the route does not exist — not a page that says no.

```env
VACUUM_CONSOLE_ENABLED=true
```

Statements run inside a transaction PostgreSQL has been told is `READ ONLY`, with a `statement_timeout`, and the transaction is always rolled back.

![Three layers: the keyword check is a courtesy, the read-only transaction is what PostgreSQL enforces, and the role it connects as is what actually bounds it](art/safety.png)

**The keyword check is not what makes this safe.** Vacuum turns away statements that do not begin with a word that reads, but that is a courtesy for people who type `DELETE` by accident. It is not a defence, and it cannot be one:

```sql
WITH written AS (INSERT INTO orders (id) VALUES (1) RETURNING *) SELECT * FROM written
```

That begins with `WITH`, walks straight past any keyword filter, and writes to your database. What stops it is PostgreSQL, which refuses the write inside a read-only transaction. There is a test that smuggles exactly that statement through and then asserts the table is still empty.

**And the read-only transaction is not the whole story either.** It constrains *this backend's* writes through MVCC. It does not constrain a function that opens a second backend, or effects that happen outside MVCC — and all of these begin with `SELECT`:

```sql
SELECT dblink('dbname=app', 'DELETE FROM users');  -- a second backend, not read-only
SELECT pg_read_file('/etc/passwd');                -- reads the server's disk
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid);                  -- kills connections
```

Vacuum refuses those by name, as another courtesy. **What actually bounds the console is the role it connects as** — and with `VACUUM_CONNECTION` unset that is your application's own role, often the owner of everything. If you turn the console on, give it a dedicated role that owns nothing and has those functions revoked. [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) has the grants.

Rows are capped by `VACUUM_CONSOLE_MAX_ROWS` (500), applied by PostgreSQL rather than to the answer: the statement is wrapped in a subquery with a `LIMIT`, so the rows past the cap are never produced. Every statement the console runs is written to the log — who, what, how many rows, how long — and the route is throttled.

`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` really runs the query it explains, so it needs its own switch:

```env
VACUUM_CONSOLE_EXPLAIN_ANALYZE=true
```

### A word on Laravel and read-only transactions

This is worth writing down, because it is not obvious and it silently defeats the naive implementation.

Laravel's `LostConnectionDetector` treats PostgreSQL's `SQLSTATE[25006]` — *cannot execute INSERT in a read-only transaction* — as a **lost connection**. If your read-only transaction is one Laravel does not know about (a raw `BEGIN TRANSACTION READ ONLY`), then `Connection::run()` catches the rejection, decides the connection died, reconnects, and **retries the statement on a fresh connection outside the transaction** — committing the very write PostgreSQL just refused.

Vacuum opens the transaction through Laravel's own `beginTransaction()` and then issues `SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY`. With `transactions >= 1`, Laravel rethrows instead of retrying. That is the entire reason the safety claim above is true rather than merely asserted, and it is covered by a test named `it does not let a rejected write be retried onto a fresh connection`.

## Tuning the thresholds

Every rule reads its limits from `config/vacuum.php`. The defaults are set for a database somebody depends on, not for a table you made a minute ago:

```php
'thresholds' => [
    'dead_tuple_ratio' => 0.20,
    'dead_tuple_minimum' => 1_000,
    'cache_hit_ratio' => 0.99,
    'cache_hit_minimum_blocks' => 100_000,
    'wraparound_xid_age' => 200_000_000,          // match your autovacuum_freeze_max_age
    'wraparound_xid_age_critical' => 1_000_000_000,
    'wraparound_mxid_age' => 400_000_000,         // match your autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age
    'wraparound_mxid_age_critical' => 1_000_000_000,
    'stale_statistics_ratio' => 0.20,             // autoanalyze fires at 0.10
    'stale_statistics_minimum' => 10_000,
    'stale_statistics_minimum_rows' => 1_000,
    'bloat_bytes' => 100 * 1024 * 1024,
    'unused_index_min_size' => 1024 * 1024,
    'long_running_query_seconds' => 60,
    'idle_in_transaction_seconds' => 300,
    'slow_query_milliseconds' => 500,
],
```

## Writing your own rule

A rule is handed one value object and returns a finding or nothing. It never touches the database, so it tests without one:

```php
use Heyosseus\Vacuum\Advisor\{Finding, Severity, TableRule};
use Heyosseus\Vacuum\Values\TableStatistic;

final readonly class NeverAnalyzed implements TableRule
{
    public function inspect(TableStatistic $table): ?Finding
    {
        if ($table->lastAnalyzedAt() !== null) {
            return null;
        }

        return new Finding(
            rule: 'never-analyzed',
            subject: $table->qualifiedName(),
            severity: Severity::Warning,
            summary: 'Nothing has ever analyzed this table, so the planner is guessing.',
            impact: 'Without statistics the planner cannot estimate row counts, and it will choose a bad plan confidently.',

Tag it, and the advisor picks it up:

```php
use Heyosseus\Vacuum\VacuumServiceProvider;

$this->app->tag([NeverAnalyzed::class], VacuumServiceProvider::TABLE_RULES);
```

There is a tag per subject — `TABLE_RULES`, `BLOAT_RULES`, `INDEX_RULES`, `DUPLICATE_RULES`, `CACHE_RULES`, `SESSION_RULES`, `STATEMENT_RULES`, `SETTING_RULES` — because a rule should be given the one thing it reasons about, and adding a rule should never widen what has to be queried before it can run.

## Restyling the dashboard

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=vacuum-views
```

The stylesheet is inlined rather than fetched from a CDN, on the grounds that the dashboard is what you open when the database is unwell, sometimes from a machine that cannot reach the internet.

## What semver covers

From 1.0 — and from 1.1 where a line says so — these are public API and a breaking change to any of them requires a major version:

- **The rule contracts** — `TableRule`, `IndexRule`, `SessionRule`, `StatementRule`, `BloatRule`, `CacheRule`, `DuplicateRule`, `ConfigurationRule`, `SettingRule` (1.0) and `SchemaRule` (1.1) — and the `Inspection` contract behind them.
- **`Finding`, `Severity` and `Grade`**, including `Finding`'s constructor signature. A custom rule constructs one, so its parameters are as public as the interface that returns it.
- **The value objects the contracts hand a rule**: `TableStatistic`, `IndexStatistic`, `Session`, `Statement`, `CacheStatistic`, `Settings` and `Capabilities` (1.0), and `TableSchema` and `IndexDefinition` (1.1).
- **Configuration keys** under `vacuum.*`, and the `VACUUM_*` environment variables that feed them. Keys may be added; existing ones will not change meaning.
- **The `vacuum:check --format=json` and `vacuum:lint --format=json` documents**, which are what a pipeline parses.
- **Route names** (`vacuum.dashboard` and the rest) and the `Vacuum::auth()` gate.
- **The `SCHEMA_RULES` tag** (1.1), alongside the others a custom rule is registered under.
- **The baseline file format** (1.2). It is committed to your repository, which makes it an interface whether or not it is called one. Keys may be added; the `findings` map will not change meaning.
- **`vacuum:lint --format=github`** (1.2) as an accepted value, and its severity mapping. The exact wording of an annotation is not covered.

Explicitly **not** covered, and free to change in a minor release:

- The SQL files under `resources/sql`. They are readable on purpose and they are not an interface — a catalog query is rewritten whenever PostgreSQL gives a better way to ask.
- The Blade views. Publishing them is supported; the markup inside them is not frozen.
- Everything under `Internals` and `Learn`. Both are teaching surfaces, and pinning their shape would freeze the explanation as well as the code.
- Anything marked `@internal`.
- `MigrationMap` and `SourceLocation`, which are console implementation detail rather than something a rule or a pipeline consumes.

Vacuum supports the PostgreSQL major versions the PostgreSQL project still supports, and CI runs the suite against each of them. A major going end-of-life is a minor release here, not a major one.

## Development

Vacuum tests against a real PostgreSQL server. The statistics views it reads are the whole product, and SQLite cannot pretend to have them.

```bash
composer install
cp phpunit.xml.dist phpunit.xml     # then put your database credentials in it
composer test
```

`phpunit.xml` is gitignored, which is where your credentials should live.

`composer test` runs Rector, Pint, PHPStan at `level: max`, 100% type coverage and 100% line coverage. All of them have to pass.

For the `pg_stat_statements` tests, the extension must exist. It needs the library preloaded, which is read at startup:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements';  -- then restart the server
CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
```

Those tests skip themselves if it is missing, though the coverage gate will then fail.
