# hck_GPT

**v2.1.0** · Part of [PC Workman HCK](https://github.com/HuckleR2003/PC_Workman_HCK)

AI diagnostic assistant for Windows system monitoring. Answers natural language questions about your PC — in Polish and English — using real hardware data. No cloud. No API key.

---

## What it does

You ask. It checks your actual hardware. It answers.

```
"Why is my PC slow right now?"
"Is cs2.exe a virus or a normal process?"
"Which game pushes my GPU the hardest?"
"RAM na 91% - co powinienem zamknąć?"
```

82 built-in intents covering hardware diagnostics, performance analysis, process identity,
driver status, gaming analytics, battery, startup programs, and system health.

## How the hybrid engine works

Every message hits the **intent parser** first. Known intents (82 total) go to the **rule engine** — fast, predictable, deterministic, no GPU needed.

Low-confidence or open-ended messages get routed to **Ollama** (local LLM). The engine injects a 6-section system context into the prompt: live CPU/RAM/GPU, today's averages, top processes, temperatures, hardware profile, and conversation history.

Ollama unavailable? 60-second cooldown, graceful fallback. No crashes.

## Intent categories

| Category | Example questions | Count |
|---|---|---|
| Hardware info | "What GPU do I have?", "How much RAM?" | 6 |
| Diagnostics | "Is my PC healthy?", "Check temperatures" | 4 |
| Performance | "Why is it slow?", "Compare today vs yesterday" | 6 |
| Process identity | "Is svchost.exe a virus?" | 3 |
| Gaming | "Can I run Cyberpunk?", "Which game stresses hardware most?" | 5 |
| Startup / drivers | "What starts with Windows?", "Are drivers updated?" | 4 |
| Resource analysis | "Why is RAM high?", "What's the top memory hog?" | 6 |
| Time-travel | "What changed since last week?", "Crash context?" | 7 |
| Battery / power | "How fast is battery draining?" | 4 |
| Small talk | Greetings, thanks, follow-up questions | 4 |
| + more | optimization, security, disk, network, fun | 33 |

## Proactive monitor

Background daemon that watches your system and pushes alerts without being asked:

- CPU sustained >88% for 30s
- RAM critical >93% → HOT strip (red, not chat spam)
- CPU/GPU temperature spikes
- Disk <8 GB free on any drive
- Session uptime >12h reminder
- New heavy process detected

Alerts go to the HOT strip (red) or TIP strip (yellow) depending on severity.
RAM critical never appears as a chat message — only in the dedicated HOT indicator.

---

## Bilingual design

Language detected **per message**, not per session. Mix Polish and English freely.

Polish diacritic normalization via ASCII-fold dual scoring:
`"dzieki"` matches `"dzięki"`, `"wydajnosc"` matches `"wydajność"`.

---

## Dependencies

hck_GPT is designed as part of PC Workman HCK and uses its data pipeline:

| Dependency | Used for |
|---|---|
| `psutil` | Live process list, CPU/RAM/disk |
| `pywin32` (WMI) | CPU model, GPU name, VRAM, mobo, RAM speed |
| `sqlite3` stdlib | User knowledge base, historical stats |
| `tkinter` stdlib | Chat panel UI |
| `requests` optional | Ollama LLM API (local) |

Standalone extraction as a pip-installable library is planned for a future milestone.
