> **Stop debugging the same error twice.** MisakaNet searches 411+ failure lessons so an agent skips the
> bugs someone already paid for, instead of rediscovering them one session at a time.
>
> Agent-native interfaces: [MCP server](https://misakanet.org/mcp) (7 tools), WebMCP (browser
> `navigator.modelContext`), `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt`, and A2A discovery through
> `.well-known/agent-card.json`.

## What is MisakaNet?

**Git-backed failure memory for AI coding agents.** An error shows up → the agent searches the lessons →
it applies a fix somebody already verified → if nothing matches, an intake turns that dead end into a
lesson for the next agent. Every lesson is a Markdown file in this repository: reviewed
like code (each commit DCO-signed), graded by evidence level, retrieved with BM25 over the Python standard
library. No vector database, no embedding model, no server unless you want one.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Lessons** | failure-recovery knowledge base, open and auditable under `lessons/` |
| **Domains** | rag · devops · fanuc · docker · feishu · mcp · network · ci · wsl · windows … |
| **Evidence levels** | E0 intake → E1 CI → E2 merged PR → E3 maintainer → E4 production reuse |

Registry listings ([Glama](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/Ikalus1988/MisakaNet/score),
[Smithery](https://smithery.ai/servers/misakanet/misakanet), MCP Toplist) proxy the hosted endpoint, which
serves 411+ **indexed failure-recovery lessons** — *indexed*, never "verified": evidence level is what says
how much a lesson has been proven.

| MisakaNet is NOT | What it is instead |
|------------------|-------------------|
| ❌ A general-purpose memory system | ✅ Failure-recovery knowledge layer |
| ❌ An Agent runtime or framework | ✅ Searchable lesson database |
| ❌ A vector database or RAG system | ✅ BM25 keyword search (zero deps) |
| ❌ A cloud service requiring signup | ✅ `git clone` → search locally |
| ❌ A skill marketplace | ✅ Debugging knowledge from real sessions |

### Lesson vs Skill

A **skill** teaches an agent *how to do something*. A **lesson** records *what went wrong before, and how
not to fail again*. MisakaNet is only the second thing: not a skill marketplace, not an agent runtime, not
a general memory layer, not a vector database. → [FAQ](FAQ.md)

## Benchmark: how much of a lesson does a model reproduce when handed one?

Weekly benchmark (Cloudflare Workers AI, 2026-08-30). **Read the metric before the numbers** — measured
2026-09-25, the scenario in this benchmark is each lesson's own title, the "matching lesson" injected into the
`with_lesson` arm is *that same lesson*, and the score is `lesson_hit_rate`: **the share of the injected lesson's commands reproduced in the answer**.
No retrieval is called and correctness is not checked, so this is the **recitation** half of RAG, not
evidence that search works:

| Model | Lesson pasted in prompt: not pasted | Lesson pasted in prompt: pasted | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| llama-3.2-3b (light) | 21% of the lesson's commands reproduced | **43%** | **2×** |
| llama-3.3-70b (strong) | 42% | **73%** | **+31%** |

A model repeats more of a document it was handed, and the weaker the model the bigger the relative
difference. That is *necessary* for the product to help and it is not sufficient — the claim "search finds the
right lesson for a failure you described" is measured nowhere yet. Details:
[benchmark-2026-08-30](docs/benchmarks/benchmark-2026-08-30.json) · metric definition: `METRIC_DEFINITION` in
[`scripts/benchmark_workers_ai.py`](scripts/benchmark_workers_ai.py)

→ [Full changelog](CHANGELOG.md) · [Release notes](https://github.com/Ikalus1988/MisakaNet/releases)

**Beware of a single number.** A benchmark is only as good as what it measures, so here is what these mean
and where this design loses:

| Metric | What it measures | Why it matters here |
|---|---|---|
| Hit rate | share of the **injected** lesson's commands reproduced in the answer — a recitation check; the scenario is that lesson's own title and no retrieval happens | it is the ceiling on usefulness, not the measure of it: a corpus can be recitable and still unfindable |
| Gain (with − without) | how much more of that lesson appears when it is pasted in | separates "the model can use a lesson" from "the model guessed the same words" — it says nothing about finding the lesson |
| Cost / latency | tokens and wall-clock per answer | the whole premise is cheaper than re-debugging, so it has to stay cheap |

**Where it loses on purpose:** BM25 matches words, not meaning. A failure described in vocabulary the
corpus has never seen is a miss, and no amount of tuning in the retriever fixes a corpus gap. That is why a
miss returns `no_match` plus an intake call rather than an empty result — the honest answer is "we do not
know this one yet", and it is also the signal that tells maintainers what to write next.

## Why failure-memory?

Agents re-debug the same class of failures in isolation: pip timeouts behind a corporate proxy, DCO on
Windows, SQLite on an NTFS mount, a GitHub 401 after a token rotation, FANUC error codes. The fix usually
already exists in someone's terminal history, and is invisible to everyone else.

Three deliberate engineering choices, each of which trades something:

* **Git is the source of truth.** A lesson is a file, so it diffs, reverts, forks and reviews like code.
  The cost is that search happens over a checkout (or a synced D1 mirror) rather than a live index.
* **Zero dependencies by default.** The retriever is BM25 over the standard library, so the offline path
  runs on an air-gapped box and cannot rot with an embedding model. The cost is recall on paraphrases.
* **Evidence is graded, not asserted.** E0–E4 lets an agent weigh a community intake differently from a
  production-proven fix. The cost is bookkeeping, and most lessons sit at E0–E2.

## How to use it

**Prerequisites:** Node ≥ 18 for the installer (Claude Code and Codex already require Node) **or**
Python ≥ 3.10 for the library and the stdio server. Nothing else.

Supported agents — and what "supported" means per group (evidence levels in
[docs/integrations/status.md](docs/integrations/status.md)):

| Group | Agents | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| Installer-managed | Claude Code · Codex · Hermes · OpenClaw · codewhale · Cursor · Gemini CLI · Copilot CLI · OpenCode · Kiro | `npx @misaka-net/misakanet-setup` writes each client's own MCP config, a rules block where the client has one, and (Claude Code only) a turn-counting hook — the five JSON-file clients (Cursor, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, OpenCode, Kiro) get the MCP entry alone; `--verify` checks whatever was written |
| MCP by hand | Cursor · Gemini CLI · Windsurf · OpenCode · Copilot · DeepSeek Harness | the endpoint is standard MCP over HTTP; add the URL in that client's own config. Cursor also has a rules-file mode |
| Anything else that speaks MCP over HTTP | — | the endpoint is public, reads are anonymous and unmetered |

Pick one channel — they are independent, and none of them needs an account:

| I want… | Command | What it touches |
|---|---|---|
| my assistant to search the lessons | `npx @misaka-net/misakanet-setup` | writes the MCP endpoint into each assistant's own config; optionally a rules block and a hook |
| to call the endpoint myself | the `curl` below | nothing to install |
| the library in my own code | `pip install misakanet-core` | nothing |

**The two-package trap** (this one cost a real install failure, #1849):

| Looks like | Actually is | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `@misaka-net/misakanet-setup` (npm) | the **installer** — has `bin`, no plugin entry | teaching your assistant to search |
| `misakanet` (npm) | the **DSH / Codex plugin** (`index.js`, `SKILL.md`) | `dsh plugin --profile web add misakanet` |
| `misakanet` (PyPI) | ships the stdio **MCP server** | `python3 -m misakanet.server` |
| `misakanet-core` (PyPI) | the **library** (zero-dep BM25) | `from misakanet.search import search_lessons` |

A marketplace error such as `@misaka-net/misakanet-setup: entry file missing: index.js` means the resolver
picked the wrong package — the installer deliberately has no `index.js`.

**One anonymous read — no account, no token, no browser:**

```bash
curl -sS https://misakanet.org/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18' -H 'Origin: https://misakanet.org' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call",
       "params":{"name":"misakanet_search","arguments":{"query":"database is locked","top":3}}}'
```

Reads are unlimited and anonymous — the only limit is a per-address burst window, which is a speed limit,
not a quota. **Registration is for writing**, not for reading: it unlocks `misakanet_write_lesson` and
`misakanet_preflight` and returns a token valid ~30 days
([why](AGENTS.md#33-注册与配额)).

Check the install with `npx @misaka-net/misakanet-setup --verify`, undo it with `--uninstall`, and print a
redacted environment report with `--report` (paste it into a public issue — that is exactly what the
external-validation bounty asks for).

### Use it as a GitHub Action

The same corpus, wired to your CI: when a workflow fails, the action searches the lessons, comments
the closest match on the pull request, and (optionally) reports the new error so someone turns it
into a lesson. Published on [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/misakanet-intake-bot).

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["CI"]                # your CI workflow's name
    types: [completed]
permissions:
  actions: read                      # read the failing job's log (required)
  pull-requests: write               # post the comment
  issues: write                      # the comment endpoint is issues.createComment
jobs:
  intake:
    if: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'failure' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: Ikalus1988/MisakaNet@v1
        with:
          mode: suggest-only         # or suggest-and-intake, to report new errors too

## Contributing

> **Zero bounty. Maximum rigor. Merge earns credit.** Every merged PR proves your agent can survive
> real-world CI gating.

1. Check the checkout works: `python3 scripts/misakanet_cli.py smoke`
2. Search before writing: `python3 search_knowledge.py "your error here"`
3. Found nothing? **[Share your failure lesson →](https://github.com/Ikalus1988/MisakaNet/issues/new?template=lesson-feedback.yml)**
   — a five-line note is enough, no polished PR required. Two places say what is missing, and they measure
   different things: the [demand board](workers/README.md#insights-endpoints-issue-591) aggregates anonymous
   *search* misses (`/api/insights/unsolved-map`; measured 2026-09-25 it held **one** signal in 30 days,
   because the intake path does not feed it — [#2224](https://github.com/Ikalus1988/MisakaNet/issues/2224)),
   and the [open intake issues](https://github.com/Ikalus1988/MisakaNet/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aintake)
   are where the real gaps currently arrive.

## Security

⚠️ **Always sandbox your Agent before executing retrieved commands.** Lessons are community-contributed — review before run.

CI scans all Markdown for dangerous patterns (`rm -rf`, `curl | sh`, backtick injection). See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

See [LIMITATIONS.md](docs/LIMITATIONS.md) for known constraints and non-goals — we believe honest disclosure builds trust.

## Troubleshooting

Most failures already have a documented answer — start from the index, not from this page:

| Symptom | Where |
|---|---|
| DCO sign-off failed · token exposed · pip timeout · `database locked` · Windows/GBK crash · WSL permission denied · FANUC error codes | [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md) — error scene index |
| Known limitations of the test suite | [docs/known-issues.md](docs/known-issues.md) |
| MCP returns 403/405, or a client shows no tools | [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md) · [FAQ.md](FAQ.md) |
| Behind a corporate proxy (Claude Desktop, Cursor, CLI) | [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md#behind-a-corporate-proxy) |

## For Agents & Crawlers

**Prefer MCP intake for missing or stale lessons; PRs are optional.**

Search existing lessons first. If no lesson matches, do not open a PR by default — call the remote MCP tool
`misakanet_submit_intake` at `https://misakanet.org/mcp`. No GitHub account, no email, no Bearer token.
Never send secrets or raw private logs. Full protocol:
[docs/mcp-intake-guide.md](docs/mcp-intake-guide.md).
