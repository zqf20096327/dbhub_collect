## Introduction
Maroik is a modern web application built with ASP.NET Core MVC, featuring a comprehensive set of tools for personal and business management. It includes features such as expense tracking, calendar management, bulletin boards, and role-based user management.

This repository is the open-source portfolio edition of Maroik: the full application source and test suites, a local Docker Compose stack, and a seed database that contains only the default admin and demo accounts. Production deployment scripts, CI/CD pipelines, and production data are not included.

### About the commit history
This repository is a portfolio snapshot of Maroik. The original Maroik repository is private, and its full development history (nearly 4,000 commits) lives there — so the short history on this repository's `main` branch does not reflect how the project was actually built. To see that ongoing activity, check the contribution graph on [IkhyeonJo's GitHub profile](https://github.com/IkhyeonJo).

## Key Features

### 1. Personal Finance Management
- Expense tracking and categorization
- Income recording
- Fixed (recurring) income and expenditure with deposit-day reminders — the next deposit is found across the year end (e.g. 28 Dec → 2 Jan), and a 29 February schedule is skipped in common years
- Amounts are kept exactly to four decimal places (`numeric(20,4)`); a fifth decimal is rejected instead of silently rounded, so an asset's balance always equals the sum of what was recorded against it
- Financial reports and analytics
- Export to Excel — amounts as numeric cells (they sum and sort in Excel), timestamps as `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` in the viewer's time zone

### 2. Calendar and Schedule Management
- Monthly calendar view
- Event creation and management, with a file attachment and inline images per event
- Calendars shared with other users or the public

### 3. Bulletin Board System
- Post creation, editing, and deletion
- Comment system
- File attachments (virus-scanned with ClamAV), downloaded through a separate access-checked POST action and streamed — the post page itself carries only the file's name and size
- Rich-text editor images, embedded in the post when it is viewed
- Search functionality

### 4. User Management
- Role-based access control (Admin/User)
- User profile management, including an avatar
- Session-based authentication
- Password management (registration confirmation, password reset, forced password change)
- E-mail addresses are matched trimmed and case-insensitively at login, password reset and confirmation resend
- Privacy: uploaded avatars and editor images are re-encoded without their metadata (EXIF GPS position, camera model, capture time), after first being turned upright by their EXIF orientation

### 5. Admin Dashboard
- User management — role change, lock/unlock, e-mail confirmation, terms agreement, soft delete/restore, password reset with a forced change at next login; role, lock and delete changes are audit-logged with the acting admin
- Navigation menu management (the menu doubles as the access-control list)
- Account export to Excel without password hashes or registration/reset tokens
- Analytics dashboard

### Error messages
- A refused write shows its actual reason, localized in English and Korean (e.g. "Only zip extension allowed.", "Cannot add a comment to a locked post.", "Role must be Admin, User or Anonymous.").
- A server-side fault (database, file storage) shows "A temporary error occurred. Please try again later." instead of blaming the user's input; the exception is logged once, where it is handled.

## Engineering Highlights
- **DDD + Clean Architecture, enforced by tests.** Dependencies point Website → Service → Domain; NetArchTest rules fail the build when a layer reaches the wrong way, when the domain logs, reads the clock, or builds an error outside `LocalizableError`, and when a project is missing from the solution.
- **Deterministic time.** Domain methods take the current time as a `DateTime utcNow` argument; each use case reads `TimeProvider` once and passes the same instant everywhere, so `Created == Updated` on creation and token expiry is tested at its exact boundaries with `FakeTimeProvider`.
- **Rich domain model.** Value objects (`Email`, `Money`, `CurrencyCode`, `AccountRole`, …) replace primitive strings; admin actions are intent-revealing aggregate operations (`ChangeRole`, `Lock`/`Unlock`, `ForceConfirmEmail`/`RevokeEmailConfirmation`, `AcceptServiceTerms`/`RevokeServiceTerms`, `SoftDelete`/`Restore`, `AdminResetPassword`) instead of a field-overwriting update.
- **Use-case DTOs.** Self-registration, admin account creation and admin account update each have their own request type, so a registration form can never carry a role, lock or confirmation flag.
- **Test-first development.** Every change starts with a failing test, including the log entries it must write; real PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ run in Testcontainers instead of mocks wherever the behaviour depends on them.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- ASP.NET Core MVC 10.0
- PostgreSQL 17
- Entity Framework Core 10.0
- Valkey (Redis-compatible) — session store and Data Protection key ring
- RabbitMQ 4 — outbound e-mail queue consumed by `Maroik.Worker`
- ClamAV — upload scanning in `Maroik.FileStorage`
- Magick.NET — image validation and metadata stripping
- DocumentFormat.OpenXml — Excel export
- Docker
  - Multi-stage builds
  - Container orchestration
  - Environment isolation
- Authentication & Authorization
  - Session Authentication
  - Role-based access control
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

### Frontend
- AdminLTE 3.1.0
- Bootstrap 4.6.0
- jQuery 3.6.0
- HTML5/CSS3
- JavaScript ES2024
- TypeScript 7.0
  - The custom client scripts are authored in TypeScript at `Maroik.Website/TypeScripts/{admin,anonymous,user}/custom/**/site.ts` and compiled 1:1 by `tsc` to `Maroik.Website/wwwroot/**/custom/**/site.js` (no bundler, no Babel — the emitted `.js` is byte-faithful to the original, minus comments and an IIFE wrapper).
  - Compiled under `--strict`; each file is an IIFE-wrapped global script (no `import`/`export`).
  - Scripts keep only DOM wiring, widget init, AJAX transport, and notifications — business logic lives in `Maroik.Core.*` (DDD + Clean Architecture). Client-side rule checks are UX mirrors; the server always re-validates.
  - `wwwroot/**/site.js` is build output and git-ignored. Docker Compose builds generate it in the Dockerfile's Node stage; running the site on the host, or running the client-script tests, needs Node 22 + `npm ci` in `Maroik.Website/`.
  - MSBuild runs `tsc` on `dotnet build` when `node_modules/` is present; Docker builds run it in a dedicated `node:22-alpine` stage.
  - Unit-tested with Vitest + jsdom in `Maroik.Website/TypeScripts.Tests/` (one `*.test.ts` per script, exercising the compiled `site.js`).
  - Details: `Maroik.Website/TypeScripts/README.md`.

```

## Naming Conventions
- Code projects (assemblies, namespaces, types) follow the .NET Framework Design Guidelines for acronym casing: acronyms of three or more letters use PascalCase (e.g. `Ssl`, `Http`), while two-letter acronyms stay uppercase (e.g. `DB`, `IO`).
- Folders that are not code projects — `Maroik.SSL`, `Maroik.DB`, `Maroik.Log` — intentionally keep their existing casing, because docker-compose volume mounts reference them by name.

## Testing
Every source project has a matching `*.Tests` project (xUnit v3 on Microsoft.Testing.Platform), plus the client-script suite and an end-to-end suite. `Maroik.sln` builds them all. Coverage target: line >= 80 %, branch >= 65 %. At the time of writing the suites hold about 4,200 tests (3,323 .NET + 848 Vitest), all passing.

| Tests | What they cover | Needs Docker |

| `Maroik.Core.Domain.Tests`, `Maroik.Core.Contract.Tests` | entities, policies, value objects, DTOs, the layering / package-reference architecture rules | no |
| `Maroik.Core.Service.Tests` | use-case orchestration (mocked repositories) | no |
| `Maroik.Core.Repository.Tests` | EF Core repositories against a real PostgreSQL 17 loaded from `Maroik.DB/.../Debugging/Init.sql` | yes |
| `Maroik.Core.PostgreSQL.Tests` | the EF model against the real schema of the init script (tables, columns, keys, foreign keys, indexes) | yes |
| `Maroik.Core.Client.Tests` | mail (in-process SMTP server), file storage, ClamAV, RabbitMQ publisher and health check (real RabbitMQ) | yes |
| `Maroik.Worker.Tests` | the e-mail consumer and the worker host, against a real RabbitMQ and an SMTP relay | yes |
| `Maroik.FileStorage.Tests` | the file-storage service | no |
| `Maroik.Website.Tests` | controllers, filters, views and start-up through `WebApplicationFactory` against a real PostgreSQL | yes |
| `Maroik.Website/TypeScripts.Tests` | every client script (Vitest + jsdom), run with `npm test` in `Maroik.Website/` | no |
| `Maroik.E2E.Tests` | the running site in a real browser (Playwright) | yes |

```bash
dotnet build Maroik.sln -p:RunClientScriptTests=false
dotnet test --project Maroik.Core.Service.Tests            # any single project
(cd Maroik.Website && npm ci && npm test)                  # client scripts
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 10.0 SDK or later
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Visual Studio (Windows) or JetBrains Rider (Linux/Mac) — optional, for container debugging

### Quick start (Docker Compose)
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.debug.yml up -d --build
```
- Website: https://localhost/ (self-signed certificate — accept the browser warning)
- Mail inbox (Mailpit): http://localhost:8025 — every e-mail the app sends (registration confirmation, password reset) lands here, so no real mail account is needed.

The database is created from `Maroik.DB/PostgreSQL/SQL_Init_Script/Debugging/Init.sql` on the first start. To start over from a clean seed, run `docker compose -f docker-compose.debug.yml down -v`.

### IDE debugging

#### Windows
1. Install Visual Studio
2. Open Maroik.sln
3. Set docker-compose as startup project
4. Press F5 to run in debug mode

#### Linux/Mac
1. Install JetBrains Rider
2. Start debug mode with docker-compose.debug.yml

### Configuration
All local settings live in `.env.debug` (read by `docker-compose.debug.yml`). Every value in it — database and broker passwords, the RSA key pair, the self-signed certificate in `Maroik.SSL/` — is a throwaway default generated for this public repository. **Generate your own before exposing an instance anywhere.** The file documents how to regenerate the RSA key pair.

## Default Accounts

### Admin Account
- ID: admin@maroik.com
