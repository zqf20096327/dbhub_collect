## Tables

All tables link by UFC Stats ID.

| Table                | One row per                      | Keys                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `events`             | event (with its `promotion`)     | `event_id`                        |
| `promotions`         | league (parent, card coverage)   | `promotion`                       |
| `fights`             | fight                            | `fight_id` → `event_id`           |
| `fight_participants` | fighter in a fight (2 per fight) | `fight_id`, `fighter_id`          |
| `round_stats`        | fighter per round                | `fight_id`, `fighter_id`, `round` |
| `fighters`           | fighter (bio + pro record)       | `fighter_id`                      |
| `fighter_aliases`    | spelling of a fighter's name     | `fighter_id`                      |
| `judge_scores`       | judge's score per round          | `fight_id`, `fighter_id`          |
| `odds`               | fighter's betting line per fight | `fight_id`, `fighter_id`          |

Stats that weren't recorded are `NULL`, not `0`. Odds are American and cover 2007 onward:
the opening line and the lowest/highest closing line across sportsbooks. Per-round judge
scores come from official UFC scorecards and cover UFC fights from 2020-08 to 2024-11.

`fight_participants.corner` is red (0) / blue (1) only from 2010-03-21 on. Before that
UFC Stats usually lists the winner first, so don't use corner as a feature for older fights.

To filter by promotion, join through `events`:

```sql
SELECT f.* FROM fights f JOIN events e USING (event_id) WHERE e.promotion = 'PRIDE';
```

## How it updates

A GitHub Action runs daily. It fetches any new events from UFC Stats, reloads the
last 21 days (UFC Stats often posts stats and corrections late), and commits
`data/canon.db` if something changes. A second, weekly Action picks up events UFC Stats
leaves off its events list (Dana White's Contender Series, PRIDE and other promotions).

## The website

`site/` is a static page that loads the whole database into the browser with
[sql.js](https://sql.js.org): fighter search, events, round-by-round fight stats,
leaderboards and a SQL box. `.github/workflows/pages.yml` publishes it to GitHub
Pages (with a gzipped copy of the DB) after every database update.
