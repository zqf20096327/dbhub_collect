  ThimbleDB
</h1>

ThimbleDB is a Cloudflare-first database for small, read-heavy web
applications. Browsers read through an authenticated authority and retain
scope-separated data in memory and encrypted IndexedDB caches. The default
read path returns encrypted immutable objects; deployments can explicitly
enable bounded decoded read bundles for eligible cold point reads and bounded
mutation batches for bursty writes. Writes and key grants use the same small
authority.

Cloudflare Workers and R2 are the reference deployment. Azure Blob Storage,
Amazon S3, and a local filesystem adapter implement the same provider-neutral
ObjectStore contract.

## Architecture

### Identity, session, and client bootstrap

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant User as User
  participant IdP as External OIDC provider
  participant App as Browser application
  participant Client as ThimbleDB client
  participant Cache as Memory + encrypted IndexedDB
  participant Authority as In-app or separate authority
  participant Auth as Private auth store

  User->>IdP: Authenticate with authorization code + PKCE
  IdP-->>App: Short-lived access token
  App->>Authority: Exchange token for opaque session
  Authority->>Authority: Verify signature, issuer, audience, scope, and role
  Authority->>Auth: Map identity and create revocable session
  Authority-->>App: HttpOnly cookie and CSRF token

  App->>Client: createThimbleClient()
  Client->>Authority: GET /api/config
  Authority->>Auth: Reload user and calculate current grants
  Authority-->>Client: Scope, layouts, indexes, generation, and capabilities
  Client->>Authority: GET authorised scope-key grant
  Authority-->>Client: Current and readable historical scope keys
  Client->>Client: Import non-extractable decrypt-only keys
  Client->>Cache: Open authority-and-scope cache namespace
  Client-->>App: Ready typed client
```

1. External OIDC owns credentials, MFA, recovery, and token issuance. Service
   principals use short-lived application tokens through the same exchange.
2. The authority maps the external identity to a stable internal principal,
   stores only an opaque session digest, and recalculates grants on requests.
3. The browser imports authorised scope keys as non-extractable, memory-only
   CryptoKeys. Persistent cache values use a separate device key.

### Read flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Read["Point read or bounded query"] --> HeadCached{"Collection HEAD cached?"}
  HeadCached -- No --> BundleCheck{"Eligible cold point read<br/>and bundle advertised?"}
  HeadCached -- Yes --> HeadFresh{"HEAD inside its TTL?"}
  HeadFresh -- Yes --> Resolve["Resolve referenced index,<br/>snapshot, or trie objects"]
  HeadFresh -- No --> Revalidate["Authenticated HEAD revalidation<br/>with If-None-Match"]
  Revalidate --> HeadResult{"HEAD result"}
  HeadResult -- "304" --> Resolve
  HeadResult -- "Changed" --> DecodeHead
  HeadResult -- "Network unavailable<br/>and cached HEAD usable" --> Resolve
  HeadResult -- "Network unavailable<br/>and no usable cache" --> ReadError["Return explicit read error"]
  Resolve --> ValuesCached{"Required immutable values cached?"}
  ValuesCached -- Yes --> Plan["Validate document or query plan,<br/>predicate, ordering, projection, and limit"]
  ValuesCached -- No --> Objects["Revalidate read grant and return<br/>missing immutable TDB1 objects"]

  BundleCheck -- Yes --> Bundle["Authority revalidates read grant,<br/>reads encrypted HEAD and required objects"]
  Bundle --> BundleLimit{"At most 4 objects and 4 MiB<br/>with authenticated size metadata?"}
  BundleLimit -- Yes --> Decoded["Return decoded cache values<br/>over HTTPS with no-store"]
  BundleLimit -- No --> FetchHead
  BundleCheck -- No --> FetchHead["Revalidate read grant and return<br/>authenticated TDB1 HEAD"]
  FetchHead --> DecodeHead["Browser decodes, decrypts when required,<br/>and validates HEAD within the safety limit"]
  DecodeHead --> CacheHead["Encrypt decoded HEAD with device key<br/>and update the scoped cache"]
  CacheHead --> Resolve
  Objects --> BrowserDecrypt["Browser decodes, decrypts when required,<br/>and validates index, snapshot, or trie objects"]
  BrowserDecrypt --> DecodedLimit{"Decoded object within<br/>configured safety limit?"}
  DecodedLimit -- No --> LimitError["Return explicit decoded-size error"]
  DecodedLimit -- Yes --> DeviceCache
  Decoded --> DeviceCache["Encrypt decoded values with device key<br/>and update the scoped cache"]
  DeviceCache --> Plan
  Plan --> ReadResult["Document, or bounded query result<br/>with point, index, or scan plan"]
```

1. Warm reads stay in the authority-and-scope cache while the mutable HEAD is
   fresh. A successful HEAD fetch or conditional revalidation starts the next
   TTL interval when its response completes. A usable cache can remain
   available during a network failure.
2. Cold point reads can use one
   bounded decoded bundle when explicitly enabled; every ineligible or failed
   bundle falls back to authenticated TDB1 object reads.
3. Queries remain bounded and report a point, index, or scan plan. Explicit
   selected fields can be served from a covering index without full-document
   reads.

### Mutation and cache-synchronisation flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Mutation["Create, replace, delete,<br/>or restore one document"]
  Mutation --> Request["Session + CSRF + exact Origin<br/>scope + layout generation"]
  Request --> Guards{"Operation allowed by maintenance state<br/>and generation current?"}
  Guards -- No --> Reject["Return explicit maintenance<br/>or layout-changed error"]
  Guards -- Yes --> Grant["Reload user and current write or admin grant"]
  Grant --> Authorised{"Authorised?"}
  Authorised -- No --> Deny["Return explicit forbidden response"]
  Authorised -- Yes --> Load["Read current HEAD and affected immutable objects"]
  Load --> Validate["Validate route, ID, document, decoded-object limit,<br/>layout, and complete index configuration"]
  Validate --> Immutable["Create immutable layout<br/>and index objects"]
  Immutable --> Publish["Publish one HEAD with If-Match"]
  Publish --> Conflict{"ETag conflict?"}
  Conflict -- Yes --> Retry{"Bounded retry remains?"}
  Retry -- Yes --> Load
  Retry -- No --> ConflictError["Return explicit conflict"]
  Conflict -- No --> Commit["Return committed cache-value bundle"]
  Commit --> Cache["Update the current scoped cache"]
  Cache --> Tabs["Notify other tabs through BroadcastChannel"]
  Tabs --> Result["Committed mutation result"]
```

1. The authority validates every mutation, creates immutable document and
   index objects, and publishes their references through one conditional HEAD.
2. Successful writes update the current cache and notify other tabs. Logout
   revokes the session and clears the affected browser cache namespace.
3. Administrative purge, scope erase, index rebuild, and layout migration use
   separate guarded endpoints. They do not return the ordinary document
   mutation bundle shown here.

### Deployment, scaling, and storage flow

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  Browser["Browser application"] --> Origin["One public browser origin"]

  subgraph InApp["In-app authority"]
    Combined["Application + ThimbleDB authority<br/>secrets colocated<br/>one release and scaling policy"]
  end

  subgraph Separate["Separate Worker or service"]
    Router["Path router or application gateway"]
    Application["Application assets or server"]
    Authority["ThimbleDB authority + secrets<br/>independent release, limits,<br/>logs, region, and scaling"]
    Router -- "/" --> Application
    Router -- "/api/* and /studio/*" --> Authority
  end

  Origin -- "In-app" --> Combined
  Origin -- "Separate" --> Router

  Combined --> Contract["ObjectStore contract<br/>get + put + delete + list + ETag conditions"]
  Authority --> Contract

  Contract --> R2["Cloudflare R2<br/>private data + auth bindings"]
  Contract --> S3["Amazon S3<br/>private data + auth buckets"]
  Contract --> Azure["Azure Blob Storage<br/>private data + auth containers"]
  Contract --> Local["Local filesystem<br/>two roots, one process"]
```

In-app deployment has the lowest operational floor and scales the application
and authority together. A separate Worker or service isolates credentials,
deployments, failures, observability, regional placement, and runtime scaling.
It does not remove per-collection conditional-write contention or change the
browser API.

The stored object and encryption protocol stays the same across providers.
Only bindings, credentials, and deployment primitives differ. The local
filesystem adapter remains single-process; use shared cloud object storage
before horizontally scaling a Node authority.

## Quick start

Create a local web app:

```powershell
npx thimbledb@latest create my-notes-app
cd my-notes-app
npm run dev
```

Or start from a maintained repository template:

- [Node starter](https://github.com/Jason-Doyle/thimbledb-node-starter)
- [Cloudflare starter](https://github.com/Jason-Doyle/thimbledb-cloudflare-starter)

Or install the package directly:

```powershell
npm install thimbledb
```

Generate the recommended Microsoft Entra delegated scope and application
roles:

```powershell
npx thimbledb generate-entra-roles --out entra-authorization.json
```

Enable the package-owned management frontend on a Node authority:

```ts
await startNodeAuthority({
  studio: true,
  studioOrigin: "https://database.example.com",
});
```

Then open `/studio/`. See [ThimbleDB Studio](docs/STUDIO.md).

The base install includes the browser/core APIs, authentication, Cloudflare
authority, local provider, and Node authority without cloud storage SDKs.
Install only the Node storage adapter your deployment uses:

```powershell
# Azure Blob
npm install @azure/storage-blob

# Amazon S3 or R2 through the S3 API
npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3
```

Use the browser/core API from `thimbledb`, external identity primitives from
`thimbledb/auth`, and the complete endpoint authority from either
`thimbledb/authority/node` or `thimbledb/authority/cloudflare`. Consumers
supply their own domain, storage, OIDC application, and secrets.

The authority can run in-app with the application or as a separate Worker,
container, function, or Node service behind the same public browser origin.
In-app deployment minimises operations. A separate authority isolates secrets,
releases, failures, and scaling. See
[In-app and separate authority deployment](docs/AUTHORITY-DEPLOYMENT.md).

Existing Kubernetes clusters can install the separate Node authority from a
multi-architecture GHCR image and OCI Helm chart. The chart uses non-root,
read-only, capability-free defaults and an existing Secret. See
[Deploy to Kubernetes](docs/DEPLOYMENT-KUBERNETES.md).

After the authority session exists:

```ts
import { createThimbleClient } from "thimbledb";

const db = await createThimbleClient();
const notes = db.collection<Note>("notes");
```

Follow the [full quickstart](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for Cloudflare, Node, and
browser setup. [Implementation prompts](docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PROMPTS.md) provide
copy-paste instructions for coding tools.

Use [Should you use ThimbleDB for a vibe-coded app?](docs/VIBE-CODED-APPS.md)
for an exact fit check before integration. The
[database comparisons](docs/COMPARISONS.md) describe when D1, SQLite,
Firestore, lowdb, or direct object storage is the better choice.

See [Use cases](docs/USE-CASES.md) for workload fit checks and complete guides
for personal workspaces, tenant operations, field use, catalogues, journals,
and structured AI application context.

To run a source checkout:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.

Configure Entra or a generic OIDC provider before signing in. The browser
harness accepts an API access token and exchanges it for a ThimbleDB session.
See [Authentication](docs/AUTHENTICATION.md).

The local provider is intended for development and one Node process. It is not
a multi-process coordination backend.

For the browser harness, sample store, and benchmark commands, see
[Evaluation harness](docs/EVALUATION.md).

## Cloudflare reference deployment

The reference deployment uses:

- one Worker for API routes, static assets, scope authorisation, and key grants
- one R2 binding for writes and maintenance
- one authenticated Worker broker for encrypted browser reads
- the application's Entra or OIDC identity layer

Start with [Deploy to Cloudflare](docs/DEPLOYMENT-CLOUDFLARE.md).

## Performance characteristics

Published evidence includes a 3,808-operation current-layout run from seven
Azure regions against a temporary Cloudflare Worker and R2 bucket:

- `evidence/r2-current-layout-multiregion-2026-09-25.json`
- `evidence/r2-current-layout-summary-2026-09-25.csv`

A separate post-merge write-scaling run retained 1,008 writes and compares the
current bounded scheduler with the historical pre-scheduler matrix:

- `evidence/write-scaling-regional-worker-2026-09-28.json`
- `evidence/write-scaling-regional-worker-2026-09-27.json`
- `evidence/write-scaling-comparison-2026-09-28.csv`

The measurements show:

- snapshots had lower pooled cold point-read p95 than tries at 128, 5,000,
  and 25,000 documents
- trie point reads transferred far fewer bytes but required four sequential
  requests without a bundle
- Trie bundle improved medium and large trie point-read p95, but did not make
  Trie faster than Snapshot overall
- covering indexes kept equality and range queries to two network reads
- large uncovered snapshot queries and trie scans exposed clear rejection
  boundaries
- all single-writer operations succeeded, while simultaneous seven-region
  writes produced failures and very high tail latency for both layouts
- all 14 regional runs rejected a gzip envelope that expanded beyond the
  16 MiB decoded-object limit
- post-merge two-index p50 amplification fell by 48-72 percent relative to
  each run's no-index floor, while current absolute writes still remained
  multi-second
- the post-merge write run retained three R2 internal failures and recorded
  zero CAS retries
- cold reads and large indexed writes remain too slow for latency-sensitive
  request paths; production fit depends on warm browser cache hits dominating
  user activity

The earlier authenticated Chromium evidence remains checked in:

- `evidence/r2-browser-multiregion-trie-2026-09-24.json`
- `evidence/r2-browser-multiregion-snapshot-2026-09-24.json`

These results do not establish better cost or latency than D1, Durable Objects,
Turso, Firestore, or another managed database. See
[Benchmarks](docs/BENCHMARKS.md) for methods, raw artifacts, limitations, and
layout decision thresholds.

## When to use ThimbleDB

ThimbleDB is suited to small per-user or per-tenant datasets, catalogues,
configuration, internal tools, and applications whose hot working set fits in
browser storage.

Choose another database for relational transactions, high-frequency shared
counters, large cross-tenant queries, or strict immediate revocation. Warm
cached reads are fast, but cold object reads and external session creation can
take seconds from distant regions. Design the first-load experience with those
limits in mind.
