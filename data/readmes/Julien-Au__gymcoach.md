> Why GymCoach? It is the only workout tracker you self-host that brings your
> own LLM. Log your training, see your progress, and get a coach that actually
> knows your data: weekly debriefs, a streaming chat, and full programs
> generated from a sentence. Your data stays in your database; the AI runs on

> integration.

## This repo largely maintains itself

GymCoach is also an experiment in autonomous software maintenance: most of its
ongoing changes are made by Claude Code running in **documented loops**, not by a
human typing each one. An agent picks an open issue, writes the change to the repo
conventions, makes it pass a green-gate (lint + typecheck + tests + build), has an
independent agent adversarially review the diff, opens a pull request, and
auto-merges it once CI is green. A human still owns the vision and the hard calls.

The whole playbook is open and reproducible in [`docs/loops/`](docs/loops/): the
pipeline (triage -> implement -> ship -> write-up), the guardrails, and the
[autonomy charter](docs/loops/07-autonomy.md) the agent runs inside. If you care
more about _how a repo can maintain itself_ than about the gym app, start there.

## Features

Everything below ships in the box. At a glance: a fast logger, real progress
analytics, first-class cardio with watch-file import, and an AI coach that runs
on your own key - all self-hosted.

### Log and train

- **Fast set logging** - sets, reps, RIR, warm-ups and drop sets, with shorthand
  quick entry (`100x8@9`) and natural-language entry parsed by the AI.
- **In-logger tools** - a rest timer, a plate-loading calculator, and a warm-up
  ramp calculator, right where you log.
- **Double-progression suggestions** - the next working load is computed from
  your last sets (and explained), with bodyweight-aware tonnage for pull-ups,
  dips, etc.
- **Supersets** - pair exercises in the builder and run them A1/A2 with grouped
  navigation and superset-aware rest.
- **Fix a set without deleting it** - the sets you have already logged stay on
  screen as an editable table, so a mistyped weight, rep count or RIR is
  corrected in place, offline included.
- **Jump around a session** - a strip of the workout's exercises shows what is
  done and what is next, and one tap opens an exercise page with its technique
  media, your recent sessions on that movement and its best estimated 1RM,
  then takes you back exactly where you were.
- **Readiness check-in** - an optional pre-session soreness/readiness prompt that
  auto-regulates the suggested load and says why it held or dropped.
- **Return-to-training calibration** - after a real layoff, the first session
  back is eased in on its own: fewer working sets, a higher target RIR and a
  conservative opening load derived from your long-term history, then normal
  autoregulation takes over. Adding a brand-new exercise is not a layoff and is
  left alone.
- **Your actual gym, not a generic one** - describe the concrete stations and
  items you train on (type, manufacturer, model, quantity, item-specific weight
  options, an optional photo), link them to the exercises they serve, and the
  equipment you used is recorded on every set you log. If a selection cannot be
  recorded (the item was deleted or unlinked while you trained), the set is
  still saved and the logger says so instead of dropping it silently.
- **Quality-of-life** - kilograms or pounds per user, an interface in English,
  French or Russian (extensible message catalogs), multi-user with strict
  per-user data isolation, and an installable PWA with offline logging.

### Track progress

- **Strength trends** - estimated-1RM and max-load over time, plus a per-exercise
  percentage loading table.
- **Volume and frequency** - weekly volume per muscle group with MEV/MRV landmark
  bands, and per-muscle weekly training frequency.
- **Muscle heat map** - front and back body silhouettes tinted by last week's
  working sets per muscle against its MEV/MRV band, so a neglected or
  over-cooked area is one glance away.
- **Records and consistency** - an all-time records board, personal-record badges
  in-session and on the summary, and a training-consistency calendar.
- **Workout history on a calendar** - page through the months, see which days you
  trained, open a day's sessions, and filter by program. Days are bucketed in
  your own timezone, not the server's
  ([example](docs/screenshots/history.png)).
- **Auto-regulation** - stalled-lift detection and a deload recommendation from
  your stalls and readiness, with a one-tap planned deload that lightens loads
  10% until it expires.
- **Goals and body comp** - per-exercise goals (weight x reps) with a progress
  bar, bodyweight tracking, and body measurements - each with a trend.
- **Progress photos** - upload photos alongside your body metrics and compare
  any two side by side. Stored locally on your server, visible only to you.
- **Home dashboard** - a coach-insight card surfaces the single most important
  signal right now (due deload, stalled lift, fresh PR, or your weekly streak),
  with no AI call.

### Cardio and wearables

- **First-class cardio** - log duration and distance (not weight x reps); a
  weekly conditioning card (minutes, km, sessions vs the 150 min/week guideline)
  that never pollutes your lifting metrics.
- **Watch-file import, no cloud** - bring activities in as **TCX, GPX or Garmin
  FIT** (duration, distance, heart rate; no OAuth, no cloud account). FIT imports
  a whole batch at once, and every imported run or ride shows a
  **heart-rate-over-time chart** plus its **aerobic decoupling** (how much your
  pace per heartbeat drifted over the effort) on the session detail.

### AI coach (bring your own model)

- **Weekly debrief and adjustments** - evidence-based, aware of your goals,
  fatigue signals and conditioning volume.
- **Conversational coach** - streaming chat grounded in your training data,
  including mid-session with the live workout attached in one tap.
- **Program generation** - a full program from a one-sentence goal, editable
  before saving.
- **Explainable by design** - a "What your coach sees" card shows the exact
  structured context the AI receives.
- **Your provider** - Anthropic SDK or any OpenRouter model. With no key set,
  the app is still a clean, fast tracker.

### Programs and exercises

- **Built-in templates** - 5/3/1 BBB, GZCLP, nSuns, PPL, Upper/Lower, Starting
  Strength, StrongLifts 5x5, Madcow, PHUL, PHAT, Full Body - runnable as written
  and editable like any program.
- **Exercise catalog** - searchable by name, on top of your custom exercises and
  muscle-group grouping.
- **Printable workout sheet** - print (or save as PDF) a clean A4 sheet per
  workout with empty weight / reps / RIR cells for every planned set, fill it in
  by hand at the gym, and re-enter it later
  ([example](docs/screenshots/print-sheet.png)).

### Your data, your server

- **Self-hosted** - your training lives in your own Postgres; the AI runs on your
  own key. No subscription, no rate-limited free tier.
- **ChatGPT / MCP connector** - external agents can analyse your training data
  and, with explicit permission, create or edit programs.
- **Import and export** - bring history in from a Strong or Hevy CSV, or from
  GymCoach's own history CSV (a spreadsheet with the same columns works too;
  dry-run preview, duplicate-safe, cardio included), and export everything back
  to CSV or TCX anytime.

## Stack

- Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript strict, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- Backend: Next.js API routes, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL 16
- AI: pluggable LLM provider (Anthropic SDK or OpenRouter)
- Infra: Docker and Docker Compose

## Why

A few beliefs shaped GymCoach:

- Your training data is yours. It lives in a Postgres database you control, not on someone else's servers. No ads, no tracking, no account you cannot delete.
- AI should be optional and yours to pay for. The coach runs on your own Anthropic or OpenRouter key, so there is no subscription and no rate-limited "free tier". With no key set, the app is a clean, fast tracker.
- Coaching should be grounded in your numbers, not generic advice. The AI only ever sees a structured summary of your own sessions, program and progress.
- Evidence over hype. Load progression uses double-progression logic, and the coach is prompted to reason from your data (and cite the usual names: Schoenfeld, Helms, Israetel) rather than invent.
- Self-hosting should be boring: one Docker Compose file, one database, standard Next.js.

I built it for my own training and open-sourced it under MIT. There is nothing to buy: a [public demo](https://demo-gymcoach.mesureprivee.com) lets you look around, but GymCoach is meant to be self-hosted. Clone it, run it, change it.

## How it works

The app:

- Next.js 15 (App Router) serves both the UI and the API routes; data lives in PostgreSQL through Prisma. Auth is a signed JWT in an httpOnly cookie; every record is scoped to a user id and every route checks ownership.
- The session logger is offline-first: each set is written to IndexedDB (Dexie) first for instant feedback, then synced to the server in the background, so a flaky gym connection never blocks you. A Wake Lock keeps the screen awake during a session.
- Progress is computed server-side: estimated 1RM (Epley), max load over time, and weekly volume per muscle group, with bodyweight-aware tonnage for movements like pull-ups and dips.

The AI layer:

- A single provider interface (`lib/llm`) sits in front of the Anthropic SDK, any OpenRouter model, or an OpenAI Responses-compatible `codex-lb` endpoint. You pick one with the `LLM_PROVIDER` env var; the rest of the app does not care which.
- For every AI call the server builds a compact, structured payload (your profile + recent sessions + active program + per-exercise progression) instead of dumping raw rows, then:
  - Weekly debrief and program adjustments: one completion that returns markdown plus an optional structured block of suggested changes, validated with Zod before anything touches your program.
  - Chat coach: the same context plus your conversation, streamed back token by token.
  - Program generation: a plain-language goal becomes a JSON program, validated and previewed so you can edit it before it is saved.
- The stable system prompt is marked for prompt caching, so multi-turn chats reuse it instead of re-sending it every turn.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- npm

## Quick start (local dev)

Recommended setup: Postgres in Docker, Next.js running locally for hot reload.

```bash
# 1. Environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env (the example ships with working dev defaults)

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start Postgres
docker compose up -d db

# 4. Apply Prisma migrations
npm run db:migrate

# 5. Seed demo data (account + exercise catalog + program + sample session)
npm run db:seed

# 6. Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

The app runs on http://localhost:3030. Postgres is exposed on `localhost:5433` on the host.

The demo account credentials come from `.env` (`USER_EMAIL` and `USER_PASSWORD`); the seed hashes the password at runtime.

## Configuration

All configuration is done through environment variables. See `.env.example` for the full list (database, JWT secret, demo account, and the AI provider keys).

### Progress photos / uploads

Progress photos are stored as plain files on the server's local filesystem,
under `UPLOADS_DIR` (default `./uploads`, gitignored) - no cloud, no third
party. Images are served only through an ownership-scoped API route, never as
a public static path. Files are written owner-only (`0o600`) inside per-user
directories created `0o700`, and every stored path is re-resolved (symlinks
included) inside the uploads dir before it is read, written or deleted. If you
self-host with Docker, mount that directory as a volume and include it in your
backups alongside the database.

## Testing

Three tiers: unit/component (Vitest + jsdom), integration (Vitest against a
real Postgres), and end to end (Playwright driving the built app).

```bash
npm run test            # unit and component tests
npm run test:coverage   # with coverage report

# Integration + E2E use a dedicated Postgres (docker-compose.test.yml, port 5434):
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://gymcoach_test:gymcoach_test@localhost:5434/gymcoach_test \
  npx prisma migrate deploy
npm run test:integration
npm run build && npm run test:e2e
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint, typecheck, unit, integration,
build and E2E on every push and pull request.

## Deployment

A production stack is provided through `docker-compose.prod.yml` (app + Postgres). Put it behind a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, Traefik) for HTTPS.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in real values (JWT_SECRET, the AI provider key, NEXTAUTH_URL, ...)
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec app npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Pulling the prebuilt image

Every `main` commit whose CI run is green publishes a linux/amd64 image to
GHCR, so you can pull instead of building on your own hardware, and registry
watchers (Watchtower, Diun) have digests to compare (a commit whose CI fails
is never published):

- `ghcr.io/julien-au/gymcoach:latest` - moving tag, follows `main`
- `ghcr.io/julien-au/gymcoach:sha-<short>` - immutable, one per commit

To use it, replace the `build:` block of the `app` service in
`docker-compose.prod.yml` with `image: ghcr.io/julien-au/gymcoach:latest`
(the compose file keeps `build:` as its default so existing setups and forks
keep working unchanged).

### Deploying a public demo instance

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true` (plus the throwaway demo credentials) in the
instance's `.env`, then build with the demo profile and run the one-shot
seeder. It fills the demo account with a rich deterministic dataset (12 weeks
of sessions, a bodyweight trend, a goal, readiness check-ins); re-running it
on every deploy also resets whatever visitors changed.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --profile demo up -d --build
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --profile demo run --rm seed-demo
```

The public demo is a single shared account, so visitors who start a session
pollute it. Re-run the seeder on a schedule (e.g. a cron every 30 minutes) so
the demo always opens on the clean, populated state - it wipes and recreates
the demo account's data without touching the rest.

To keep the deployed demo on the latest code, prefer a pull-model cron on the
host (periodically `git fetch` and rebuild only when the branch moved) over an
inbound SSH deploy from CI - a host reaching out to GitHub is far more reliable
than CI reaching in to a small VPS.

## Roadmap

- [x] Single user MVP (logging, progress, weekly AI debrief, program adjustments)
- [x] Pluggable LLM provider (Anthropic SDK or OpenRouter, switchable via env)
- [x] Multi user support (registration, profiles, data isolation)
- [x] AI program generation from a natural language goal
- [x] Conversational AI coach (streaming chat with your training context)
- [x] Test pyramid (unit, integration, E2E) and CI
- [x] Shorthand set logging (`100x8@9`) - the deterministic slice of
      natural-language logging
- [x] In-session AI suggestions (ask the coach mid-workout with the live
      session attached)
- [x] Free-text (AI-parsed) set logging (opt-in "Parse with AI" fills the set
      form from plain language; you confirm before it logs)
- [x] Progress photos (local-only upload with side-by-side compare)
- [x] Interface localization (English, French and Russian, extensible message
      catalogs)
- [x] Muscle heat map (body silhouettes tinted by weekly volume vs MEV/MRV)
- [x] Physical gym equipment inventory, with the equipment used recorded on
      each logged set
- [x] Return-to-training calibration after a long layoff
- [x] Printable A4 workout sheet (blank weight / reps / RIR cells)
- [x] Calendar workout history (month grid, day drill-down, program filter, your
      timezone)
- [x] Live-session exercise navigation (jump strip plus a per-exercise detail
      page)
- [x] Inline set editing during a live session (correct a logged set in place,
      offline included)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and encouraged. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
for setup, conventions, the test commands, and - since this repo is largely
maintained by an autonomous AI loop - an honest description of how external
issues and PRs are reviewed and merged ("How your contribution is handled").
Notable changes are tracked in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

### Thanks

- [@SHAREN](https://github.com/SHAREN) - first external contributor, and a
  big one: interface localization with Russian (#272), per-set workout
  autoregulation (#273), saved gyms with equipment-aware load selection
  (#274), exercise technique media (#275), and the ChatGPT / MCP connector
  (#276). Along the way they also found and fixed a latent `.gitignore` bug
  that shadowed an API route in fresh clones. Then a second series:
  return-to-training calibration (#311), the physical gym equipment inventory
  (#312) and the equipment recorded on each logged set (#313). They also
  proposed making MCP a first-class "external deep coach" interface (#331); the
  sequencing is answered on that issue, and its one web-app-only piece is
  tracked as #333. A third series followed in September, seven PRs, all merged:
  portable progress-photo paths (#350), locale-stable MCP dates (#354), the
  calendar workout history (#351), the PWA update refresh (#352), reliable
  locale switching behind a proxy (#353), live-session exercise navigation
  (#355) and inline set editing (#356) - the last of which they hardened
  themselves, closing every finding of the review within hours.
- [@shaurya703](https://github.com/shaurya703) - picked up three of the loop's
  own follow-up issues within hours of their filing and turned each into a
  clean PR, including the persisted dropped-equipment notice (#342).
- [@mvnixon](https://github.com/mvnixon) - reported the `GET /mcp` hang that
  stopped MCP clients probing with GET from connecting at all (#314), and
  made the case for publishing the production image so self-hosters can pull
  instead of build (#310).
- [@gogoku121](https://github.com/gogoku121) - proposed the browsable
  exercise library built on an MIT-licensed dataset (#308, scoped and tracked
  as #320).
- Exercise technique photos come from
  [free-exercise-db](https://github.com/yuhonas/free-exercise-db) (Unlicense).
