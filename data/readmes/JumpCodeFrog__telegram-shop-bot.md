### 🚀 Quick Start

> For a read-only Telegram Stars ledger check, run `make reconcile-stars`.
> It prints aggregate counts only. Exit `1` means configuration/API/DB failure,
> a truncated or unstable window, provider/local-only rows, amount mismatch, or
> unresolved review items. Model: [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-commerce-state-and-payment-ledger.md).
> Recovery stays preview-first and explicit; see the
> [payment operations runbook](docs/payment-operations.md).

Get a token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), then choose a release binary or build from source.

#### Download a binary (Windows or Linux)

Download the archive for your system from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/JumpCodeFrog/telegram-shop-bot/releases): Windows (`.zip`, available from v3.0.1) or Linux (`.tar.gz`). Choose `amd64` for Intel/AMD processors or `arm64` for ARM processors. Prebuilt binaries need no Go, Make, or Docker.

Download `checksums.txt` from the **same release** and [verify the archive's SHA-256](docs/release-verification.md) before extracting or running it. This checks file integrity; it does not provide an author signature.

**Windows:** extract the entire ZIP, including the `locales` folder. Open PowerShell in the extracted directory containing `telegram-shop-bot.exe`, then run:

```powershell
.\telegram-shop-bot.exe quickstart
```

After stopping the bot with `Ctrl+C`, use these commands in the same directory:

```powershell
.\telegram-shop-bot.exe doctor   # check configuration and services
.\telegram-shop-bot.exe version  # show the installed version
.\telegram-shop-bot.exe run      # start without the wizard
```

**Linux:** extract the entire archive, keep `locales` beside the executable, open a terminal in that directory, and run `./telegram-shop-bot quickstart`. Later, use `./telegram-shop-bot doctor`, `./telegram-shop-bot version`, or `./telegram-shop-bot run`.

#### Build from source

Requires [Go 1.24+](https://go.dev/dl/), Git, and Make:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JumpCodeFrog/telegram-shop-bot.git && cd telegram-shop-bot
make quickstart
```

The built-in setup asks only for the BotFather token and your numeric Telegram user ID. It validates the bot through Telegram, derives its username, writes `.env` without overwriting an existing file (`0600` on Unix), checks SQLite and optional Redis, then starts the shop. The token is hidden in an interactive terminal and never printed.

Need your numeric ID? Send any message to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot); it is not your phone number or `@username`.

Optional: enable Inline Mode with `/setinline` in @BotFather to share products from the catalog in any chat. `doctor` reports when it is off.

```bash
make doctor     # actionable setup report
make run        # start without the wizard
make payment-review PROVIDER=stars # redacted local review inbox
```

Redis is optional; without it the bot uses its in-memory fallback. See [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) for more binary commands.

#### Docker Compose

> Only Docker is required. The source checkout is built locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JumpCodeFrog/telegram-shop-bot.git
cd telegram-shop-bot
cp .env.example .env
# Set BOT_TOKEN and ADMIN_IDS in .env, then:
docker compose up -d --build
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
docker compose logs -f bot
```

---

### 🔑 Get a Bot Token

1. Open Telegram → search **[@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)**
2. Send `/newbot`
3. Choose a name and username
4. Copy the token: `1234567890:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz`
5. Paste it when the `quickstart` wizard asks (or set `BOT_TOKEN` in `.env` for Docker)

### 💳 Payments

**Telegram Stars** — built-in, works out of the box. Rate is configurable via `USD_TO_STARS_RATE` (default: 50 Stars = $1).

**CryptoBot (USDT)** — optional. Set `CRYPTOBOT_TOKEN` to enable.  
Background worker polls payment status every 30 seconds. Signatures verified via HMAC-SHA256.

**YooKassa (RUB)** — optional. Card payments: the buyer is redirected to the YooKassa checkout page, the order settles when YooKassa notifies the bot.  
Set `YOOKASSA_SHOP_ID`, `YOOKASSA_SECRET_KEY`, `YOOKASSA_RETURN_URL` (public HTTPS) and `USD_TO_RUB_RATE` (RUB per 1 USD, e.g. `92.5`) — the first three must be set together, and with `USD_TO_RUB_RATE` at the default `0` the "Pay by card" button stays hidden (in the bot and the Mini App alike). USD prices convert at the configured rate; the RUB total is snapshotted on the order at checkout. Register `<WEBHOOK_URL>/yookassa-webhook` as the notification URL in the YooKassa merchant cabinet. YooKassa notifications are unsigned — the body only identifies the payment, and settlement happens strictly after the bot re-fetches the authoritative payment state from the YooKassa API. As a backup for lost notifications (e.g. bot downtime), a background poller re-scans the last 24 hours of succeeded payments every 60 seconds and settles whatever the webhook missed — no action needed from the operator. Subscriptions remain Stars-only.

**Stripe (USD)** — optional. Card payments in USD: the buyer is redirected to Stripe's hosted Checkout page, the order settles when Stripe notifies the bot.  
Set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (must start with `sk_live_` or `sk_test_`), `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (must start with `whsec_`) and `STRIPE_RETURN_URL` (public HTTPS) — all three must be set together. In the Stripe dashboard (Developers → Webhooks) register `<WEBHOOK_URL>/stripe-webhook` for `checkout.session.completed` and copy the endpoint's signing secret into `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Stripe notifications are HMAC-signed: once the signature verifies, the signed body itself settles the order — no API refetch needed (unlike the unsigned YooKassa flow, which must re-fetch the payment). Orders below Stripe's $0.50 minimum are refused when the card button is tapped. Subscriptions remain Stars-only.

**TON (on-chain)** — optional. Direct TON transfers to the shop's own wallet: the buyer taps the TON button and gets the wallet address, the exact amount and a **mandatory `order-<id>` memo** — the `ton://transfer` deeplink button prefills all three — then sends the transfer from any TON wallet. There is no webhook on-chain: a background worker polls the wallet's latest transactions via toncenter every ~30 seconds and settles the order once a transfer with the exact memo covers the frozen amount.  
Set `TON_WALLET_ADDRESS` and `USD_PER_TON` (USD per 1 TON, e.g. `5.25`) together — with `USD_PER_TON` at the default `0` the TON button stays hidden (in the bot and the Mini App alike); `TON_API_KEY` (toncenter) is optional and only lifts rate limits. The nanoton total is snapshotted on the order at checkout from the `USD_PER_TON` in effect at that moment, so a later rate change never reprices an existing order, and an order created while TON was disabled can never be paid in TON. Settlement is overpay-tolerant: a transfer of at least the snapshot settles and the ledger records the actual received amount; an underpay is quarantined for `make payment-review PROVIDER=ton`. A transfer without the exact memo can never be matched to an order automatically — identify the sender and the intended order on-chain (tonviewer), then either credit the transfer to the order with `payment-review ingest-provider --provider ton` or refund it manually from the wallet (details: [docs/payment-operations.md](docs/payment-operations.md) §7). Subscriptions remain Stars-only.

**NOWPayments (300+ coins)** — optional. Hosted crypto invoices: the buyer is redirected to a NOWPayments invoice page offering 300+ coins (BTC, ETH, USDT, …), and the order settles when NOWPayments sends a signed IPN callback.  
Set `NOWPAYMENTS_API_KEY`, `NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_SECRET` and `NOWPAYMENTS_RETURN_URL` (public HTTPS) — all three must be set together — and register `<WEBHOOK_URL>/nowpayments-webhook` as the IPN callback URL in the NOWPayments dashboard. IPN callbacks are HMAC-SHA512-signed over the canonicalized (recursively key-sorted) JSON body: once the signature verifies, the signed body itself settles the order — no API refetch (the CryptoBot/Stripe pattern). Only `payment_status: finished` settles; every other status is acknowledged without side effects. Invoices charge the order's own USD total, so the signed amount must match exactly — unlike TON there is no overpay tolerance. ⚠️ Confirm the byte-level canonicalization agreement with NOWPayments' signer with ONE live test payment before enabling the rail in production (verification fails closed: a mismatch rejects genuine IPNs, it can never accept a forged one). Subscriptions remain Stars-only.

**Balance** — internal, no configuration. Buyers with a positive USD balance (granted by an admin via `/setbalance`) see a "Pay (balance)" button at checkout for non-subscription carts; the tap settles the order synchronously and debits the balance — no provider round-trip. Subscriptions remain Stars-only.

**Stars subscriptions** — a product created as a "30-day subscription" is sold as a recurring Stars payment (`subscription_period=2592000`). Subscriptions are Stars-only; users manage them via `/mysubs`.

### 📱 Mini App

A lightweight web shop (vanilla JS, embedded in the binary — no build step) that opens right inside Telegram: catalog, product cards with photos and ratings, cart, and checkout via `openInvoice` (Stars) or CryptoBot.

1. Serve the bot's port 8080 behind a public **HTTPS** domain (Telegram requires HTTPS for Web Apps).
2. Set `WEBAPP_URL=https://shop.example.com/app` in `.env`.
3. Restart — the bot's menu button becomes the Mini App, static files are served at `/app/`, and the REST API at `/api/*` (authorized via Telegram `initData`, HMAC-verified).

> Without `WEBAPP_URL` the Mini App and its API are not mounted at all — the bot works exactly as before.

---

### 🌱 Seed Demo Data

```bash
go run ./cmd/seed
```

Creates categories (Clothing, Shoes, Accessories), 6 products, and promo codes `WELCOME10` (−10%) and `SALE20` (−20%). Safe to run multiple times.

---

### 🚢 Production Deployment

```bash
# 1. Set real BOT_TOKEN and ADMIN_IDS in .env (or run `make init`)
# 2. Run unified checks: config, DB, Redis, Telegram and webhook
make doctor

# 3. Start
docker compose up -d --build
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/metrics
```

<details>
<summary>Webhook + nginx config</summary>

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name shop.example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/shop.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/shop.example.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

```env
WEBHOOK_URL=https://shop.example.com
TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET=random-secret-string
```

Telegram posts to `https://shop.example.com/telegram-webhook`. If CryptoBot is enabled, configure its webhook as `https://shop.example.com/cryptobot-webhook`. If YooKassa is enabled, register `https://shop.example.com/yookassa-webhook` as the notification URL in the YooKassa merchant cabinet. If Stripe is enabled, register `https://shop.example.com/stripe-webhook` in the Stripe dashboard (Developers → Webhooks). If NOWPayments is enabled, register `https://shop.example.com/nowpayments-webhook` as the IPN callback URL in the NOWPayments dashboard. TON needs no webhook at all — settlement is polled from the chain.
