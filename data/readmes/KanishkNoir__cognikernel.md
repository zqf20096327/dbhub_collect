**Your AI coding agent has amnesia by design.** Every session starts from zero —
it re-reads the same files, re-derives the same architecture, and re-asks
questions you already answered last week. CogniKernel gives the *project* a
memory that outlives any one session, so the agent stops paying the same cost
twice:

```
  WITHOUT MEMORY                          WITH COGNIKERNEL
  ───────────────                          ─────────────────
  Session 1                                Session 1
    "explain the auth flow"                  "explain the auth flow"
    -> reads 12 files, learns it             -> reads 12 files, learns it
    -> session ends, all of it lost          -> session ends
                                              -> decisions captured & stored

  Session 2                                Session 2
    "explain the auth flow"                  already knows: the auth flow,
    -> reads 12 files again                  why Redis beat an in-process
    -> re-derives the same thing             cache, and the approach that
    -> session ends, nothing kept            was tried and abandoned
                                              -> picks up where it left off

  Session 3                                Session 3
    "explain the auth flow"                  already knows everything
    -> reads 12 files a third time           sessions 1 and 2 settled
    -> context resets again                  -> starts from where YOU are,
                                                 not from zero
```

No extra LLM in the loop, no API keys, no tokens billed for memory itself, and
nothing leaves your machine.

---

## Quickstart

**Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/cognikernel/):**

```sh
pip install "cognikernel[embedding]"   # recommended: + dense retrieval & the fine-tuned encoder runtime
# or: pip install cognikernel          # core (lexical-only)
```

Prefer an isolated global CLI? `pipx install "cognikernel[embedding]"` or `uv tool install "cognikernel[embedding]"`.

**Set up a project** — run once from the project root:

```sh
cognikernel init .            # register the project + install hooks and MCP for Claude Code and Codex
cognikernel install-heads     # optional, recommended: fine-tuned encoder models (~270 MB, one-time, sha256-verified)
cognikernel doctor .          # verify everything is wired up
```

Then just **start a Claude Code session in the project.** Decisions are captured
automatically when the session ends and injected as a compact memory block at the
next session start — nothing else to do. (`install-heads` is optional but
recommended: without it, extraction falls back to a weaker lexical path, and
`doctor` tells you which is active — see [Setup details](#setup-details).)

---

## What's new in 0.1.3

- **Fresh installs get the memory tools again.** 0.1.2 accepted `mcp` 2.x, which
  removed a module the MCP server needs, so `recall`, `find_related`, `skeleton`
  and `get_session_state` could be missing. 0.1.3 requires `mcp<2`. On 0.1.2, run
  `pip install "mcp<2"`.
- **The right open work item.** The block's "Working on" line is no longer taken
  over by Claude's step narration, an ordinary instruction, or a sentence that only
  points at a work item, and it keeps its place when decisions pile up. A work item
  carried over from an earlier session says which one: `(S1 · 09-12)`.
- **Less of Claude's own chatter kept as memory.** Step narration ("Now let's run
  the full test suite."), answer lines ("Summary: …") and narration about
  CogniKernel itself now rank below real decisions or are no longer stored.
- **Memory follows you into subdirectories** of the same git repository instead of
  starting a second, empty store.
- **Ask memory why:**
  - `cognikernel why`: where a claim came from, why it ranks where it does, and
    what it replaced
  - `cognikernel show --as-of`: what memory believed at a past date or commit
  - `cognikernel explain-recall`: why recall found what it did
- **Cheaper by default:** new projects start with the advisory read gate. Under
  the old strict default, 89% of refused first reads were retried at once.
  Existing projects keep their setting.
- **Corrected numbers:** `cognikernel telemetry` and the published benchmark
  counted token usage once per transcript line instead of once per response, so
  the figures `doctor` showed were inflated too.

Details: [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) · [release notes](docs/release-notes-0.1.3.md).

## What CogniKernel actually is

AI coding agents don't remember anything between sessions by default — the
model's weights are frozen, so its only memory is whatever fits in that
session's context window. Two consequences of that are common enough now to
have names: **context rot**, where a long session's own window fills with
stale tool output and superseded instructions until quality degrades, and
**cold-start re-derivation**, where the moment a session ends, all of that
understanding is gone and the next one pays the "getting up to speed" cost
again. At scale, that repeated cost is a real reason AI coding spend has
become something engineering orgs actively budget and worry about — this
project is one attempt at closing that gap.

CogniKernel watches a coding session through its hook surfaces, extracts the
*decisions, constraints, and abandoned approaches* worth keeping, consolidates
them into an event-sourced store, and injects them back as a compact context
block the next time you work. The store is keyed on the project path, so
memory made in one tool travels to the other.

It is **not** a vector-database wrapper, and it is **not** another LLM
summarizing your transcripts. Most memory tools work that way — send your
session to a generative model to "summarize what mattered," which means
another API key, per-session token cost, added latency, and your session
content leaving the machine. CogniKernel treats extraction as *classification,
not generation*: a deterministic sanitize → classify → consolidate pipeline,
with two small fine-tuned encoder models (~130 MB ONNX, milliseconds on CPU)
scoring salience and detecting when a new decision supersedes an old one. No
API calls, no tokens billed, nothing leaves your machine. The only LLM
involved is the coding agent you already run — CogniKernel makes it remember.

**What you get, out of the box:**

- **Automatic capture & recall** — decisions, constraints, and abandoned
  approaches are extracted at session end and injected next time. You never
  hand-write memory to `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Cross-tool memory** — one store serves Claude Code *and* Codex working in the
  same directory ([Cross-platform](#cross-platform-codex)).
- **Action-time guardrails** — a prior "don't do X" surfaces at the moment you're
  about to do X, not three files later (Claude Code).
- **Read efficiency** — an injected AST skeleton means the agent re-reads far
  fewer files ([What it saves you](#what-it-saves-you)).
- **MCP tools** for targeted use: `recall` · `find_related` · `skeleton` ·
  `get_session_state`.
- **CLI**: `init` · `doctor` · `install-heads` · `codex-sync` · `show` · `why` ·
  `explain-recall` · `reset` (full list under [Interfaces](#interfaces)).
- **No LLM, no cloud, no keys** — everything runs locally; nothing leaves your
  machine.

---

## The fine-tuned models

Two small encoder models do the actual thinking behind CogniKernel — not a keyword
list, not an LLM call:

| Model | What it decides | Why it's an encoder, not an LLM |
|---|---|---|
| **`salience_v2`** | For every sentence in a session transcript: is this worth keeping, and what type — `DECISION`, `CONSTRAINT_HARD`/`SOFT`, `APPROACH_ABANDONED_DO_NOT_RETRY`, or noise? This is the model that decides *what gets remembered.* | A fine-tuned SetFit classifier (bge-small backbone, ~130 MB ONNX) runs this on CPU in milliseconds. An LLM doing the same job costs an API call and real latency on every session — CogniKernel spends neither. |
| **`supersession_xenc`** | Does this new fact *replace* an existing one (a decision changed, a constraint was relaxed), or does it just restate what's already stored? This is the model behind latest-wins consolidation. | Same constraint: this fires on every capture. A cross-encoder scores it locally in milliseconds instead of round-tripping to a model API. |

**Validated on held-out data, not vibes.** Each model is scored against a frozen
evaluation set mined from real captured project stores that the training data never
sees — retraining on the eval set is a standing rule violation, not a shortcut we
occasionally allow. Because the underlying task (is this sentence a decision, or just
description?) is itself genuinely ambiguous at the margin, we also measure how much
*two independent human labelers* agree with each other on the same sentences, and hold
the model to that ceiling rather than to a naive 100%. The model's minority classes
(rare event types with few historical examples) are tracked and grown deliberately,
because a thin eval slice can hide the exact class that most needs work.

**They're optional but on by default — here's the fail-open contract.** `cognikernel init`
writes a per-project config that already selects the fine-tuned path
(`extractor = "v2-broad"`, `cross_encoder_supersession = true`). What's missing after
`init` is the ~270 MB of model weights themselves — that's what
`cognikernel install-heads` fetches. Until you run it, CogniKernel works, but degrades
both decisions to a deterministic keyword/lexical fallback (weaker: it can miss
decisions phrased outside its trigger vocabulary, and it can't catch a paraphrased
correction lexical matching misses) — `cognikernel doctor` names this state explicitly
rather than leaving it invisible (see below). Nothing breaks either way — that's
the fail-open design — but the fine-tuned path is the better-quality one, and the
one new projects are configured to use by default. See [Quickstart](#quickstart) to
install them.

---

## The memory loop

Everything CogniKernel does is one loop: **observe → extract → consolidate →
store → retrieve → assemble → inject**. The left rail captures; the right rail
recalls; the spine underneath keeps both honest.

## The four hook surfaces

CogniKernel attaches to a session at four points. Each is fail-open — if memory
is unavailable or errors, the hook logs at `WARNING`, returns cleanly, and the
session continues. `salience_v2` and `supersession_xenc` (above) do the
classification behind Capture and Session block; nothing here is a hardcoded
keyword list unless the fallback path is active.

```
  SessionStart          UserPromptSubmit         PreToolUse            Stop
  ─────────────         ─────────────────        ──────────           ──────
  inject the block  ──▶  surface relevant    ──▶  warn before a   ──▶  extract &
  memory picks up        memory as you type       past decision        persist what
  where you left off     it, unasked               gets violated        this session
                                                                         decided
```

| Surface | Hook | Authority | What it does | Why you care |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Session block** | `SessionStart` | advisory | injects the canonical decisions/constraints/skeleton block | a new session already knows what the last one decided — no "let me re-read the codebase to remember where we were" |
| **CK-1 recall** | `UserPromptSubmit` | advisory | surfaces prompt-relevant memory, dual-evidence gated, dedup'd via render ledger | ask about a subsystem and the relevant prior decision rides in with your prompt, unasked |
| **Read/Edit gate** | `PreToolUse` | advisory (strict opt-in) / **JIT** | read efficiency on Read/Grep: refuses re-reading a file already read this session, and refuses first reads only under `hook_policy = "strict"`; **just-in-time prohibition surfacing** on Write/Edit (K2) | the agent gets warned *at the moment it's about to violate a past decision*, not three files later when you notice |
| **Capture** | `Stop` | side-effect | extracts and persists decisions — you never write memory to CLAUDE.md by hand | you never write down what you decided; the next session already has it |

---

## What gets remembered

Memory is **typed**, not free-text chunks. The type drives ranking, rendering,
and supersession:

- `DECISION` — a choice that was made ("use Redis for the rate limiter")
- `CONSTRAINT_HARD` / `CONSTRAINT_SOFT` — rules, graded by deontic force
- `APPROACH_ABANDONED_DO_NOT_RETRY` — a dead end, kept in the **graveyard** so
  the agent doesn't re-attempt it
- conventions, config facts, schema decisions (canonical role keys)

A **decision key** lets a later restatement *supersede* an earlier one
(latest-wins), so the store self-consolidates instead of accumulating
contradictions. An optional cross-encoder adds semantic supersession when the
encoder backend is installed.

---

## Retrieval

Lexical-primary, with dense as a fused signal — never pure vector:

- **Hybrid core** — FTS5 BM25 ∪ optional dense embeddings → Reciprocal Rank Fusion
- **prohibition_search** — a type-restricted lexical pool so a "do not do X" rule
  can't be crowded out by topically-similar prose at the moment you're about to do X
- **Skeleton** — an AST symbol graph ranked by PageRank; `find_related` unions
  **semantic (embedding) neighbours** with **import-graph-adjacent** events to
  surface what a change touches (the semantic axis needs the `embedding` extra)
- **Golden-record consolidation at read** — latest-wins reconciliation so recall
  returns one coherent answer, not a pile of revisions

---

## What it saves you

Benchmarked in a three-arm comparison — CogniKernel vs flat curated notes vs no
memory — with real agent sessions across four multi-session projects. Full
methodology, per-project tables, and the honest caveats (including where
CogniKernel ties or loses) are in [`docs/benchmark.md`](docs/benchmark.md):

```
  Orientation reads — reads before the first line of code, i.e. the cost of
  working out where you are. CogniKernel vs. Claude Code native auto-memory.
  (bar scale: 20 chars = 40%; see docs/benchmark.md §3)

  project stresses…      CK / auto    reduction vs auto-memory

  evolving decisions     27 / 39   ███████████████░░░░░  -30.8%
  small, re-readable     17 / 20   ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░  -15.0%
  quality invariants     97 / 104  ███░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   -6.7%
  self-authored API      90 / 92   █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   -2.2%
```

- **Orientation reads: the one win that holds everywhere.** Lower on **4 of 4**
  projects. This is precisely what an injected block is for — the agent starts
  already knowing the repo's shape instead of paying to rediscover it. Fewer
  round-trips also means more of the context window left for actual work, so
  your session runs *longer* before compaction, not just cheaper.
- **Total reads and tokens: a split result, not a sweep.** Once you count every
  read rather than just orientation, CogniKernel is ahead on one project of four
  (Relay, −38.1%) and slightly behind on the rest. Against native auto-memory,
  price-weighted cost is **−25.0% on Relay** and **−19.3% on Toolbelt**, and within
  a few percent on Conductor (+3.0%) and Taskflow (+4.2%). Against no memory at
  all it is not a sweep: on Relay CogniKernel costs **23% more than the no-memory
  arm**, from round-trips its own tools add. Structured memory repays its overhead
  on projects with several evolving decisions and several abandoned approaches; on
  small re-readable ones it adds little. *(Corrected 2026-09-10 — earlier figures
  double-counted token usage; see `docs/benchmark.md` §3.)*

- **Recall instead of re-derivation.** Where memory earns its keep is projects
  whose state is too large, too evolving, or too long-lived to re-derive
  cheaply: the agent starts already knowing the decisions, constraints, and
  dead ends, instead of spending the first quarter of the session rediscovering
  them.

---

## Reliability — the spine

The system is designed to degrade *legibly*, never silently:

- **Atomic migrations** — each numbered migration applies its body + version bump
  in one transaction; safe to crash mid-script
- **Idempotent replay** — a re-run worker job can't double-count or drift decay (evidence-provenance guard)
- **Fail-open hooks** — every surface swallows its own failure *and logs at WARNING*; silence never reads as success
- **`cognikernel doctor --strict`** — per-subsystem health (schema, FTS5, embeddings, symbols, worker queue); non-zero exit when degraded
- **Architecture enforcement** — `import-linter` layered contracts, guarded by a meta-test so a typo can't silently disable them
- **CI promotion gate** — lint + full suite (incl. `tests/reliability/` failure-injection) on every PR; see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)

---

## Cross-platform (Codex)

The store is platform-neutral — one SQLite DB per logical project, so Claude Code
and Codex working in the same directory share one memory. Project resolution is
**alias-aware**: `C:\repo` and `/mnt/c/repo` resolve to the same store, so memory
follows the checkout across Windows, WSL, and native mounts; for genuinely
different checkout paths, an opt-in `project_identity` key in
`.cognikernel/config.toml` pins them to one shared store. Codex reads memory through
the registered MCP server (`get_session_state` / `recall`); the capture direction
is **pull-based**, because Codex has no `Stop`-hook equivalent:

- **`cognikernel codex-sync <project>`** scans `~/.codex/sessions` for rollouts whose
  recorded `cwd` maps to the project and captures the delta through the *same*
  extraction pipeline (a rollout→transcript adapter is the only Codex-specific
  code; delta/dedup/idempotency are shared and unchanged).
- **Automatic at the handoff** — Claude's SessionStart drains pending Codex
  rollouts before building the block, and the MCP server's queue drainer pulls
  new rollouts each cycle, so a live Claude session picks up Codex-side decisions
  without waiting for the next session; on the Codex side, `init` writes an
  `AGENTS.md` instruction + a `ck-sync` skill so Codex pulls at session start.
- **`init` provisions both** — `.mcp.json` (Claude) and `.codex/config.toml`
  (with the server's `cwd` + project env pinned) + `AGENTS.md` (Codex),
  idempotently and without clobbering existing settings.
- **`cognikernel doctor`** reports a `codex` health line (sessions dir + rollout
  count, or "nothing to sync" — Codex is optional, so its absence is healthy).

A decision made in Codex reaches the next Claude session's block, and
vice versa. The action-point surfaces (CK-1, PreToolUse gate) are Claude-only —
Codex has no per-prompt/per-tool hook — so on Codex the loop degrades to the shared
block + MCP recall.

---

## Interfaces

**MCP tools** (the session block is injected automatically; these are for targeted use):
`recall` · `find_related` · `skeleton` · `get_session_state`

**CLI:**
- `cognikernel init <project>` — register the project and install the session hooks
- `cognikernel doctor [--strict] <project>` — subsystem health report
- `cognikernel codex-sync <project>` — capture Codex CLI sessions for this project
- `cognikernel install-heads` — install the trained encoder artifacts (salience + cross-encoder ONNX bodies): downloaded from the [`heads-v1` release](https://github.com/KanishkNoir/cognikernel/releases/tag/heads-v1) and sha256-verified, or copied from a local `models/` export when present
- `cognikernel show <project> [--as-of <date|commit>]` / `cognikernel reset <project>` — inspect stored memory (or what it believed at a past date or commit) / clear it
- `cognikernel why <project> <#id or words>` — where a claim came from, why it ranks where it does, and what it replaced or was replaced by
- `cognikernel explain-recall <project> <query> [--claim #id]` — why `recall` and the per-prompt push retrieved what they did, or didn't
- `cognikernel telemetry <project>` — count Claude Code session usage (once per API response) for `doctor`'s cache and round-trip figures

---

## Setup details

The [Quickstart](#quickstart) above is the whole flow; this expands on the two
steps worth understanding.

**`install-heads` is the easiest to skip and most worth not skipping.**
`cognikernel init` already configured the project to use the fine-tuned path
(`extractor = "v2-broad"`, `cross_encoder_supersession = true` in
`.cognikernel/config.toml`) — `install-heads` is what actually supplies the model
weights those settings call for. Skip it and CogniKernel still runs, just on the
weaker deterministic fallback (fail-open, not a hard error). The download pulls
from the [`heads-v1` release](https://github.com/KanishkNoir/cognikernel/releases/tag/heads-v1)
and is sha256-verified; pass `--source <dir>` to install from a local `models/`
export instead, or `--no-download` to rely on the fallback deliberately. The
fine-tuned runtime (onnxruntime + tokenizers) ships with the `[embedding]` extra,
so install with `pip install "cognikernel[embedding]"` for the full path.

**`cognikernel doctor` tells you which path is active** — its subsystem-health
block reports `salience_head` and `supersession_head` by name:

```
-- subsystem health -----------------------------------------
  [OK] salience_head    : installed, loads from ~/.cognikernel/models/salience_v2
  [OK] supersession_head: installed, loads from ~/.cognikernel/models/supersession_xenc
```

If you skipped `install-heads` (or installed core-only, without the `[embedding]`
extra that provides the ONNX runtime), the same lines say `not installed` and
name the exact command to fix it — always informational, never a `doctor
--strict` failure, since the legacy fallback is a fully supported mode.

**Working from a clone instead of PyPI?** Substitute `uv sync --extra embedding`
for the install and prefix the commands with `uv run` (e.g. `uv run cognikernel
init .`).

## Status

Version **0.1.3**. Schema **v22** (adds per-response telemetry and round-trip
counts, on top of the supersession/archival timestamps and commit anchor that
`show --as-of` and `why` read). Architecture contracts: 4 kept / 0 broken. CI
gate: lint + full suite on Ubuntu (3.11/3.12) and Windows. See
`CONTRIBUTING.md` for the Definition of Done that gates every change.
