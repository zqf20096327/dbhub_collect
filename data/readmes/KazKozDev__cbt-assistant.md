# CBT Assistant — local-first CBT journal and AI mental health chatbot on Ollama

An offline, self-hosted cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) app: structured thought records, mood and sleep tracking, clinical self-assessments, and guided SOS exercises — plus a chat assistant grounded in a built-in CBT knowledge base via RAG. No cloud and no account; the model runs on your own machine through Ollama.

<a id="installation"></a>

## Quick start

```bash
# macOS 14+
git clone https://github.com/KazKozDev/cbt-assistant.git && cd cbt-assistant && ./start_cbt_assistant.command
```

```bash
# Windows 10 22H2+ (PowerShell or cmd)
git clone https://github.com/KazKozDev/cbt-assistant.git
cd cbt-assistant
start_cbt_assistant.bat
```

The launcher sets up the Python environment, prepares Ollama, downloads `qwen3.5:9b` (~6.6 GB), starts the server on port 8000, and opens your browser; later launches reuse the same setup. On Linux, make sure `ollama serve` is running, run the steps manually, and open http://localhost:8000. English and Russian are switchable in Settings.

**Hardware requirements:** 16 GB RAM recommended for `qwen3.5:9b` (8 GB is sufficient if switching to smaller 3B/4B models in Settings), ~10 GB free disk space for model weights and the local embedding index.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> CBT Assistant is a self-help and journaling tool — not a therapist, medical device, or crisis service. Its knowledge base follows evidence-based CBT protocols, but AI responses and self-assessments can still be wrong. If you may be in immediate danger or at risk of harming yourself or someone else, contact local emergency services or a crisis line now.

## CBT journal, mood tracker, self-assessments, and SOS exercises

- **Thought Diary** — situations, automatic thoughts, emotions and intensities, cognitive distortions, rational responses.
- **Mood & Sleep Logs** — daily scores and notes, sleep duration, interruptions, quality.
- **Self-Assessments** — PHQ-9, GAD-7, Rosenberg Self-Esteem, and Burnout, with score interpretation.
- **Dashboard & Calendar** — mood and sleep trends over time, and a month view unifying every daily entry.
- **SOS Portals** — fullscreen paced breathing, 5-4-3-2-1 grounding, progressive muscle relaxation, and STOP, with scenes, sound, and countdowns.
- **Reports** — text summaries or printable PDF, generated in the browser.

## Private AI mental health chatbot with local memory

- Warm, non-judgmental dialogue with `qwen3.5:9b` running locally — core chat generation never leaves your machine.
- Grounded, not improvised: clinical guidance is retrieved from the bundled CBT library via FastEmbed RAG and cited as `[KB:chunk_id]`. Below the similarity threshold (`0.46`) the assistant offers supportive conversation instead of inventing protocols — measured at **recall@3 85.7%, MRR 0.70, 100% abstention accuracy** across 18 retrieval cases.
- Writes your records for you: ask it to log a thought record or a sleep entry, launch an agreed SOS portal, or schedule a planned activity.
- Remembers you across restarts: a personal profile and rolling summary persist in SQLite, so chats aren't isolated.
- Voice mode (optional) — speech recognition and neural text-to-speech in English and Russian (requires internet access).

## How the local CBT assistant works

</p>

At startup the Markdown CBT library is split by heading hierarchy and embedded locally with FastEmbed (`paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2`); semantic retrieval strictly runs before response generation. Messages, structured records, and profile memory live in SQLite (`data/cbt_sessions.db`), while interface logs and screening state also use browser `localStorage`. Frontend UI assets (Inter font, Lucide icons, and Chart.js for dashboard and PDF reports) are bundled locally for 100% offline use.

```text
GET    /api/knowledge/search?q=sleep&top_k=3
GET    /api/knowledge/status
GET    /api/memory/{session_id}
DELETE /api/memory/{session_id}
```

### Retrieval quality

The threshold is measured, not guessed. `evals/rag_retrieval.json` holds 18 versioned cases — 14 that must return a specific knowledge-base section and 4 out-of-scope questions that must return nothing at all — scored by `src/rag/evaluation.py`:

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| recall@3 | 85.7% (0.857) |
| MRR | 0.702 |
| Abstention accuracy (negative cases) | 100% (1.0) |

Measured on `paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2` at threshold `0.46`, index version `a07db2f30577badb`, 53 chunks. The lowest passing positive scored `0.495` and the highest negative scored `0.255` — the threshold sits in that gap. Reproduce with:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_rag.py --top-k 3 --threshold 0.46
```

This is a repository regression set, not a clinical-quality evaluation.

### Data sovereignty & storage

- **Database location:** `data/cbt_sessions.db` (single-file SQLite database).
- **Backups:** Copy `data/cbt_sessions.db` to back up all diary entries, tests, and conversation memory.
- **Data deletion:** Delete `data/cbt_sessions.db` and click **Reset all data** in Settings to clear browser `localStorage`.

Index caching, rebuilds, and degraded-mode behaviour are described in [ARCHITECTURE](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Limitations & Safety

- **Crisis safety** — CBT Assistant is designed for self-help and mild-to-moderate distress; it does **not** include automated real-time suicide or crisis detection. If you are experiencing acute distress, self-harm impulses, or suicidal thoughts, please contact local emergency services or a crisis line (e.g., 988 in the US/Canada, 112 in the EU).
- **Network** — core chat, RAG, and journaling are 100% offline. Optional voice features (edge-tts synthesis, browser Web Speech API) and YouTube ambient media connect to external services.
- **Security** — binds to `127.0.0.1:8000` by default (safe on public Wi-Fi). If you expose it to a local network (`HOST=0.0.0.0`), note that it has permissive CORS and no authentication layer; keep it off public or untrusted networks.
- **Performance** — chat quality, latency, and memory use depend on your hardware and model; chat is unavailable until the embedding index finishes building.
- **Platform** — no Docker image and no Linux launcher; Linux setup is manual.
