## What This Is

Keyoku is not a vector database. It's a **cognitive engine** — the system that sits behind an AI agent and gives it the ability to remember, understand connections, and act on what it knows.

**Memory that lives.** Memories aren't rows in a table. They're extracted from conversations, deduplicated by meaning, merged when they overlap, and decay when unused — just like human memory. Important things stick. Irrelevant things fade.

**A knowledge graph that grows itself.** Every conversation automatically builds a graph of people, organizations, and how they relate. The agent doesn't just remember "Alice mentioned Bob" — it knows Alice works at Acme, Bob is her manager, and they're collaborating on a Q3 launch.

**A brain that doesn't wait to be asked.** The heartbeat system scans 12 signal categories across your entire memory store — deadlines, goals, sentiment shifts, relationship gaps, behavioral patterns — combines weak signals into decisions, enriches everything with the knowledge graph, and compiles it through an LLM into a single actionable output.

Zero external dependencies. Pure Go. SQLite + in-process HNSW. Your data never leaves your machine.

## Keyoku Harness Integration

The engine is the brain of [Keyoku](https://github.com/Keyoku-ai/keyoku) — the
workflow harness for coding agents. Point the harness at a running engine:

```bash
keyoku-server &                     # embedder only; Ollama works, no API key needed
export KEYOKU_ENGINE_URL=http://localhost:18900
```

The harness mirrors its knowledge layer (connector descriptions, mined
practice patterns, agent research, CLAUDE.md conventions) into the engine via
`POST /api/v1/seed` — the extraction-free door — and upgrades `knowledge_query`
to semantic search via `POST /api/v1/search`. Decay, dedup, and the knowledge
graph apply automatically. The harness degrades to local JSONL when no engine
is configured.

> **Subsystem status for the harness product:** storage, search, embeddings,
> dedup, decay, and the knowledge graph are the active core. The heartbeat /
> proactive-nudge subsystem predates the harness relaunch and is not used by
> it — it remains maintained for standalone memory-engine deployments and
> will be superseded by a slimmer trigger scan.

## Quick Start

### As a Go library

```bash
go get github.com/keyoku-ai/keyoku-engine
```

```go
import keyoku "github.com/keyoku-ai/keyoku-engine"

k, err := keyoku.New(keyoku.Config{
    DBPath:             "./memories.db",
    ExtractionProvider: "openai",
    OpenAIAPIKey:       os.Getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
})
defer k.Close()

// Store memories from a conversation
result, _ := k.Remember(ctx, keyoku.RememberInput{
    EntityID: "user-123",
    Messages: messages,
})

// Search by meaning
memories, _ := k.Search(ctx, keyoku.SearchInput{
    EntityID: "user-123",
    Query:    "what are their preferences?",
    Limit:    5,
})

// Zero-token heartbeat — no LLM call, pure local query
heartbeat, _ := k.HeartbeatCheck(ctx, keyoku.HeartbeatCheckInput{
    EntityIDs: []string{"user-123"},
})
```

### As an HTTP server

```bash
make build
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
./bin/keyoku-server --db ./memories.db
```

Default port: `18900` (override with `--port` or `KEYOKU_PORT`).

## The Brain

The heartbeat is the standalone memory-engine's proactive layer — it turns passive memory into active intelligence. *(The Keyoku harness does not use it; see the subsystem-status note above.)*

### How it works

Every tick, the brain runs a **zero-token scan** — 12 SQL-driven checks across your entire memory store, costing nothing. Only when it finds something worth acting on does it spend LLM tokens to compile a response.

### What it scans

| Signal | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Scheduled tasks** | "Daily standup prep" fired at 9am |
| **Deadline proximity** | Project due in 47 minutes — forced immediate |
| **Pending work** | 3 unfinished plans, highest importance first |
| **Goal progress** | "API migration" went from 20% to 60% since last check |
| **Session continuity** | User was mid-conversation about deployment 2h ago |
| **Sentiment shift** | Mood declined over last 5 conversations |
| **Relationship gaps** | Haven't heard from Alice in 12 days |
| **Knowledge gaps** | Agent couldn't answer a question last week |
| **Behavioral patterns** | User typically does code reviews on Tuesdays |
| **Conflicts** | Two memories contradict each other |
| **Stale monitors** | A tracked plan hasn't been touched in 24h |
| **Decaying memories** | Important memory approaching decay threshold |

### What makes it smart

The brain doesn't just check signals — it **thinks about them**:

- **Confluence.** Five weak signals combine to trigger action. A fading memory + a sentiment dip + a relationship gap + a stale plan + a behavioral pattern = worth mentioning, even though none alone would be.

- **Response awareness.** If the user ignores nudges, the brain backs off — 3x cooldown at 30% response rate, 10x at under 10%. No spam.

- **Topic dedup.** Same topic won't resurface just because the memory ID changed. The brain checks entity overlap between current signals and recent decisions.

- **Deadline gradient.** A deadline in 47 minutes is not the same as one in 20 hours. Proximity scoring creates urgency naturally — and critical deadlines bypass quiet hours.

- **Progress detection.** When a goal improves (at_risk to on_track) or a silent contact re-engages, the brain notices and surfaces it as a positive change. Agents should acknowledge improvement, not just nag.

- **Pattern matching.** Nudges are matched to the user's behavioral patterns. If they typically do deep work on Wednesdays, the brain finds related plans and surfaces them.

- **Graph enrichment.** Before sending signals to the LLM, the brain traverses the knowledge graph — collecting entity relationships so the LLM understands WHO is involved and HOW they connect, not just raw text.

The LLM receives a structured prompt with signals, knowledge graph context, and positive changes. It outputs an action brief, recommended actions, urgency level, and a user-facing message. The brain gates this — the LLM can suppress a "should act" decision, but never promote one. The engine always has final say.

### Autonomy levels

| Level | Sees signals | Messages user | Takes action |
|-------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `observe` | Yes | No | No |
| `suggest` | Yes | Yes (as suggestions) | No |
| `act` | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Memory Lifecycle

Memories flow through four states, managed automatically by background jobs:

```
ACTIVE ──decay──▶ STALE ──decay──▶ ARCHIVED ──decay──▶ DELETED
  ▲                                    │
  └────── access reinforcement ────────┘
```

**Decay** follows an Ebbinghaus curve with access-frequency boosting — memories that get retrieved resist decay. 10 accesses = 2.2x stability. 50 accesses = 2.96x stability. Stability varies by type: ephemeral memories last 3 days, identity memories last 365.

**Consolidation** runs hourly, merging similar memories (0.85+ similarity) via LLM synthesis — eliminating redundancy while preserving all important facts.

**Deduplication** catches duplicates at write time — both exact (hash) and semantic (0.95 threshold). Near-duplicates (0.75+) get merged instead of rejected.

**Conflict detection** uses LLM analysis to find contradictions and recommend resolution: keep existing, use new, merge, or ask the user.

## Knowledge Graph

Built automatically from every conversation:

- **Entities** — people, organizations, locations, products. Extracted via proper noun detection + type inference. Aliases tracked (max 10 per entity). Semantic matching at 0.85 threshold.

- **Relationships** — 40+ auto-detected types (works_at, manages, friend_of, married_to, etc.) with strength, confidence, and evidence tracking. Bidirectional inference.

- **Graph traversal** — BFS up to 5 hops, shortest path between entities, LLM-powered explanations of how two entities connect.

```go
// Find how Alice and Bob are connected
path, _ := k.Graph().FindPath(ctx, "owner-id", aliceID, bobID)

// Get a natural language explanation
explanation, _ := k.Graph().ExplainConnection(ctx, "owner-id", aliceID, bobID)
// => "Alice works at Acme Corp where Bob is a senior engineer.
//     They're both assigned to the Q3 product launch."
```
