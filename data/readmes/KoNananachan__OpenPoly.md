Experimental live-trading system for [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com)
prediction markets. A single-process Python backend drives an event-driven
strategy pipeline; a React Flow canvas lets you wire that pipeline up and tune
it visually.

> ⚠️ **openPoly can place real orders with real money.** It defaults to **paper
> mode** and never touches funds until you explicitly switch to live. Prediction
> markets are high risk and restricted in many jurisdictions. Read the
> [DISCLAIMER](./DISCLAIMER.md) before going anywhere near live mode.

## See the demo first (no backend, no setup)

[![openPoly strategy canvas — the live-section pipeline with a node's config panel open](docs/images/strategy-canvas.jpg)](https://konananachan.github.io/OpenPoly/)

**▶ Live demo: <https://konananachan.github.io/OpenPoly/>** — the real frontend
with mock data, running entirely in your browser. Click and look around; nothing
connects to a backend and no funds are involved. All numbers, positions, and
news are **mock data**; clicking a live action (Run/Pause, save keys, …) just
pops a "demo mode" notice — nothing real happens. For the full thing with a live
paper-trading backend, use the Quickstart below.

## What it is

openPoly trades one strategy at a time at grain-scale capital ($5–$50), built to
iterate fast and validate signal alpha on real markets. The strategy decision
logic is **atomized into pluggable "sections"** — typed, swappable modules
(news source, market source, embedding, analyzer, entry, exit, …) that you can
reconfigure on the canvas without touching the framework.

It is a deliberately **single system**: one process, one pipeline, one SQLite
file — zero infra to stand up. See
[`docs/architecture/`](./docs/architecture/00-overview.md) for the design.

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Backend | Python + FastAPI, single process |
| Storage | SQLite (single writer) |
| Polymarket SDK | `py-clob-client` |
| Frontend | React + React Flow (strategy canvas) |

> **Built on external APIs.** openPoly is a thin orchestration layer over two
> third-party services: news signals come from the **TradingNews API**, and all
> market data and order placement go through the **official Polymarket API**
> (via [`py-clob-client`](https://github.com/Polymarket/py-clob-client)). It
> ships no proprietary data or matching of its own — you bring credentials for
> each service (see `.env.example`) and openPoly wires them into the pipeline.

## Features

- **Visual strategy canvas** — wire up and tune the whole decision pipeline on a
  React Flow canvas. Each node is a section; edit its config inline, no redeploy.
- **Pluggable typed sections** — the decision logic is atomized into swappable
  modules (news source, market source, embedding, analyzer, entry, exit,
  database). Each has a Pydantic `Config`, so its params are a single source of
  truth shared by backend and canvas.
- **Event-driven, single process** — one FastAPI process drives the pipeline; the
  runtime owns scheduling, capability injection, audit, and timeouts.
- **Paper mode by default** — runs against real markets with no funds at risk;
  live order placement is an explicit, deliberate opt-in.
- **Live activity monitoring** — equity curve, open positions, and the incoming
  news feed update as the strategy runs.
- **Zero hardcoded secrets** — every credential resolves via `*_ref` indirection
  (`env:` / `local:` / keychain); nothing sensitive lives in the repo.
- **Zero infra** — a single Python process and one SQLite file. Nothing to stand
  up, nothing to orchestrate.

## Early results — a first read on the signal

openPoly has run **live, on real money** on Polymarket (Polygon mainnet) at
grain scale ($1–$10 per entry). One window — 25 positions over ~6 days — is a
tiny sample, but it already says something useful about *where the edge lives*.

![Equity curve — realized + unrealized, marked to bid](docs/images/equity-curve.jpg)

| Live window · 2026-05-25 → 05-31 | Result |
|---|---|
| Realized return on notional, net of fees | **+5.2%** |
| Mark-to-market return (snapshot) | +6.7% |
| Closed win rate | 62% (13 / 21) |
| Live fills / distinct positions | 46 / 25 |
| Entry notional deployed | $229.42 |
| On-chain settlement | 39 / 40 receipts `0x1` |

**Every entry (25/25) was triggered by an incoming news item** — openPoly never
trades on price alone. And after those news-triggered entries, **23 of 25
positions moved in the trade's favor** before exit, several sharply (post-entry
peaks of +67%, +80%, +142%, +161% against entry price). The news, in other
words, tended to arrive *ahead* of the market repricing. That is where the edge
appears to live — in the **news signal itself** (streamed in via the TradingNews
API), not in anything clever downstream.

The realized number is deliberately modest next to those peaks, and that gap is
the honest takeaway: the *signal* found the move; the *exit logic* gave most of
it back (one position peaked +161% but booked +$1.68; another ran +142% then
stopped out at −$2.90). Closed win rate was 13/21.

> A tiny, early sample (n=25) on grain-scale capital — **suggestive** of a real
> directional edge, not a proven or repeatable return. Past results say nothing
> about the future, and openPoly is not investment advice. Read the
> [DISCLAIMER](./DISCLAIMER.md) before going near live mode.

### How a trade gets decided

`news_source → embedding → analyzer → entry → exit`, each a swappable section: a
news item arrives, the **embedding** narrows it to the markets it actually moves,
the **analyzer** scores the directional signal, **entry** fires only past an edge
threshold, and **exit** manages the position (take-profit / trailing-stop /
stop-loss).

### Where it improves next

The data points the work at *exits and sizing*, not the signal:

- **Let winners run** — trailing/stop exits surrendered large post-entry peaks;
  conviction-scaled holds would keep more of the move the signal already found.
- **Size by conviction** — flat ~$5–10 sizing treats a +161% setup like a coin
  flip; weighting by analyzer confidence concentrates capital on the strongest
  signals.
- **Tighter entries** — a few stop-losses fired on positions that peaked sharply
  in their favor first; better entry timing and slippage control would convert
  more of those into wins.

## Strategy changelog

The strategy is a living thing — entry gates, exit thresholds, and risk
brakes have all changed as paper and live data came in, and each change is
recorded with its reasoning (including the ideas that were considered and
rejected). See **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)** for the full
decision-by-decision history.

## Quickstart (paper mode, same machine)

**Prerequisites:** [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python toolchain) and
Node.js + `yarn`.

```bash
# 1. Backend — binds 127.0.0.1:8000, paper mode by default
uv run uvicorn openpoly.api.main:app

# 2. Frontend — in another terminal, proxies to the local backend on :8000
cd frontend && yarn install && yarn dev
```

Open the Vite URL it prints and the strategy canvas loads. No environment
variables, no funds, no live orders — paper mode is the default. To configure
secrets for later, copy `.env.example` to `.env` (gitignored) and fill it in.

**Trading live from a Polymarket-geoblocked region?** Order placement is region
-blocked there, so the backend has to run from an allowed region while the
frontend stays local. See [`docs/deploy/`](./docs/deploy/README.md).

Two naming gotchas worth internalizing: `openpoly/db/` (the SQLite engine) is
**not** `sections/database/` (a swappable database *section*), and
`openpoly/news/` · `markets/` (domain logic) are **not**
`sections/news_source/` · `market_source/` (section impls).

## Extending it

Strategy work happens in **sections**. To add your own, drop a class implementing
the section contract (`SECTION_TYPE`, `SECTION_VERSION`, `REQUIRES`, `Config`,
`run`) into [`openpoly/user_sections/`](./openpoly/user_sections/README.md) — the
registry discovers it at startup. That directory is gitignored, so your private
strategies stay local. Full contract: [`docs/architecture/02-strategy-sections.md`](./docs/architecture/02-strategy-sections.md).

## Ethos

- **MIT** licensed — open source is a mindset, not a future milestone.
- **Published and maintained by KoNananachan** — this public repo is the canonical
  openPoly release.
- **Default paper mode** — live trading requires explicit opt-in.
- **Zero hardcoded secrets** — everything via `*_ref` indirection (env / keychain).
- **Cross-platform** — Linux / macOS first.
