# audiosilo-meta

The open source community audiobook database behind
[meta.audiosilo.app](https://meta.audiosilo.app) - audiobook metadata, in the open.

**The GitHub repository is the database.** Metadata lives as plain JSON pack
files - many records to a file, addressed by slug range
([PACK-SPEC.md](PACK-SPEC.md)) - edited by pull request or issue form, validated
by Go tooling in CI, and compiled into a single SQLite artifact that servers
consume.

> **Status: Phase 1 shipped, Phase 2 landed.** Governance, schemas, the
> validation/build pipeline, the OpenAudible and Libation importers, the
> read-only **API server** (`metaserve`), the **website** (`site/`, served by
> metaserve at meta.audiosilo.app), the Docker image, the in-browser `/import`
> diff, the **Audiobookshelf** metadata-provider endpoint, and issue-form intake
> automation are all built. The characters/recaps CC BY-SA layer (Phase 2) is
> live across the schema, tooling, and data - and since 2026-08-21 it lives in
> its own repository,
> [audiosilo-meta-community](https://github.com/KodeStar/audiosilo-meta-community),
> which the release build composes into the same artifact. Still open: Open
> Library / Wikidata crosswalk seeding. Only claim what exists.

## Why this exists

No existing open database is both **audiobook-specific** and
**community-editable**:

- Open Library, Wikidata and Inventaire are open (CC0) but have essentially no
  audiobook structure - no narrator field of substance, no chapters, no runtime.
- BookBrainz has no audiobook format and no narrator field.
- Audnexus (the backend Audiobookshelf and Plex read from) is a read-only cache
  over Audible's own catalogue; its own README says it exists only "during the
  interim of waiting for a community driven audiobook database."

So narrators, specific recordings, and chapters are treated here as
**first-class data** - the fields every other database lacks, and the reason this
project exists.

## How the pipeline works

```
  contributor
      │  pull request  /  issue form
      ▼
  data/*.json  ──►  CI validation  ──►  meta.sqlite  ──►  API server + site
  (the database)    (metacheck +        (release          (metaserve,
                     metafmt, Go)        artifact)          read-only)
```

1. Contributors add or edit JSON files in `data/` (by pull request, or via issue
   forms that become pull requests).
2. CI validates every pull request - schema, canonical formatting, referential
   integrity, and identifier uniqueness. A red pull request never merges.
3. On merge to `main`, a release workflow builds `meta.sqlite` and attaches it
   (gzipped, with a checksum) to a dated GitHub Release.
4. Servers download that artifact and serve a read-only API. All writes go
   through GitHub; there are no server-side accounts.

## The data model

- **Work** - the abstract book (title, authors, language, series membership).
- **Recording** - a specific narration of a work (narrators, abridged flag,
  runtime, release date, publisher, region-scoped ASINs, ISBNs, cover URL,
  chapters). One work, many recordings. A production released in several
  marketplaces stays *one* recording: an ISBN may be written as
  `{"isbn": ..., "region": ...}` when the region is known, and `publishers[]`
  records the other regions' imprints beside the publisher of record.
- **Person** - a human shared across roles (author on works, narrator on
  recordings; can be both).
- **Series** - a named series with an ordered list of member works (string
  positions such as `"2.5"`).

*Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* is one **work** with two
**recordings** - Stephen Fry and Jim Dale - each carrying its own ASINs. That is
the shape this project is built around. Full details in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Repository layout

```
data/          the CC0 database: works/, people/, series/ + redirects.json (range-packed JSON, see PACK-SPEC.md)
               (the CC BY-SA characters/recaps layer lives in KodeStar/audiosilo-meta-community)
schema/        JSON Schemas (one per entity) - authoritative field definitions
cmd/           Go tooling: metacheck (validate), metafmt (canonicalise), metabuild (SQLite), metaserve (API server)
internal/      shared Go packages behind the tooling (build, check, serve, ...)
Dockerfile     container image: API server + static site (no baked data)
.github/       issue forms + CI workflows (check, release, image)
CONTRIBUTING.md  GOVERNANCE.md  LICENSING.md
```

## Quickstart

Requires **Go 1.26+** (pure Go, no cgo, no external services).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kodestar/audiosilo-meta
cd audiosilo-meta

# The gate - run before opening a pull request:
go build ./... && go vet ./... && go test ./... && \
  go run ./cmd/metacheck --profile core && go run ./cmd/metafmt --check --profile core

# Build the CORE-ONLY SQLite artifact locally (validates first). The REAL
# artifact composes both repositories - add --community <community-checkout>/data:
go run ./cmd/metabuild -o meta.sqlite
```

- `--profile core` is what CI passes, and what this repository's tree is: works,
  people, series. Without it the tools read the root as a whole database and
  quietly adopt a stray `data/works-community/` file that CI reports as an
  unrecognized location - so a green local run would not mean a green PR.
- `metacheck` - schema, referential integrity, and uniqueness validation.
- `metafmt --check` / `--write` - canonical JSON (sorted keys, 2-space indent,
  trailing newline) plus pack placement: `--write` moves an entry to the pack its
  slug belongs in and splits a pack that has outgrown its caps, so nobody has to
  work placement out by hand.
- `metabuild -o meta.sqlite` - compile the database into a SQLite file
  (`--community <dir>` composes the community checkout in; without it the
  artifact is the core half only). A work's
  `added_at` comes from the record; one that carries none falls back to the
  newest `sources[].imported_at`.
- `metamigrate` - the one-off conversion of a pre-pack, file-per-record tree into
  the pack layout (`--out <dir>` to rehearse without touching the source).

## Running the API server

`metaserve` is a read-only JSON API over the compiled artifact - FTS search,
work/person/series detail, chapter lists, and ASIN/ISBN lookup. All data is
public, so there is no auth; the API sends permissive CORS.

```sh
# Dev: build the artifact, then serve it locally.
go run ./cmd/metabuild -o meta.sqlite
go run ./cmd/metaserve --db meta.sqlite --addr :8080

curl localhost:8080/healthz
curl 'localhost:8080/api/v1/search?q=dragon'
curl 'localhost:8080/api/v1/works/latest'
curl 'localhost:8080/api/v1/lookup?asin=B08G9PRS1K'
```

Key endpoints (all under `/api/v1`): `stats`, `search?q=&limit=`,
`works/latest?limit=`, `works/{id}`, `works/{id}/recordings/{rid}/chapters`,
`people/{id}`, `series/{id}`, `lookup?asin=|isbn=`, `coverage`,
`coverage/works`, `coverage/series-gaps`, plus `/healthz`.

Work-detail recordings also carry `purchase_links` - non-affiliate Audible and
Libro.fm URLs derived at response time from recording ASINs and 13-digit
recording ISBNs, with availability deliberately `unknown` (see the API docs).
The work page renders them: the server-rendered fact sheet lists every link, and
the island leads with the marketplace the reader's browser languages suggest,
keeping every other recorded region one click away.

`people/{id}` and `series/{id}` take an optional `?limit=&offset=` window and
report the unpaged totals (`authored_total`/`narrated_total`, `works_total`).
They differ in default: a person's credit lists are paged (100 per page, 500
max) because they are unbounded - a corporate credit such as "Full Cast"
narrates thousands of works - while a series returns every member work unless a
window is asked for, because the player's series rail is composed from the full
list.

The coverage endpoints back the site's contribute page. `coverage` returns the
top-line band only - how many works carry characters/recaps/whole-book recap
summaries - so it stays tiny at any catalogue size. `coverage/works?filter=&q=
&limit=&offset=` is the paginated, searchable browser: `filter` is `missing`
(missing any dimension) or `has_characters`/`has_recaps`/`has_recap_summary`; `q`
matches a work's title, authors, narrators and series through the same full-text
index as `search` (whole words and word prefixes, not mid-word substrings); the
response carries a per-filter
`available` flag that is
false when the dimension is not evaluable at the artifact's schema version.
`coverage/series-gaps?q=&limit=&offset=` is the paginated, name-searchable list
of series with interior position gaps.

Flags: `--db` (local artifact), `--site <dir>` (serve a static site at `/`),
`--poll` (fetch and hot-swap the latest published data release from GitHub),
`--repo` (default `KodeStar/audiosilo-meta`), `--interval` (default `1h`),
`--cache` (download dir). With `--poll` and no `--db` - what the container image
runs - the server fetches the newest data release (the newest release carrying
`meta.sqlite.gz`; code/image `v*` releases are skipped) on boot, streaming it to
the cache directory and verifying the published checksum before it counts. If
that first fetch fails the process does not exit. It first falls back to the
newest artifact already in the cache directory - what the previous container was
serving - and serves that, logged as stale, until a release loads. Only with
nothing cached does it come up empty (static site served, `/healthz` and every
API route 503 with a clear message, and a `Retry-After` reporting the wait
actually in force). Either way it retries after 30s and then backs off, doubling
up to `--interval`, so an unreachable GitHub is a logged outage rather than a
container crash loop. A restart while GitHub is reachable does not re-download
what the cache already holds either: the cached artifact for the newest release
is verified against that release's published checksum and adopted as is. With
`--db` as well, the local artifact serves immediately
and the poller still runs a refresh at startup (not just once per `--interval`).
Superseded artifacts are pruned from the cache after each hot-swap. Set
`GITHUB_TOKEN` to raise the API rate limit.

For immediate production refreshes, set `METASERVE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to a random
value of at least 32 bytes while keeping `--poll` enabled. This registers
`POST /hooks/github/release`, authenticated with the standard
`X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=...` HMAC header. The release workflow calls the
endpoint only after every release asset has uploaded, then metaserve re-queries
GitHub, verifies the published checksums, and uses the same atomic hot-swap path
as polling. The webhook never trusts or installs data from its request body.
Hourly polling stays enabled as a fallback for a missed delivery.

Configure the deployment and GitHub repository with the same secret:

1. Generate a secret, for example with `openssl rand -hex 32`, and expose it to
   the container as `METASERVE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
2. Add the Actions secret `METASERVE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` with that value.
3. Add the Actions secret `METASERVE_WEBHOOK_URL` with the public endpoint, for
   example `https://meta.audiosilo.app/hooks/github/release`.

The endpoint is not registered when the deployment secret is absent. A missing
workflow configuration or failed delivery is non-fatal because the fallback
poller will still discover the release.

### Docker

The image bundles the server and the static site (built from `site/`) - and no
data. On boot it downloads the newest published data release into the cache
volume, then accepts signed release refreshes when configured and polls as a
fallback. Keeping the catalogue out of the image means a site or server change
neither rebuilds nor ships the database, and the image size is independent of
how large the catalogue grows.

```sh
docker build -t audiosilo-meta .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v audiosilo-meta-cache:/data ghcr.io/kodestar/audiosilo-meta:latest
```

For a real deployment use the committed [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml):
loopback-only port (a TLS reverse proxy such as nginx/Ploi fronts it), a named
volume for the release-download cache, an optional signed release webhook, and
hourly fallback polling. The image entrypoint carries all required flags;
`command:` appends extras (for example `command: ["--interval", "15m"]`).
Health check endpoint: `/healthz` - a readiness check, so it answers 503
`{"status":"starting"}` until the first artifact has loaded.

The `image` workflow builds and pushes `ghcr.io/kodestar/audiosilo-meta` on a
`v*` tag.

## Scanning a local library (metascan)

`metascan` is the low-friction way to contribute a library when you have only
audio files - no OpenAudible or Libation export. Point it at a folder and it
walks the tree, gathers whatever metadata it can find, and writes a JSON file the
meta.audiosilo.app import page accepts.

```sh
go run github.com/kodestar/audiosilo-meta/cmd/metascan@main /path/to/audiobooks -o scan.json
```

Then drop `scan.json` onto **meta.audiosilo.app/import**.

It runs entirely on your machine and **sends nothing anywhere** - it only reads
files. What it gathers, per book:

- **Embedded tags** (via [dhowden/tag](https://github.com/dhowden/tag)): title,
  authors, narrators, and an ASIN when Libation/OpenAudible embedded one.
- **The folder structure**, treated as a first-class source (tags are often
  missing or wrong, series data especially): `Author/Book`,
  `Author/Series/Book`, and name patterns like `01 - Title`, `Book 3 - Title`,
  `Title, Book 3`, and `Jack Reacher 03 - Title` yield author/series/position/
  title.
- **An ASIN** - the anchor that makes a sparse book matchable - hunted in tag
  atoms and in file/folder names (for example `Title [B076HYPQLK]`).
- **Runtime and chapter counts**, if `ffprobe` is on your `PATH`. Without it the
  scan still works; those two fields are simply omitted.

Have `ffprobe` installed if you can: it is also the deeper tag reader. The pure
Go reader covers the common title/author/narrator tags plus MP3 user frames,
but several audiobook-specific fields are reachable only through ffprobe -
Audible/Libation freeform MP4 atoms (ASIN and friends), m4b stream language,
and various container extras. Without ffprobe, embedded series/ASIN extraction
is limited (especially for m4b files); the folder-structure heuristics still
work in full.

Every field records where it came from (`tag` / `path` / `filename`) in the
book's `sources` map, and unknown fields are omitted rather than guessed.
Grouping follows the workspace convention: a folder that directly contains audio
is one book (its files are the parts), and loose files at the scan root are
individual single-file books. One evidence-gated exception: when a folder's
files carry mutually distinct album tags (or distinct, non-generic title tags
that each match their own filename), that is a flat folder of separate
single-file books - the common `Series/01 - A.m4b, 02 - B.m4b` layout - and each
file becomes its own book, with the folder feeding the series/author heuristics.
Without tag evidence the folder is always kept as one book (never split on
filenames alone), and a multi-file folder with no signal either way is counted
in the summary so you know where to check for collections. The JSON goes to
stdout by default (or `-o <file>`); a human-readable summary goes to stderr.
Pass `-ffprobe ""` to skip ffprobe enrichment.

## Audiobookshelf

`metaserve` doubles as an **Audiobookshelf custom metadata provider**. An ABS
admin adds it under **Settings -> Item Metadata Utils -> Custom Metadata
Providers** with the URL `https://meta.audiosilo.app/abs` and no authentication
(the data is public); it needs ABS **v2.8.0 or newer**. Once added it appears in
each book's **Match** / **Quick Match** picker (it is not used by the background
scanner), for book libraries only.

The endpoint is `GET /abs/search`. ABS sends `?mediaType=book&query=<title>`
(with optional `&author=` and `&isbn=`) and never an ASIN; the server returns
`{"matches": [...]}` with one entry per **recording**, up to 10 - an exact ISBN
lookup first, otherwise an FTS title search with loose author boosting. Each
match carries title, subtitle, author, narrator, publisher, publishedYear,
description, cover, ISBN, ASIN, series + sequence, language, duration (in
minutes), and genres when the work carries them (values from the project's own
normalized genre vocabulary - never a retailer's category tree). Tags are
deliberately never returned. The [`/audiobookshelf`](https://meta.audiosilo.app/audiobookshelf)
site page walks through both directions (adding the provider, and exporting an
ABS library into `/import`).

## Contributing

New contributions are welcome - by direct pull request or by issue form (no JSON
required). Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md); the merge policy and
trust tiers are in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).

Data rules in brief: factual fields only, no publisher blurbs, covers as URLs,
own-words descriptions, `sources[]` on every record, and a CC0 dedication for
every submission.

## Licensing

| What | Licence |
|---|---|
| Code (tooling, schemas, CI, future server) | **AGPL-3.0-only** ([`LICENSE`](LICENSE)) |
| Data - factual core (works, recordings, people, series) | **CC0-1.0** public domain dedication |
| Data - derived layer (characters and recaps) | **CC BY-SA 4.0**, in its own repository: [audiosilo-meta-community](https://github.com/KodeStar/audiosilo-meta-community) |

**This repository holds no share-alike content.** Since the community-repo split
the CC BY-SA layer is a separate repository; the release artifact is composed
from both, so `meta.sqlite` still carries characters and recaps and each record
states its own licence.

Publisher blurbs and cover art are referenced, never copied. Full policy,
including the takedown / rightsholder opt-out channel, in
[LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md).

## Roadmap

- **Phase 0** (done) - governance, schemas, CI validation, the SQLite builder, and
  hand-curated records that prove the pipeline (including multi-recording works).
- **Phase 1** - the read-only Go API server (`metaserve`, FTS search + ASIN/ISBN
  lookup), the website (`site/` - search-first landing, stats, latest additions,
  work/person/series pages), the Docker image, the OpenAudible and Libation
  importers, the public deployment (meta.audiosilo.app), the in-browser import
  page (`/import` - parses an OpenAudible export, a Libation export, an
  Audiobookshelf library export, or a metascan folder scan client-side and diffs
  it against the live catalogue), and **issue-form intake automation** (a data
  issue form becomes a validated bot pull request - see
  [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md)) have **landed**. Still planned: seeding from
  Open Library / Wikidata identifier crosswalks.
- **Phase 1.5 - AudioSilo player integration** - the AudioSilo server
  (`GET /libraries/{id}/meta`) and player surface enriched metadata from this
  database, capability-gated and behind an admin off-switch. This priority
  integration has **landed**, and the **Audiobookshelf metadata-provider facade**
  (`GET /abs/search`, see above) has now shipped on top of it.
- **Phase 2** - community-authored characters and recaps under strict length and
  originality rules, in a separately-tagged CC BY-SA layer, have **landed**: the
  schema enforces the layer structurally, `metacheck` validates it, and
  `metabuild`/`metaserve` ship it. The layer itself now lives in
  [audiosilo-meta-community](https://github.com/KodeStar/audiosilo-meta-community),
  which is also where its issue forms and its authoring guide are; the release
  artifact is composed from the two repositories.
- **Phase 3+** - the source-to-sidecar extraction tooling (`metaextract` plus the
  documented agent process) has **landed**; deeper player rendering gated by the
  listener's progress position is in progress.

Community: questions, contribution help, and coordination happen on the
[AudioSilo Discord](https://discord.gg/nFFqRbkRn6) and in GitHub Discussions.

Design basis: the workspace feasibility study (`../META-FEASIBILITY.md`).
