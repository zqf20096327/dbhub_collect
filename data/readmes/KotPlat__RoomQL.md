---

A query whose **filter values** vary at runtime already has a fine static answer: `WHERE (:minAge IS NULL OR age >= :minAge)`, one `@Query`, one method, checked by Room at compile time. A query whose **structure** varies — which column to sort or group by, whether a join is present, which columns to project — is a harder problem: SQL can bind a *value* as a parameter, never an *identifier*, so a static `@Query` can only reach that with a `CASE`-expression ladder that gets unreadable fast, or can't reach it at all for a dynamic `SELECT` list. **RoomQL** replaces both problems with one typed DSL: a KSP processor generates a `Column<T>` for every column in your `@Entity` classes, so `orderBy`, `groupBy`, `join`, and `select` take real, rename-safe Kotlin symbols, and `where { }`'s null-skipping filters cover the values case in the same block. (Exactly which parts of "structure" are merely awkward in static SQL versus genuinely impossible is worth knowing precisely — see the [comparison](#how-roomql-compares-to-the-alternatives) below.)

## Installation

Declare the version catalog entries (`gradle/libs.versions.toml`):

```toml
[versions]
roomql = "2.0.0"

[libraries]
roomql-runtime-android = { module = "io.github.kotplat.roomql:runtime-android", version.ref = "roomql" }
roomql-ksp-processor   = { module = "io.github.kotplat.roomql:ksp-processor",   version.ref = "roomql" }
```

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.google.devtools.ksp")
}

dependencies {
    implementation(libs.roomql.runtime.android)   // the .toQuery() bridge to Room; pulls in :runtime transitively
    ksp(libs.roomql.ksp.processor)                // generates the *Table objects
}
```

That's the whole dependency block for Android use — `:runtime-android` already depends on `:runtime` (the `query { }` DSL), so it comes along automatically. `ksp(...)` can't be folded into it: Gradle has no mechanism to pull an annotation/symbol processor transitively through `implementation`/`api`, so every KSP-based library (Room, Moshi, Hilt included) needs its own explicit `ksp(...)` line.

Add `io.github.kotplat.roomql:runtime` directly only if you want the DSL without the Room bridge — for example, unit-testing generated SQL on the plain JVM with no emulator. See [Modules](#modules) for what each artifact contains.

### Requirements

| Dependency | Version |
|---|---|
| Kotlin | 2.0.21 or newer (tested on 2.0.21, 2.1.21, and 2.2.0) |
| KSP | The version matching your Kotlin. KSP1 and KSP2 both work. |
| Room | 2.6.x – 2.7.x (tested on 2.6.1 and 2.7.2; KSP2 needs Room 2.7+) |
| Android | minSdk 21+ |
| JDK (to run the build) | 17 or newer |
| App Java target | Any on Android. Pure-JVM use of `runtime` needs Java 17+. |

## Minimal working example

```kotlin
import androidx.room.Dao
import androidx.room.Entity
import androidx.room.PrimaryKey
import androidx.room.RawQuery
import androidx.sqlite.db.SupportSQLiteQuery
import com.roomql.android.toQuery
import com.roomql.runtime.SortDirection
import com.roomql.runtime.query

@Entity(tableName = "users")
data class UserEntity(
    @PrimaryKey val id: Int,
    val name: String,
    val age: Int,
    val status: String,
)
// KSP generates UserEntityTable in the same package.

@Dao
interface UserDao {
    @RawQuery
    fun search(q: SupportSQLiteQuery): List<UserEntity>
}

fun searchUsers(dao: UserDao, minAge: Int?, status: String?): List<UserEntity> {
    val q = query {
        from(UserEntityTable)
        where {
            UserEntityTable.age gteIfNotNull minAge      // dropped from the SQL when minAge is null
            UserEntityTable.status eqIfNotNull status    // dropped from the SQL when status is null
        }
        orderBy(UserEntityTable.age, SortDirection.DESC)
        limit(20)
    }
    return dao.search(q.toQuery())
}
```

`searchUsers(dao, 18, "active")` runs `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age >= ? AND status = ? ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 20`.
`searchUsers(dao, 18, null)` runs `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age >= ? ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 20`.
`searchUsers(dao, null, null)` runs `SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 20`.

No `if` ladders, no `IS NULL OR` trick, and `UserEntityTable.age` is a real Kotlin symbol — rename the property or the column and the code stops compiling.

### A case a static `@Query` makes you fight for

Optional filter *values* have a static answer (`IS NULL OR`, shown above). A runtime-chosen sort *column* has one too, if you are willing to write it: `ORDER BY CASE WHEN :sortBy = 'age' THEN age WHEN :sortBy = 'name' THEN name END`, bound to a plain string. It works, and it is exactly the kind of SQL nobody wants to maintain once a second axis — an optional join, a filter — needs to vary alongside it. RoomQL replaces the `CASE` ladder with a typed argument:

```kotlin
fun sortedUsers(dao: UserDao, sortColumn: Column<*>, direction: SortDirection): List<UserEntity> {
    val q = query {
        from(UserEntityTable)
        orderBy(sortColumn, direction)
    }
    return dao.search(q.toQuery())
}

sortedUsers(dao, UserEntityTable.age, SortDirection.DESC)
sortedUsers(dao, UserEntityTable.name, SortDirection.ASC)
```

Both calls run through the same method with no branching, no `CASE` ladder, and `sortColumn` stays a real, rename-safe `Column<T>` the whole way. For a single fixed set of sortable columns, a `when (sortField) { AGE -> "age"; ... }` dispatch is a perfectly good zero-dependency alternative — RoomQL's edge shows up once this needs to compose with an optional join, a runtime `groupBy`, or a chosen `select(...)` projection at the same time, not from sorting alone.

## What you get

- **Dynamic query structure, typed.** `orderBy`, `groupBy`, `join`, and `select` all take a real `Column<T>`/`Expression<T>` instead of a `CASE` ladder or a bare string. `select(...)`'s dynamic column list has no static SQL equivalent at all; the others do, but only as increasingly unreadable workarounds once more than one needs to vary together.
- **Compile-time safety on column references.** `UserEntityTable.age` is generated from your entity by KSP. Renames and typos fail the build instead of the query.
- **Optional filters that disappear, and say so.** `age gteIfNotNull minAge` drops the condition from the SQL when `minAge` is null; the plain `age gte minAge` is required and will not compile with a nullable value. Reading the operator name tells you which one you have.
- **A real DSL, not string concatenation.** `where`, `or { }`, `orderBy`, `limit`/`offset`, `groupBy`/`having`, `select`, `join`. Values are bound as positional `?` parameters, so there is no injection surface.
- **Aggregates and explicit projections.** `count`, `countAll`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max` work in `having { }` and `orderBy`; `select(...)` projects them (or specific columns) instead of whole rows. `@Projection` generates a typed factory function for a multi-column result class, so a missing field is a compile error rather than a silently unmapped column.
- **Automatic JOIN column aliasing.** Colliding column names across joined tables are aliased (`users.id AS users__id`) so a cursor never silently overwrites one column with another.
- **Works with Room's own `@RawQuery`.** The output is a plain `SupportSQLiteQuery`. Blocking, `suspend`, and `Flow` return types all work — Room does the rest.

## Documentation

RoomQL's reference documentation lives alongside the code, not on a separate site:

| Document | What it covers |
|---|---|
| **[Usage Guide](docs/USAGE.md)** | Every capability as a worked example — entities, `@RawQuery` DAOs, AND/OR, optional filters, joins, `Flow`, error handling, testing — with the SQL each one generates. |
| **[API Reference](docs/API.md)** | Every public type, function, and operator with its signature, generated SQL, and null-skipping behaviour. |
| **[Cheat Sheet](docs/CHEATSHEET.md)** | A one-page, task-oriented lookup — "I want an optional numeric filter" → `gteIfNotNull` — faster than reading the full guide or reference. |
| **[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)** | What shipped in each release. |
| **[Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)** | Build, test, and the `apiDump` step for public API changes. |

Per-module notes: [`:runtime`](runtime/README.md) · [`:runtime-android`](runtime-android/README.md) · [`:ksp-processor`](ksp-processor/README.md)

### Public API at a glance

RoomQL's entire public surface, across all three artifacts. Signatures, generic bounds, and the SQL each operator generates are in the **[API Reference](docs/API.md)**.

| Symbol | Artifact | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [`query { }`](docs/API.md#query) | runtime | Entry point. Builds and returns a `RoomQlQuery`. |
| [`QueryBuilder`](docs/API.md#querybuilder) | runtime | Receiver inside `query { }`: `from`, `join`, `where`, `groupBy`, `having`, `select`, `orderBy`, `limit`, `offset`, `build`. |
| [`WhereScope`, `HavingScope`](docs/API.md#wherescope-and-havingscope-the-condition-operators) | runtime | Receivers inside `where { }` (`Column<T>`-only) and `having { }` (any `Expression<T>`, aggregates included). Both carry every operator below, plus `or { }` for alternatives. |
| `eq`, `notEq`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte` | runtime | Comparisons. Required — a nullable value will not compile. |
| `eqIfNotNull`, `notEqIfNotNull`, `gtIfNotNull`, `gteIfNotNull`, `ltIfNotNull`, `lteIfNotNull` | runtime | The optional forms. Skip when the value is `null`. |
| `like`, `notLike`, `contains` | runtime | Text matching on `String` columns. Required. `contains` adds the `%` wildcards for you. |
| `likeIfNotNull`, `notLikeIfNotNull`, `containsIfNotNull` | runtime | The optional forms. Skip when the value is `null`. |
| `inList`, `notInList` | runtime | Set membership. Required — an empty list renders `IN ()`, which SQLite defines as matching nothing. |
| `inListIfNotEmpty`, `notInListIfNotEmpty` | runtime | The optional forms. Skip when the list is `null` or empty. |
| `between` | runtime | Range. Both bounds required — compose `gteIfNotNull` + `lteIfNotNull` for a half-open range. |
| `isNull`, `isNotNull` | runtime | SQL `NULL` checks — the two operators that never skip. |
| [`Column<T>`](docs/API.md#column) | runtime | A typed column reference. Generated per entity property, never hand-written. |
| [`count`, `countAll`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`](docs/API.md#aggregate-functions) | runtime | `Expression<T>` factories for `having { }`, `orderBy`, and `select`. `count`/`countAll` differ under a `LEFT JOIN`; `sum`/`avg` require a numeric column. |
| [`select`](docs/API.md#projections) | runtime | Projects specific columns/aggregates instead of whole rows. Switches off automatic JOIN-collision aliasing when present. |
| [`alias`](docs/API.md#projections) | runtime | Names an expression's output column as a `SelectItem`, accepted only by `select(...)` — the escape hatch for shapes `@Projection` can't model. |
| [`@Projection`](docs/API.md#projections) | runtime / ksp-processor | Annotates a result data class; KSP generates `<ClassName>Projection(...)`, one typed `Expression<T>` parameter per property, to spread into `select(...)`. |
| [`EntityTable`](docs/API.md#entitytable) | runtime | Implemented by every generated `*Table`: `tableName`, `allColumnNames`. |
| [`RoomQlQuery`](docs/API.md#roomqlquery) | runtime | The DSL's output: `sql` plus positional `args`. Pure JVM — assert on it in unit tests. |
| [`JoinType`](docs/API.md#jointype-and-sortdirection) / [`SortDirection`](docs/API.md#jointype-and-sortdirection) | runtime | `INNER`/`LEFT`, and `ASC`/`DESC`. |
| [`RoomQlException`](docs/API.md#roomqlexception) | runtime | Thrown by `build()` for an invalid query, with the reason in the message. |
| [`RoomQlQuery.toQuery()`](docs/API.md#comroomqlandroid--the-room-bridge) | runtime-android | Adapts the DSL output into the `SupportSQLiteQuery` Room's `@RawQuery` accepts. |
| [`roomql.tableSuffix`](docs/API.md#options) | ksp-processor | KSP option renaming the generated objects' `Table` suffix. |

## How RoomQL compares to the alternatives

| Approach | Whole-query SQL checked? | Dynamic sort/group column | Dynamic `SELECT` list | Optional filter values | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **RoomQL** | No — `@RawQuery` skips it | Yes — a real `Column<T>`, checked at compile time | Yes — `select(...)`, same typed references | Native — `null` drops the condition | Two dependency lines, a `.toQuery()` call, no whole-query SQL validation |
| Room `@Query` string | Yes, at compile time | Via a `CASE WHEN :sortBy = ... THEN col` ladder, bound to a string — works, unreadable past one axis | No static way to vary the column list at all | `(:x IS NULL OR col = :x)` per filter — works fine | None; this is Room's default, best-checked path when your query is otherwise static |
| Overloaded DAO methods | Yes, each method's SQL is checked | One static method per column/direction — fine for a small, fixed set | One method per projection shape you need | One method per filter combination (2ⁿ) | Grows combinatorially once more than one axis varies at once |
| Hand-built `SimpleSQLiteQuery` | No — you concatenate strings | Yes, nothing checked at compile time | Yes, nothing checked at compile time | Manual `if` ladders | Zero dependencies; every injection, column-typo, and arg-ordering bug is yours |
| `SupportSQLiteQueryBuilder` (androidx.sqlite) | No — columns are strings | Yes, nothing checked at compile time | Yes, nothing checked at compile time | Manual | Already on your classpath; no type safety, no Room integration |
| [SQLDelight](https://github.com/sqldelight/sqldelight) | Yes — full SQL verified at compile time | Same `CASE` trick as `@Query`, same limits | No static way to vary the column list at all | Limited; dynamic shapes need generated variants or raw execution | You leave Room entirely and own the schema in `.sq` files |

A single dynamic axis in isolation usually has a workaround that does not need RoomQL: a `when (sortField) { ... }` dispatch for one of a handful of sort columns, or a `CASE`-based `ORDER BY`/`GROUP BY` bound to a plain string. The two places static SQL has no workaround at all are a dynamic `SELECT` list (no bound value can shrink or grow it) and toggling an `INNER JOIN` (an always-false `ON` drops every row rather than neutralizing it — `LEFT JOIN` can be gated this way, `INNER JOIN` cannot). **Use RoomQL when** more than one of these axes needs to vary together, or when you want one consistent typed vocabulary instead of a `CASE` ladder for structure and an `IS NULL OR` ladder for values. **Do not use RoomQL** for queries that are fully static, for a single small-cardinality axis a `when` dispatch already covers, or if you need a shape it does not build at all: `DISTINCT`, subqueries, or `UNION`.

## FAQ

### Does RoomQL replace Room?

No. RoomQL sits on top of Room and produces the `SupportSQLiteQuery` that Room's own `@RawQuery` methods take. You keep your `@Entity` classes, your `@Database`, your DAOs, and your migrations exactly as they are — RoomQL only replaces the SQL string for queries whose filter values or structure (sort, group, join, projection) vary at runtime.

### Why not just use the `(:x IS NULL OR col = :x)` trick on a plain `@Query`?

For optional *filter values* on an otherwise fixed query shape, that trick is genuinely fine — one `@Query`, one method, and Room checks the whole SQL string at compile time, which RoomQL cannot match. Stay on it if that is all you need. RoomQL earns its cost once the query's *structure* also needs to vary — and it is worth being precise about which parts of "structure" actually force the issue. A single dynamic sort or group-by column has a static workaround too: a `CASE WHEN :sortBy = 'age' THEN age ... END` bound to a plain string, the same value-binding trick as `IS NULL OR`. It just gets unreadable fast, and stops composing cleanly the moment a second axis — an optional join, a filter — needs to vary alongside it. The one thing with no static workaround at all is a dynamic `SELECT` list: no bound value can add or remove a column from it. If you only ever need one axis of structural dynamism, a `when (sortField) { ... }` dispatch may be all you need; reach for RoomQL once several axes need to compose, or once you need `select(...)`.

### How do I build a Room query with optional filters in Kotlin?

Wrap the filters in RoomQL's `query { }` block and use the `IfNotNull` operators for the ones that are optional: `where { UserEntityTable.age gteIfNotNull minAge }` emits `age >= ?` when `minAge` has a value and emits nothing at all when it is `null`. The plain `gte` requires a non-null value and will not compile against a nullable one — that split is what makes a `where { }` block tell you which of its conditions can disappear, just by reading the operator names. There is no `if` ladder and no `(:minAge IS NULL OR age >= :minAge)` trick, because the condition is never added to the SQL in the first place.

### Does RoomQL use reflection or runtime code generation?

No. RoomQL's KSP processor generates a `<EntityName>Table` object with a typed `Column<T>` per column at **build** time, and the runtime is a plain string builder over those references. Nothing is reflected over or generated while the app runs, so R8/ProGuard needs no extra keep rules. Column and table names are baked in as string literals, so obfuscation cannot change the SQL RoomQL emits — CI enforces this by scanning the published artifacts for reflection on every run.

### Is RoomQL safe from SQL injection?

Values are always bound as positional `?` parameters and passed to SQLite as an argument list — RoomQL never interpolates a user-supplied value into the SQL text. Table and column names come from generated code rather than user input. The one exception is the raw-string `from("table_name")` overload: never pass an untrusted string to it.

### Why are there three modules instead of one?

The DSL (`runtime`) is a pure-JVM module with no Android dependency, which is what lets you unit-test generated SQL on the JVM with no emulator or Robolectric. `runtime-android` is the thin Android bridge holding only `RoomQlQuery.toQuery()`, and `ksp-processor` runs at build time only. Splitting them keeps the Android dependency out of your test path — and in practice it costs you only two Gradle declarations, not three: `implementation(runtime-android)` already pulls in `runtime` transitively (see [Installation](#installation)).

### Does RoomQL work with Kotlin Multiplatform?

Not yet. `runtime` is a plain JVM module (not a KMP source set), and `runtime-android` depends on `androidx.sqlite`. RoomQL targets Android and JVM projects that use Room.

### Does RoomQL support KAPT?

No — RoomQL ships a KSP processor only, so your module needs the `com.google.devtools.ksp` plugin and `ksp(libs.roomql.ksp.processor)`. Room itself can still run on KAPT in the same module if you have not migrated it yet.

### Why doesn't my `Flow` re-emit when the table changes?

Room cannot infer which tables a raw query touches, so a `Flow`-returning `@RawQuery` must list them itself: `@RawQuery(observedEntities = [UserEntity::class])`. If that list is missing or names the wrong entity, the `Flow` emits once and then goes quiet. This is a Room requirement, not a RoomQL one.

### Does RoomQL validate my SQL at compile time?

Only the column references. RoomQL's KSP processor makes `UserEntityTable.age` a real Kotlin symbol, so a renamed or deleted column is a compile error — but Room's `@RawQuery` deliberately skips Room's static SQL verification, so a logically wrong query (a bad join predicate, a `groupBy` that does not match the projection) surfaces at runtime. For static queries, a plain `@Query` remains the safer choice.

## Pitfalls and limitations

Know these before adopting:

- **`IfNotNull` removes the condition — it does not mean "match `NULL`".** `status eqIfNotNull null` drops the filter; it is not `status IS NULL`. Use `isNull()` for that. The plain operators (`eq`, `gte`, …) will not compile against a nullable value at all, so this can only surprise you on the operator you asked to skip.
- **No compile-time SQL validation of the whole query.** Column references are checked; query logic is not. See the FAQ above.
- **JOIN results need matching `@ColumnInfo` names.** Colliding columns are aliased to `table__column`; your result class must use those exact names or the field will not map.
- **`Flow` `observedEntities` is manual.** Get it wrong and the `Flow` will not re-emit.
- **You must call `.toQuery()`.** The DSL output is a plain-JVM `RoomQlQuery`; `.toQuery()` (from `:runtime-android`) adapts it. One call at the DAO boundary is the price of an emulator-free test path.
- **Positional `?` args only.** No named parameters — a Room `@RawQuery` restriction.
- **`QueryBuilder` is not thread-safe.** Build a query on one thread or coroutine; never share a half-built builder.
- **Validation is deferred to `build()`.** Missing `from()`, a non-positive `limit`, `offset` without `limit`, and `having` without `groupBy` all throw `RoomQlException` at build time, not while you configure.
- **No `DISTINCT`, subqueries, or `UNION`.** `select(...)` covers explicit projections and aggregates; these three remain out of scope.
- **`@Projection`-generated factories only cover the constructor-property shape.** A result class outside that shape (a computed property, a shape KSP can't infer) still names its columns with the plain `alias` infix instead.
- **Room version range.** Targets Room 2.6.x–2.7.x (API 21+): CI tests 2.6.1, and `scripts/verify-toolchains.sh` tests 2.7.2 before each release. Room 2.8 raised `minSdk` to 23; support is deferred.
- **No auto-generated JOIN result types.** You supply your own result class — by design, so you control its shape.

## Modules

| Module | Artifact | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| [`:runtime`](runtime) | `io.github.kotplat.roomql:runtime` | the `query { }` DSL, `Column<T>`, conditions — pure JVM |
| [`:runtime-android`](runtime-android) | `io.github.kotplat.roomql:runtime-android` | `RoomQlQuery.toQuery()` → `SupportSQLiteQuery` |
| [`:ksp-processor`](ksp-processor) | `io.github.kotplat.roomql:ksp-processor` | generates the `*Table` objects from `@Entity` |

> **On annotation-driven integration.** RoomQL uses Room's manual `@RawQuery`: you declare the method, build with `query { }`, and pass `.toQuery()`. A zero-boilerplate annotation-driven integration was explored and dropped — KSP cannot read function bodies, so it could not infer the query or `observedEntities`. That exploration lives on the `development` branch; the rationale and the compiler-plugin alternative that was considered are documented in the closed issues [#6](https://github.com/KotPlat/RoomQL/issues/6) and [#13](https://github.com/KotPlat/RoomQL/issues/13). No release ships an annotation artifact yet.
