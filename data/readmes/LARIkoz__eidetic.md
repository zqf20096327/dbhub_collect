## What is it?

Eidetic gives an AI coding agent **long-term memory** that lives in plain Markdown files and is searched with hybrid FTS5 + vector search. One engine, **two kinds of memory**:

- **Personal memory (PUSH)** — your own decisions, rules, and project context. **The agent writes its own memory:** at every session end a small LLM pulls the decisions, rules, and lessons out of the transcript and files them as cards (`agent-extracted`, 0.5× weight) — your memory grows from just working. It **auto-injects** into every Claude Code session (recallable on demand from any MCP agent too) and **compounds** — updating existing notes instead of piling up duplicates.
- **Topic bases (PULL)** — an external corpus (API docs, a methodology, a book) you turn into an isolated base and **attach only to the projects that need it**.

What makes it different from every other memory tool: it **detects when memories go stale** and down-ranks them — so more memory doesn't quietly make the agent _worse_ (that's [why](#why-eidetic) it exists). Claude Code-native via zero-config hooks; works with Codex, Gemini, Cursor, Cline, and any MCP agent.

_Lineage: [Luhmann's Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), [Tiago Forte's Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/), and [Karpathy's **LLM Wiki**](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) — its **structure** implemented end-to-end (typed pages, wikilinks, an op-log, a compounding write-path), plus declared-contradiction surfacing and supersession; full semantic truth-maintenance is the [v6 roadmap](#roadmap). More in [Design philosophy](#design-philosophy)._

---

## Why Eidetic?

```
Session 1:  "Never mock the database in tests"
Session 2:  *mocks the database*
Session 50: *still mocking the database*
```

That's the **Day 1 problem** — Claude forgets everything between sessions. Every memory tool solves this.

But there's a harder problem nobody talks about:

```
Session 35: "Use validate_key() for all API checks"
            *validate_key() works great, gets saved to memory*

Session 50: *validate_key() was renamed to check_auth() two weeks ago*
            *Claude confidently injects the old rule*
            *Agent gets WORSE, not better, from its own memory*
```

That's the **Day 60 problem** — after 500+ memory files, stale knowledge actively hurts the agent. More memory = worse performance.

Eidetic attacks it with **drift detection + truth maintenance**: dead wikilinks, age-stale cards, unconfirmed agent escalation, and declared contradictions / supersession (`contradicts:` / `supersedes:` frontmatter) all genuinely down-rank a card before it poisons the agent. The one case above that nothing declares — a *silent* rename with no broken link — still needs **semantic** contradiction detection, which is the [v6 roadmap](#roadmap); until then it's caught when the rule's wikilink dies, the card ages out, or a newer card declares `contradicts:` it.

---

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LARIkoz/eidetic.git && cd eidetic && bash install.sh
```

One command. `install.sh` asks 3 quick questions (Enter = sensible default) and wires the Claude Code hooks. The **core** (FTS5 search, auto-injection, drift, vault) needs **zero pip installs** and works immediately; semantic search adds one — `pip install fastembed` (see [Dependencies](#dependencies)). Piped / CI / agent installs stay non-interactive via env or the defaults.

**Prefer your agent install it?** Hand it the repo link + **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** (or a ready prompt in **[docs/prompts.md](docs/prompts.md)**) — it runs the whole thing end-to-end. Verify any time with `bash ~/.claude/memory-system/bin/doctor.sh`; roll back with `bash ~/.claude/memory-system/bin/rollback.sh`.

---

## How to use it

Eidetic has **two kinds of memory**, used differently.

### Personal memory (PUSH) — your own knowledge

On Claude Code it's **automatic**: the installer wires hooks, so your accumulated rules / decisions / context **auto-inject** at the start of every session and new signals are **captured** at the end. You mostly just work. To act on it explicitly:

- **Recall** — `/memory-recall "<query>"` (or the MCP `memory_search` tool from any agent).
- **File an answer back** — `echo "<answer>" | python3 ~/.claude/memory-system/bin/remember.py "<title>"` promotes a good synthesized answer into a typed page (re-promoting the same topic appends an `## Update`, never duplicates).
- **Browse** — `eidetic export-vault` turns your memory into a browsable Obsidian wiki.

### Topic bases (PULL) — an external corpus you attach per project

A **topic base** is an isolated corpus (API docs, a methodology, a book) you query on demand and attach only where needed — never polluting your personal recall. Same engine, separate index, its own git repo.

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/memory-system/bin/base.py init   acme                  # → ~/eidetic-bases/acme-base/
python3 ~/.claude/memory-system/bin/base.py index  acme                  # build FTS + e5 vectors
python3 ~/.claude/memory-system/bin/base.py attach acme --scope project  # attach to a project over MCP
```

- **Full guide + agent contract:** **[docs/topic-bases.md](docs/topic-bases.md)** — storage model, ingest scenarios, **routing (how the agent knows when to reach for a base)**, API-doc gotchas.
- The bundled **`/eidetic-base`** skill builds one for you from a source (scrape → pages → index → verify → attach).
- A base is a **separate repo** outside the eidetic tree, so your corpora stay private even though eidetic is public.

### Copy-paste agent prompts

Don't memorize commands — hand your agent a ready prompt from **[docs/prompts.md](docs/prompts.md)**: _install Eidetic_ · _build a topic base from a site / book / API_ · _attach a base to a project_.

---

## Built on a reusable engine

Eidetic's embedding / vector / search core is a versioned public seam — the
**Engine API v1** (`bin/engine.py`). Memory, topic bases, and your own consumers
build on the same door instead of the private internals.

```
  Personal memory   Topic bases   Your consumer      ← products
          \______________ | ______________/
                     bin/engine.py                   ← Engine API v1 (the door)
                          |
                   embed.py · rerank.py              ← private core
```

Reads degrade (search returns `[]` + one reason if the model is missing), builds
shout (`EngineUnavailable`), and the contract is versioned (`ENGINE_API 1.1`).
See [docs/engine.md](docs/engine.md) — quickstart, contract table, and the first
external consumer (a task-tracker search skill on its own index).

External integrations use the path-free Core/SDK contract defined in
[ADR 0003](docs/adr/0003-core-sdk-boundary.md); the low-level module remains a
Core and legacy compatibility surface.

### Compound ranking

Every result is ranked by:

```
score = relevance x evidence x source x freshness x status

evidence:   validated = 1.0    observed = 0.7    hypothesis = 0.4
source:     user-explicit = 1.0  agent-extracted = 0.5  system = 0.3  imported = 0.3
freshness:  < 30 days = 1.0    > 30 days = 0.5    (an active drift finding multiplies in: stale 0.5x, broken link 0.8x)
status:     current = 1.0      resolved/fixed = 0.75   superseded/deprecated = 0.35   archived = 0.25
```

Keyword hits also carry a match-quality factor. A validated, recent, current, human-created memory always outranks an old, unverified, agent-extracted, or superseded guess.

## Features

### Drift Detection (v2.5)

The feature that makes Eidetic different. Four checks, 24h throttle, zero file mutations:

| Check                     | What it catches                                        | Threshold                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Wikilink drift**        | `[[validate-key]]` referenced but file renamed/deleted | Immediate                              |
| **Age staleness**         | Project memory untouched for 30+ days                  | 30d project, 60d status, 90d reference |
| **Confidence escalation** | 3+ agent-extracted updates, 0 human confirmation       | 3 events                               |
| **Declared contradiction** | A card another card declares `contradicts:` (or its own `contradicted_by:`) | Immediate, no grace gate |

Drift findings penalize ranking by **multiplying into the freshness factor**: broken wikilink = 0.8x, stale = 0.5x, confidence escalation = 0.3x, declared contradiction = 0.4x — so a stale card with a drift finding always ranks below a merely-old one, and a finding can never *raise* a card. Distinct findings on one card **compound** (their penalties multiply, floored at 0.1x), so a three-problem card ranks below a one-problem card. Auto-resolve when the problem disappears — including declared relations: propagation is recomputed from the current declarers on every reindex, so removing a `contradicts:`/`supersedes:` line drops the penalty on the next drift run. A declaration only down-ranks its target when the declarer is at least as new and of equal-or-higher source tier; otherwise the claim is surfaced in diagnostics without touching ranking.

**Grace gate:** a finding starts penalizing only on its **second** detection (drift runs are ≥24h apart), so one transient mis-detection never down-ranks a card. Until then it appears in diagnostics only.

### Smart Token Compression (v1.3)

160 feedback rules in ~6,800 tokens. Previously only ~57 fit in MEMORY.md. Keyword clustering groups related rules; tiered display shows important rules in full, low-priority as name only.

### Hybrid Search (v2.0, v5.1)

FTS5 for keywords (~50ms). Vector search (multilingual-e5-large, 1024-dim) as fallback for semantic queries. Cross-language by design — a query in one language finds notes written in another (e5 covers ~100 languages). v5.1 replaced the old MiniLM-384 embedder with e5-large: cross-lingual paraphrase recall@3 went **25% → 67%** (measured on RU→EN). Results merged via Reciprocal Rank Fusion. If every candidate is weak, reports `No confident results` instead of surfacing noise.

**Two-signal confidence gate (v5.1).** e5 compresses scores, so a true cross-lingual match (~0.83 cosine) is indistinguishable from topical noise (~0.83) by cosine alone. A vector-only hit reaches actionable confidence only with lexical corroboration (shared query anchors) — high recall, no false confidence. A model/dim stamp on the vector store also guards against silent embedder drift.

Progressive search keeps broad queries compact. Use `--detail <id>` to fetch full content when a candidate looks relevant.

### Code-Aware Search (v2.2)

Tree-sitter parses `.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.sh` — every function and class becomes searchable by name or purpose.

### Knowledge Compounding

Before creating a new memory, searches for existing ones on the same topic. Found? Updates it, adds history. Not found? Creates new file. Matching is **lexical, not yet semantic**: salient-keyword overlap with porter stemming, so a repeat in the same or moderately reworded vocabulary compounds, and a heavy paraphrase is at worst **flagged** on the op-log as `possible duplicate of <card>` — never a silent duplicate. So: 50 sessions ≈ dozens of refined rules plus a few flagged near-misses, not 500 silent duplicates. Vector-gated semantic dedup is v6.

### File Answers Back — Promote (v5.3)

A good synthesized answer shouldn't die in the chat log. **Promote** files it back as one **typed page** — `echo "<answer>" | python3 ~/.claude/memory-system/bin/remember.py "<title>"`. Search-before-write means a re-promote on the same topic appends a dated `## Update` section instead of duplicating, and a new page gets `## Related` wikilinks to its neighbours. It's the deliberate, mid-session companion to the end-of-session signal capture, and it's the same write-path a future importer reuses. Every write also lands on a greppable **op-log** — `grep '^## \[' log.md` is the whole timeline.

This is Eidetic implementing the **structure** of [Karpathy's **LLM Wiki**](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) end-to-end: compounding pages, an explicit **maintenance contract** ([docs/MEMORY-SCHEMA.md](docs/MEMORY-SCHEMA.md)), typed pages (`synthesis` / `concept` / `entity`), and an op-log — with auto-extraction, drift detection, and declared-contradiction / supersession handling layered on top. The wiki's **metabolism** — noticing contradictions *nobody declared* and synthesizing across many pages per ingest — is the [v6 roadmap](#roadmap); that's the part of "maintains itself instead of rotting" still to be earned.

### Session-End Auto-Capture (configurable)

At session end a small LLM pulls `Decision:/Rule:/Worked:/Failed:/Knowledge:` signals from the transcript and compounds them (`source: agent-extracted`, 0.5× weight). It runs on **whichever CLI you have** — Claude or Codex — degrading `claude-batch → claude --print → codex-batch → codex exec`, so any install with the `claude` _or_ `codex` CLI captures signals. Pick the capture model to match your CLI:

| Your CLI   | Capture model (default → cheaper/safer)               | Override env                                      |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claude** | `sonnet` → `haiku`                                    | `EIDETIC_SIGNAL_CLAUDE_MODEL`                     |
| **Codex**  | `gpt-5.5` → `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` (subscription-safe) | `EIDETIC_SIGNAL_CODEX_MODEL` / `_CODEX_CLI_MODEL` |

Gemini / Grok agents recall via MCP but don't run extraction yet. For deliberate, full-quality capture, use **Promote** (above).

### Obsidian Vault Export (v4.0)

Eidetic turns your memory into a browsable **Obsidian wiki** — a `HOME.md` hub, folders by type (rules / projects / references), resolved `[[wikilinks]]`, and an auto-generated map of content.

> **The vault is a read-only window, not the engine.** Search, injection, compounding, and drift detection run on your `.md` files + the FTS5 / vector indexes — _nothing ever reads the vault back_. Delete it and Eidetic works identically; it regenerates on the next export. The vault is for **you** to browse what the agent knows; the agent never runs on it.

**Where it lives:** `~/Documents/eidetic-vault/` by default (pass a path to override). The installer wires a Stop hook + nightly refresh, so the vault stays current automatically — or rebuild it any time:

```bash
eidetic export-vault                 # → ~/Documents/eidetic-vault/  (default)
eidetic export-vault ~/my-vault/     # custom location
```

**Open it in Obsidian:** _Open folder as vault_ and point at that directory (it also auto-registers on first export). `eidetic doctor` prints the vault's location and page count.

A quality gate filters your memory files down to a validated subset; optional `--polish` rewrites cards into human-readable prose via an LLM.

---

## Works with any agent

Eidetic is **agent-agnostic at the memory layer** — one `.md` store + FTS5 + e5 vector index; only the _integration surface_ changes per agent:

- **Claude Code** — zero-config. `install.sh` wires SessionStart/Stop hooks, so memory **auto-injects** at the start of every session and signals **auto-capture** at the end. The deepest, hands-off experience.
- **Codex · Gemini · Cursor · Cline — any MCP agent** — point the agent at the bundled **MCP server** for on-demand recall + write-back (session-end signal capture also runs on the `codex` CLI, not just `claude`). Add it to your agent's MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "eidetic": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["~/.claude/memory-system/mcp_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

7 tools: `memory_search`, `memory_search_detail`, `memory_serendipity`, `memory_health`, `memory_reindex`, `memory_lint`, `export_vault`. Claude Code doesn't need this — it uses the zero-config hook path above.

No lock-in to one agent. (Auto-injection is the Claude Code hook path; other agents recall on demand through MCP.)

---

## Dependencies

Eidetic is **tiered** — the core needs nothing extra; the headline semantic search needs one pip install.

> ⚠️ `install.sh` installs the **core only** — it does **not** pip-install fastembed / tree-sitter. A fresh install is FTS-only until you `pip install fastembed`. The e5 model cache must be **persistent** (`~/.cache/fastembed`); a temp-dir cache gets purged by the OS and silently disables vector search.

**Run the doctor any time** to see which tiers are active and what's missing — including _why_ the wiki/vault isn't being created:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/memory-system/bin/doctor.sh
```

It checks deps, index, memory files on disk, vectors + lag, model-cache location, hooks, the wiki/vault, **the op-log + promote/compound deployment state, card-kind distribution, and a failed-embed log (W5)** — with a fix hint for every ⚠️/❌.

Platform: macOS / Linux (uses `fcntl` file locks).

### Updates

Background update check every 6 hours. When available:

```
Eidetic update available (a1b2c3d). Run: bash ~/.claude/memory-system/bin/update.sh
```

Updates preserve databases, rules, and hooks — only code files are replaced.

## Performance

| Metric               | Value                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Background / idle    | **0 CPU** — event-driven, no daemon                     |
| Session start (warm) | **~350ms**                                              |
| FTS5 search          | **~50ms**                                               |
| Core dependencies    | **zero** — no Docker, npm, or pip (e5 vectors optional) |

<sub>Cold start ~15s (one-time e5 load) · vector query ~32ms · FTS reindex ~0.3s · full embed ~1h one-time, incremental in seconds · index ~66MB · signal extraction = 1 LLM call/session.</sub>

## Comparison

### What only Eidetic does

Based on [40-repo competitive analysis](https://github.com/LARIkoz/eidetic/releases/tag/v2.2.0) (May 2026):

| Feature                       | Why it matters                                            |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Drift detection**           | Catches stale memories before they poison the agent       |
| **Compounding**               | Updates existing knowledge instead of creating duplicates |
| **Self-referential discount** | Agent guesses can't reinforce themselves into "facts"     |
| **Evidence tiers**            | Proven rules always outrank unverified guesses            |
| **Code search**               | "Where is the rate-limit handler?" actually works         |
| **Zero-dep core**             | No Docker, no npm, no pip for basic usage                 |

## Design philosophy

Inspired by [Luhmann's Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), [Tiago Forte's Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/), and Karpathy's wiki-for-LLMs idea — both his [AI wiki concept](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/1dd0294ef9567971c1e4348a90d69285) and the [**LLM Wiki**](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) pattern whose structure Eidetic now implements end-to-end (compounding pages, an explicit schema, an op-log, typed pages — semantic truth-maintenance is v6). Per Karpathy, _"humans abandon wikis because maintenance grows faster than value; LLMs don't get bored"_ — so Eidetic's value curve climbs with use instead of decaying.

Core principles:

1. **Files are truth.** Indexes are derived. If the DB dies, rebuild from markdown in <1s.
2. **Every memory must be findable** without knowing where it is. Cross-project search is the default.
3. **Critical rules must never become invisible.** The system guarantees all behavioral rules reach the agent.
4. **The system maintains itself** — or it dies. The AI agent does all indexing, linking, searching, and compounding automatically. Human curates for _truth_ when they want to — full self-maintenance (contradiction resolution, multi-page synthesis, auto-filing) is the v6 goal.

---

## Safety

- **Atomic writes** — `tempfile` + `os.replace()`, crash-safe
- **Backup/restore** — auto-backup before reindex, auto-restore on failure
- **Lock serialization** — `fcntl` lock file via `bin/lock_runner.py`
- **Anti-injection** — prefix-validated signal extraction blocks transcript noise from becoming memory
- **Protected-type guard** — a promotion never appends agent-authored content into a user-validated feedback/profile card, and never clobbers it
- **Loud self-heal (W5)** — a failed session-start embed lands in `embed-last.log` + surfaces a one-line warning (no more silent vector outages); high vector lag is flagged too
- **Graceful degradation** — missing index falls back to `head -200 MEMORY.md`
- **Rollback** — one command, <5 seconds

---

## Roadmap

**Shipped** — v1.0 → v5.6: FTS5 + signals + compounding, hybrid e5 search, code search, drift detection, promote / op-log / typed pages, cross-lingual translation, usage telemetry, functional doctor. Full per-version detail in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

**Next** — distribution: pip package, docs polish.

**Planned — v6 (truth-maintenance)** — *declared* contradictions (`contradicts:`/`contradicted_by:`) and supersession (`supersedes:`) already surface as drift findings and down-rank (0.4x / 0.35x). v6 adds the automatic half: **semantic** contradiction detection (no declaration needed), multi-page synthesis on ingest, and auto-filing of answers — memory that resolves its own contradictions and doesn't rot. Plus session-transcript search.
