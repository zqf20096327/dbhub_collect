# d9 — Open Data Platform

**d9** is an open-source fork of [Directus 9](https://github.com/directus/directus) (GPLv3), maintained independently by [La Webcapsule](https://github.com/LaWebcapsule). As Directus 10+ is now a premium open-source software, this repository aims to maintain a standard openSource version of Directus 9.

> d9 is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to the Directus core team or Monospace Inc.

## Why d9?

- **Open-source permanence** — d9 stays GPLv3, forever. No premium gates, no vendor lock-in.
- **Drop-in compatibility** — Same database schema as Directus 9. Migrate in minutes, not days.

## Features

- **REST & GraphQL API** — Instantly layers a blazingly fast Node.js API on top of any SQL database.
- **Manage pure SQL** — Works with new or existing SQL databases, no migration required.
- **Multi-database support** — PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, OracleDB, CockroachDB, MariaDB, and MS-SQL.
- **Self-hosted** — Run on your own infrastructure. You own your data.
- **Fully extensible** — Modular architecture, easy to customize with extensions.
- **No-code Data Studio** — An intuitive Vue.js dashboard for non-technical users.

npm init @wbce-d9/directus-project@latest

```

### 2. Update your imports

import { ... } from "directus"
import { ... } from "@directus/some-package"

// After

```
