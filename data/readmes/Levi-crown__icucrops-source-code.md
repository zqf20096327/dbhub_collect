## <img src="assets/badges/leaf.svg" width="30" height="30" align="absmiddle" alt=""> About

ICuCrops was made for Sarate Agriculture Farm in San Pablo, Laguna. The farm grows
pechay, bok choy, mustasa and green ice lettuce in soil beds, and it used to water them
on a fixed schedule, twice a day, whether the soil needed it or not.

ICuCrops puts sensors in every cultivation row and in the greenhouse air. It reads soil
moisture, soil pH, EC, temperature, humidity and light, and checks each reading against
the range of the crop planted in that row. From there it:

- waters a row when the soil gets too dry, and stops once the row has enough water
- runs the exhaust fan when the air gets too humid
- turns on the grow light when it gets dark or too cold
- alerts the farm staff when pH, EC, temperature, humidity or light goes out of range
- counts the days from planting so the staff know when a crop is due for harvest

Administrators and users follow all of this on a web dashboard, where they can also
control the equipment by hand and download reports.

This repository has the website (frontend) and the Flask server (backend) only. The
sensor firmware is not included.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **There is no sensitive information in this repository.** No API keys, no passwords,
> no `.env` files, no Supabase connection strings and no database files. The server reads
> its keys from the computer it runs on, so none of them are written in the code.

## <img src="assets/badges/tree-structure.svg" width="30" height="30" align="absmiddle" alt=""> How it works

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/icucrops-how-it-works-diagram.svg" alt="How ICuCrops works, from the sensors to the website and the kiosk" width="100%">
</p>

1. The sensors take the readings. Each of the 4 rows has 3 soil-moisture probes and an RS485
   sensor for pH and EC, and a DHT22 and an HW-072 light sensor read the greenhouse air.
2. Five ESP32 boards collect the readings, one for each row and one for the air and light
   sensors, and send them to the Raspberry Pi 4 over MQTT.
3. The Raspberry Pi runs ICuCrops. The Flask server checks every reading against the crop
   planted in that row, saves it in SQLite, and sends back what to turn on or off.
4. The ESP32 boards switch the relays for the water, the lime solution and the fertilizer of
   each row, the 7 exhaust fans, the grow light and the misting. The water pump supplies the
   water to the rows.
5. When the internet is on, the Pi syncs with Supabase, and the online dashboard on Vercel
   reads from it, so the farm can be checked from a phone or a computer.
6. The Pi also keeps everything in SQLite, its offline database. The kiosk at the farm shows
   both the offline and the online dashboard, so monitoring and watering keep going even
   when the internet is down.
