## Overview

**Sard** (Arabic *سَرْد*, "narration") reads EPUB and PDF. It is a native desktop application:
a Rust core, a WebView front end, and a local SQLite database. No account, no sync service, no
telemetry. Your library, your reading positions, your notes and your highlights live in one file
on your own machine.

It is Windows-first today. The reading surface is a single centred column of text on an opaque
page, with the desk showing in the margins — you set the measure, the margins and the page width,
and the interface gets out of the way until you ask for it.

## Why Sard exists

Most readers are built for one writing system and bolt the rest on afterwards: mirror the layout,
swap the strings, ship it. That produces software where diacritics collide with the line above, the
justification tears holes in the text, search misses a word because it carries a mark, and the
"next page" arrow points the wrong way.

Sard was written the other way round. Right-to-left is not a mode — it is one of two directions the
layout is built in from the start, and a book brings its own. Tashkīl can be shown, dimmed or
hidden. Search folds diacritics, so «الليل» finds «اللَّيْلُ». Numerals follow the interface. Naskh
and Ruqʿa ship beside Literata, Source Serif and Inter, and each script keeps its own face, size and
leading.

None of it comes at the expense of anything else. Every script Sard supports is first-class; none of
them is the whole point. The same care goes into English typography, into how a panel opens, into
whether hiding a toolbar shifts the text under it. The priority order is
**beauty › smooth › lightweight**, and each one is measured rather than asserted.

## Key features

**Reading**
- EPUB with reflowable text: paginated or scrolled, RTL and LTR
- PDF, viewed as-is, with a scrubbable page bar
- Per-script typography — separate Arabic and Latin faces, size, weight, leading, tracking,
  paragraph spacing, first-line indent, alignment, margins, page width
- Diacritics: show, dim or hide
- Immersive scrolling — the toolbar, the read-aloud transport and the scrollbar recede as you
  read into the page, and return when you scroll back
- Furthest-read tracking — an unobtrusive return pill lets you jump back to where you left off
- Text replacements — substitute words or phrases throughout a book cleanly, toggleable anytime

**Library**
- Five viewing modes: Grid, Covers, Spines, Details, and Vista
- Import single files or a whole folder; SHA-based deduplication
- User-defined shelves; sort and filter
- Covers extracted from the book, or generated from its title when there is none
- Your own image behind the library and around the reading desk, with presence, blur and focal point

**Profiles**
- Complete visual presets: library and reading colors, custom paper tints, backgrounds, fonts,
  bookmark shapes, reference styles, and reading voices
- Portable — export and import reading profiles via single-file drag-and-drop

**Annotation & Deposits**
- Highlights in eight inks tuned per theme (or custom colors), notes with titles and tags,
  bookmarks with customizable shapes
- **References** — a note bound to a word or phrase, marked wherever that phrase occurs with
  custom twin rules
- **Reading Deposits** — share a book together with chosen highlights, notes, references, and
  replacements as a clean, portable bundle without leaking private reading positions
- A cross-book inbox and archive for every highlight and note you have ever made
- Image cards: turn passages or standalone thoughts into shareable cards with custom backgrounds,
  papers, and typography

**Read-aloud**
- Microsoft Edge's online neural voices
- Sentence spotlight and word-level highlighting that follow the audio
- A transport that shrinks from a full pill to a single calligraphic stroke in the margin
- Punctuation and symbol pronunciation control; chapter continuation

**Discord Activity**
- Real-time Rich Presence on your Discord profile showing your current book, chapter, and
  reading percentage, or library browsing
- Privacy-first: local IPC connection with Discord desktop app, zero network telemetry, and four
  granular privacy switches

**Everywhere**
- 16 built-in themes (including Moonlit Sky), plus full custom palette and paper creation
- Full English and Arabic interface, mirrored end to end
- Custom font importing (.otf, .ttf, .woff, .woff2) with interactive specimen preview
- Keyboard-reachable controls with visible focus

## Screenshots

### Library

Your books as objects: real covers, shelves you define, and grid, list or shelf-row views. The
interface mirrors completely between Arabic and English — this is the same screen in both.

<td><b>Your own background</b> — an image behind the library, with the theme still setting every colour.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Reader

A single column of text on an opaque page, with the desk showing in the margins. Measure, margins,
page width, leading and per-script fonts are all yours to set.

</p>

### Search

Diacritic-insensitive, and **spoiler-safe**: matches up to your position are shown in full, while
everything ahead is sealed behind a count until you ask for it.

</p>

### Notes &amp; annotations

A note can carry a title, a body, an ink colour, an ink density and tags — written in a centred
editor built to be a quiet room, with the passage above and nothing competing for attention.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/notes.png" alt="The note editor: the highlighted passage, an optional title, the note body, and a margin panel with colour, ink density and tags" width="880">
</p>

### Selecting text &amp; references

Select any passage and the toolbar offers eight highlight inks and every action that can follow —
including **Add reference**, which binds a note to a word or phrase and marks it wherever that
phrase recurs.

<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/screenshots/options-en.png" alt="The selection toolbar in English: eight highlight inks above, then Listen, Note, Add reference, Copy, Add to card and Create photo card"></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>English</b></td>
<td><b>Arabic</b> — same toolbar, mirrored.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Themes

Sixteen papers, from Ivory through True-Black to Moonlit Sky. Each carries its own eight highlight
inks, tuned so a highlight lightens dark paper instead of blotting it.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/Themes.png" alt="The Appearance settings showing all sixteen themes as labelled swatches, plus day/night mode and the library background controls" width="900">
</p>

### Settings

Two levels: app-wide from the Library, and per-book while reading. This is the in-book drawer —
five tabs, with Contents open on one side and the reading surface live between them, so every
change previews on the real page.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/In-book-settings.png" alt="Reading an Arabic book with the Contents panel open on the left and the in-book settings drawer on the right" width="900">
</p>

### Read aloud

Neural speech through Microsoft Edge's online voices. The sentence being spoken is spotlit and the
current word tracked inside it; the transport carries voice, speed and volume, and collapses to a
single calligraphic stroke when you want the page to yourself.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/screenshots/in-book-en-with-background-and-TTS-working.png" alt="Reading in English with read-aloud playing: the spoken sentence spotlit, the current word highlighted, and the transport showing voice and speed"></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>English</b> — engine, voice, speed and volume in one pill.</td>
<td><b>Arabic</b> — the same tracking, right-to-left.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Photo cards

Turn a passage into a shareable image — five card styles, sixteen papers, four formats — and keep it
in the app to re-share later.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/quote.png" alt="The photo card composer: a portrait card with a quotation, beside controls for card style, paper, format and text size" width="880">
</p>

### Discord Activity

Show what you are reading on your Discord profile with real-time progress, or share that you are exploring your library. Sard communicates with your local Discord desktop client through a private, local IPC pipe — no telemetry, no accounts, and four independent switches so you share only what you want.

```

Three ideas hold the codebase together:

**One IPC seam.** `commands/mod.rs` and `lib/ipc.ts` are the only place the front end and the core
meet. Everything crossing that line is typed on both sides.

**One token set.** A theme is a set of semantic tokens. They fan out to `:root` CSS variables for
the interface *and*, through an injected-CSS funnel, into the book's own document — which is a
separate frame that cannot read the parent's variables. Adding a seventeenth theme is adding a
preset; nothing else changes.

**One database connection.** A single `rusqlite::Connection` behind a mutex in the app state,
recovered rather than poisoned on panic, so one failure cannot silently disable persistence for
the rest of the session.

## Performance

Performance here means measured before and after, not asserted:

- **Frame budget.** Backgrounds are resampled to a bounded edge at import, so a 115-megapixel
  photograph and a 2-megapixel one cost the same to render — measured identical frame times at
  240 Hz.
- **Blur where it earns its place.** Frosted surfaces run a 4 px blur over a 96 %-opaque ground
  rather than a wide blur over a transparent one; the look survives, the compositor work does not.
- **No idle work.** The read-aloud animation loop parks instead of spinning when nothing is
  sounding. No background timers run while you are simply reading.
- **Off the main thread.** Import — whole-file read, SHA-256, zip and OPF parse — is asynchronous,
  so a folder of books does not freeze the window.
- **Stable layout.** Scrollbar gutters are reserved rather than borrowed, because a list that
  crosses the overflow threshold otherwise re-lays out every card.

## Text-to-speech

- **Microsoft Edge** neural voices are used over the network, including word-level timing. Nothing
  is bundled and no account is needed, which keeps the installer small.

While a chapter plays, the current sentence is spotlit on the page and the current
word is tracked inside it. Speed is an explicit ordered set rather than a slider, so 1.10× exists
instead of being rounded away. The transport collapses in two steps: a full pill, a compact row,
then a **kashida** — a tapered calligraphic stroke in the bottom margin whose fill is your
progress and whose bead is play/pause. Chapter ends offer to continue rather than simply stopping.

## EPUB support

EPUB rendering is [foliate-js](https://github.com/johnfactotum/foliate-js), vendored at a pinned
commit under `public/foliate-js/` so a future upstream change can never silently alter how a book
lays out. Sard drives it through one controller and styles the book through a single injected-CSS
funnel.

Sard forces a single column and lets that column fill the sheet, so widening the page widens the
measure. Reading position is stored as an EPUB CFI, which survives a font change, a resize or a
re-import. Local modifications to the vendored copy — including the iframe sandbox hardening — are
recorded in `public/foliate-js/VENDOR.txt` and must be re-applied on any re-vendor.

PDF is deliberately narrower in scope: view-as-is, with page navigation, a scrubbable position bar,
copy-selection and an approximate inverted mode. Themes, reflow and annotation do not apply to a
fixed-layout document, and Sard says so rather than pretending otherwise.

## Search

In-book search is diacritic-insensitive: «الليل» finds «اللَّيْلُ». It is case-insensitive for Latin
text, and reports progress while it scans rather than blocking on a long book.

It is also **spoiler-safe**. Matches up to your current position are shown in full. Everything
ahead of you is sealed behind a count — *"3 matches ahead are hidden"* — and revealed only if you
ask. Searching a book you are halfway through should not tell you how it ends.

## Notes

A note can carry a title, a body and tags. A highlight can carry a note. A note can exist on its
own, pinned to a spot in the page, with no highlight at all.

Notes open in a centred editor built to be a quiet room — the passage above, your text below,
nothing else competing. Every note and highlight is also reachable from a single cross-book inbox
in the library, filterable by colour, book, tag and kind, so a thought you had six books ago is
still findable.

## References

A reference is a note bound to a **word or phrase** rather than to a position — a character's
name, a recurring image, a term you want to track.

Once created, that phrase is marked wherever it occurs, by a twin rule drawn beneath it: two thin
strokes with rounded terminals, at a colour, thickness and distance you control. The mark is drawn
as SVG in the reader's overlay rather than as a text decoration, because the design — rounded caps,
a second stroke, a controllable gap — is not expressible with CSS text styling. One shared geometry
resolver draws both the mark on the page and the sample in the settings panel, so the two can
never disagree.

## Themes

Sixteen papers: Ivory, Sepia, Slate, True-Black, Sage, Rose Quartz, Parchment, Dusk, Ink, Espresso,
Forest Night, Mulberry, Charcoal, Nocturne, Linen, and **Moonlit Sky** — a gold-on-night theme with
its own crescent, stars and cloud layer.

Each carries eight highlight inks tuned to that paper, so a highlight lightens dark paper instead
of blotting it. Themes apply app-wide, or per-book if you prefer each book to keep its own look;
the library can hold a different theme from the reader. A contrast guard flags any custom text
colour too faint to read on the paper you have chosen.

## Discord Activity

Sard connects to Discord to reflect your reading journey in real time:

- **What appears**: Sard’s hoopoe mark, the book title, your current chapter, whole-book progress percentage, and elapsed reading time. When browsing your collection without an active book, it shows that you are exploring the library.
- **Granular privacy controls**: Under **Settings → Discord Activity**, four independent toggles govern what leaves your machine:
  1. *Show reading activity on Discord* — master on/off switch; turning it off clears your Discord activity immediately.
  2. *Show book title* — toggle whether the title of the book is shared.
  3. *Show chapter and progress* — toggle whether your chapter title and percentage completion are displayed.
  4. *Show browsing activity* — toggle the "Browsing the library" status when no book is open.
- **Strictly local IPC**: Sard never contacts Discord's remote servers and bundles no GameSDK or binary DLLs. It speaks directly to the Discord desktop application running on your own machine via a local named pipe / IPC socket. The worker runs on an isolated background thread so connection probes never stall the interface, and the privacy gate is validated in the Rust core before any bytes reach the pipe.

## Profiles

Beyond the sixteen ready-made themes, Sard lets you craft complete **reading profiles** that encapsulate the entire visual and reading experience:

- **Dual palettes**: Independent color sets for the library and the reading surface.
- **Custom papers**: Pick any background color, with contrast checked automatically against readable thresholds.
- **Atmosphere**: Pair your palette with a personal background image, tuning presence, blur, and focal point.
- **Typography & geometry**: Set per-script fonts, measure, margins, line leading, and page width.
- **Mark styles**: Choose the shape of your bookmarks and the exact twin-rule styling of your references.
- **Voice selection**: Tie your preferred reading voice and playback speed directly to the profile.

Profiles are portable: export your look to a single `.sard` profile package or import one by dragging and dropping it into the window.

## Reading deposits & replacements

Books are often read together. A **Reading Deposit** (*وديعة القراءة*) lets you share your engagement with a book — highlights, notes, references, and word replacements — as a portable `.sard` package.

- **Selective unbinding**: The deposit sheet maps your reading marks across the book. Everything is included by default, and you unbind whatever you prefer to keep private.
- **Deliberate boundary**: What travels is the reading itself. Reading position, progress percentages, bookmarks, database row IDs, and global tags are strictly excluded.
- **Replacements** (*بدائل القراءة*): Correct an OCR error, adjust terminology, or swap names throughout a book cleanly. Replacements can be toggled on or off at any moment without modifying the underlying book file.

## Custom fonts

Bring your own typefaces to the reading desk:

- **Drag-and-drop import**: Drop any `.otf`, `.ttf`, `.woff`, or `.woff2` font file directly onto Sard to add it to your library.
- **Font specimen preview**: Inspect the font with an interactive specimen sheet featuring sample texts in Arabic and Latin across sizes and weights before reading.
- **Independent scripts**: Assign distinct custom fonts to Arabic and Latin text independently to maintain typographic harmony across multilingual books.

## Installation

Download the latest installer from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/Limitless-Soul1/Sard/releases)
page:

- **`Sard_1.3.0_x64-setup.exe`** — NSIS installer, the usual choice
- **`Sard_1.3.0_x64_en-US.msi`** — MSI, for deployment tooling

Requirements: **Windows 10 or 11 (x64)**. The WebView2 runtime is preinstalled on current Windows;
on older builds the installer will prompt for it.

The installers are not code-signed yet, so Windows SmartScreen will warn on first run —
*More info → Run anyway*. If you would rather not, [build from source](#build); it takes a couple
of minutes.

### Updates

From **v1.1.0** onward Sard updates itself. Click the flower in the Library's corner and it checks
GitHub Releases; if there is something newer it shows you the version and the release notes and asks
before doing anything. Accepting downloads the installer, verifies it against Sard's signing key,
installs it and restarts the app.

**Your data is never touched by an update.** The installer replaces only the program files under
`%LOCALAPPDATA%`; your library, reading positions, notes, highlights, references, bookmarks, photo
cards, backgrounds, settings and downloaded voices all live under `%APPDATA%\com.sard.app` and are
left exactly as they are. Deleting that data is possible only through an explicit checkbox on the
*uninstaller*, which an update never reaches.

*v1.0.0 predates the updater and cannot update itself — install v1.1.0 by hand once, and it will
keep itself current from then on.*

## Build

Prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) with npm
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs) — stable, MSVC toolchain
- WebView2 runtime

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Limitless-Soul1/Sard.git
cd Sard
npm install
npm run tauri build      # release binary + MSI/NSIS installers
```

For a faster local build, `npx tauri build --no-bundle` skips the installers and produces just the
executable. Close any running copy of Sard first — it holds its own executable open, and the build
would otherwise fail with a misleading error. See [`BUILD.md`](./BUILD.md) for the details and the
common failure modes.

## Development

```sh
npm run dev              # Vite dev server alone
npm run tauri dev        # the desktop app with hot reload
npm run build            # typecheck + production front-end build
cargo test               # Rust core (run inside src-tauri/)
cargo clippy --all-targets
```

Layout:

```
src/                 React front end — features/, reader-engine/, theme/, i18n/, lib/
src-tauri/           Rust core — commands/, db/, library/, books/, tts.rs, backgrounds/
public/foliate-js/   vendored EPUB engine (pinned; see VENDOR.txt)
public/fonts/        bundled OFL fonts and their licences
scripts/             build tooling
```

Conventions worth knowing before a first patch:

- Every colour resolves to a theme token. Literal colours appear only where something is a *paint*
  — a generated book jacket, a highlight ink, a danger red.
- Logical properties (`inset-inline-*`) wherever the interface mirrors. Physical sides only where
  a side is deliberately pinned: the reader's control cluster, Contents on the left, Notes and the
  settings drawer on the right.
- Database changes are additive migrations under `src-tauri/src/db/migrations_sql/`, numbered and
  never edited after they ship.
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*. If a line looks strange, the reason it is not the obvious
  alternative belongs beside it.

## Roadmap

- Code-signed installers, so Windows stops warning on first run
- macOS and Linux builds
- A wider EPUB conformance pass — footnotes, media overlays, complex fixed-layout
- Deeper PDF support: annotation on the page, text reflow where the document allows it
- Dictionary and translation lookup on selection
- Accessibility: full screen-reader labelling and a keyboard path to every action

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Two things that will make review quick:

1. **Say what you measured.** Sard's history is a record of changes justified by numbers. A patch
   that claims to be faster, lighter or clearer is easiest to accept when it says what moved.
2. **Preserve behaviour unless the change *is* the behaviour.** If a fix alters something a reader
   would notice, call that out explicitly.

Bug reports are most useful with the book that triggered them, if you can share it, or a
description of its structure if you cannot.

## Support the project

Sard is developed independently and given away under a free licence. If it earns a place in your
reading, you can help fund the work that keeps it going:

**[creators.sa/lll9we](https://creators.sa/lll9we)**

Contributions go toward development time, code signing for the installers, and the hardware Sard is
tested on. There is no paid tier and no feature behind a paywall — the whole application is, and
will remain, free software.
