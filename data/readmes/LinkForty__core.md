  # LinkForty Core

  **Open-source alternative to Branch.io, AppsFlyer OneLink, and Firebase Dynamic Links**

  Self-hosted deep linking engine with device detection, analytics, deferred deep linking, and smart routing. No per-click pricing, no vendor lock-in, full data ownership — runs on your own PostgreSQL. Firebase Dynamic Links shut down in August 2025; LinkForty is a production-ready, open-source replacement you can deploy today.

## API Reference

### Links

#### Create a Link

`userId` is optional. When provided, the link is scoped to that user (multi-tenant mode). When omitted, the link has no owner (single-tenant mode).

```bash
POST /api/links
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "userId": "user-uuid",
  "originalUrl": "https://example.com",
  "title": "My Link",
  "description": "Summer campaign link",
  "iosAppStoreUrl": "https://apps.apple.com/app/id123456",
  "androidAppStoreUrl": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.example",
  "webFallbackUrl": "https://example.com/product/123",
  "appScheme": "myapp",
  "iosUniversalLink": "https://example.com/app/product/123",
  "androidAppLink": "https://example.com/app/product/123",
  "deepLinkPath": "/product/123",
  "deepLinkParameters": { "ref": "campaign-1" },
  "utmParameters": {
    "source": "twitter",
    "medium": "social",
    "campaign": "summer-sale"
  },
  "ogTitle": "Check out this deal",

  },
  "attributionWindowHours": 168,
  "customCode": "summer-sale",
  "expiresAt": "2026-12-31T23:59:59Z"
}
```

All fields except `originalUrl` are optional.

#### Get Link-Specific Analytics

```bash
GET /api/analytics/links/:linkId?days=30
```

### Redirect

```bash
GET /:shortCode
GET /:templateSlug/:shortCode
```

Automatically redirects users to the appropriate URL based on device type (iOS/Android/web), evaluates targeting rules, and tracks the click asynchronously.

**Mobile interstitial:** When a link has `appScheme` configured and a store fallback URL (iOS App Store or Google Play), mobile requests receive a smart interstitial page instead of a raw 302 redirect. The interstitial tries to open the app via URI scheme and falls back to the app store after 1.5 seconds. This handles the case where a 302 to a custom URI scheme fails silently when the app is not installed. URL fragments are preserved through the redirect, enabling patterns like E2E encryption where the decryption key lives in the fragment.

**Launchpad page (desktop):** A link to app-only content has nowhere to send a desktop visitor. When the chain resolves no web destination (link → template → workspace `appConfig`), a desktop request gets a hosted landing page instead of an error: the link's title, description and image (`ogTitle` / `ogDescription` / `ogImageUrl`, falling back to `title` / `description`), the app's icon and name, App Store / Google Play buttons, and a QR code so the visitor can finish on their phone. The page is `noindex`, sent with `Cache-Control: no-store` and a content-security policy that allows no script without a per-response nonce, and it never navigates on its own — no timers, no automatic scheme attempts.

When the link does have a web destination, the page offers it as a "Continue on the web" link, so a visitor is never trapped. By default it appears **only** where the alternative is nothing; a link that resolves to a destination still gets its 302. Two knobs change that:

- `organizations.settings.launchpad` (per workspace):

  ```json
  {
    "launchpad": {
      "desktop": "no-destination",     // "no-destination" (default) | "always" | "off"
      "mobile": "store",               // "store" (default) | "page"
      "appName": "Ride Alert",
      "appIconUrl": "https://cdn.example/icon.png",
      "accentColor": "#0f766e",           // buttons, the web link, focus rings
      "backgroundColor": "#101418"        // optional; fixes the page's palette (see below)
    }
  }
  ```

  Without `backgroundColor` the page follows the visitor's light/dark preference. With one, the background is fixed and the text, surfaces and borders are derived from it — a light or a dark brand color both stay legible, and the visitor's theme no longer changes the page.

- `links.launchpad_mode` (per link, `launchpadMode` on the links API): `inherit` (default), `on` or `off`. The link's value wins over the workspace's.

With `desktop: "off"` (or `launchpad_mode: "off"`), a link with no web destination gets the plain "This link opens in an app" page instead.

**Launchpad page (mobile):** With `mobile: "page"`, a phone visitor whose platform has no Universal Link / App Link on the link gets the same page instead of the store redirect or the scheme interstitial: an "Open in app" button when the link has a URI scheme (a tap, not a navigation — the URL fragment is appended on tap), the visitor's own store button, and the web fallback as a "Continue on the web" link. That last one matters inside in-app browsers (Gmail, Facebook, Instagram…), which bypass Universal Links: the store redirect would send someone who *has* the app to the store, so the redirect path prefers the web fallback there to give the OS a second chance on the next hop — and the page keeps that hop available as a tap. Links that carry a Universal Link / App Link keep their 302 regardless, because the OS resolves the installed case before the request reaches this server. `launchpad_mode: "off"` opts a link out; `"on"` does not force the page onto a workspace that chose `"store"`. The default, `"store"`, is unchanged behaviour.

Two hooks on `RedirectRouteOptions` let a host application extend the page without forking it — see [Server Options](#server-options).

### QR Codes

```bash
GET /api/links/:id/qr?format=png&size=300
GET /api/links/:id/qr?format=svg
GET /api/links/:id/qr?url=https://links.example.com/spring/abc123   # encode the link on a custom host / template path
```

Without `url` the code encodes `SHORTLINK_DOMAIN/{shortCode}`. `url` must be an http(s) URL whose path ends in the link's short code; anything else is a 400. The Launchpad page uses it to encode its own address, so a phone that scans the code lands on the same host and path the visitor is on.

### Webhooks

```bash
GET    /api/webhooks?userId=user-uuid
POST   /api/webhooks                     # Body: { name, url, events, userId? }
GET    /api/webhooks/:id?userId=user-uuid
PUT    /api/webhooks/:id?userId=user-uuid
DELETE /api/webhooks/:id?userId=user-uuid
POST   /api/webhooks/:id/test?userId=user-uuid
```

Events: `click_event`, `install_event`, `conversion_event`, `sdk_event`. Payloads are HMAC SHA-256 signed.

### Mobile SDK Endpoints

```bash
POST /api/sdk/v1/install               # Report app install, get deferred deep link
GET  /api/sdk/v1/attribution/:fingerprint  # Debug attribution lookups
POST /api/sdk/v1/event                 # Track in-app conversion events
GET  /api/sdk/v1/resolve/:shortCode    # Resolve link to deep link data (no redirect)
GET  /api/sdk/v1/health                # Health check
```

An event whose `installId` this server no longer has is **recovered, not
refused**: the install is recorded again (marked `recovered`, with no link,
click or confidence score, so it is never mistaken for a fresh attributed
install) and the event is stored against it.

This matters because the id lives in the app's storage for the life of the
install while the server's copy may not: a restore from an older backup, a
manual cleanup, an app build pointed at a fresh database, or an analytics
retention job all leave a live device holding an id nothing resolves. The
bundled SDKs store the id once and never re-register, so without recovery
that device is refused forever with no way back. The 404 that remains carries
`code: "INSTALL_NOT_FOUND"` and `action: "reregister"`.

### Health

```bash
GET  /health                           # Liveness — process is up (no DB access)
GET  /health/ready                     # Readiness — 503 if the database is unreachable
```

### Debug & Testing

```bash
POST /api/debug/simulate               # Simulate a link click with custom parameters
WS   /api/debug/live?userId=user-uuid  # WebSocket live click event stream
GET  /api/debug/user-agents            # Common UA strings for testing
GET  /api/debug/countries              # Common countries list
GET  /api/debug/languages              # Common languages list
```

### Well-Known Routes

```bash
GET /.well-known/apple-app-site-association   # iOS Universal Links
GET /.well-known/assetlinks.json              # Android App Links
```

### OG Preview

```bash
GET /:shortCode/preview                # OG meta tag page for social scrapers
```

## Configuration

### Server Options

```typescript
interface ServerOptions {
  database?: {
    url?: string;           // PostgreSQL connection string
    pool?: {
      min?: number;         // Minimum pool connections (default: 2)
      max?: number;         // Maximum pool connections (default: 10)
    };
  };
  redis?: {
    url: string;            // Redis connection string (optional)
  };
  cors?: {
    origin: string | string[];  // CORS allowed origins (default: '*')
  };
  logger?: boolean;         // Enable Fastify logger (default: true)
  trustProxy?: boolean | number;  // Trust X-Forwarded-For when behind a proxy (default: false)
  redirect?: RedirectRouteOptions;  // See below
}

interface RedirectRouteOptions {
  abuseReportUrl?: string;  // Linked from the link-safety warning page
  launchpad?: {
    // Supply richer content for the launchpad page than the link row carries:
    // a rendered share image, a templated hero. Return null for the default.
    // A hook that throws is logged and treated as null — the page never fails
    // because of it. `heroHtml` is inserted unescaped: render it yourself,
    // never from end-user input.
    resolveContent?: (link, settings) => Promise<LaunchpadContent | null>;
    // Endpoint that receives `{ linkId, event }` beacons from the page —
    // "view" on load, "cta_ios" / "cta_android" / "cta_open" on tap. No
    // cookies or identifiers. Unset means the page sends nothing.
    beaconUrl?: string;
  };
}
```

`renderLaunchpadPage()`, `defaultLaunchpadContent()` and `shouldServeLaunchpadOnDesktop()` are exported so a host can render the same page elsewhere (a settings preview, for instance).

### Running behind a reverse proxy

When Core runs behind a reverse proxy, CDN, or load balancer, set `trustProxy` so the server uses the real client IP from `X-Forwarded-For` for redirect targeting, geo, attribution, and fingerprinting. Pass it when creating the server (e.g. `trustProxy: true` or a number of proxy hops) or set the `TRUST_PROXY` environment variable (e.g. `TRUST_PROXY=1`). Client-provided `ipAddress` in the SDK install request body is **not** used as the trusted IP; it is optional debug metadata only and must not be relied on for attribution.

### Environment Variables

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost/linkforty
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production
CORS_ORIGIN=*
# When behind a reverse proxy: TRUST_PROXY=1 (or number of hops) so client IP is read from X-Forwarded-For
# TRUST_PROXY=1

# Mobile SDK (optional — for iOS Universal Links and Android App Links)
IOS_TEAM_ID=ABC123XYZ
IOS_BUNDLE_ID=com.yourcompany.yourapp
ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME=com.yourcompany.yourapp
ANDROID_SHA256_FINGERPRINTS=AA:BB:CC:DD:...

# Custom domain for QR code URLs (optional)
SHORTLINK_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
```

## Database Schema

Core does not create a `users` table. Authentication and user management are the consumer's responsibility. The `user_id` column on `links` and `webhooks` is optional (nullable, no foreign key) — use it for multi-tenant scoping when your auth layer provides a user identity.

import { generateShortCode } from '@linkforty/core';

const code = generateShortCode(8); // Returns 8-character nanoid
```

### Detect Device

```typescript
import { detectDevice } from '@linkforty/core';

const device = detectDevice(userAgent); // Returns 'ios' | 'android' | 'web'
```

### Get Location from IP

```typescript
import { getLocationFromIP } from '@linkforty/core';

const location = getLocationFromIP('8.8.8.8');
// Returns: { countryCode, countryName, region, city, latitude, longitude, timezone }
```

### Build Redirect URL with UTM Parameters

```typescript
import { buildRedirectUrl } from '@linkforty/core';

const url = buildRedirectUrl('https://example.com', {

  medium: 'social',
  campaign: 'summer-sale'
});
// Returns: https://example.com?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=summer-sale
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Route Registration

```typescript
import { createServer } from '@linkforty/core';

const server = await createServer({
  database: { url: 'postgresql://localhost/linkforty' },
});

// Add custom routes
server.get('/custom', async (request, reply) => {
  return { message: 'Hello World' };
});

await server.listen({ port: 3000 });
```

### Using Individual Route Handlers

```typescript
import Fastify from 'fastify';
import { initializeDatabase, redirectRoutes, linkRoutes } from '@linkforty/core';

const fastify = Fastify();

// Initialize database separately
await initializeDatabase({ url: 'postgresql://localhost/linkforty' });

// Register only specific routes
await fastify.register(redirectRoutes);
await fastify.register(linkRoutes);

await fastify.listen({ port: 3000 });
```

## Deployment

LinkForty can be deployed in multiple ways depending on your needs:

### Production Deployment (Recommended)

Deploy to managed platforms with minimal DevOps overhead:

**Fly.io (Recommended)**
- Global edge deployment
- Managed PostgreSQL and Redis
- Auto-scaling and SSL included
- Starting at ~$10-15/month

[View Fly.io deployment guide](infra/fly.io/DEPLOYMENT.md)

See [`infra/`](infra/) directory for all deployment options and platform-specific guides.

### Docker Deployment (Recommended for Self-Hosting)

**Production-ready Docker images available on Docker Hub:**

```bash
# One-command deployment
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linkforty/core/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

**Image Details:**
- **Registry:** `linkforty/core`
- **Tags:** `latest`, `v1.x.x`, `main`
- **Architectures:** linux/amd64, linux/arm64
- **Base:** Node.js 22 Alpine (minimal, secure)
- **Security:** Non-root user, SBOM attestations

**Version Pinning (Recommended):**
```yaml
services:
  linkforty:
    image: linkforty/core:v1.5.0  # Pin to specific version
```

See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for complete deployment guide including:
- Environment configuration
- Health checks
- Backup strategies
- Production best practices

### Manual Deployment

For custom infrastructure needs:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install @linkforty/core`
2. Set up PostgreSQL database (13+)
3. Set up Redis (optional but recommended)
4. Run migrations: `npm run migrate`
5. Start server: `node server.js`

### Other Platforms

Community-maintained templates available for:
- AWS (ECS/Fargate)
- Google Cloud Run
- Railway, Render, and more

See [`infra/CONTRIBUTING.md`](infra/CONTRIBUTING.md) to add support for additional platforms.

## Performance

- **Redis caching**: 5-minute TTL on link lookups reduces database queries by 90%
- **Database indexes**: Optimized queries for fast link lookups and analytics
- **Async click tracking**: Non-blocking click event logging via `setImmediate()`
- **Connection pooling**: Efficient database connection management (min 2, max 10)

## Security

- **SQL injection protection**: Parameterized queries throughout
- **Input validation**: Zod schema validation on all inputs
- **CORS configuration**: Configurable CORS for API access control
- **Link expiration**: Automatic handling of expired links
- **Webhook signing**: HMAC SHA-256 signed payloads
- **No auth included**: Core does not include authentication. The optional `userId` parameter provides data scoping but does not verify identity. Add your own auth middleware as needed.

## Mobile SDK Integration

LinkForty Core supports iOS Universal Links and Android App Links for seamless deep linking in mobile applications.

### iOS Universal Links Setup

1. **Set environment variables:**
   ```bash
   IOS_TEAM_ID=ABC123XYZ  # Your Apple Developer Team ID
   IOS_BUNDLE_ID=com.yourcompany.yourapp
   ```

2. **Configure in Xcode:**
   - Add "Associated Domains" capability
   - Add domain: `applinks:yourdomain.com`

3. **Verify AASA file:**
   ```bash
   curl https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association
   ```

   Expected response:
   ```json
   {
     "applinks": {
       "apps": [],
       "details": [
         {
           "appID": "ABC123XYZ.com.yourcompany.yourapp",
           "paths": ["*"]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

### Android App Links Setup

1. **Get your SHA-256 fingerprint:**
   ```bash
   # Debug keystore
   keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore \
     -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android

   # Release keystore
   keytool -list -v -keystore /path/to/release.keystore \
     -alias your-alias
   ```

2. **Set environment variables:**
   ```bash
   ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME=com.yourcompany.yourapp
   ANDROID_SHA256_FINGERPRINTS=AA:BB:CC:DD:...

   # Multiple fingerprints (debug + release)
   ANDROID_SHA256_FINGERPRINTS=AA:BB:CC:...,DD:EE:FF:...
   ```

3. **Configure in AndroidManifest.xml:**
   ```xml
   <intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">
     <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
     <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
     <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
     <data android:scheme="https" />
     <data android:host="yourdomain.com" />
   </intent-filter>
   ```

4. **Verify assetlinks.json:**
   ```bash
   curl https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json
   ```

   Expected response:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
       "target": {
         "namespace": "android_app",
         "package_name": "com.yourcompany.yourapp",
         "sha256_cert_fingerprints": ["AA:BB:CC:..."]
       }
     }
   ]
   ```
