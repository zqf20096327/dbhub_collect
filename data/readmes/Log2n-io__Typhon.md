### 📣 8 slides, 4 minutes to understand what it is about ➡️ [Typhon intro](https://www.typhondb.io/deck/typhon-intro).

#### Want to learn mode, read the [**pitch**](PITCH.md).
It makes the case for Typhon — the problem it solves, what's actually built and measured today, and where it's headed — before you dive into the technical docs below.

### ⚠️ The engine is in active development — pre-alpha. ⚠️
Stabilizing fast, not yet production-ready, but ready for POC & early adopters.

**[Alpha NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Typhon) (and [CLI + Workbench](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Typhon.Cli))**, full **[reference documentation](https://doc.typhondb.io)** are now live. Most of the public API is now stable — and you can **[open an issue](https://github.com/Log2n-io/Typhon/issues)** or go to the **[discussions](https://github.com/Log2n-io/Typhon/discussions)** for help, questions, or feedback.


**A microsecond-latency ACID data engine combining ECS archetype storage with tick-based parallel execution.**

Typhon is an embedded data engine for real-time workloads like game servers, simulations, and stateful dataflow.<br/> 
It pairs a microsecond-latency ACID store — MVCC snapshot isolation, configurable durability, source-generated ECS archetype accessors — with a tick-based parallel runtime that dispatches fine-grained system chunks across worker threads, each operating directly on the store.<br/>
The runtime doesn't sit on top of the database — it runs inside it.

## Key Features

📚 This is a curated highlight reel — see the full **[Feature Catalog](https://doc.typhondb.io/latest/guides/feature-catalog/README.html)** for every capability, categorized and cross-linked to source and tests.

- **Microsecond Operations** — Optimized for µs-level latency with pinned memory, SIMD, and lock-free reads
- **ACID Transactions** — Full transactional semantics with optimistic concurrency control
- **MVCC Snapshot Isolation** — Readers never block writers; each transaction sees a consistent snapshot
- **ECS Archetype System** — Entities are typed by archetype; components are blittable structs with source-generated accessors and archetype inheritance
- **Larger-Than-RAM Storage** — The database is a memory-mapped, paged file on disk, virtualized through a page cache that holds only the hot working set — so resident memory is bounded by the cache, not the database. Manipulate a 100 GiB store on a machine with a fraction of that RAM; component data, indexes, and the entity map all page to/from disk on demand (in-memory ECS frameworks, by contrast, must fit the entire world in RAM)
- **Workbench Dev UI** — **📣[Demo video #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIFqwPJKOlA)📣** A local, browser-based companion (ASP.NET Core + React/Vite) — *DataGrip for Typhon*, not just a profiler. Open a recorded `.typhon-trace`, attach to a live engine over TCP, or open a `.typhon` database file directly. **Performance:** per-tick profiler timeline with CPU-sample + off-CPU overlays, Top Spans, Call Tree, Critical Path, System DAG. **Data & schema:** component/archetype browsers, Schema Inspector, a zoomable Hilbert-curve Database File Map, live Resource Tree. **Queries:** catalog, plan tree, per-execution inspector — all in a dockable, persisted workspace
- **Entity Clusters** — SoA batched storage co-locating up to 64 entities per cluster, with cluster-native SIMD predicate evaluation (AVX-512 / AVX2 / scalar dispatch), zone-map pruning, and k-way sorted merge
- **Query Engine** — Typed queries with `Where`, `With`/`Without` filters, polymorphic iteration, OR logic, navigation joins, and a cluster execution path that routes filtered scans through SIMD gather-compare on cluster SoA columns
- **Entity Relationships** — Typed `EntityLink<T>` references for 1:1, 1:N, and N:M relationships, with declarative cascade delete and reactive FK-joined queries
- **Views & Change Tracking** — Incremental entity-set monitoring (added/removed/modified detection) via ring-buffer delta streaming for indexed queries — opaque/unindexed predicates still work but fall back to a full re-scan per refresh; SingleVersion/Transient view support is still being validated end-to-end
- **B+Tree Indexes** — Cache-aligned 256-byte nodes with optimistic lock coupling and specialized key-size variants
- **Spatial Indexing** — Page-backed wide R-Tree for AABB / Radius / Ray / Frustum / kNN queries, plus a per-cell cluster broadphase (`SpatialGrid`) with BMI2 Morton-encoded cell keys and multi-resolution `SimTier` dispatch for near/far/coarse simulation budgets
- **Write-Ahead Logging** — WAL (v2, always on) with configurable durability modes (Deferred, GroupCommit, Immediate) and coalesced tick-boundary snapshots via `TickFence` / `ClusterTickFence` chunks for the runtime tick loop
- **Page Integrity** — CRC32C checksums, suspect-page detection, and crash-recovery rebuild (index + EntityMap); full-page images were retired in favor of a rebuild-based torn-page net
- **Schema Versioning** — Component/field-level revisions with migration functions, compatible-evolution support, and audit history; automatic archetype layout-drift detection at database open is still landing
- **Three Storage Modes** — Versioned (full MVCC + WAL), SingleVersion (last-writer-wins; per-tx TickFence or **Committed** durability discipline — atomic, zero-loss, no revision chain), Transient (heap-only, no persistence)
- **Configurable Durability** — Choose per-UnitOfWork whether data is deferred, group-committed, or immediately fsynced
- **Bulk Load Session** — Opt-in exclusive write path for fast dataset ingestion, batching writes through a recycled Transaction and committing the whole load atomically behind a checkpoint barrier
- **Game Server Runtime** — Tick-based micro-task `DagScheduler` with any-worker parallel dispatch, per-system change filters, typed MPSC event queues, side-transactions, cluster dormancy with staggered heartbeat wake, checkerboard Red/Black dispatch, and a growing overload response ladder (system throttling, tick-rate modulation up to 6x, a last-resort player-shedding callback) — still evolving, with finer-grained escalation designed but not a current priority
- **Subscription Server + Client SDK** — TCP delta streaming of published views with MemoryPack serialization, per-client incremental sync, backpressure-driven resync, and a zero-engine-dependency `Typhon.Client` assembly for game clients
- **Observability** — Runtime telemetry, metrics, and diagnostics with zero-cost JIT-eliminated toggles
- **Deep-Trace Profiler** — Per-tick Gantt and flame-graph visualization via a `.typhon-trace` binary format, live TCP streaming to a React/Vite viewer, and optional `dotnet-trace` CPU sampling correlation for full managed-stack profiles
- **Interactive Shell (typhon)** — Database REPL for inspection and debugging
- **Public/Internal API split** — Two namespaces per assembly (`Typhon.Engine` / `Typhon.Engine.Internals`), each subsystem folder split into `public/` + `internals/`, enforced at compile time by the `TYPHON008` Roslyn analyzer
- **Roslyn Analyzers** — Custom analyzers detecting undisposed engine resources at compile time + the `TYPHON008` internal-API leak detector

## Quick Start

A taste — declare a component and an archetype, spawn an entity, read it back:

```csharp
// A component is a plain struct; an archetype is the fixed set of components an entity has.
[Component("Game.Health", 1, StorageMode = StorageMode.Versioned)]
public struct Health { public int Current, Max; }

[Archetype(1)]
public sealed partial class Unit : Archetype<Unit>
{
    public static readonly Comp<Health> Health = Register<Health>();
}

// ...build the engine + register the schema (see the Guide), then:
using var tx = dbe.CreateQuickTransaction();
var id = tx.Spawn<Unit>(Unit.Health.Set(new Health { Current = 100, Max = 100 }));
var hp = tx.Open(id).Read(Unit.Health);   // hp.Current == 100
tx.Commit();
```

> *Illustrative — engine build + schema registration are elided. The **[User Guide](https://doc.typhondb.io/latest/guides/README.html)** has the full, **runnable** version ([`doc/guide/example`](doc/guide/example)).*

### A 5 minutes round-trip
Install the [Typhon.Cli](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Typhon.cli) NuGet package and follow the [instructions](src/Typhon.Shell/PACKAGE.md) to create a sample app, run it, profile it, open the database and the profiled session in the workbench.
