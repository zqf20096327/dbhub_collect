<p align="center"><strong>Query and browse databases—and stage SQL row edits—without leaving Emacs.</strong></p>

Clutch keeps queries in editable buffers, shows results in an interactive grid, and stages supported SQL row changes for preview before execution. It provides sidecar-free paths for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, and Redis, plus JDBC access to Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, Snowflake, Redshift, ClickHouse, DuckDB, and other databases.

![Clutch query console with a result grid and XML value viewer](docs/screenshots/clutch-overview.png)

## Quick Start

The shortest path uses SQLite, which requires only Emacs 29.1+—no protocol package or Java runtime.

### 1. Install Clutch

With MELPA or another package archive configured:

```emacs-lisp
(package-install 'clutch)
```

### 2. Open a SQLite database

```text
M-x clutch-query-sqlite-file
```

Select a SQLite database file. Clutch opens a connected query console in an editable SQL buffer.

### 3. Run a query

```sql
SELECT sqlite_version();
```

Press `C-c C-c`. Clutch executes the region when one is active, otherwise the statement at point, and displays the result below the query buffer.

For MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, or JDBC, continue with [Installation Details](#installation-details) and [Saved Connections and Query Workflow](#saved-connections-and-query-workflow).

## Key Capabilities

- **Keep query context visible:** execute a region or statement without leaving the SQL buffer; results refresh in a split grid and the last executed statement stays marked in the fringe on graphical displays or the left margin in terminals.
- **Inspect wide or structured results:** navigate a single-page table, scroll horizontally, open record and full-value views, and preview truncated JSON, XML, text, or BLOB values after a brief pause without dragging the preview across cells during navigation.
- **Edit supported SQL results with guardrails:** stage inserts, updates, and deletes locally, inspect the execution preview, and submit only after validation and confirmation.
- **Navigate with database context:** complete scoped tables and columns, inspect Eldoc and object definitions, follow foreign keys, and reuse cache-first metadata without blocking point motion.
- **Refine and export results:** apply server-side `WHERE` and `ORDER BY`, use client-side substring filtering, copy selections as TSV, CSV, or Org tables, and export complete pageable results as CSV or TSV with consistent Transient controls for optional headers and clipboard/file destinations.
- **See connection state where it matters:** keep separate query consoles, reconnect from preserved parameters, and view schema-refresh, transaction, timeout, and diagnostic state in the relevant buffers.
- **Choose the backend path you need:** use native or pure-Elisp integrations when available, or the Java 17+ [clutch-jdbc-agent](https://github.com/LuciusChen/clutch-jdbc-agent) for JDBC databases.

### Row-editing boundaries

Clutch stages `UPDATE` and `DELETE` only when it can identify a stable source row:

| Backend | No-primary-key support |
|---|---|
| MySQL native | Non-null unique keys; no physical row-locator fallback |
| PostgreSQL native | Non-null unique keys, then `ctid` for ordinary heap tables |
| SQLite native | Non-null unique keys, then `rowid` for tables not declared `WITHOUT ROWID` |
| Oracle JDBC | Non-null unique keys, then `ROWID` for confirmed base tables |
| Other JDBC backends | Non-null unique keys only |

Joined, grouped, derived, or otherwise ambiguous result sets remain read-only unless Clutch can identify one source table and a matching row identity. Schema-qualified JDBC sources retain their schema for identity lookup and staged mutations; Oracle views and synonyms, including dictionary relations such as `USER_TABLES`, remain read-only and skip unsafe identity probes.

## Backend Support

| Backend | Support level | Requirements and notes |
|---|---|---|
| MySQL | Core SQL support | Validated against MySQL 5.6, MySQL 8.0, MySQL 8.4 LTS, and MariaDB 10.11 |
| PostgreSQL | Core SQL support | Requires [`pgsql`](https://melpa.org/#/pgsql), available from MELPA |
| SQLite | Core SQL support | Uses Emacs 29.1+ built-in `sqlite-*` functions; no external dependency |
| Oracle / SQL Server | Core SQL support via JDBC | Requires Java 17+ and `clutch-jdbc-agent.jar` |
| DuckDB | Core SQL model, generic JDBC entry | Uses a file-backed `jdbc:duckdb:...` URL and the DuckDB JDBC driver |
| MongoDB | Basic native document support; optional SQL Interface surface | Native use requires `mongodb.el`; SQL Interface uses `:surface sql-interface` and JDBC |
| Redis | Basic key/value support | Requires `redis.el`; includes command buffers, bounded key browsing, and type-aware values |
| ClickHouse / Snowflake / Redshift / DB2 / generic JDBC | Basic SQL / query-first support | Backend-specific limits apply to editing, transactions, and dialect behavior |

See [Backend support levels](docs/backend-support.org) for the precise support policy and non-relational boundaries.

## Installation Details

The SQLite Quick Start has no optional dependency. For other backends, install only the protocol package you use:

| Backend | Extra Emacs package |
|---|---|
| `:backend mysql` | [mysql.el](https://github.com/LuciusChen/mysql.el) |
| `:backend pg` | [`pgsql`](https://melpa.org/#/pgsql) |
| `:backend mongodb` | [mongodb.el](https://github.com/LuciusChen/mongodb.el) |
| `:backend redis` | [redis.el](https://github.com/LuciusChen/redis.el) |
| `:backend sqlite` | None; Emacs 29.1+ provides SQLite |
| `:backend jdbc` / Oracle / SQL Server / ClickHouse / DB2 / DuckDB | None in Emacs; uses the bundled JDBC adapter |

If a configured native backend package is missing, Clutch reports it when connecting. Install that package with your package manager, ensure it is on `load-path`, and reconnect.

JDBC support ships with Clutch, but its runtime requires Java 17+, `clutch-jdbc-agent.jar`, and a database driver jar where applicable. Clutch pins agent 0.2.25, which preserves structured BLOB whitespace, keeps CLOB previews at complete Unicode character boundaries, bounds per-connection lock retention, and runs Oracle schema-wide listings on their own session so they cannot delay a query's metadata lookups. On first connection, Clutch can prompt to download the agent and supported drivers; it verifies the configured agent jar against its SHA-256 before startup. See the [JDBC backend guide](docs/jdbc-backend.org) for setup, supported drivers, connection examples, and transaction behavior.

For source checkouts, add Clutch and each native protocol checkout you use to `load-path`:

```emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/clutch")
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/mysql.el")   ; only for :backend mysql
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/pgsql.el")   ; only for :backend pg
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/mongodb.el") ; only for :backend mongodb
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/redis.el")   ; only for :backend redis
(require 'clutch)
```

Org-Babel integration lives in the separate [ob-clutch](https://github.com/LuciusChen/ob-clutch) package.

## Requirements

- Emacs 29.1+
- MySQL 5.6+, PostgreSQL 12+, or SQLite through Emacs built-in support for the corresponding SQL backends
- Java 17+ only for JDBC backends
- Current `mongodb.el` or `redis.el` for the corresponding native document/key-value backend

MariaDB 10.11 has been live-validated through the native `mysql` backend, including TLS with `mysql_native_password`; other MariaDB versions are expected to be broadly compatible but are not yet part of the regular test matrix. MySQL 5.6 has no native JSON column type, MariaDB exposes `JSON` as checked text, and the older `mysql_old_password` plugin is not supported by the native client.

## Upgrading From Pre-Split Checkouts

Current Clutch releases keep native protocol clients and Org-Babel integration in separate packages. If you are upgrading from a checkout that bundled them:

- Install [mysql.el](https://github.com/LuciusChen/mysql.el) separately for `:backend mysql`.
- Install [`pgsql`](https://melpa.org/#/pgsql) from MELPA for `:backend pg`.
- Install [mongodb.el](https://github.com/LuciusChen/mongodb.el) separately for `:backend mongodb`.
- Install [redis.el](https://github.com/LuciusChen/redis.el) separately for `:backend redis`.
- Install [ob-clutch](https://github.com/LuciusChen/ob-clutch) separately for Org-Babel source blocks.
- Add an explicit `:backend` to every saved connection.

## Interactive Client

### Saved Connections and Query Workflow

#### 1. Configure connections

```emacs-lisp
(require 'clutch)

(setq clutch-connect-timeout-seconds 10
      clutch-read-idle-timeout-seconds 30
      clutch-query-timeout-seconds 20
      clutch-jdbc-rpc-timeout-seconds 15
      clutch-jdbc-validate-after-idle-seconds 300)

(setq clutch-connection-alist
      '(("dev-mysql"  . (:backend mysql
                          :host "127.0.0.1" :port 3306
                          :user "root"
                          :database "mydb"
                          :connect-timeout 5
                          :read-idle-timeout 60))
        ("dev-pg"     . (:backend pg
                          :host "127.0.0.1" :port 5432
                          :user "postgres"
                          :database "mydb"))
        ("prod-pg-ssh" . (:backend pg
                          :host "pg.internal" :port 5432
                          :user "app" :database "appdb"
                          :ssh-host "bastion-prod"))
        ("remote-pg"  . (:backend pg
                          :host "127.0.0.1" :port 55433
                          :user "app" :database "appdb"
                          :tramp-default-directory "/ssh:devbox:/workspace/"))
        ("dev-redis"  . (:backend redis
                          :host "127.0.0.1" :port 6379
                          :database 0))
        ("dev-sqlite" . (:backend sqlite
                          :database "/path/to/my.db"))))
```

- Every entry must resolve to a backend (`mysql`, `pg`, `sqlite`, `mongodb`, `redis`, or a JDBC driver symbol such as `oracle`). Prefer keeping `:backend` in `clutch-connection-alist` so completion can show backend icons; if it is omitted, an encrypted `:profile-entry` must provide `backend`.
- SQLite is local and file-based: only `:database` is required; use `":memory:"` for a transient database. Do not combine SQLite with `:ssh-host` or `:tramp-default-directory`.
- `:password` is optional for network backends; see [Password Management](#password-management) for auth-source integration.
- `:profile-entry` can load missing connection fields from encrypted `pass` or `.authinfo.gpg` profiles when host/user/database metadata should not live in Emacs init files.
- Network backends accept `:connect-timeout` and `:read-idle-timeout`. PostgreSQL and JDBC also accept `:query-timeout`; JDBC additionally accepts `:rpc-timeout`.
- `clutch-jdbc-validate-after-idle-seconds` is a global JDBC safety threshold, not a saved-connection timeout. It defaults to 300 seconds; set it to `nil` or 0 to disable the pre-execution validation and retain next-command-only recovery.
- TLS can be enabled with `:tls t`. For explicit plaintext, prefer `:ssl-mode disabled` on MySQL and `:sslmode disable` on PostgreSQL.
- `:ssh-host` and `:tramp-default-directory` both create local forwards for structured `:host` / `:port` endpoints. `:ssh-host` uses a `~/.ssh/config` host alias, while `:tramp-default-directory` derives the origin from an ssh-like or container TRAMP directory.
- Query-console SQL is saved by connection identity rather than saved connection name, so renaming a saved connection keeps the same console SQL.

JDBC-backed databases use their clutch driver/dialect symbol as `:backend`, such as `oracle`; `:backend` does not merely select the Java driver. Reserve `:backend jdbc` for databases without a dedicated clutch backend. See [docs/jdbc-backend.org](docs/jdbc-backend.org) for supported databases and setup.

#### 2. Open a query console

```
M-x clutch-query-console     ;; Select a saved connection, or press RET on an
                              ;; unmatched connection to create a temporary connection
M-x clutch-query-sqlite-file ;; Shortcut: select a SQLite file → opens a connected SQL console
                             ;; Header-line: MySQL[root@127.0.0.1:3306/mydb]
                             ;;         or PostgreSQL[postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/mydb]
                             ;;         or SQLite[my.db]
```

`clutch-query-console` lists both open consoles and saved connections. An open saved console appears once, while open temporary and SQLite consoles remain directly selectable. Repeated calls with the same connection switch to the existing buffer instead of opening a new one. Pressing RET with no matching connection starts a temporary connection flow; SQLite is part of that flow and asks for a database file instead of host/user credentials. `clutch-query-sqlite-file` is the direct shortcut for local SQLite files. If no saved connections or consoles exist, `clutch-query-console` starts the temporary connection flow immediately.

#### 3. Write and execute SQL

```sql
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10;
```

Press `C-c C-c` to execute. If a region is selected, the selected SQL runs; otherwise the statement at point runs. Select a region first when exact execution boundaries matter. Results appear in a split result buffer below.

By default, `TRUNCATE` and `UPDATE` or `DELETE` without an effective `WHERE` require entering the exact token `YES`. Customize `clutch-high-risk-query-confirmation` to use an ordinary `yes-or-no` prompt or to disable this high-risk confirmation. Other destructive SQL keeps its ordinary confirmation prompt, and each statement asks at most once.

#### 4. Control transactions

For native MySQL and PostgreSQL, and for JDBC connections that run in manual-commit mode, clutch uses the same transaction keys:

- `C-c C-a` toggles auto-commit when supported
- `C-c C-m` commits
- `C-c C-u` rolls back

The same shortcuts work in an attached Result Browser or Record view when that SQL connection supports manual transactions. Result submission follows the current transaction mode, like DataGrip's data editor: in Auto mode, `C-c C-c` (`clutch-result-submit`) submits and automatically commits the locally staged INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE batch on transaction-capable backends; in Manual mode, it uses a savepoint inside the current server transaction, where `C-c C-m` (`clutch-commit`) commits and `C-c C-u` rolls back. If a later staged statement fails, Clutch rolls this submission back to its savepoint while preserving work that was already in the transaction, so the retained staged batch can be corrected and retried safely. On savepoint-capable connections, submitting multiple staged statements never requires changing transaction mode first. Drivers without savepoint support, including the current DuckDB JDBC driver, reject Manual-mode staged submission before running staged DML; switch to Auto mode to submit that batch.

SQLite does not expose these transaction controls; its console header omits the `Tx` segment.

Native MySQL maps `C-c C-a` to the server session's autocommit flag directly. Native PostgreSQL uses a clutch-managed manual mode: enabling manual mode does not send `BEGIN` immediately, the first foreground statement opens the transaction lazily, and transactional DDL also counts as uncommitted work, so toggle/disconnect stays blocked until you commit or roll back.

If recovery of an atomic submission fails, or any `COMMIT` returns without a known outcome, the transaction indicator changes to `Tx: Uncertain`. Clutch then blocks further queries, commit, and transaction-mode changes; explicitly roll back with `C-c C-u`, or reconnect if rollback cannot recover the session. Either action restores a usable session, but it cannot prove that an earlier uncertain commit did not happen, so verify the database before retrying retained work.

### Password Management

Connection entries may include `:password`, but auth-source is preferred. When `:password` is omitted, clutch resolves credentials through:

- an explicit `:profile-entry` whose profile contains a password/secret
- pass entries via `auth-source-pass`, matching the connection name suffix or an explicit `:pass-entry`
- standard `auth-source-search` by `:host`, `:user`, and `:port`
- an interactive `read-passwd` prompt as the final fallback

```emacs-lisp
(require 'auth-source-pass)

(setq clutch-connection-alist
      '(("dev-mysql" . (:backend mysql
                         :host "db.example.com" :port 3306
                         :user "alice" :database "mydb"))))
```

```bash
pass insert mysql/dev-mysql   ;; or just: pass insert dev-mysql
```

For JDBC connections (including Org-Babel blocks), an explicit `:pass-entry` that resolves to no password now fails fast in Emacs instead of sending a null password to the driver. If you use `pass`, make sure `auth-source-pass` is enabled first.

#### Encrypted connection profiles

If host/IP addresses, usernames, or database names should not live in your Emacs configuration, use `:profile-entry`. The profile is read before normal connection canonicalization. Keep the transport choice in named connection entries when the same database profile needs both direct and SSH routes.

```emacs-lisp
(setq clutch-connection-alist
      '(("prod-mysql" . (:backend mysql :profile-entry "mysql/prod"))
        ("prod-reporting" . (:backend mysql :profile-entry "mysql/reporting"))))
```

Clutch treats profile fields as defaults. Explicit keywords in `clutch-connection-alist` override values from `pass` or `.authinfo.gpg`, including `:backend`, `:host`, `:port`, `:user`, `:database`, `:ssh-host`, and `:tramp-default-directory`. Keeping non-sensitive hints such as `:backend` in the alist lets Clutch show backend icons in completion without decrypting encrypted profiles just to render the candidate list. If `:backend` is omitted, Clutch will still read it from the profile when connecting.

With `pass`, the first line remains the password and the remaining lines use the standard `key: value` convention:

```
db-password-here
backend: mysql
host: db.example.com
port: 3306
user: app_user
database: app_db
connect-timeout: 8
read-idle-timeout: 30
```

Create or edit the entry with:

```bash
pass edit mysql/prod
```

With `.authinfo.gpg`, use the `machine` field as the logical profile id. Since auth-source maps `machine` to `:host`, put the real database host in `db-host`:

```
machine mysql/prod login app_user password db-password-here \
  backend mysql db-host db.example.com port 3306 database app_db
```

Explicit fields are useful for variants such as a read-only database while still keeping the host and password encrypted:

```emacs-lisp
("prod-mysql-ro" . (:backend mysql :profile-entry "mysql/prod"
                    :database "app_readonly"))
```

`:pass-entry` keeps its existing meaning: it is only a password source. Use `:profile-entry` when the encrypted entry should provide full connection metadata.

See the [auth-source manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/auth/index.html) for supported credential stores.

### SSH Tunnels via ~/.ssh/config

For a database that is sometimes reachable directly and sometimes through a bastion, define two saved connections over one encrypted profile:

```emacs-lisp
(setq clutch-connection-alist
      '(("prod-pg" . (:backend pg :profile-entry "pg/prod"))
        ("prod-pg-ssh" . (:backend pg :profile-entry "pg/prod"
                           :ssh-host "bastion-prod"))))
```

From a local buffer, the first entry connects directly. The second always opens a local SSH forward through the `bastion-prod` alias in your normal OpenSSH configuration; `:ssh-host` is an explicit transport request, not a database hostname or an automatic fallback hint. The shared profile holds the database endpoint and credentials without duplicating its password.

Use `M-x clutch-prepare-ssh-host`, or `S` from `C-c ?`, when the first SSH use needs host-key confirmation or a key passphrase. The batch tunnel itself uses non-interactive OpenSSH auth, so load keys into `ssh-agent` or configure `AddKeysToAgent` when needed. Clutch does not probe or switch between the two routes; select the connection whose transport you want. Existing explicit and inferred TRAMP forwarding rules remain unchanged. SSH forwarding applies to structured `:host` / `:port` entries; opaque `:url` profiles, including JDBC and MongoDB URLs, still need manual tunnels or backend-level transport support. Backend-specific tunnel details live in [docs/native-backends.md](docs/native-backends.md).

### TRAMP-aware Connection Origin

Opening a TRAMP buffer does not globally change clutch. TRAMP is considered only when a connection is created, and the chosen origin is stored for later reconnect, completion, refresh, and query execution. Configure `:tramp-default-directory` when a profile should always use a remote-machine or container endpoint:

```emacs-lisp
("remote-pg" . (:backend pg
                 :host "127.0.0.1" :port 55433
                 :user "app" :database "appdb"
                 :tramp-default-directory "/ssh:devbox:/workspace/"))
```

Without `:ssh-host` or `:tramp-default-directory`, commands invoked from a TRAMP buffer can infer that buffer's remote context. `clutch-tramp-context-policy` controls this:

- `nil`: never infer TRAMP context
- `ask` (default): ask before using the current TRAMP context
- `auto`: use the current TRAMP context without asking

Supported origin types, container relay requirements, and forwarding limits are documented in [docs/native-backends.md](docs/native-backends.md).

### Working with SQL files

You can also open any `.sql` file, enable `clutch-mode`, and connect manually — the query console is not required.

```
1. Open a .sql file
2. M-x clutch-mode        — enable clutch (inherits sql-mode syntax/fontification)
3. C-c C-e                 — select a saved connection or enter params manually
                             Mode-line shows MySQL[root@127.0.0.1:3306/mydb]
4. C-c C-c                 — execute region, or the current statement/query at point
```

In ordinary `clutch-mode` or REPL buffers, `C-c C-e` keeps that generic connect flow: select a saved connection, or press RET with no matching connection to enter temporary params. For SQLite files, prefer `M-x clutch-query-sqlite-file`, or `M-x clutch-query-console` followed by RET with no matching connection and backend `sqlite`; both open a connected SQL console rather than using the database file buffer as the editor. In query-console buffers, `C-c C-e` reconnects the connection already associated with that console, without reopening the global connection picker. To switch to another saved or temporary connection, use `M-x clutch-query-console`.

For deeper troubleshooting, enable `M-x clutch-debug-mode`, reproduce the failure, then inspect `*clutch-debug*`. Enabling the mode starts a fresh capture window and creates that dedicated buffer automatically. It is the only supported debug UI, and it shows problem records, generated/internal SQL when relevant, recent redacted debug events, and JDBC stderr/debug payload when available.

To activate `clutch-mode` automatically for `.sql` files, add to your config:

```emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.sql\\'" . clutch-mode))
```

`.mysql` files activate `clutch-mode` automatically without any configuration.

### Interactive Client Guide

Detailed key bindings, result-browser workflows, object navigation, Embark integration, transient menus, faces, timeouts, and customization now live in [docs/interactive-client.org](docs/interactive-client.org).

Common entry points:

- `C-c C-c` executes the region or statement at point
- Standard completion completes SQL identifiers at point, including empty column positions; `C-c TAB` invokes it explicitly
- SQL table/alias context is cached per statement and refreshed after edits or scope changes; incomplete statements do not scan other statements to infer source tables.
- `M-.` jumps SQL aliases to their statement definition; object lookup uses `C-c C-d` / `C-c C-j`
- In Result Browser buffers, `{` and `}` jump to the first and last visible data columns; Clutch's own row-number column replaces native display line numbers there
- `C-c ?` opens the transient menu
- Stateful transient entries highlight their current choice; unavailable actions stay visible but inapt when their surrounding context is still useful
- `C-c C-j` starts the object workflow
- `RET` opens record view from a result row
- Pressing `s` cycles sorting for the result column at point; simple table results use server-side `ORDER BY`, while UNION, grouped, derived, and other non-rewritable results sort the current page locally. Use `C` to jump to another visible column first, or click a result header to cycle it
- `i`, `d`, and `C-c C-c` stage and submit row changes in result buffers
- The result footer keeps transaction state and staged-change counts ahead of row statistics and sorting. Long sort/filter labels are shortened; their full text remains available on hover and through the existing sort/filter commands.
- `/` filters only the loaded page. The footer keeps the original page range and reports a separate matching-row fraction; an empty filtered page shows how to change or clear the filter. Clearing it restores the page without querying the database.
- Copy (`c`) identifies its scope as the current cell or selected cells. Export (`e`) explicitly targets all result rows, fetching all pages when supported, and warns in its menu when an active local filter is ignored. Export does not adopt the selected cells or local filter; SQL `WHERE` and explicit row limits still apply.
- Insert forms use `C-c C-n` for SQL NULL, `C-c C-e` for an empty string, and `C-c C-d` to omit a field and use its server default. Typing `NULL` inserts literal text; cloning preserves SQL NULL and empty strings as distinct values. Single-row CSV/TSV imports replace a field's previous special state with the imported value. Opening and cancelling a JSON child editor preserves the insert field's value and state. Clones and INSERT exports retain the source schema.
- JDBC CLOBs longer than the returned preview remain explicitly marked as incomplete. They can be viewed, but editing, cloning a copied incomplete field, and exporting that value are blocked to prevent data loss. Complete short CLOBs, including emoji and empty text, remain usable as ordinary text.
- CSV, TSV, INSERT and UPDATE file exports write in batches and replace the destination only after the export succeeds. Symbolic links are preserved and their final target receives the output; the selected filename determines transformations such as `.gz` compression, even if the link target has a different extension. These transformations run on the complete encoded output and may hold it in memory. A failed or cancelled export preserves the existing file. CSV/TSV default to UTF-8 with one BOM for Excel; custom UTF-16 exports retain their byte order and line endings without adding BOMs between batches. Clipboard exports and native document `insertMany` helpers retain their complete output in memory; backends may also materialize a bounded or nonpageable query before formatting begins.
- Explicit SQL row limits (`LIMIT`, `OFFSET`, `TOP`, `FETCH`) remain part of the query during pagination and export. Ordinary column, table and alias names such as `top` or `fetch` do not disable pagination.
- `C-c '` edits the current result cell or record-view field; JSON columns and text values containing JSON objects or arrays open in a JSON editor, and `C-c C-c` stages or `C-c C-k` cancels the edit directly when that JSON editor opened automatically. In ordinary edit buffers, nullable columns offer `C-c C-n` for database `NULL`, while columns with a usable default offer `C-c C-d` for database `DEFAULT`
- `C-c C-k` discards the staged change at point from a result cell or record-view field
- `M-x clutch-copy-context-for-agent` copies SQL, table metadata, and the latest matching visible result sample as Markdown for an external agent; the same command is available as `k` in the main and result transients. Table metadata reuses the existing object describe path.

### MongoDB Backend

MongoDB is basic native document support through `mongodb.el`: ordinary MongoDB deployments, supported MongoDB Shell / MQL helper commands, and shared object/result workflows. It is not a full `mongosh` JavaScript runtime. MongoDB SQL Interface stays on the same `mongodb` backend as `:surface sql-interface` and requires the JDBC sidecar plus MongoDB JDBC driver jar. See [docs/mongodb-backend.org](docs/mongodb-backend.org).

The shared `clutch-switch-schema` command lists databases visible to the current MongoDB user and changes Clutch's logical database without reconnecting.

### Redis Backend

Redis is basic key/value support through `redis.el`. It connects to ordinary Redis TCP endpoints, uses line-oriented `clutch-redis-mode` command buffers, and maps key browsing/type-aware reads into the shared Clutch grid. Redis support is intentionally basic: no SQL row editing, joins, row identity, transaction workflow, pub/sub loops, cluster management, or stream consumer workflows. Generated discovery and collection-browse operations are bounded; use explicit scan/range commands for larger traversals. See [docs/backend-support.org](docs/backend-support.org) and [docs/native-backends.md](docs/native-backends.md) for support boundaries.

Redis profiles may select an initial logical database with `:database`. Clutch does not offer it in `clutch-switch-schema` because Redis has no generally available, ACL-safe command that enumerates every configured logical database.

### JDBC Backend

JDBC support covers Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, Snowflake, Redshift, ClickHouse, MongoDB SQL Interface, DuckDB, and generic JDBC URLs through the [clutch-jdbc-agent](https://github.com/LuciusChen/clutch-jdbc-agent) sidecar. For setup, driver installation, connection examples, backend-specific notes, and transaction behavior, see [docs/jdbc-backend.org](docs/jdbc-backend.org).

The agent keeps stdout exclusively for its JSON protocol and redirects third-party Java console output to captured stderr before loading drivers. Driver messages such as Snowflake external-browser login status therefore remain available to Clutch diagnostics without breaking the connection.

For the sidecar wire protocol and agent internals, see [docs/jdbc-agent-protocol.md](docs/jdbc-agent-protocol.md).

### Org-Babel Integration

Org-Babel integration lives in the separate [ob-clutch](https://github.com/LuciusChen/ob-clutch) package and supports saved clutch connections plus MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and generic JDBC-backed `clutch` source blocks. For setup, block examples, header arguments, and connection caching, see [docs/org-babel.org](docs/org-babel.org).

Local SQLite filenames are resolved against the command's source directory during connection preparation. With the matching `ob-clutch` cache fix, relative `:database app.db` headers in different directories open different databases; `:memory:` remains an in-memory connection.

### Timeouts, Interrupts, and Customization

Timeouts can be configured globally or per connection, and long-running queries can be interrupted with `C-g`. Backend-specific cancel behavior, debug workflow, result displayers, schema warmup, CSV/TSV encoding, and completion customization are documented in [Query Timeout and Interrupt](docs/interactive-client.org#query-timeout-and-interrupt).

## Testing

### Unit tests (no server required)

The non-live CI gate used by GitHub Actions can be run locally:

```bash
./test/run-ci.sh all
```

Focused local runs can start with tagged smoke coverage, or pass any ERT selector to `main` or `db`. `main` defaults to the historical `clutch-test` gate; it can also load a colon-separated module list for focused runs:

```bash
./test/run-ci.sh smoke
CLUTCH_TEST_MODULES=clutch-test-sql ./test/run-ci.sh main
CLUTCH_TEST_SELECTOR='"^clutch-test-completion-"' ./test/run-ci.sh main
```

Backend targets such as `db-jdbc`, `db-mysql`, `db-pg`, `db-mongodb`, `db-redis`, and `db-sqlite` remain available.

Default ERT runs intentionally skip live tests when database credentials are not set. Treat those runs as unit/regression coverage, not proof that real database workflows still work. External protocol packages and the Org-Babel bridge live in separate repositories and carry their own focused test suites.

### Native live tests

```bash
./test/run-ci.sh native-live
```

The native live runner starts or reuses local containers and covers MySQL, PostgreSQL, ordinary MongoDB native protocol, and Redis native protocol connections against real databases. Set `CLUTCH_TEST_JDBC_AGENT_JAR` to an exact published or locally built agent jar to extend the same run with container-backed Oracle, SQL Server, and ClickHouse plus a local DuckDB database; `CLUTCH_TEST_JDBC_AGENT_DIR` can select the isolated runtime directory where that jar and the required JDBC drivers are prepared. Without an explicit jar, the costly JDBC extension stays disabled. MongoDB SQL Interface JDBC live tests still require a separate SQL Interface endpoint; ordinary MongoDB work uses the default `mongodb` document surface. Contributor release gates are listed in `AGENTS.md` §Pre-Commit Checklist.

## Roadmap

- AST-based SQL rewriting is deferred, not planned as a near-term feature. The current top-level clause scanner, direct LIMIT/OFFSET pagination, and conservative result capability checks cover known WHERE/filter/count/ pagination cases without making derived-table wrapping the default escape hatch. Revisit a full parser only if concrete rewrite bugs or optimization features justify the added complexity.
