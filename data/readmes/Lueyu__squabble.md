# Squabble

**Research that remembers. Decisions you control.**

An open-source investing workspace.
Independent research and reverse checks produce a daily report.
A sourced channel follows meaningful changes and keeps decisions in your hands.

The [AI companion workspace](docs/ai-friend-v4.md) adds independent animal companions, a large multi-account chart, persistent strategy clarification and clear navigation across reports, data and memory.

**US · HK · China A-shares** · **English / Chinese** · **Self-hosted** · **No default external telemetry**

## Why Squabble?

Understand your portfolio, what changed, and what needs your decision.

- **Daily research and a quiet channel.** Independent investigations and a separate reverse check stay in readable reports. The channel publishes short, sourced updates, expandable evidence and one-fact follow-ups. [Channel guide](docs/channel-workbench.md).
- **Strategy-driven paper trading.** Copy recorded holdings and cash, review the strategy, then explicitly apply it to the simulation. Current rules, proposed changes and actual fills remain distinct. Existing advanced tools remain available.
- **Persistent agents and guided teams.** Import holdings, meet your agents, then create an independently running paper team. Reuse agent versions across teams with isolated memories, bounded startup authorization and an accessible pause control. [Guide](docs/independent-agents.md).
- **Configurable investment teams.** Build departments and matrix reporting on a drag-and-connect canvas, start from 10 editable templates, and trace team research through decisions and paper execution. Real and team accounts share an account-specific assets view. [Enable and use the team workspace](docs/team-workspace.md).
- **Prepared tools and your own extensions.** The Web bundle includes document OCR, public financial queries, Chromium and a required local container sandbox. Confirm capability permissions once; add custom MCP or optional cloud services when needed. Durable receipts, source permissions and exact external-write previews remain shared. [Setup and acceptance limits](docs/agent-tooling.md).
- **Your data stays yours.** Self-hosted. No default external telemetry. Desktop and source local workspaces open without a Squabble login; account mode remains available.

## Install

### Desktop app (Windows / macOS)

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Lueyu/squabble/releases/latest).
2. Download the installer for your system (`.exe` for Windows, `.dmg` for macOS).
3. Run the installer. Everything is bundled — PostgreSQL, the server, and the app.

After install, Squabble opens directly into a local workspace in its own window.
Your data stays on your machine. Existing data is preserved; see the [upgrade and workspace selection notes](docs/self-hosting.md#local-workspace-and-existing-data).

### Web app (Docker)

You need [Docker with Compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) in Linux-container mode. Download and extract the `squabble-bundle-linux-amd64` artifact from a successful [Bundled Web images](https://github.com/Lueyu/squabble/actions/workflows/bundle.yml) run. It contains exact public image digests and all deployment files. From the extracted directory:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:3000**. Create your first account.

Open **Settings → Tools**, review local processing and public-network permissions, then enable the prepared capabilities. No host Python, OCR models, browser installation or E2B account is required. Developers building a checkout use `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.source.yml up -d --build`. Existing desktop installers do not yet include this new suite. [Deployment details](deploy/README.bundle.md).

The database starts empty. To try a demo with fictional data, run `docker compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up -d --build` instead.

### From source (developers)

You need Node.js 22+ and npm 10+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lueyu/squabble.git && cd squabble
npm install
npm run dev
```

Before the first launch, configure PostgreSQL and a private `JWT_SECRET` in `.env.local` using `.env.example`.
After `Ready:` appears, open **http://127.0.0.1:8080** for the source-backed UI with hot reload.
The example enables `AUTH_MODE=local`: no Squabble login is needed. Keep `SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1` and `TRUST_PROXY=false`; use `AUTH_MODE=account` for account-based access. See the [development guide](docs/development.md#local-workspace-mode) for existing data and allowed frontend origins.
Each `npm run dev` stops the previous development session, reclaims both configured ports and their process trees, rebuilds the server, and refreshes Vite's cache. Ctrl+C stops the current session.
Override `SERVER_PORT=3000` and `CLIENT_DEV_PORT=8080` in `.env.local` if needed. The frontend never silently switches to another port.

## What it does

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Portfolio tracking** | US/HK/CN holdings, cash, P&L and net-value curves. USD/HKD/CNY conversion built in. |
| **AI research** | Bull-bear debate, critic review, risk gates. 14-section report. Versioned, with losing arguments kept. |
| **Research memory** | Versioned theses with evidence, counterevidence, invalidation conditions and time boundaries. Inspect which complete memory items were sent to each research attempt. Agent acceptance and your confirmation remain separate. |
| **Paper trading** | AI bot with hard risk limits (daily-loss breaker, per-order cap). Manual and MCP agent orders. |
| **Portfolio import** | CSV with auto column mapping (5 broker presets). Select up to 20 screenshots for sequential recognition by a connected image-capable local agent or vision API. Remove unwanted images, then review the combined, editable results before one import confirmation. |
| **Notifications** | Webhook, Bark, ServerChan, SMTP, Telegram. Every fill and risk event, pushed to you. |

## Current Web experience

**Portfolio overview**, **My agents**, **Team simulations** and **Research** form the default daily navigation, with **Data & memory**, **Run analysis** and **Settings** alongside. Start by importing holdings, meeting agents and creating a team. A confirmed startup agreement authorizes bounded automatic research and paper execution; the retained manual report/combination workflow below still requires explicit application. An explicit saved disabled preference or `SQUABBLE_SIMPLE_EXPERIENCE=false` retains earlier pages. The overview compares your recorded real portfolio with several independent simulations on a large equity or return chart. Choose a period and accounts, then open an account to inspect its positions, orders and strategy combination. The chart reads saved observations only: it neither refreshes quotes nor starts research or trading. Missing observations break the curve. Returns stay unknown until there are two trusted observations, and after cash-flow or baseline changes; each account shows its actual observation origin.

Create a named simulation from recorded holdings/cash or virtual cash without stopping existing accounts. Each account has its own strategy combination, budgets and pause control. Several strategies may share one account's cash and positions, with enabled budgets totaling at most 100%. Budgets cap attributed exposure after the cash reserve; they do not automatically rebalance positions. Overlapping instructions that disagree on direction or target must be resolved before application. Saving a combination draft leaves its installed strategy running; preview and explicitly apply the reviewed combination to change it.

Research reports preserve the latest complete result, earlier versions, original sources and public work steps. Daily research freezes complete recorded holdings, cash and limits before independent research and reverse checks. Saved output can be reformatted locally; explicit continuation uses AI only when new checking or summary work is needed. Historical reports remain immutable. A report's exact execution proposal or readable research can be saved to a selected simulation as a disabled draft allocation without another extraction call. Observation-only or incomplete proposals do not become automatic trade instructions. Review the source, conditions, quantity or target total position, validity and budgets before applying.

The simulation uses deterministic, AI or council review as required, with shared final checks for fresh quotes, market sessions, source validity, funds and risk. **Pausing an account stops all its automatic buys and sells, including protective exits; other accounts continue.** While the scheduler is enabled, paused accounts still receive valuation updates. The channel distinguishes accounts and links factual partial/full fills to the correct account and order. Confirmed strategies, combination revisions and trades remain in history. Simulation does not submit broker orders or change recorded real assets; later real trades are not automatically copied. See the [assets, reports and strategy guide](docs/assets-reports-strategy.md).

## Connect native research agents

Open **Settings → Local research agents** to use Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI,
Antigravity, OpenCode, Kimi or the community Doubao CLI already
installed on your computer. Sign in through the provider's terminal, then click
**Connect**. For Docker, open Squabble desktop on the same computer and pair it
from web Settings; confirm the local address in the desktop dialog. Keep the app
open while researching. Each member can select a model and the reasoning options
supported by its agent, or inherit the existing defaults. [Setup and usage details](docs/local-agents.md).

In local workspace mode, native agent connections belong to this installation and
do not require a Squabble account. Provider CLI sign-in remains separate.

Compatible Codex and Claude Code versions automatically receive task-scoped,
read-only research tools; other runtimes receive a dated evidence snapshot with
the limitation shown in Settings. The discussion chat shows public work summaries,
tool outcomes, elapsed time and sources. No MCP JSON or extra connection steps are needed.

Each role's research is collapsed above its reply. Replies separate the conclusion,
supporting evidence, risks and next checks; longer analysis remains expandable.

## Research memory

Open the book icon in a discussion to inspect that stock's research dossier.
Start with active theses and their invalidation conditions, then expand evidence,
known dates, counterevidence and version history. Agent acceptance and your own
confirmation are separate; neither turns an unknown source field into a verified fact.

Later research ranks eligible memory for the current task and sends whole thesis
units within the request budget. The activity details distinguish prepared and
submitted items, versions and omissions; submission does not prove model use.

Reports are archived in the background. The dossier shows pending or failed jobs,
supports retry and imports eligible historical reports without a model call.
Older reports without structured theses remain report history. Turning off
automatic archival still allows an explicit manual import or retry.

Price, SMA20, RSI14 and daily volume-ratio conditions can be monitored within an
enabled daily paper strategy; indicators use completed daily bars. Unconfigured or
unsupported conditions remain visible, and missing data is unknown. A triggered
condition stays in that thesis version's history. After a breach, new risk requires dependencies
established by a reviewed replacement or deliberate user revision; a price rebound
does not erase the original event.

## Daily strategies and automatic paper trading

In **Agent Builder**, enable the research team and **Daily strategy**, choose the
fast reviewer, configure notifications, then save and activate the profile.
The team prepares a plan before each market opens. During continuous trading,
the program checks its conditions and computes indicators; the fast reviewer
can approve, wait or veto. The ledger checks the current plan, thesis dependencies, price, funds,
position limits and risk rules again before a simulated fill. Protective stops
use deterministic rules. Notifications are queued independently of orders.

After upgrading, stored plans without a memory dependency inventory need a fresh
validated plan before adding risk; protective exits remain available. A new plan
with structured theses waits for their archival. If automatic archival is off,
use the dossier's manual import or retry instead of repeating the research.

Existing profiles keep their previous mode until you opt in. The server must
remain running. Public Yahoo quotes may be delayed; indicators use completed
daily candles, not intraday candles. The bundled US/HK/CN calendar covers 2026;
unavailable calendars or invalid data block execution. This is paper trading,
with no broker connection. API research uses your configured budget; native
agents use their own provider billing.

## Connect your AI assistant

Squabble has a built-in MCP server for the retained advanced paper-account workflow. Its connection controls are in the earlier Web experience (`SQUABBLE_SIMPLE_EXPERIENCE=false`):

1. Open **AI Paper Trading → AI Agents → Connect Agent**.
2. Copy the MCP URL and token into your assistant's MCP settings.
3. Ask it to *"check my portfolio"* or *"buy 100 shares of NVDA"*.

Each agent gets a spending limit, a read-only or trade permission, and an approval mode. Orders can auto-fill, or wait for your tap. These tools reject ambiguous account selection when several accounts are active; choosing an account in the current workspace does not change MCP scope. [MCP account boundaries](docs/mcp-paper-accounts.md).

## Privacy

Self-hosted. No default external telemetry. Market-data services and configured AI providers receive the requests needed for their features; public market-data requests can occur without a personal API key. [Full details →](docs/privacy.md)
