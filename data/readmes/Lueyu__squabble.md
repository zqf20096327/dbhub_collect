# Squabble

**Let your AI argue. You decide.**

An open-source investing workspace.
A bull, a bear and a critic challenge your ideas.
Then you make the call.

**US · HK · China A-shares** · **English / Chinese** · **Self-hosted** · **Zero telemetry**

## Why Squabble?

Most portfolio trackers show numbers. Squabble argues about them.

- **AI research reports.** A bull and a bear debate your holdings. A critic removes weak arguments. Your risk rules run as hard gates. The result is a 14-section report with both sides preserved.
- **AI paper trading.** Opt into daily team research, a dated trading plan, scheduled market checks and a fast model review before automatic simulated fills. Configure push notifications and hard risk limits. Manual and MCP agent orders remain available.
- **Your data stays yours.** Self-hosted. Zero telemetry. Desktop and source local workspaces open without a Squabble login; account mode remains available.

## Install

### Desktop app (Windows / macOS)

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Lueyu/squabble/releases/latest).
2. Download the installer for your system (`.exe` for Windows, `.dmg` for macOS).
3. Run the installer. Everything is bundled — PostgreSQL, the server, and the app.

After install, Squabble opens directly into a local workspace in its own window.
Your data stays on your machine. Existing data is preserved; see the [upgrade and workspace selection notes](docs/self-hosting.md#local-workspace-and-existing-data).

### Web app (Docker)

You need [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lueyu/squabble.git
cd squabble
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:3000**. Create your first account.

The database starts empty. To try a demo with fictional data, run `docker compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up -d --build` instead.

### From source (developers)

You need Node.js 22+ and npm 10+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lueyu/squabble.git && cd squabble
npm install
npm run dev
```

Before the first launch, configure PostgreSQL and a private `JWT_SECRET` in `.env.local` using `.env.example`.
After `Ready:` appears, open **http://127.0.0.1:8080** for the source-backed UI with hot reload.
The example enables `AUTH_MODE=local`: no Squabble login is needed. Keep `SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1` and `TRUST_PROXY=false`; use `AUTH_MODE=account` for account-based access. See the [development guide](docs/development.md#local-workspace-mode) for existing data and allowed frontend origins.
Each `npm run dev` stops the previous development session, reclaims both configured ports and their process trees, rebuilds the server, and refreshes Vite's cache. Ctrl+C stops the current session.
Override `SERVER_PORT=3000` and `CLIENT_DEV_PORT=8080` in `.env.local` if needed. The frontend never silently switches to another port.

## What it does

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Portfolio tracking** | US/HK/CN holdings, cash, P&L and net-value curves. USD/HKD/CNY conversion built in. |
| **AI research** | Bull-bear debate, critic review, risk gates. 14-section report. Versioned, with losing arguments kept. |
| **Research memory** | Versioned theses with evidence, counterevidence, invalidation conditions and time boundaries. Inspect which complete memory items were sent to each research attempt. Agent acceptance and your confirmation remain separate. |
| **Paper trading** | AI bot with hard risk limits (daily-loss breaker, per-order cap). Manual and MCP agent orders. |
| **Portfolio import** | CSV with auto column mapping (5 broker presets). Select up to 20 screenshots for sequential recognition by a connected image-capable local agent or vision API. Remove unwanted images, then review the combined, editable results before one import confirmation. |
| **Notifications** | Webhook, Bark, ServerChan, SMTP, Telegram. Every fill and risk event, pushed to you. |

## Simplified experience (opt-in rollout)

Set `SQUABBLE_SIMPLE_EXPERIENCE=true` on the server to use **Today**, **Research room** and **AI investment**. Today shows portfolio facts and current analysis; ask a question directly to bring connected agents into a discussion. Members submit this round's initial research before seeing each other's findings, then challenge specific evidence and retain unresolved disagreements. No report-version or strategy-publication workflow is required.

AI investment starts from an explicitly confirmed holdings/cash snapshot and manages one independent paper account. The team can discover securities within your confirmed markets and limits. Clear rules use the fast path; ambiguous or material decisions receive additional research. New-stock purchases require two distinct execution sources. Chat restrictions take effect only after you confirm the impact card. **Pause automatic trading stops every automatic buy and sell, including protective exits.** Resume reassesses current conditions; it never replays missed orders.

Existing ledgers and historical decision evidence are preserved. Existing automatic accounts require explicit adoption before switching to the new authorization. The default performance comparison is the same starting holdings held unchanged. Missing prices, FX, asset verification or source data remain visible gaps. See the [product specification](docs/squabble-simple-product.zh-CN.md) and [delivery notes](docs/simple-experience-delivery.md) for defaults, rollout and verification.

## Connect native research agents

Open **Settings → Local research agents** to use Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI,
Antigravity, OpenCode, Kimi or the community Doubao CLI already
installed on your computer. Sign in through the provider's terminal, then click
**Connect**. For Docker, open Squabble desktop on the same computer and pair it
from web Settings; confirm the local address in the desktop dialog. Keep the app
open while researching. Each member can select a model and the reasoning options
supported by its agent, or inherit the existing defaults. [Setup and usage details](docs/local-agents.md).

In local workspace mode, native agent connections belong to this installation and
do not require a Squabble account. Provider CLI sign-in remains separate.

Compatible Codex and Claude Code versions automatically receive task-scoped,
read-only research tools; other runtimes receive a dated evidence snapshot with
the limitation shown in Settings. The discussion chat shows public work summaries,
tool outcomes, elapsed time and sources. No MCP JSON or extra connection steps are needed.

Each role's research is collapsed above its reply. Replies separate the conclusion,
supporting evidence, risks and next checks; longer analysis remains expandable.

## Research memory

Open the book icon in a discussion to inspect that stock's research dossier.
Start with active theses and their invalidation conditions, then expand evidence,
known dates, counterevidence and version history. Agent acceptance and your own
confirmation are separate; neither turns an unknown source field into a verified fact.

Later research ranks eligible memory for the current task and sends whole thesis
units within the request budget. The activity details distinguish prepared and
submitted items, versions and omissions; submission does not prove model use.

Reports are archived in the background. The dossier shows pending or failed jobs,
supports retry and imports eligible historical reports without a model call.
Older reports without structured theses remain report history. Turning off
automatic archival still allows an explicit manual import or retry.

Price, SMA20, RSI14 and daily volume-ratio conditions can be monitored within an
enabled daily paper strategy; indicators use completed daily bars. Unconfigured or
unsupported conditions remain visible, and missing data is unknown. A triggered
condition stays in that thesis version's history. After a breach, new risk requires dependencies
established by a reviewed replacement or deliberate user revision; a price rebound
does not erase the original event.

## Daily strategies and automatic paper trading

In **Agent Builder**, enable the research team and **Daily strategy**, choose the
fast reviewer, configure notifications, then save and activate the profile.
The team prepares a plan before each market opens. During continuous trading,
the program checks its conditions and computes indicators; the fast reviewer
can approve, wait or veto. The ledger checks the current plan, thesis dependencies, price, funds,
position limits and risk rules again before a simulated fill. Protective stops
use deterministic rules. Notifications are queued independently of orders.

After upgrading, stored plans without a memory dependency inventory need a fresh
validated plan before adding risk; protective exits remain available. A new plan
with structured theses waits for their archival. If automatic archival is off,
use the dossier's manual import or retry instead of repeating the research.

Existing profiles keep their previous mode until you opt in. The server must
remain running. Public Yahoo quotes may be delayed; indicators use completed
daily candles, not intraday candles. The bundled US/HK/CN calendar covers 2026;
unavailable calendars or invalid data block execution. This is paper trading,
with no broker connection. API research uses your configured budget; native
agents use their own provider billing.

## Connect your AI assistant

Squabble has a built-in MCP server. Give Claude or ChatGPT access to your paper account:

1. Open **AI Paper Trading → AI Agents → Connect Agent**.
2. Copy the MCP URL and token into your assistant's MCP settings.
3. Ask it to *"check my portfolio"* or *"buy 100 shares of NVDA"*.

Each agent gets a spending limit, a read-only or trade permission, and an approval mode. Orders can auto-fill, or wait for your tap.

## Privacy

Self-hosted. Zero telemetry. The only outbound requests are the ones you make with your own API keys. [Full details →](docs/privacy.md)
