✨ Introduction
****************
**omni-json-db** is a high-performance, embedded database engine designed for Python developers. It combines the raw speed of a Key-Value store with the flexible querying of a document database and the associative power of a graph database.

Built for high throughput and thread safety, **omni-json-db** utilizes modern serialization (e.g., *JSON*, *MsgPack*, *marshal*, *Pickle*, *YAML*) and efficient compression to provide a compact storage layer. Whether you are building a local cache, a log aggregator, or a complex knowledge graph, **omni-json-db** offers "Zero-Config" simplicity at scale.

* **Schema-LESS**: Store complex, nested data without pre-defining tables.
* **Server-LESS**: Access data directly on disk without a database server overhead.
* **SQL-LESS**: Manipulate data using standard Python syntax, Regex, and Lambdas.
* **Dependency-LESS**: Runs on a clean Python install with **zero required third-party packages** — optional C-accelerators and extra formats are one ``pip install "omni-json-db[full]"`` away.


🤔 Why omni-json-db?
********************

Unlike traditional SQL or NoSQL databases, **omni-json-db** allows you to query and manipulate data using native Python syntax—including slicing, lambdas, regex, and set operations. It also features built-in "Time-Travel" (undo/redo), a property-graph engine, and pluggable serialization.

   **omni-json-db** has been tested with Python 3.7+ and PyPy3. (~100% test coverage)

🚀 Features
***********
* **Native Graph Engine**: Transform your Key-Value store into a Property Graph. The ``GraphDb`` layer supports O(1) adjacency indexing and classic algorithms (BFS, Dijkstra, DFS, cycle detection) without sacrificing performance. [refer to `Graph Database`_]

* **Pythonic Interaction**: Interact with data using familiar Python ``dict`` methods, list slicing, and set operations, avoiding complex SQL queries. [refer to `Basic`_ + `Operator`_]

* **Dataclass Objects**: Read and write any ``@dataclass`` directly — ``jdb += user``, ``jdb['u1'] = user``, ``del jdb[user]``. The object is flattened into a plain ``dict`` rather than pickled, so records written from objects stay fully queryable, exportable, and language-neutral. [refer to `Dataclass Objects`_]

* **Advanced Serialization & Compression**: Combine formats (JSON, MsgPack, Pickle, YAML) with algorithms like LZ4, Zstandard, or Brotli to optimize your I/O and disk usage. [refer to `Change Type`_ + `Supported Data Formats`_ + `Supported Zip Formats`_]

* **Pluggable Codec & Encryption**: Bring your own serialization or encryption logic via a simple ``dumps``/``loads`` interface — no forking required. Supports both a process-wide default and per-instance codecs (e.g. per-tenant encryption keys). [refer to `Pluggable User-Defined Codec (U)`_]

* **Powerful Query Engine**: Execute searches via Regex, Lambda filters, and rich operators (``EQ``, ``GT``, ``LT``, ``IN``, ``HAS``, ``RE``, ...). [refer to `Query Engine`_ + `More Query Examples`_ + `Pythonic Query Examples`_]

* **Operational Modes**: Supports In-Memory mode (``JMemFiles``) for high performance and Network mode (``JNetFiles``) to serve data over a network. [refer to `In-memory Mode`_ + `Network Mode`_ ]

* **State Management**: Built-in "Time-Travel" allows you to track states, undo modifications (``unmodify()``), or recover deleted data (``unremove()``). ``history()`` lists every version still reachable, and ``min_safe`` decides how many of them survive. [refer to `Unremove & Unmodify`_ + `Record History`_ + `Backup & Restore`_]

* **All-or-Nothing Writes**: ``with jdb.transaction():`` opens a write session that puts back everything it changed if the block raises — modifications, deletions, bulk inserts and renames alike. Nesting acts as a savepoint. [refer to `Transactions`_]

* **Batch Writes**: Bulk inserts take a dedicated append path — one ``write()`` per VAL file and one encoded block for the KEY rows instead of a syscall per record — so ``jdb += rows``, ``insert()`` and every importer land 1.4x–4.5x faster with no API change. [refer to `Bulk Insert`_]

* **Fast Open at Scale**: A disposable key-table snapshot (``index_cache``) cuts a cold open by ~4x, and ``warm_up`` moves what is left onto a background thread. [refer to `Faster Open`_]

* **Data Migration**: Effortlessly migrate from SQLite or import/export via CSV, Parquet, INI, and TOML with simple commands. Parquet imports stream in constant memory via ``pyar
