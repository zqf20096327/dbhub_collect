# TF3 Dashboard — Second Screen Dashboard for Transport Fever 3

Turn a second monitor into a live control room for your Transport Fever 3 company: finances, every line and
vehicle, stations, towns, industries, depots and alerts, with the game's own icons and history charts.
Optionally, manage the game from the dashboard (speed, camera, vehicles, stop configuration, terminals) while
the game stays full screen.

Everything runs locally on your PC. Nothing leaves your computer. No account, no installation, no admin rights.

**Get it:** mod [on mod.io](https://mod.io/g/transportfever3/m/second-screen-dashboard) · companion program on the [Releases](https://github.com/M1r077/tf3-dashboard/releases/latest) page.

## How it works

Two halves:

| Part | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Mod `Second Screen Dashboard`** | [mod.io](https://mod.io/g/transportfever3/m/second-screen-dashboard) (in-game Mod Hub) or `mod/` in this repo | A Lua game script that writes a snapshot of the game state to `<userdata>/dashboard_export/live.lua` every few seconds, and (if you enable it) executes commands written to `cmd.lua`. Uses only the official TF3 scripting API. Never modifies the savegame. |
| **Companion program (this repo)** | Your PC, Windows | `collector.py` watches `tf3dash_live.lua` / `tf3dash_slow_*.lua` and stores the history in a local SQLite database; `server.py` serves the dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/` in your browser. Python 3.12 standard library only — the release zip ships a bundled Python, nothing to install. |

The mod alone does nothing visible; the companion alone has nothing to show. mod.io cannot distribute programs,
which is why the companion lives here.

## Install (3 steps)

1. **Mod** — in the game, open the Mod Hub, search *Second Screen Dashboard* ([mod.io page](https://mod.io/g/transportfever3/m/second-screen-dashboard)), subscribe, then enable it in your
   savegame's mod list (like any script mod — **subscribing is not enough, the mod must be ticked in the savegame**).
   Or copy `mod/tf3_dashboard_export` to `<userdata>\mods\` (see [docs/DETAILS.md](docs/DETAILS.md)).
2. **Companion** — download `TF3-Dashboard-<version>.zip` from the
   [Releases](https://github.com/M1r077/tf3-dashboard/releases) page, unzip anywhere **except a cloud-synced folder**
   (OneDrive Desktop/Documents, Dropbox...): the history is a SQLite database and sync clients lock or duplicate it.
   `C:\TF3-Dashboard` or `D:\Games\TF3 Dashboard` are fine. Mod and companion are released together: mod revision 14
   goes with companion 0.6.x (older pairs keep working, the newest features simply stay blank).
3. **Run** — start the game with the mod enabled, then double-click `run_dashboard.cmd`. A window with two panes
   opens (collector | server) and your browser shows the dashboard. Put the browser on your second monitor,
   press `F11`. Close the window to stop everything.

Steam, Epic and GOG are supported; the game's userdata folder is detected automatically
(`<Steam>\userdata\<id>\3493540\local` or `%APPDATA%\Transport Fever 3`).

### Nothing shows up?

While the database is empty the dashboard displays a **checklist** that tells which link of the chain is missing:
game folder found → `tf3dash_live.lua` written by the mod → snapshots stored by the collector. The usual causes:

- the mod is subscribed but **not enabled in the savegame** (Mods menu of the savegame): no `tf3dash_live.lua`;
- the game is in the main menu: the mod only exports while a map is loaded;
- **mod revision 8 or older with game build 40420 or newer** (the stability update of 8 October 2026): since that
  build the game only lets mods write to a few userdata folders, and the old mod wrote to its own
  `dashboard_export` folder; its log (`crash_dump\stdout.txt`) repeats `saveUserdata failed: The directory you
  trying to access is not available or invalid`. Update the mod to revision 9 (Mod Hub) and the companion to
  0.3.2: the export now lives in `towns_industries\tf3dash_*.lua`, a folder the game allows. The checklist
  recognises this case;
- the game writes to another userdata folder than the one the companion watches (another Steam account, moved
  profile): the checklist reads the game's own log (`crash_dump\stdout.txt`) and shows the folder it uses (0.2.3+);
- the companion runs from OneDrive/Dropbox: see Install, move it;
- the game is installed in an unusual place: create `config.json` (see Configuration).

The "TF3 Dashboard Collector" pane says the same thing in text, colour-coded: green = fine, yellow = waiting or
warning, red = something to fix. Once snapshots flow it prints one summary line per minute (errors are always
shown). When reporting a problem, copy the checklist or that pane, and the lines
containing `dashboard_export` from `stdout.txt` (that is the mod's log tag, the folder is `towns_industries`).

Running from source instead of the release zip: you need Python 3.10+ on the PATH (`winget install Python.Python.3.12`).
No pip, no venv, no packages.

### Remote control (optional)

In the game: Mods ▸ Second Screen Dashboard ▸ **Permit game control = On** (off by default). The dashboard
then shows the game controls (pause / speed, camera and saved camera views, vehicle actions, stop and terminal
editor on each line).
Every command does exactly what the matching click in the game does; nothing is ever bought, sold or demolished,
and no route is changed. The channel is a local file (`tf3dash_cmd.lua`) read by the mod four times a second.

## What you see

- **Operations** — fleet in service, load factor and average speed over time, per-carrier summary, stuck or idle
  vehicles, wear (service first), most unhappy and busiest lines, alerts with jump-to-entity.
- **Vehicles** — every vehicle with model icon, line, state, load, speed, condition, history on click. What the
  vehicle carries (mod revision 8): the cargo icons on board with counts, and what it was bought for. Filter by
  type or cargo. H or the "Horn" button sounds the horn.
- **Lines** — load, headway, waiting passengers/cargo, transported per year, the game's rating, history, and the
  **stop editor**: load mode, min/max waiting time, cargo filter (game icons), preferred and alternative terminals,
  whole-line actions (including the horn of every vehicle).
- **Map** — lines, vehicles, stations, industries, towns, headquarters (mod revision 8), alerts; click = camera on
  the object (a vehicle: follow it). With mod revision 11 the map draws the savegame's **geography**: shaded relief,
  sea, lakes and rivers, every road and track (bridges, tunnels), five map styles (gear button; mod revision 14 brings
  the **full-resolution terrain**, 4 m, with a satellite look: rock where it is steep, meadows below), and lines are drawn
  **along the network** (the real path of each vehicle, a predicted route until one has driven it). A **ruler** button measures as the crow flies, with the height difference and the distance the game actually pays (straight line + 8 x the climb, never the length of track), plus the distance by road and by rail over the existing network (dashed where nothing is built). **Cargo layers** (production / demand / stocks) draw the cargo icons next to each industry and town, dimmed by how far they are from their maximum; hovering shows the figures, and a vehicle shows what it carries. **Camera views**
  (mod revision 7): save the game camera under a name and recall it with one click or Shift+1..9; a view can be
  attached to a vehicle (revision 11: recalled = follow it again with the same framing). Views are kept
  per savegame in `db\camera_views.json`. **Travelling** (mod revision 10): smooth camera movements around a view
  (orbit, dolly, flyover, sweep, spiral), the chain of all views, and on each line's sheet a **line tour** - one
  flight over the line, its stops and where its vehicles are at that moment. The **Travellings** card keeps your
  favourite ones per savegame (subject + settings, up to 20), editable and replayable with one click. Drop music
  files in `music\` and they play with the travellings (in the browser; never part of the release); the game's own
  soundtrack is offered too, read straight from the game's `music.zip`.
- **Towns**, **Industries** and **Stations & depots** — tables with a detail card on click: capacities and
  satisfaction, production / shipped per cargo, waiting items and overflow, all over time (14 days of history).
- Every history chart runs on the **game's simulation clock** (a pause is a point, not a plateau; ranges in game
  months and years), and like the game the companion keeps **one timeline per save**: reloading an older savegame
  removes what had been recorded beyond it.
- **Finances** — balance, yearly result, transported, network size and company value over time, and the **game's own
  finance journal** (mod revision 13): the same table as the game's Finances window, by financial year, with every
  line (running costs and maintenance by carrier, upkeep of roads, tracks, buildings, income, construction and
  vehicle purchases), kept for the whole savegame. Cards can be dragged and resized; the layout is saved per browser.
- **Settings ▸ Savegames and backups** — one backup = database + camera views for the current savegame; restore
  the views, or the whole database at the next start.
- Languages: English, French, German, Brazilian Portuguese, partial Chinese — follows the game language automatically.

## Configuration

Nothing to configure in the normal case: the game's userdata folder (Steam: registry + `userdata`; Epic/GOG:
`%APPDATA%\Transport Fever 3`) and the game installation (Steam libraries, Epic manifests, GOG registry — used
only to extract the icons) are detected automatically. For unusual setups, copy `config.example.json` to
`config.json` and keep the keys you need:

```json
{ "export_dir": "C:\\Users\\<you>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Transport Fever 3\\towns_industries", "game_dir": "C:\\...\\Transport Fever 3", "port": 8765 }
```

Steam: `"export_dir": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\userdata\\<id>\\3493540\\local\\towns_industries"`
(mod revision 9+; with revision 8 or older on a game build before 40420 it was `...\\dashboard_export`, which the
companion still understands).
`python collector\tf3paths.py` prints what is detected.

Mod settings (in-game): fast interval (time, finances, alerts, vehicles — default 2 s), slow interval (lines,
stations, towns, industries — default 30 s), export vehicles on/off, accept commands on/off, debug log.

In the game, a small **(i)** button in the mod button area (top left, next to the layers button) shows the state of
the export: green = running, red = the game could not write the files (with what to do), grey = starting; the window
also shows the export folder, when the companion was last seen, and the current settings (mod revision 10+).

## Performance and privacy

- Each snapshot is computed by the game's script thread and costs it some milliseconds (about 10-20 ms on a fast PC
  with a medium network, more on a slow PC or a big network). **If the game stutters at a regular rhythm after
  enabling the mod**, open the mod settings in the savegame and raise the fast interval (5 or 10 s), the slow interval
  (60 or 120 s); on very large networks disable the vehicle export. The defaults (2 s / 30 s) target a reasonably
  recent PC.
- The database keeps per-snapshot detail for 2 hours and per-minute aggregates for 14 days (configurable, see
  `collector.py --help`). Only the most recent savegame is kept.
- The server listens on `127.0.0.1` only. Commands are refused from any other address.
- The game icons are extracted from **your** game installation at first start (`dashboard/extract_icons.py`); they
  are not redistributed.

## Documentation

- [docs/DETAILS.md](docs/DETAILS.md) — full technical reference: the three parts, export files and schema, retention, savegames and backups, commands, publishing on mod.io, text encoding, SQL examples, alert codes.
- [docs/API_CATALOGUE.md](docs/API_CATALOGUE.md) — what the Transport Fever 3 modding API allows, section by section: done, doable, risky, impossible. Start here before asking for a feature.
- [docs/INTEGRATIONS.md](docs/INTEGRATIONS.md) — the rule for other mods (read their published data freely, ask before copying or writing), licences seen, candidates.
- [docs/TF3_SETTINGS_LUA.md](docs/TF3_SETTINGS_LUA.md) — unofficial reference of every key of the game's `settings.lua` (values, menu labels, hidden keys). Not about the dashboard; game knowledge gathered along the way.

## Translating

English, French, German and Brazilian Portuguese are complete; Chinese (`zh` / `zh_CN`) covers the frequent words
only and falls back to English for the rest — completing it is the most wanted contribution. Any other language is
welcome too. Two files, no build step:

- `dashboard/static/i18n.js` — the dashboard (about 420 short strings). Copy the `en: { ... }` block, rename it with
  the two-letter code (`es`, `ja`, ...), translate the right-hand sides; `{name}`-style placeholders stay as they are.
  Add an `<option value="es">Español</option>` in the `#lang` select of `dashboard/static/index.html`. For Chinese,
  the `zh` block at the end of the file already exists: add the missing keys to it (any key not listed falls back
  to English).
- `mod/tf3_dashboard_export/strings.json` — the mod settings and the in-game status window (27 strings). Same idea;
  the block name is the game's locale code (`zh_CN`, `es`, ...).

`node test\i18ncheck.js` lists any key missing or left empty. Open a pull request, or if git is not your thing, post
the two files on the mod.io page or in a GitHub issue and we will add them with your name in the credits. Partial
translations are fine: a missing key falls back to English.

## Building a release

`build_release.cmd` downloads the official Python embeddable package, assembles `release/TF3-Dashboard-<version>.zip`
(companion + Python, ~15 MB) and `release/tf3_dashboard_export-rev<N>.zip` (the mod for manual installation).

Two independent version numbers:

- **companion**: `VERSION` in `dashboard/server.py` (shown next to the title in the dashboard). Semver-ish: patch
  (`0.1.x`) for fixes and small adjustments, minor (`0.x.0`) for new features, a new database schema or a dependency
  on a newer mod revision. Every version is a git tag `v<version>` and a GitHub release with its zip, never rebuilt
  afterwards.
- **mod**: `revision` in `mod/tf3_dashboard_export/mod.json`, bumped at each mod.io update only. The
  `tf3_dashboard_export-rev<N>.zip` is attached to a release only when the revision changed.
