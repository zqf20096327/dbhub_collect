## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mahi12333/Learning-Management-System.git
cd Learning-Management-System
```

### 2. Environment variables

Create a `.env` or set system environment variables used by `application.yml`:

```properties
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/lms
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=root
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=your-password
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://api_key:api_secret@cloud_name   # optional
```

### 3. application.yml (example)

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: ${SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL}
    username: ${SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME}
    password: ${SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD}
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
    show-sql: true
    properties:
      hibernate:
        dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
```

> **Note:** `ddl-auto: update` is convenient for development only. Use migrations (Flyway / Liquibase) for production.

### 4. Run (development)

```bash
mvn clean package
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Application will start on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

## 🧪 Testing

* Integration tests: Spring Boot Test, Testcontainers (optional for DB)
* Postman collection: `/docs/postman_collection.json` (optional)

---

## ✅ Best Practices & Suggestions

* Use DTOs for all controller input/output.
* Centralize exception handling with `@ControllerAdvice`.
* Validate requests with `@Valid` and custom validators.
* Use role-based method security (`@PreAuthorize`) for fine-grained access.
* Externalize credentials (use Vault / secrets manager for prod).
* Add API rate limiting on sensitive endpoints.
* Use Flyway / Liquibase for schema migrations.
* Add logging + request tracing (Spring Sleuth / OpenTelemetry).
