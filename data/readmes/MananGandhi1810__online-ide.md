## Tech Stack

- Express.js (Backend + Execution Worker)
- Python (for code execution on the container)
- React.js (Frontend)
- Redis (for internal messaging, storing OTPs, saving code execution results)
- PostgreSQL (with Prisma ORM)
- Docker (with docker-compose)
- Dockerode (for managing docker containers)
- Resend (for sending emails)
- Shadcn/UI (for frontend components)
- Shiki.js with Monaco Editor (for code editing with syntax highlighting)
- Meta LLaMA 4 17b (CloudFlare Workers AI)
- GitHub Actions (for CI/CD)
- PostHog (for analytics)

## How it works

![Diagram](assets/flow-diagram.png)

1. The user writes code in the frontend and clicks execute or submit.
2. The frontend sends the request to the backend server.
3. The backend stores user and code data in PostgreSQL.
4. The backend publishes the execution job to Redis PubSub.
5. The code execution worker consumes the queued job.
6. The worker starts a Docker container and runs the submitted code with the provided test cases.
7. The worker records the execution result, execution time, and success or failure status back in PostgreSQL.

This setup keeps the web request fast, isolates code execution inside containers, and lets the backend and worker communicate asynchronously through Redis.

## Setup

You can either use the docker-compose file to run the project or run the backend and frontend separately.

### Using Docker Compose

- Clone the repository
- Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required values in both `frontend/` and `backend/` directories.
- Run `docker compose up` in the root directory
- The project will be running on `localhost:8000`

### Running Backend and Frontend Separately

> [!NOTE]
> You will still need to have Docker installed on your system.

- Clone the repository
- Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required values in both `frontend/` and `backend/` directories.
- Run Redis and PostgreSQL using Docker
    - Run `docker compose up redis postgresql -d` in the root directory
- Run the backend server
    - Navigate to the `backend` directory
    - Run `npm install`
    - Run `npm run dev`
- The backend server will be running on `localhost:3000`
- Run the frontend server
    - Navigate to the `frontend` directory
    - Run `npm install`
    - Run `npm start`
- The project will be running on `localhost:5173`
