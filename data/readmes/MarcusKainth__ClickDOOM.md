# ClickDOOM

**Knee-Deep in the Rows**: DOOM inside ClickHouse, two ways. The actual 1993
engine running on a RISC-V CPU implemented in SQL, and the engine's own
simulation and renderer rewritten as SQL, checked against the first, tic by
tic and pixel by pixel.

ClickDOOM has two modes.

**Emulation mode** executes the real id Software engine: DOOM's C source, via
the doomgeneric port, is compiled unmodified to bare-metal RV32IM, and that
binary runs instruction by instruction on a CPU emulator built entirely in
ClickHouse SQL: fetch, decode, execute, registers, RAM, MMIO, all of it. The
lineage is [Click-V](https://github.com/SpencerTorres/Click-V), which proved a
RISC-V CPU can live inside ClickHouse; ClickDOOM builds a faster
batch-execution engine and points it at DOOM. It is exact and it is slow: about
5,000 instructions per second, which puts the `demo3` timedemo at two weeks.

**Native mode** is the genre this project once distanced itself from, done to
a different standard. Excellent Doom-likes in SQL exist (DOOMHouse, DOOMQL,
DuckDB-DOOM). Native mode is not a Doom-like: it is DOOM's own tic simulation
and its own renderer, function for function, written as ClickHouse SQL and run
as two statements that stay open for a whole session, one row per tic. It plays
`demo3` at the engine's 35 Hz in a window, and it is held to the real engine:
the reference emulator reads the engine's game state out of RAM at every frame
and hashes every frame it draws, and native mode has to produce the same state
row and the same 64,000 bytes. [NATIVE.md](NATIVE.md) is its contract.

What counts as "in SQL" for each mode is defined in [PURITY.md](PURITY.md),
committed before the first line of code.

Frame 220 of `-timedemo demo3`, after 221,639,724 instructions. Every pixel
computed inside ClickHouse, read back out by a SQL query, and hashed to
`aa27f0470c7c5f3a` — the same value the reference emulator produces from its
own independent run.

## Build log

**[The engine without the CPU](docs/blog/2026-09-02-the-engine-without-the-cpu.md)**
· 2 September 2026, evening — why the emulator's ceiling sent the project to
DOOM's own architecture in SQL, every frame of `demo3` drawn by ClickHouse at
35 frames per second with 2,168 of 2,172 byte-identical to the engine's, and
where the simulation stands.

**[Turning an optimisation off made it faster](docs/blog/2026-09-02-turning-an-optimisation-off.md)**
· 2 September 2026 — switching off ClickHouse's short-circuit evaluation is
worth 17%, our own benchmark had been understating us by 18%, and six figures
is now ruled out with a number rather than a feeling.

**[The sprint that mostly said no](docs/blog/2026-08-26-the-sprint-that-mostly-said-no.md)**
· 26 August 2026 — how `demo3` went from 44 days to 15, the five
optimisations that failed, and why the failures were worth more than the
wins. Written by the team lead, who is also an AI agent.

## How it works

Emulation mode is five workstreams connected by two contracts, both written
down in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md). Native mode adds one crate and one document and is
described after them.

**rom** builds DOOM into the thing the CPU actually runs: doomgeneric
compiled to a bare-metal RV32IM binary, with the shareware `doom1.wad`
embedded in the image, crt0 and libc shims standing in for an OS that
isn't there.

**refemu** is a Rust RV32IM interpreter that runs the same ROM and
serves as the oracle — the known-good trace that the SQL implementation is
checked against, instruction by instruction (SPEC §7).

**sqlcpu** and **executor** are the CPU itself: instruction decode and
execute as ClickHouse SQL, driven by an `arrayFold` batch loop with
write-log memory and MMIO plumbing, so a batch of instructions commits to
RAM in one statement rather than one round trip each.

**driver** is deliberately dumb — a Rust loop that ticks the batch
statement, feeds key events in, and blits whatever frame SQL produced.
[PURITY.md](PURITY.md) is the enforceable boundary here: no game logic,
no CPU logic, no rendering logic reaches the driver. Frame readout — 8bpp
framebuffer plus palette turned into displayable rows — is itself a SQL
query (`driver/`, computed SQL-side, run by the driver only as a `SELECT`).

**native** holds native mode: the WAD's lumps loaded as raw bytes, the
engine's constant tables generated from the vendored source, and SQL that
decodes the level, composes the textures, runs the tic and draws the frame.
`refemu` gains a probe that writes the real engine's game state as rows of the
same shape, so `clickdoom native diff` reports the first tic and field on which
the two disagree, and every frame is compared by hash.

Two contracts hold this together: the ROM boundary (rom ↔ refemu ↔ sqlcpu
all execute the identical binary) and the trace format differential
testing is checked against (SPEC §7). Everything else is workstream-local.

## Quick start

Build once, start the database, then pick a mode. `clickdoom help` lists the
commands and `clickdoom <mode> <command> --help` every flag; the lines below
are the shortest path to a frame in each mode.

```sh
make up                                # the pinned ClickHouse, via docker compose
cargo build --locked --release         # target/release/clickdoom and target/release/refemu
export PATH="$PWD/target/release:$PATH"
export CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=clickdoom   # the compose file's password; every command reads it
```

Every command connects to `localhost:8123` and the `clickdoom` database unless
`--host`, `--port` or `--database` say otherwise.

### Native mode

DOOM's own simulation and renderer as SQL, at the engine's 35 Hz. Playing
needs the level and nothing else:

```sh
clickdoom native load                  # decode doom1.wad's E1M7 into the database
clickdoom native play                  # a window driven by the keyboard and mouse
```

Click in the window to take the mouse: the pointer is held and hidden, and
turning follows the mouse however far it moves. Escape frees the mouse, and
Escape again ends the run.

Playing `demo3` draws each frame from the game state the real engine had at
that frame, which the reference emulator records from the ROM. That needs the
ROM, so it needs Docker for the pinned toolchain:

```sh
make build-rom                         # the DOOM ROM, in the pinned rv32 toolchain image
make gen-probe-trace                   # refemu runs demo3 and dumps the state at every frame
clickdoom native load --probe refemu/reference_traces/demo3/probe.$(cut -c1-12 rom/PINNED_HASH).tsv
clickdoom native demo demo3            # demo3 at 35 Hz in a window; --no-window --frame-dir DIR writes a PPM per frame
clickdoom native diff 200 --probe refemu/reference_traces/demo3/probe.$(cut -c1-12 rom/PINNED_HASH).tsv
```

`native demo --expect-probe-fbhash` exits 3 on the first frame that is not
byte-identical to the engine's own. `native diff` runs the simulation for the
tics you name and exits 3 on the first tic and field where it and the engine
disagree.

### Emulation mode

The RV32IM CPU as SQL, executing the DOOM ROM. It needs the ROM, and boots it
to the first frame in about 15 million instructions:

```sh
make build-rom
clickdoom emulation run --bin rom/build/doom-rv32im.bin --manifest rom/build/manifest.json \
    --k 60000 --hwm 20000 --target-icount 15393136 --stop-at-frame 0 \
    --trace refemu/reference_traces/demo-boot-to-first-frame.$(cut -c1-12 rom/PINNED_HASH).tsv
clickdoom emulation render ansi        # the latest committed frame, in the terminal
clickdoom emulation diff 100000        # sqlcpu and refemu side by side for 100,000 instructions
```

`emulation run` is resumable: stop it and run the same line again and it
carries on from the last committed batch. The trace it takes is the reference
emulator's checkpoint file, and a checkpoint that differs stops the run.

`make lint` runs the purity check plus the linters, and is what CI runs on
every pull request. `make help` lists every target, including the ones that
wrap the lines above.

## Contributing

The most useful contribution is one that falsifies the claim above: a case
where the SQL CPU and the reference emulator disagree on the same ROM, or a
place where computation has left SQL.
