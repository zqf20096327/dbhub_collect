# TAF-Perl (Test Automation Framework - Perl)

TAF-Perl is a deterministic, extensible test automation framework written in Perl that provides clean, repeatable lifecycle control for database benchmarking.

TAF-Perl is maintained under the MariaDB Foundation as part of its mission to support open, vendor-neutral, community-driven tooling for the database ecosystem. The framework supports MariaDB, MySQL, and any other database maker for which a TAF database plugin, SQL dialect, and compatible test client exist.

TAF-Perl provides a stable foundation for building client-to-backend test suites, benchmarking workloads, and system validation tools. The framework emphasizes clarity, reproducibility, and contributor-proof behavior.

For remote testing, only the SQL dialect, test client, and a reachable database installation are required.

## Why Perl

TAF-Perl is implemented in Perl for practical, architectural, and operational reasons.

Perl is present on every Linux distribution used for database development, testing, and production. There is no runtime to install, no virtual environment to manage, and no dependency chain to maintain. The language is available immediately on bare systems, containers, CI hosts, and remote test machines.

Perl aligns directly with the needs of a deterministic test framework:

- stable behavior across platforms
- predictable execution
- mature standard library for process control, file handling, and automation
- no external modules or package managers required

Perl enables contributor-proof design by making state transitions, file operations, and test lifecycles explicit and easy to inspect. It avoids the overhead of compiled toolchains, language servers, or dependency managers. The result is a framework that is simple to deploy, simple to reason about, and simple to maintain.

## Features

TAF-Perl provides a deterministic, contributor-proof automation framework with the following capabilities:

- Modular Perl test suite architecture
- Deterministic lifecycle routines
- Properties-driven configuration with override discipline
- Unified tools library for file operations, logging, archiving, SCP, validation, and system information
- Starter template suite for rapid onboarding
- Supports client build logic and backend setup routines
- Designed for single-host execution with client and backend co-resident
- Contributor-proof design with explicit, predictable behavior
- By default, TAF keeps all components, including database software installs, inside the TAF directory structure. This keeps test systems clean and allows multiple database installs to coexist without affecting the host.
- Modular profiler plugin system supporting perf, flamegraph generation, and additional profiling tools via drop-in modules
- Integrated TAF Results Backend for storing run metadata, workload parameters, automated comparison diffs, baselines, and regression detection
