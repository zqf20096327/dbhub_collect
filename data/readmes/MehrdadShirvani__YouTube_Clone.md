This project was developed as the final project for an advanced programming course👨‍💻🥇. A full-featured **YouTube Clone** built entirely in **Java**, with a **JavaFX client**, **Socket-based communication**, **RESTful media streaming**, and **MySQL database** using **Hibernate ORM**. This application replicates the core experience of YouTube — including video playback, user interaction, and content management — with a strong emphasis on **security**, **performance**, and **modular design**.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

This application is built using a **client-server architecture** with clear separation of concerns across UI, networking, and business logic.

### 🔗 Communication

- **Java Sockets** are used for real-time communication between client and server
- Designed using a custom, structured **Socket API**
- All communication is **encrypted** to ensure privacy and integrity

### 📡 Media Transfer
- Videos are streamed via a **Java RESTful API**
- Supports **byte-range (partial content)** to enable seamless playback and seeking
- Videos can also be **downloaded** by users as needed
