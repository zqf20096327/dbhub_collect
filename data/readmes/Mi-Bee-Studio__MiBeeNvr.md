> **Turn any low-power ARM device into a professional NVR in 60 seconds.**  
> Single binary, zero dependencies, no cloud required. Runs on low-power ARM devices with a 512MB memory budget.

## Quick Start

### One-click Install (Recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mi-Bee-Studio/MiBeeNvr/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

Downloads the binary, creates a system user (`nvr`), generates a config, installs a systemd service, and starts it. Data directory: `/var/lib/mibee-nvr`.

### Option 1: Pre-built Binary

Download the latest binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Mi-Bee-Studio/MiBeeNvr/releases):

```bash
# AMD64 (most PCs/servers)
wget https://github.com/Mi-Bee-Studio/MiBeeNvr/releases/latest/download/mibee-nvr-amd64
chmod +x mibee-nvr-amd64

# ARM64 (Raspberry Pi 4/5, etc.)
wget https://github.com/Mi-Bee-Studio/MiBeeNvr/releases/latest/download/mibee-nvr-arm64
chmod +x mibee-nvr-arm64

# ARMv7 (Raspberry Pi 2/3, etc.)
wget https://github.com/Mi-Bee-Studio/MiBeeNvr/releases/latest/download/mibee-nvr-armv7
chmod +x mibee-nvr-armv7
```

Initialize config and start:

```bash
./mibee-nvr-amd64 init --password yourpassword
./mibee-nvr-amd64 -config mibee-nvr.yaml
```

Open `http://localhost:9090` to access the Web UI.

### Option 2: Docker

```bash
docker compose --project-directory . -f deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:9090` to access the Web UI.

To store recordings on an external drive, edit the volume mount in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - /mnt/external/nvr:/data    # ← change to your host path
    environment:
      - NVR_DATA_DIR=/data          # must match the volume mount
```

### Option 3: Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mi-Bee-Studio/MiBeeNvr.git
cd MiBeeNvr
make build
./mibee-nvr init --password yourpassword
./mibee-nvr -config mibee-nvr.yaml
```

For detailed setup, see [Getting Started](docs/en/getting-started.md).

## Why MiBee NVR?

- **Single Binary**: Zero dependencies, embedded Svelte 5 SPA, `CGO_ENABLED=0`
- **Low-Power ARM Ready**: Runs on 1GB RAM with a 512MB memory budget (validated on Raspberry Pi 3B as the minimum baseline)
- **Multi-Protocol Streaming**: HLS, WebRTC, HTTP-FLV, RTMP, SRT, WebSocket
- **No Cloud Required**: Self-hosted, no subscriptions, no vendor lock-in
- **Modern Web UI**: Dark/light themes, i18n support, responsive design
- **ONVIF Support**: Auto-discovery, PTZ control, stream URI management
- **Plug-and-Play Auto-Discover**: ONVIF cameras joining the LAN are enrolled automatically in the background (Hikvision-NVR-style) — no manual scan. Unauthenticated devices start recording immediately; authenticated ones are added as pending activation until you supply credentials
- **IP Self-Healing**: ONVIF cameras that change IP (Wi-Fi roaming across APs) are auto-relocated by serial number and reconnected — unicast probing works across routed subnets
- **Smart Integrations**: MQTT triggers, WebDAV, FTP, FFmpeg transcoding

## Features

### 📷 Camera Support
- RTSP (H.264/H.265/MJPEG) streaming
- HTTP JPEG snapshot streaming
- ONVIF discovery & management with PTZ control
- Xiaomi CS2 + legacy TUTK (7 models) cloud camera support
- SRT/RTMP push-in cameras (cross-network ingest — receive streams from remote publishers)
- GB/T 28181 national-standard platform (experimental): SIP cameras (Hikvision/Dahua/Uniview) register to the NVR — catalog, PTZ, voice intercom, device-side recording search & playback, alarm subscription, cascade. Default off
- Native Go push-out relay (forward any camera to remote RTMP/RTSP targets; FFmpeg optional for compatibility)

### 📺 Streaming & Live View
- HLS on-demand streaming with LL-HLS support
- WebRTC WHEP for sub-second latency viewing
- HTTP-FLV for browser-friendly streaming
- RTMP ingest server for push/pull workflows
- SRT low-latency transport receiver
- WebSocket real-time binary frame streaming

### 💾 Recording & Storage
- Automatic MP4 segment generation
- Multi-camera concurrent recording
- Per-camera retention policies
- Audio capture (AAC + G.711 + Opus)
- Segment merging with configurable policies
- Periodic timelapse recording
- Continuous playback: double-buffered seamless segment chaining + full-day VOD timeline (scrub across recordings and gaps), AVI frame-browse mode
- LAN discovery (mDNS `_mibee-nvr._tcp` + UDP 49090 responder) with a stable `device_id` in `/api/health`

### 🔧 Management
- Modern Svelte 5 web UI with dark/light themes
- REST API for automation
- BasicAuth with bcrypt password hashing
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Atomic configuration with validation

### 🤖 Smart Features
- Browser-side AI detection (ONNX Runtime Web, WebGPU-accelerated) — no backend inference
