# CIA World Factbooks Archive 1990-2025

A complete, structured archive of the CIA World Factbook spanning **36 years** (1990-2025), covering **281 entities** with **1,071,603 data fields** in a normalized SQLite database.

The CIA World Factbook was discontinued on **February 4, 2026**. This archive preserves every edition published since 1990 and creates a structured, queryable dataset.

## Get the app

The full archive is also a **free, fully-offline app** — the entire
36-year dataset is bundled inside, so it runs with no account and no network.

> **Data Integrity:** No Factbook content is added or altered. The parsing process structures the CIA's raw text into queryable fields — removing formatting artifacts, sectioning headers, and deduplicating noise lines — but the actual data values are exactly as the CIA published them. The only additions to the source data are reference lookup tables (FIPS-to-ISO code mappings, entity classifications, COCOM regional assignments) that sit alongside the original data, not inside it. In FieldValues, a small number of rows are derived by computation from neighboring sub-values (e.g. total life expectancy averaged from male/female in pre-1995 data); these are clearly flagged with `IsComputed = 1`.

## Raw Source Bundle

The original input files behind every year — Gutenberg `.txt`, CIA HTML zips, JSON snapshots — are also published as a separate GitHub Release for offline verification, full-text search of raw bytes, or re-running the ETL from scratch.

**[Download: raw-sources-v1](https://github.com/MilkMp/CIA-World-Factbooks-Archive-1990-2025/releases/tag/raw-sources-v1)** — 38 files, 2.98 GB, every year is its own asset.

The bundle has been row-level-diffed against `factbook.db` at **99.94% exact match**. Methodology, per-year results, and the full manifest live in [`raw-sources/`](raw-sources/) (validation report, L3 / L3b reports, SHA256 + upstream URL per file).

## ETL Pipeline & Python Scripts

There are **two ways** to get the data:

1. **Import the pre-built SQL dumps** (in `data/`) — no Python required. See [How to Restore](#how-to-restore) below.
2. **Re-run the ETL pipeline from scratch** — the Python scripts in `etl/` download raw Factbook data directly from their original sources (Wayback Machine, Project Gutenberg, GitHub), parse every format variant, and load the structured results into SQL Server via pyodbc. This is how the archive was originally built.

The raw CIA World Factbook changed format **at least 10 times** between 1990 and 2025. Every script in `etl/` exists because a previous version of the parser broke on a new year's data. The pipeline handles 4 plain-text format variants, 5 HTML layout generations, and a final JSON era — each requiring its own parser.

### Scripts

| Script | Lines | Years | What it does |
|--------|-------|-------|--------------|
| `build_archive.py` | 986 | 2000-2020 | Downloads HTML zips from the Wayback Machine, detects which of 5 HTML layouts each year uses, and parses fields. Handles CDX API fallback when downloads fail, filters template/print pages, and deduplicates entries. |
| `load_gutenberg_years.py` | 1,043 | 1990-2001 | Parses plain-text Gutenberg editions with 4 distinct format variants (tagged, asterisk, at-sign, colon). Includes fuzzy country name matching to handle aliases like "Burma" and "Ivory Coast." |
| `reload_json_years.py` | 413 | 2021-2025 | Checks out year-end git commits from the factbook/cache.factbook.json repo and loads structured JSON. Strips embedded HTML from content fields. |
| `build_field_mappings.py` | 783 | All | Maps 1,132 raw field name variants to 416 canonical names using a 7-rule system: identity, dash normalization, CIA renames, consolidation, country-specific entries, noise detection, and manual review. Uses case-sensitive collation (`COLLATE Latin1_General_CS_AS`) to ensure case variants get separate mapping rows. Pipe (`\|`) delimiters in Content for sub-field boundaries across all eras. |
| `classify_entities.py` | 283 | All | Auto-classifies 281 entities into 9 types (sovereign, territory, disputed, etc.) based on Dependency Status and Government Type fields, with hardcoded overrides for edge cases. |
| `repair_1996_truncated.py` | 189 | 1996 | Parses CIA's original `wfb-96.txt.gz` (page-header format with centered country/section names) and replaces truncated Gutenberg entries for 7 countries: Venezuela, Armenia, Greece, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Tuvalu. |
| `validate_integrity.py` | 296 | All | Read-only validation suite with 10 checks: field count benchmarks, US population/GDP ground truth, year-over-year consistency, source provenance, NULL detection, and unmapped field name gap analysis. |
| `structured_parsing/parse_field_values.py` | 1,400+ | All | Decomposes 1,071,603 raw text blobs into 1,775,588 typed sub-values using 55 field-specific parsers + generic fallback. Each row includes a `SourceFragment` column showing the exact text slice that produced the value, and an `IsComputed` flag distinguishing source-extracted values (0) from parser-derived values (1). Extracts land/water area, male/female life expectancy, age brackets, sex ratios, literacy, budget, elevation, dependency ratios, GDP composition, CO2 emissions, water/sanitation, and more. |
| `structured_parsing/validate_field_values.py` | 231 | All | Validates FieldValues against the source database: row counts, coverage, numeric extraction rate, spot checks against known ground truth values (US population, Russia area, Japan military). |
| `structured_parsing/export_field_values_to_sqlite.py` | 269 | All | Exports FieldValues + all reference tables to a self-contained SQLite database (factbook.db, ~662 MB with FTS5 + ISOCountryCodes when using `--webapp`). Includes post-export integrity check that detects and backfills any unmapped field names. |

### Why parsing was so difficult

The CIA never maintained a stable schema. Every few years the HTML layout changed completely, field names were renamed without notice, and entire categories were restructured. Examples:

- **1990-1999 (plain text):** Four different formatting conventions across the decade. 1990-1993 used `Country: Name` headers with indented fields. 1994 introduced tagged markers (`_@_`, `_*_`, `_#_`). 1996 switched to bare section headers with no markers at all. 1999 changed the delimiter scheme again. Each variant required its own regex-based parser.

- **2000-2020 (HTML):** The CIA redesigned the Factbook website at least 5 times. The 2000 edition used `<b>FieldName:</b>` inline formatting. By 2004 it switched to `<td class="FieldLabel">` table layouts. 2008 introduced CollapsiblePanel JavaScript widgets. 2014 changed to expand/collapse `<h2>` sections. 2017 moved to field-anchor `<div>` structures. A parser that worked on 2006 data would produce garbage on 2010 data.

- **2001:** The Wayback Machine's HTML zip for 2001 was corrupted, so parsing fell back to the Project Gutenberg plain-text edition — the only year where the HTML and text pipelines had to swap.

- **Field name drift:** The CIA renamed fields silently over the decades. "GDP - real growth rate" became "Real GDP growth rate." "Telephones" split into "Telephones - fixed lines" and "Telephones - mobile cellular." Oil sub-fields were consolidated into "Petroleum." The `build_field_mappings.py` script maps all 1,132 variants through 7 rule layers to maintain time-series continuity.

- **Country-specific noise:** 1990s editions embedded government body names (parliaments, assemblies, courts) as top-level fields. Dissolved countries (Serbia and Montenegro, Netherlands Antilles) appear and disappear. Turkish Cyprus, Malaysian states, and Netherlands Antilles islands show up as sub-entries that need special handling.

See [docs/METHODOLOGY.md](docs/METHODOLOGY.md) and [docs/ETL_PIPELINE.md](docs/ETL_PIPELINE.md) for the full technical details.

## How to Restore

### Prerequisites
- SQL Server 2017+ (or Azure SQL)
- [ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server)
- Python 3.8+ with `pyodbc` (for ETL scripts and CLI search tool)

### Steps

1. **Create the database:**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE CIA_WorldFactbook;
   ```

2. **Run the schema script:**
   ```bash
   sqlcmd -S localhost -d CIA_WorldFactbook -i schema/create_tables.sql
   ```

3. **Import data (in order):**
   ```bash
   sqlcmd -S localhost -d CIA_WorldFactbook -i data/master_countries.sql
   sqlcmd -S localhost -d CIA_WorldFactbook -i data/countries.sql
   sqlcmd -S localhost -d CIA_WorldFactbook -i data/categories.sql
   sqlcmd -S localhost -d CIA_WorldFactbook -i data/field_name_mappings.sql
   ```

4. **Import field data (decompress and import each year):**
   ```bash
   cd data/fields
   # On Linux/macOS:
   for f in *.sql.gz; do gunzip -k "$f" && sqlcmd -S localhost -d CIA_WorldFactbook -i "${f%.gz}"; done
   # On Windows (PowerShell):
   Get-ChildItem *.sql.gz | ForEach-Object {
       $sql = $_.FullName -replace '\.gz$',''
       [System.IO.Compression.GZipStream]::new(
           [System.IO.File]::OpenRead($_.FullName),
           [System.IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Decompress
       ).CopyTo([System.IO.File]::Create($sql))
       sqlcmd -S localhost -d CIA_WorldFactbook -i $sql
   }
   ```

5. **Verify:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM CountryFields;  -- Should return 1,071,603
   ```

### Structured Field Values Database (NEW)

The raw text in `CountryFields.Content` has been decomposed into **1,775,588 typed sub-values** across **2,599 distinct sub-fields** using 55 dedicated parsers. Each row includes a `SourceFragment` showing the exact text slice that produced the value, and an `IsComputed` flag distinguishing values extracted directly from source text (`0`) from values derived by computation (`1`, e.g. averaging male/female life expectancy for pre-1995 data). Sub-field boundaries in Content use pipe (`|`) delimiters for unambiguous parsing. This enables SQL queries that were previously impossible without per-query regex — for example, ranking countries by land-vs-water ratio, comparing male vs female life expectancy, or charting budget deficit trends.

**Download:** [factbook.db (~662 MB) from Release v3.5](https://github.com/MilkMp/CIA-World-Factbooks-Archive-1990-2025/releases/tag/v3.5) — single self-contained database with all tables, FTS5 search index, and ISO country codes.

**Live dashboard:** [worldfactbookarchive.org/analysis/structured-data](https://worldfactbookarchive.org/analysis/structured-data) — interactive charts showing new queries with SQL and source data tabs.

The database is self-contained with all reference tables included. Example query:

```sql
-- Top 10 countries by land area (2025) with land/water split
SELECT c.Name,
  MAX(CASE WHEN fv.SubField = 'land' THEN fv.NumericVal END) AS land_sqkm,
  MAX(CASE WHEN fv.SubField = 'water' THEN fv.NumericVal END) AS water_sqkm
FROM FieldValues fv
JOIN CountryFields cf ON fv.FieldID = cf.FieldID
JOIN Countries c ON cf.CountryID = c.CountryID
JOIN FieldNameMappings fnm ON cf.FieldName = fnm.OriginalName
WHERE c.Year = 2025 AND fnm.CanonicalName = 'Area'
GROUP BY c.Name
ORDER BY land_sqkm DESC LIMIT 10;
```

See [etl/structured_parsing/DESIGN.md](etl/structured_parsing/DESIGN.md) for the full architecture, parser registry, and sub-field catalog.

### StarDict Dictionaries (for KOReader / GoldenDict)

Offline dictionaries in StarDict format for use with [KOReader](https://koreader.rocks/), [GoldenDict-ng](https://xiaoyifang.github.io/goldendict-ng/), and other StarDict-compatible apps. Each (country, field) pair is its own dictionary entry (e.g., "Afghanistan - Population"), matching the per-field format used by KOReader's existing factbook dictionary. Entries are searchable by country name, ISO Alpha-2 code, or FIPS 10-4 code combined with the field name.

**36 dictionaries** (one per year, 1990-2025), **~2.1 million entries** total, ~130 MB compressed.

**Download:** [StarDict tarballs from Release v3.5-stardict](https://github.com/MilkMp/CIA-World-Factbooks-Archive-1990-2025/releases/tag/v3.5-stardict) — grab individual years or all 36.

**Generate locally:**
```bash
pip install pyglossary python-idzip
python etl/stardict/build_stardict.py                    # all 36 years
python etl/stardict/build_stardict.py --years 2025       # just 2025
```

Output goes to `data/stardict/`. Each dictionary is a directory with `.ifo`, `.idx`, `.dict.dz`, and `.syn` files. Copy the directory into your dictionary app's data folder (e.g., `koreader/data/dict/` for KOReader).

See [etl/stardict/README.md](etl/stardict/README.md) for format details, synonym resolution, validation (16/16 tests), and installation guides.

### Alternative: SQLite (No SQL Server Required)

A pre-built SQLite database (`factbook.db`, ~662 MB) is available as a release download for users who don't need SQL Server. The file exceeds GitHub's 100 MB file-size limit, so it is not included in the repository itself.

**Download:** [factbook.db from the latest release](https://github.com/MilkMp/CIA-World-Factbooks-Archive-1990-2025/releases/latest)

Place the downloaded file at `data/factbook.db` in the project root. SQLite requires no installation — Python's built-in `sqlite3` module can query it directly.

| | SQL Server | SQLite |
|--|-----------|--------|
| **Setup** | Install SQL Server + ODBC driver, run schema + import scripts | Download one `.db` file |
| **Size** | ~263 MB across 36 gzipped SQL files | ~662 MB single file |
| **Query tool** | SSMS, sqlcmd, pyodbc | Python `sqlite3`, DB Browser, any SQLite client |
| **Best for** | Power BI, enterprise analytics, large-scale joins | Quick exploration, scripting, lightweight apps |
| **Schema** | Identical 5-table structure | Identical 5-table structure |

The SQLite database contains the same tables (including FieldValues with IsComputed), same indexes, and same 1,071,603 fields as the SQL Server version, plus an FTS5 full-text search index for fast keyword and boolean search. This is what the [live webapp](https://worldfactbookarchive.org/) runs on.

**Note on numeric values:** The `CountryFields` table stores raw text content exactly as published by the CIA. There is no pre-computed `Value` column. The CSV and Excel exports on the webapp parse numeric values at download time using regex extraction. To extract numeric values yourself, join through `FieldNameMappings` and apply a pattern for the field you need:

```python
import sqlite3, re

db = sqlite3.connect("factbook.db")
db.row_factory = sqlite3.Row

# Example: extract Population as an integer
rows = db.execute("""
    SELECT c.Year, mc.CanonicalName, cf.Content
    FROM CountryFields cf
    JOIN Countries c ON cf.CountryID = c.CountryID
    JOIN MasterCountries mc ON c.MasterCountryID = mc.MasterCountryID
    JOIN FieldNameMappings fm ON cf.FieldName = fm.OriginalName
    WHERE fm.CanonicalName = 'Population'
    ORDER BY mc.CanonicalName, c.Year
""").fetchall()

for r in rows:
    m = re.search(r'[\d,]{5,}', r["Content"])
    value = int(m.group().replace(",", "")) if m else None
    if value:
        print(f"{r['CanonicalName']} ({r['Year']}): {value:,}")
```

Common extraction patterns for other fields:

| Field | Pattern | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Population | `re.search(r'[\d,]{5,}', text)` &rarr; remove commas, cast to int | 331,449,281 |
| Real GDP per capita | `re.search(r'\$([\d,]+)', text)` &rarr; remove commas, cast to int | $63,500 |
| Life expectancy at birth | `re.search(r'total population:\s*([\d.]+)', text)` &rarr; float | 78.5 years |
| Population growth rate | `re.search(r'(-?[\d.]+)%', text)` &rarr; float | 0.7% |
| Military expenditures | `re.search(r'([\d.]+)%\s*of\s*G[DN]P', text)` &rarr; float | 3.45% of GDP |
| Area | `re.search(r'total\s*:?\s*([\d,]+)\s*sq\s*km', text)` &rarr; remove commas, cast to int | 9,833,517 sq km |
| Birth/Death rate | `re.search(r'([\d.]+)\s*(?:births\|deaths)\s*/\s*1,000', text)` &rarr; float | 11.0 births/1,000 |

## Field Name Standardization

The CIA renamed many fields over the 36-year span. The `FieldNameMappings` table maps 1,132 raw field name variants to 416 canonical names (case-sensitive, so `Natural hazards` and `natural hazards` get separate rows):

| Mapping Type | Count | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| identity | 184 | Modern field names (unchanged) |
| rename | 159 | CIA renamed the field (e.g. "GDP - real growth rate" -> "Real GDP growth rate") |
| dash_format | 64 | Formatting differences (single vs double dashes) |
| consolidation | 48 | Sub-fields merged into parents (e.g. Oil production/consumption -> Petroleum) |
| country_specific | 354 | Regional sub-entries, government body names |
| noise | 281 | Parser artifacts, fragments (flagged IsNoise=1) |
