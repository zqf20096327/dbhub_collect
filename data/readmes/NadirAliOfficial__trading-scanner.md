# Trading Scanner — MT5 Signal Bot + Streamlit Dashboard

A professional **Forex & Gold trading scanner** built in Python that connects to **MetaTrader 5**, detects high-probability setups using Smart Money Concepts (SMC), scores them, and sends **progressive Telegram alerts** with chart screenshots.

Designed as Phase 1 of a full **Trading Operating System** — no auto-execution, full manual control.

## Features

### Market Scanner
- Connects to MetaTrader 5 via the official Python API
- Scans **6 instruments** simultaneously: XAUUSD, EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, GBPJPY, EURJPY
- Multi-timeframe analysis: H4 bias → H1 structure → M15 entry
- Runs on a configurable interval (default 60s)

### Strategy Logic (Smart Money Concepts)
| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| HTF Bias | Bullish/bearish trend via EMA20/EMA50 on H4 |
| Market Structure | Swing highs/lows across timeframes |
| Break of Structure (BOS) | Price closes beyond last confirmed swing |
| Liquidity Sweep | Wick past structural level, body closes back inside |
| Fair Value Gap (FVG) | 3-candle imbalance detection, tracks filled/unfilled |
| Retest | Price returning to FVG or broken structure |
| Rejection Candle | Hammer, shooting star, bullish/bearish engulfing |
| Session Filter | London, New York, London/NY overlap, Asian |
| Risk-to-Reward | Auto-calculated entry, SL, TP1 (2R), TP2 (3R) |
| **News Filter** | Blocks alerts 30m before / 15m after HIGH-impact events (ForexFactory) |

### Setup Scoring Engine
Each setup is dynamically scored (max 14 points) and graded:

| Grade | Min Score | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 🥉 Standard | 4 | Basic confluence |
| 🥈 A | 7 | Good setup |
| 🥇 A+ | 10 | High-probability |
| 💎 Elite | 12 | All conditions confirmed |

### Telegram Alerts
Progressive staged alerts sent with chart screenshots:

- 🔍 Setup Developing
- ⚡ Entry Zone Approaching
- ✅ 5-Min / 15-Min Confirmation
- 🎯 High-Confidence Setup

Each alert includes grade, score bar, bias, session, entry/SL/TP levels.

### Risk Management Constitution
Automatically suspends alerts when limits are breached:
- Max % risk per trade (used for lot size calculation)
- Daily drawdown limit
- Weekly drawdown limit
- Max consecutive losses

### Trade Journal & Database
SQLite database storing:
- Setups detected (symbol, grade, score, levels, chart path)
- Trades (entry, SL, TP, outcome, RR achieved, notes)
- Journal entries (daily review responses)
- Risk log (equity, drawdown history)

### News Filter
- Fetches the **ForexFactory weekly calendar** (public JSON endpoint, no API key needed)
- Caches events locally for 1 hour, refreshes automatically
- Maps each symbol to its currencies (e.g. GBPJPY → GBP + JPY)
- Suppresses scanner alerts during the blackout window around HIGH-impact events
- Sends a Telegram notification when an alert is blocked (once per symbol, with cooldown)
- Window is fully configurable via `.env`

### Streamlit Dashboard
Seven-page dashboard:

| Page | Contents |
|------|----------|
| Dashboard | Today's stats, recent setups, next high-impact event countdown, equity trend |
| **Economic Calendar** | Live ForexFactory events, countdown timer, impact filter, timeline chart, scanner blackout indicator |
| Active Setups | Filterable setup table with chart previews |
| Trade Journal | Log and close trades |
| Analytics | Win rate, RR distribution, cumulative RR curve, performance by grade/symbol/session |
| Daily Review | End-of-day reflection form (stored for future AI coaching) |
| Risk Status | Drawdown tracker, consecutive loss chart, constitution rules |
