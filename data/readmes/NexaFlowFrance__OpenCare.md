OpenCare is a **self-hosted alternative to caregiver apps like Jointly or CaringBridge**: a care
circle around each cared-for person, a real-time care journal, medications with reminders, a shared
calendar, shared expenses between siblings, and tools nobody else offers: magic links so professionals
can write without an account, a fridge QR emergency sheet, a wall tablet for the cared-for person.
All on **your** server: the health data of a vulnerable person should not live on someone else's cloud.

## ✨ Features

### The foundation

| | |
|---|---|
| 👥 **Care circle** | One circle per cared-for person, invite by link, fine-grained roles (family, professional, neighbour, read-only). Multi-circle from day one: follow both parents, or link two into a **household** (a couple) with a combined dashboard |
| 📔 **Care journal** | The digital liaison book: timestamped entries with photos, real time on every device (WebSocket). The heart of the app |
| 💊 **Medications** | Treatments and schedules, intake confirmation written to the journal, prescription renewal alerts |
| 📅 **Shared calendar** | Visits, medical appointments, nurse rounds, recurrences, reminders, iCal export (.ics / webcal) |
| ❤️ **Health tracking** | Hand-entered vitals (weight, blood pressure, pain, mood, temperature, glucose), curves over time |
| ✅ **Tasks and shopping** | Who does what this week, plus a shared shopping list the home aide can use too |
| 💬 **Messages** | Circle thread and direct messages, attachments |
| 📁 **Documents and contacts** | Prescriptions, reports, insurance, legal papers; the circle address book (GP, nurse, the neighbour who has the key) |

### Beyond the paid apps

| | |
|---|---|
| 💶 **Shared expenses** | A built-in Tricount: who advanced what, balances, suggested settlements, and tracking of French aids (APA, CESU, tax credit) |
| ⚖️ **Care load fairness** | "Marie covered 78% of the visits this month": objective stats to prevent burnout of the primary caregiver |
| 🔗 **Magic links** | The home aide or the nurse writes in the journal from a simple link (SMS/QR), no account, no app to install |
| 🩺 **Consultation prep** | One click: a printable summary for the doctor (key events, vitals trends, current treatments, the family's questions) |
| 🖥️ **Kiosk** | A wall tablet at your loved one's home: who is coming today (with photos), big medication reminders, weather, and two huge buttons: "All is well" / "I need help" |
| 🚨 **Emergency QR sheet** | A printed QR on the fridge: paramedics scan it and see the vital sheet (treatments, allergies, directives, contacts), always up to date |
| 📖 **"Who I am"** | A life-story page (career, pride, habits, what soothes them) shown to every new caregiver, inspired by the Alzheimer's Society "This is me" document |
| 🧳 **Respite handover** | The primary caregiver leaves for a week: an auto-generated handover pack (schedule, medications, instructions, contacts) shared by link |
| 🏠 **Passive monitoring** | Home Assistant webhooks (door sensor, coffee-maker plug, motion): "normal activity this morning" on the family dashboard, alert cascade if no sign of life. No camera, no wristband |
| 🎙️ **Voice journal** | Dictate on your way out ("20 minute visit, all fine, get paracetamol"): your self-hosted Whisper transcribes, the AI files the journal entry and the shopping item |
| 🤖 **Weekly AI digest** | Every Sunday: "Calm week. 5 visits. Stable blood pressure. Attention: 2 missed doses on Tuesday and Thursday." With slow-trend detection (recurring low mood, gradual weight loss) |
| 🌡️ **Heat-wave watch** | Declare a heat episode in one tap: prevention checklist on the dashboard and kiosk, hydration reminders to caregivers at chosen times, and an "I drank water" button on the kiosk |
| 🗣️ **AI companion** | An optional voice companion the cared-for person chats with from the kiosk: gentle reminiscence drawn from the "Who I am" page, voice in (your Whisper) and read aloud. Strict guardrails (never medical advice, distress alerts the circle). Local-first with Ollama, or your own cloud key |

### Built to be yours

- **Self-hosted**: Docker, or a one-click **Windows installer** (Node.js and PostgreSQL bundled)
- **Offline-friendly PWA**: works in a nursing-home room with poor signal
- **Local-first AI**: Ollama on your machine, or your own Anthropic / OpenAI-compatible key, encrypted at rest
- **Full export** of all circle data, **AGPL-3.0** licensed
- **French, English and Spanish** interface, keyboard reachable and screen reader friendly

## 🚀 Quick start

### 🪟 Windows installer (.exe)

For Windows users, **NexaFlow** provides an all-in-one graphical installer: Node.js and
PostgreSQL are bundled, no Docker and no configuration required.

Download `OpenCare-Setup.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/NexaFlowFrance/OpenCare/releases/latest),
run it, click **Start**: the app opens at http://localhost:3000. The window also shows your local
network address so the rest of the family can open it from their phones on the same Wi-Fi.

### 🐳 Docker (recommended for a server)

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # set POSTGRES_PASSWORD and JWT_SECRET
docker-compose up -d --build
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001

### 💾 Backups

Everything lives in PostgreSQL, so one dump is a full backup.

```bash
bash scripts/backup.sh              # writes a checked, compressed dump to ./backups
bash scripts/restore.sh <file>      # restores it, after a safety backup
```

Put it in cron, and copy the files off the machine. See
[DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md) for the options.

### 🛠️ Development

On Windows, the simplest path needs no Docker: the script starts the bundled
PostgreSQL, writes a dev `.env`, and launches the app.

```powershell
npm install
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\dev-windows.ps1
```

On macOS or Linux (or Windows with Docker):

```bash
npm install
docker-compose up -d postgres   # or any PostgreSQL 14+
cp .env.example .env            # set JWT_SECRET (32+ chars) and POSTGRES_PASSWORD
npm run dev
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173 · Backend: http://localhost:3001

The database schema bootstraps itself on first start: no manual SQL step. A
`.env` at the project root is required for `npm run dev` (the script above
creates one for you on Windows).

## 🙏 Credits

Built and maintained by [NexaFlow France](https://nexaflow.fr), and offered to every family
that takes care of someone.

OpenCare is built on the open-source foundation of [OpenFamily](https://github.com/NexaFlowFrance/OpenFamily),
the self-hosted family organizer by NexaFlow. The care circles, the real-time layer, the offline-first
client and the self-hosting story all come from that base, rebuilt around family caregiving.

Thanks to [mpking828](https://github.com/mpking828) for the time zone alignment between the server and
the database, the multilingual emergency sheet, and careful bug reports from a household outside France.

Special thanks to [thecybermacgyver](https://github.com/thecybermacgyver), whose thorough product review
and kiosk mockups shaped the patient experience of version 1.2.
