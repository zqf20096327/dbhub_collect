> emerged from a direct exchange with him.

## 🚀 Quick start

### 🪟 Windows installer (.exe) — the easiest path

For Windows users, **NexaFlow** provides an all-in-one graphical installer: Node.js and
PostgreSQL are bundled — **no Docker, no configuration** required.

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/NexaFlowFrance/OpenFamily/releases/latest/download/OpenFamily-Setup.exe">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/⬇️%20Download%20the%20latest%20version-OpenFamily%20for%20Windows-2496ED?style=for-the-badge&logo=windows&logoColor=white" alt="Download OpenFamily for Windows" />
  </a>
</p>

Run `OpenFamily-Setup.exe`, click **Start**, and the app opens at http://localhost:3000.
The window also shows your local network address so you can open it from a phone on the same
Wi-Fi, and the **Settings** tab explains how to set up Tailscale for secure remote access.

### 📱 Android app (APK)

OpenFamily also has a native **Android app** — a thin client that connects to **your own**
server (you enter its address on first launch, just like the Nextcloud or Home Assistant
apps). It hosts nothing itself.

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/NexaFlowFrance/OpenFamily/releases/latest/download/OpenFamily.apk">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/⬇️%20Download%20the%20APK-OpenFamily%20for%20Android-3DDC84?style=for-the-badge&logo=android&logoColor=white" alt="Download OpenFamily for Android" />
  </a>
</p>

Install the APK, allow installs from unknown sources when prompted, open the app and enter
your server URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:3001`, or your HTTPS / Tailscale address).

> 🔄 **Stay up to date automatically:** add the repo to
> **[Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium)** to receive app updates straight from
> GitHub Releases — no app store required.

### 🐳 Docker (recommended for a server)

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # edit your settings
docker-compose up -d --build
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001

Verify the stack end-to-end:

```bash
npm run smoke:api
```

**Prefer ready-made images?** Every release is published for amd64 and arm64. Create a `docker-compose.override.yml` next to `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  server:
    image: ghcr.io/nexaflowfrance/openfamily-server:1.7.1
  client:
    image: ghcr.io/nexaflowfrance/openfamily-client:1.7.1
```

then run `docker compose pull server client && docker compose up -d`, without `--build`. The image names need their `-server` / `-client` suffix. Build-time options such as `VITE_REGISTRATION_ENABLED` still require building the client yourself.

### 🛠️ Manual install

```bash
npm run install:all
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE openfamily;"
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173 · Backend: http://localhost:3001
