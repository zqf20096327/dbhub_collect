Stay in Neovim for the daily SQL Server workflow—from connecting and exploring
objects to executing T-SQL and inspecting results.

`sqlserver.nvim` is a SQL Server-native workspace built around Neovim rather
than an attempt to reproduce SQL Server Management Studio. It uses Microsoft
SQL Tools Service for SQL Server-aware language intelligence and query
execution while keeping protocol, workspace, result, and UI concerns separate.

## Features

- Connect query buffers to SQL Server and Azure SQL profiles.
- Complete, diagnose, format, hover, navigate, and inspect T-SQL signatures
  through Neovim's built-in LSP support and SQL Tools Service.
- Search, browse, and script tables, views, procedures, and functions in the
  connected database. The hierarchical Object Explorer is available when
  `snacks.nvim` is installed with its picker enabled.
- Execute the statement under the cursor, a visual selection, or the complete
  buffer.
- Cancel active queries and inspect persistent workspace activity.
- Revisit recent executions and navigate their result sets in dedicated
  `sqlserver-result` buffers.
- Open CSV, JSON, and XML exports as editable buffers, or save Excel `.xlsx`.
- Copy selected result ranges as rich HTML tables for apps such as Teams.
- Display workspace state and result-history position in a configurable winbar.

Switching from `mssql.nvim` requires configuration and workflow changes. See
[Migrating from mssql.nvim](docs/migrating-from-mssql.md) for a compatibility
guide and checklist.

## Installation

Requires Neovim 0.11.7 or newer. With [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "NicholasMata/sqlserver.nvim",
  -- version = "v1.0.0-rc.5", -- Pin a release
  -- branch = "next", -- Follow unreleased development
  opts = {
    keymap_prefix = "<leader>s",
  },
}
```

The tested SQL Tools Service release is pinned and installed automatically on
first setup unless `tools_file` points to an existing executable. Override
`tools_version` only when intentionally testing another upstream release.
`snacks.nvim` is optional; only `:SQLServer ObjectExplorer` requires it.
Create or edit connection profiles with:

```vim
:SQLServer EditConnections
```

See [Connections JSON](docs/connections-json.md) for the supported connection
properties and `${ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE}` credential references.

## Configuration

The defaults provide a split result view, persistent activity, native progress,
and a winbar showing the current server, database, and state:

```lua
require("sqlserver").setup({
  keymap_prefix = "<leader>s",
  open_results_in = "split",
  view_messages_in = "activity",
  results = {
    column_icons = true,
    sticky_header = true,
    history_limit = 10,
    max_rows = 1000,
    max_cell_width = 100,
  },
  timeouts = {
    lsp_attach = 10000,
    connection = 10000,
    export = 10000,
    object_explorer = 10000,
    query = false,
  },
  ui = {
    presenter = "default",
    winbar = true,
    native_progress = true,
    activity = {
      height = 12,
    },
    connection_info = {
      height = "auto",
    },
  },
})
```

Operational timeouts use milliseconds or `false` to wait indefinitely. Queries
have no client-side timeout by default and can be stopped with `CancelQuery`.

With the prefix above, use `<leader>sx` for the statement under the cursor or a
visual selection, and `<leader>sX` for the complete buffer. Commands are also
available through `:SQLServer`.
