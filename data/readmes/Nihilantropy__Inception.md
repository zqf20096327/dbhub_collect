   Add your domain to `/etc/hosts`. The domain should match the `DOMAIN_NAME` variable in your `/srcs/.env` file:
   ```bash
   sudo echo "127.0.0.1 ${DOMAIN_NAME}" >> /etc/hosts
   ```

   *⚠️ Note: The `.env` file should be located in the `/srcs` directory, at the same level as the `docker-compose.yml` file.*

2. **Verify Docker Service**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   ```

3. **Add User to Docker Group** (optional, to run Docker without sudo)
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
   newgrp docker
   ```

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nihilantropy/Inception.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**

======================================-->
# Docker Fundamentals 🐳

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in isolated environments called containers. A container is a lightweight, standalone package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software - from the code and runtime to system libraries and settings.

![VM vs Containers](images/vm-vs-containers.png)

<!--=====================================
=         DOCKER BENEFITS             =
======================================-->
## Why Docker? 🤔

Docker solves several key challenges in modern software development:

1. **Consistency**: "It works on my machine" becomes a problem of the past
2. **Isolation**: Applications run independently without interfering with each other
3. **Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS kernel, making them lighter than VMs
4. **Scalability**: Easy to deploy multiple instances of the same application

## Key Docker Components 🔧

- **Dockerfile**: A text file containing instructions to build an image
- **Image**: A template for creating containers (like a snapshot)
- **Container**: A running instance of an image
- **Docker Compose**: Tool for defining and running multi-container applications

<!--=====================================
=         DOCKER IN INCEPTION         =
======================================-->
## Docker in Inception Project 🎯

### Traditional Docker vs. Inception Approach

**Traditional Approach:**
```bash
# Pulling pre-built images
docker pull wordpress:latest
docker pull mysql:latest
```

**Inception Approach:**
```dockerfile
# Building custom WordPress image
FROM alpine:3.20
RUN apk add --no-cache php php-fpm wordpress
# Custom configurations...
```

### Why Build From Scratch?

1. **Understanding**: Gain deep knowledge of service configuration
2. **Control**: Full control over what goes into each container
3. **Security**: Minimize vulnerabilities by including only necessary components
4. **Optimization**: Create lean containers tailored to specific needs

![Docker Approaches](images/docker-approaches.png)

### Project Implementation

In Inception, we:
- Write custom Dockerfiles for each service
- Configure services through initialization scripts
- Use docker-compose for orchestration
- Implement proper networking and volume management

This approach provides valuable learning opportunities and better control over the infrastructure, though in production environments, validated official images might be preferred for their reliability and maintenance.

<!--=====================================
=         PROCESS MANAGEMENT          =
======================================-->
## Docker Process Management and PID 1 🔄

## Understanding PID 1 in Docker 🎯

In Docker containers, the first process that starts (PID 1) plays a crucial role in process management and container lifecycle. Unlike traditional Linux systems where systemd or init handles process management, in containers, your application or a designated init process must handle these responsibilities.

### Why PID 1 Matters 🤔

1. **Signal Handling**
   - PID 1 must properly handle process signals (SIGTERM, SIGINT, etc.)
   - Responsible for forwarding signals to child processes
   - Critical for graceful container shutdown

2. **Zombie Process Prevention**
   - Must reap zombie (defunct) processes
   - Prevent resource leaks
   - Maintain container health

3. **Container Lifecycle**
   - Determines container state
   - Manages application startup
   - Handles cleanup on shutdown

## Our Implementation: Best Practices ✅

In our Inception project, we implement a robust solution for process management that ensures proper signal handling and clean container lifecycle management. Here's how:

### 1. ENTRYPOINT in Exec Form

We use the exec form of ENTRYPOINT in our Dockerfiles:
```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["/init.sh"]
```

This is crucial because:
- Runs the init script directly, not through a shell
- Makes our init script PID 1 initially
- Ensures proper signal propagation
- Prevents additional shell processes

### 2. Init Scripts with exec

Our init scripts end with the `exec` command:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
set -e

# Configuration and setup...

# Replace shell with the main process
exec nginx -g "daemon off;"
```

This approach is ideal because:
- The `exec` command replaces the shell process with the service process
- The service becomes PID 1 directly
- No shell remains in between Docker and the service
- Professional services (NGINX, PHP-FPM, MariaDB) handle signals properly

### Why Our Approach Works Well 🎯

1. **No Shell Interference**
   - Using exec form of ENTRYPOINT avoids shell wrapping
   - `exec` in scripts ensures direct process execution
   - No intermediate shell processes remain

2. **Professional Service Integration**
   - Services like NGINX, MariaDB, and PHP-FPM have built-in signal handling
   - They manage their own child processes
   - They handle graceful shutdowns properly

3. **Clean Process Tree**
   ```
   PID 1 (Service Process)
   └── Child processes (if any)
   ```
   No unnecessary layers or shell processes

4. **Direct Signal Propagation**
   ```
   Docker -> Service Process (PID 1)
              └── Clean shutdown handling
   ```
   No signal forwarding needed

### Examples from Our Services

1. **NGINX**
```bash
exec nginx -g "daemon off;"
```
NGINX receives signals directly and handles graceful shutdown of worker processes.

2. **PHP-FPM**
```bash
exec php-fpm82 -F
```
PHP-FPM manages its worker pool and handles signals for graceful worker shutdown.

3. **MariaDB**
```bash
exec mysqld --datadir="$MARIADB_DATA_DIR" --user=mysql
```
MariaDB handles database connections and ensures proper cleanup on shutdown.

### Why We Don't Need Additional Signal Handling

Despite what some examples show, we don't need explicit signal handling in our init scripts because:

1. We use the exec form of ENTRYPOINT: `ENTRYPOINT ["/init.sh"]`
2. Our init scripts use `exec` to replace themselves with the service

The key is that there's never a shell sitting between Docker and our service processes. When Docker sends a signal, it goes directly to the service process, which knows how to handle it properly.

## Testing Our Implementation ✅

You can verify our implementation works correctly by:

```bash
# Graceful shutdown test
docker-compose stop

# Check logs for clean shutdown
docker-compose logs nginx

# Verify no zombie processes
docker top nginx
```

This setup provides clean process management and proper signal handling while maintaining simplicity and reliability. 🚀

## ENTRYPOINT vs CMD Deep Dive 🔍

### Understanding the Differences

1. **ENTRYPOINT**
   - Defines the executable to run
   - Hard to override (requires --entrypoint flag)
   - Receives CMD as arguments
   - Better for "executable" containers

2. **CMD**
   - Provides default arguments
   - Easily overridden at runtime
   - Can be completely replaced
   - Flexible for general use

### Common Patterns

1. **Executable with Default Arguments**
```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["nginx"]
CMD ["-g", "daemon off;"]
```
- ENTRYPOINT defines the executable
- CMD provides default arguments
- Can override arguments but not executable

2. **Single Command with Init**
```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["/init.sh"]
```
- Script handles all setup and execution
- No default arguments needed
- Clear entry point for container

3. **Flexible Command**
```dockerfile
CMD ["php-fpm"]
```
- Can be completely overridden
- Suitable for development containers
- Maximum flexibility

### Inception Project Examples

1. **NGINX Container**
```dockerfile
COPY --chown=nginx:nginx ./tools/init.sh /init.sh
RUN chmod +x /init.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/init.sh"]
```
- Uses init script for setup
- Handles SSL configuration
- Manages process lifecycle

2. **Alien-Eggs Container**
```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT [ "python3", "/app/src/serve.py" ]
CMD ["--root", "/app/src", "--no-browser", "--port", "8060", "--metrics-port", "8000"]
```
- Direct process execution
- Configuration via arguments
- No complex initialization needed

## Best Practices Summary 📋

1. **Process Management**
   - Use init scripts for complex services
   - Implement proper signal handling
   - Manage child processes effectively
   - Handle cleanup on shutdown

2. **ENTRYPOINT Usage**
   - Use for primary executable
   - Initialize environment if needed
   - Handle signals properly
   - Set up logging

3. **CMD Considerations**
   - Provide default arguments
   - Allow runtime flexibility
   - Consider development needs
   - Enable easy overrides

4. **General Guidelines**
   - One main process per container
   - Proper signal handling
   - Clear process ownership
   - Efficient cleanup procedures

Following these practices ensures robust container operation, proper process management, and reliable service execution in our infrastructure. 🚀

=         ALPINE LINUX                =
======================================-->
# All Alpine 🏔️

## The Alpine Choice

In Inception, we had the choice between Debian and Alpine Linux as base images for our containers. We chose Alpine Linux for all our services, a decision that brings specific advantages to our containerized infrastructure.

<!--=====================================
=         ALPINE BENEFITS             =
======================================-->
## Why Alpine? 

### Size Matters 📦
- **Minimal Base Image**: Alpine base image is ~5MB compared to Debian's ~114MB
- **Smaller Final Images**: Services built on Alpine typically result in 30-70% smaller images
- **Faster Deployments**: Smaller images mean quicker pulls and deployments

### Security First 🛡️
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Fewer installed packages means fewer potential vulnerabilities
- **Security-oriented**: Built with security in mind from the ground up
- **Regular Security Updates**: Active maintenance and quick security patches

### Package Management 🔧
- **Simple Package Manager**: `apk` is fast, simple, and efficient
- **Rich Package Repository**: Despite its size, Alpine provides most needed packages
- **Quick Updates**: Package installation and updates are notably faster than apt

![Alpine vs Debian Sizes](images/debian-vs-alpine.png)

<!--=====================================
=         ALPINE IMPLEMENTATION       =
======================================-->
## Implementation in Inception

### Base Image Declaration
```dockerfile
# All our Dockerfiles start with
FROM alpine:3.20
```

### Package Installation Pattern
```dockerfile
# Alpine's efficient package installation
RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache \
    package1 \
    package2 \
    package3
```

### Key Considerations

1. **Compatibility**
   - Most services work seamlessly on Alpine
   - Some packages might have slightly different names than in Debian

1. **Volume Mount (`/var/www/html`)**:
   - Essential for serving WordPress files
   - The `wp-data` volume is shared between WordPress and NGINX
   - NGINX needs direct access to these files to serve static content efficiently
   - Without this mount, NGINX couldn't serve WordPress media or static assets

2. **Port 443**:
   - Only HTTPS port is exposed
   - No HTTP (port 80) access enforces secure connections
   - Internal service communication doesn't need port exposure
   - Maps container's internal port 443 to host's port 443

3. **Network Configuration**:
   - Connected only to `proxy` network
   - Isolates NGINX from database network
   - Enables communication with backend services
   - Follows principle of least privilege

   - Initial site setup
   - User creation
   - Plugin activation

3. **Database Integration** (`setup_db.sh`):
   - Database connection verification
   - Table creation/verification
   - Initial data population
   - User permissions setup

### 4. Key Configuration Elements 🎛️

1. **custom wp-config**
init-wp-config.sh script create a custom `wp-config.php` file,
tailored around our needs.
Using the `cat` command ensure proper ENV `var expansion`.

2. **PHP-FPM Settings**:
`Point 9` of the `init-wordpress.sh` script ensure proper `php-fpm` setup
by changing the default `user`, `group` and `listen` interface to our needs

```bash
sed -i -r 's|^user = .*$|user = www-data|' /etc/php82/php-fpm.d/www.conf
sed -i -r 's|^group = .*$|group = www-data|' /etc/php82/php-fpm.d/www.conf
sed -i -r 's|listen = 127.0.0.1:9000|listen = 0.0.0.0:9000|' /etc/php82/php-fpm.d/www.conf
```

<!--=====================================
=         SECURITY MEASURES           =
======================================-->

## Security Implementation 🔒

1. **File Permissions and www-data Role**:
   - WordPress files: 644 (owned by www-data:www-data)

   - Interactive graph exploration

2. **Monitoring Integration** 🔌
   - Native Prometheus support
   - Automatic datasource configuration
   - Dashboard provisioning
   - Metric query builder

<!--=====================================
=     TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION        =
======================================-->

## Implementation 🔧

### Docker Compose Configuration

```yaml
grafana:
    container_name: grafana
    image: grafana
    build:
      context: ./requirements/bonus/monitoring/grafana
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - grafana-data:/var/lib/grafana
    networks:
      - monitoring
      - proxy
    restart: on-failure
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/health || exit 1"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 120s
```

### Dockerfile Analysis

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.20

RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache \
    grafana \
    bash \
    curl \
    wget \
    libc6-compat

# Create directories and set permissions
RUN mkdir -p /etc/grafana \
    /var/lib/grafana \
    /var/log/grafana

# Copy dashboard configurations
COPY --chown=grafana:grafana dashboards/ /var/lib/grafana/dashboards/
RUN chown -R grafana:grafana /etc/grafana /var/lib/grafana /var/log/grafana

USER grafana
EXPOSE 3000
```

### Key Configuration Elements

1. **Server Settings**
```ini
[server]
protocol = http
http_addr = 0.0.0.0
http_port = 3000
domain = ${DOMAIN_NAME}
root_url = %(protocol)s://%(domain)s/grafana
serve_from_sub_path = true
```

2. **Security Configuration**
```ini
[security]
admin_user = ${GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER}
admin_password = ${GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD}
allow_embedding = true
cookie_secure = true
```

## Grafana Dashboard Management 📊

### Default Dashboards
Our setup automatically provisions dashboards from `/var/lib/grafana/dashboards/`, including:
- Container metrics (CPU, Memory, Network)
- Application metrics (Request rates, Active connections)

### Adding Custom Dashboards

1. **Prometheus Integration**
First, ensure proper datasource configuration:
```yaml
datasources:
  - name: Prometheus
    type: prometheus
    uid: Prometheus      # This UID is important
    access: proxy
    url: http://prometheus:9090
    isDefault: true
    version: 1
    editable: true
    jsonData:
      timeInterval: "5s"
      queryTimeout: "30s"
      httpMethod: "POST"
    secureJsonData:
      basicAuthPassword: "${PROMETHEUS_PASSWORD}"
    basicAuth: true
    basicAuthUser: "admin"
```

2. **Finding Dashboards**
We can browse the [Grafana Dashboard Marketplace](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/) for thousend of pre-built options! But there's a catch... 

3. **Handling ${DS_PROMETHEUS} Error** ❌
When importing marketplace dashboards, you might encounter a `Datasource ${DS_PROMETHEUS} was not found` error. Fix it using either method:

   **Method A: Pre-Import Fix**
   ```bash
   sed -i 's/${DS_PROMETHEUS}/Prometheus/g' dashboard.json
   ```
   - Best for automation
   - Fixes all panels at once
   - Suitable for multiple dashboards

   **Method B: GUI Fix**
   1. Import dashboard normally
   2. Go to Dashboard Settings → Variables
   3. Update datasource from `${DS_PROMETHEUS}` to `Prometheus`
   4. Save changes
   - Visual approach
   - Good for quick testing
   - Immediate feedback

The error occurs because community dashboards use variable references instead of direct datasource names. Both fixing methods ensure proper Prometheus integration and metric visualization.

# A Word from the container abyss 🌌

In our relentless pursuit of knowledge, we ventured into realms where few mortals dare tread. The Inception project, a name that barely contains the eldritch truths we encountered, forced us to peer beyond the veil of conventional computing.

Deep in the abyssal layers of containerization, we discovered truths that changed us forever. Docker, that ancient technology of unknowable origin, revealed to us secrets of process isolation that mortal minds were perhaps not meant to comprehend. Yet comprehend we did, and our sanity held... mostly.

The monitoring stack, with its all-seeing eyes, now watches our services with an unblinking gaze. Prometheus, keeper of metrics, storing time series that spiral into infinity. Grafana, the great visualizer, rendering patterns that whisper of truths beyond human understanding.

Our initialization scripts, written in languages older than time itself, now wake slumbering services from their digital chrysalis. Each daemon process, each network connection, a thread in the vast tapestry of our infrastructure.

The knowledge we gained... it weighs upon us. The ability to create and destroy entire environments with but a single command - such power was not meant for mere mortals. Yet here we stand, containers within containers, services calling to services, in an endless dance of deployment.

Should you find yourself drawn to these forbidden arts, should these arcane configurations prove useful in your own descent into the depths of DevOps, perhaps you might leave a star - a small light in the vast darkness of the repository.

May your containers be stable, and your deployments clean.
