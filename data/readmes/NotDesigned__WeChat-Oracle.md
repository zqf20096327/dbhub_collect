# WeChat Oracle

Local-first WeChat group archive and agent assistant.

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

WeChat Oracle records WeChat group messages through [WeFlow](https://github.com/hicccc77/WeFlow), stores them in SQLite, optionally OCRs images and transcribes voice messages locally, and lets an LLM-backed bot answer questions inside the group. The bot can also maintain long-term per-group memory in the background.

The project is designed for a personal Windows machine running WeChat PC. Message data, media, memory, and debug logs stay under `data/` unless you explicitly send content to an LLM or vision provider.

## What It Does

- Ingests live WeChat messages from WeFlow SSE into SQLite.
- Imports historical WeFlow JSON exports.
- Stores normalized messages, forwarded-message children, media paths, OCR/ASR transcripts, command runs, agent memory, and audit traces.
- Answers in group chat through wx4py UI automation.
- Supports slash commands such as `/find`, `/sum`, `/recent`, `/ask`, `/explain`, and `/balance`.
- Supports free-form agent chat when directly mentioned, replied to, or probability-triggered.
- Supports Local Ask from the terminal UI or CLI: ask the bot about one selected group without sending anything to WeChat.
- Runs a silent `lurk` learning path that updates `group_memory` / `persona_drift` without sending group messages.
- Can use either the native in-process tool loop or an OpenClaw-backed runtime for agent turns.

## Architecture

   |                         optional local worker
   | SSE live messages       OCR / ASR

   |
   +--> dispatcher --> LLM / agent backend --> wx4py reply to WeChat
   |
   +--> local ask  --> LLM / agent backend --> terminal UI only
   |
   +--> agent lurk --> memory writes only, no reply
```

Production can be started with one supervisor command:

```powershell
uv run wechat-oracle run
```

`run` starts `ingest live` and `dispatcher` together. `ingest live` starts the SSE subscriber and an embedded mm worker thread. `dispatcher` polls SQLite, processes explicit commands and agent triggers with per-group ordering and cross-group parallelism, and serializes all wx4py sends through one sender thread so only one GUI operation touches WeChat at a time.

By default `run` opens a Textual terminal UI: the top area stays fixed with bot configuration, selected Local Ask group, and process status, while the rest of the screen scrolls live logs from both child processes. Press `a` to open a one-shot Local Ask dialog, or `c` to edit the agent backend/model, probability wakeup, and reply mention policy. Saving the config writes `.env` and restarts the dispatcher so group replies use the new settings. Use `uv run wechat-oracle run --plain` to disable the TUI and let child processes write directly to the terminal.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11.
- WeChat PC 4.1.8.107, Qt version, is the recommended runtime for wx4py replies. Newer 4.1.10.x clients may break UI control.
- [WeFlow desktop](https://github.com/hicccc77/WeFlow) with HTTP API enabled. This project does not install WeFlow for you; install and start it first, then copy the HTTP API access token into `WO_WEFLOW_TOKEN`.
- Python 3.12+.
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
- An OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint, or OpenClaw local gateway for `WO_AGENT_BACKEND=openclaw`.

Non-reply workflows such as DB initialization, historical import, status checks, and WeFlow diagnostics can run without wx4py. Sending replies requires WeChat's main window to be visible, not minimized to tray.

## Quick Start

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/WeChat-Oracle.git
cd WeChat-Oracle
uv sync
uv run wechat-oracle setup
uv run wechat-oracle doctor
uv run wechat-oracle run
```

`setup` writes a minimal `.env`, `doctor` checks the database, WeFlow, the selected agent backend, and the reply path, and `run` starts live ingest plus dispatcher with a small terminal UI. On Windows you can also double-click `scripts\run.bat` after setup.

Before running `setup`, install and start WeFlow, open its settings, enable the HTTP API service, and copy the access token when prompted.

For manual setup, create `.env` in the repository root. Start with the common settings:

```env
# WeFlow
WO_WEFLOW_TOKEN=<weflow-token>
WO_GROUPS=

# Bot identity in the target group
WO_BOT_NAME=<bot-group-nickname>
# Optional. Set manually if quote-replying to the bot does not trigger.
# WO_BOT_WXID=wxid_xxx

# Reply path
WO_REPLY=True
WO_REPLY_BACKEND=wx4py
WO_REPLY_MENTION_POLICY=explicit

# Optional agent tuning
WO_AGENT_BASE_PROBABILITY=0.25
WO_AGENT_PROACTIVE_MODE=reactive
WO_AGENT_CONTINUATION_ENABLED=True
WO_AGENT_CONTINUATION_MAX_FOLLOWUPS=2
WO_AGENT_CONTINUATION_DELAY_SECONDS=90
WO_AGENT_CONTINUATION_TTL_SECONDS=600
WO_AGENT_RECENT_CONTEXT_CHAT=100
WO_LLM_MAX_TOKENS=5000
WO_LLM_WRITE_MAX_TOKENS=10000

# Optional image reading
WO_VISION_API_KEY=
WO_VISION_ENDPOINT=https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
WO_VISION_MODEL=qwen-vl-plus
WO_VISION_MAX_IMAGES=3
WO_VISION_MAX_TOKENS=800

# Optional background learning
WO_AGENT_LURK_ENABLED=False
WO_AGENT_LURK_INTERVAL_SECONDS=1800
WO_AGENT_LURK_MIN_NEW_MESSAGES=20
```

`WO_BOT_NAME` and `WO_BOT_WXID` identify different things. `WO_BOT_NAME` is the nickname used to detect real `@<bot>` mentions in the group. `WO_BOT_WXID` is the bot account's own wxid and is only needed for the reply-to-bot trigger. The dispatcher auto-discovers it from stored bot messages when possible; set it manually if quote-replying to the bot does not wake the agent.

Then choose one agent backend.

Option A: use an ordinary OpenAI-compatible API directly:

```env
WO_AGENT_BACKEND=native
WO_LLM_API_KEY=<api-key>
WO_LLM_ENDPOINT=https://api.deepseek.com
WO_LLM_MODEL=deepseek-v4-pro
```

Option B: use OpenClaw as the agent runtime:

```env
WO_AGENT_BACKEND=openclaw
WO_OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18789
WO_OPENCLAW_TOKEN=<gateway-token>
WO_OPENCLAW_AGENT_ID=<your-agent-id>
WO_OPENCLAW_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300
```

Then either run both processes through the supervisor:

```powershell
uv run wechat-oracle run
```

Or run them manually in two terminals:

```powershell
# Terminal 1: live ingest + OCR/ASR worker
uv run wechat-oracle ingest live

# Terminal 2: command/agent dispatcher
uv run wechat-oracle dispatcher
```

In a watched group:

```text
@<bot-name> /help
@<bot-name> Who mentioned stocks today?
@<bot-name> /find since:2026-05 about home renovation
```

If `WO_GROUPS` is empty, live ingest monitors every group chat currently exposed by WeFlow sessions. You can also set `WO_GROUPS` to a comma-separated list of group names, remarks, or wxids.

## Core Commands

General CLI:

```powershell
uv run wechat-oracle setup
uv run wechat-oracle doctor
uv run wechat-oracle run
uv run wechat-oracle init-db
uv run wechat-oracle status
uv run wechat-oracle ingest live
uv run wechat-oracle ingest backfill <export.json> --format weflow
uv run wechat-oracle dispatcher
uv run wechat-oracle worker mm
```

WeFlow diagnostics:

```powershell
uv run wechat-oracle weflow find <group-name-or-wxid-fragment>
uv run wechat-oracle weflow sessions --groups-only
```

Agent state:

```powershell
uv run wechat-oracle agent show <group_id>
uv run wechat-oracle agent show-runs <group_id> -n 10
uv run wechat-oracle agent ask <group_id-or-name> summarize today
uv run wechat-oracle agent ask <group_id-or-name> update memory from this topic --write
uv run wechat-oracle agent lurk <group_id>
uv run wechat-oracle agent wipe <group_id>
uv run wechat-oracle agent wipe <group_id> --persona-only
uv run wechat-oracle agent wipe <group_id> --memory-only -y
```

Health checks:

```powershell
uv run wechat-oracle verify roundtrip
```

OpenClaw runtime helpers:

```powershell
uv run wechat-oracle openclaw ping
uv run wechat-oracle openclaw mcp-test
uv run wechat-oracle openclaw mcp-serve
```

`openclaw mcp-serve` is a stdio MCP server entrypoint intended to be spawned by OpenClaw. `openclaw ping` tests the configured OpenClaw chat-completions gateway.

Convenience wrappers:

```powershell
scripts\run.bat
scripts\track.bat
scripts\import.bat <export.json>
```

`scripts\run.bat` starts `wechat-oracle run`. `scripts\track.bat` is the lower-level live-ingest-only wrapper kept for debugging.

## Historical Backfill

Backfill imports historical WeFlow exports into the same SQLite archive used by live ingest:

```powershell
uv run wechat-oracle ingest backfill <export.json> --format weflow
uv run wechat-oracle ingest backfill <weflow-export-dir> --format weflow
```

The command imports one export file, or all JSON files under a WeFlow export directory's `texts/` folder. Re-running the same file or directory is safe: all imported messages go through `ingest/writer.py:write_messages()`, and `UNIQUE(dedupe_key)` skips duplicates.

Supported formats:

| Format | Input |
|---|---|
| `weflow` | WeFlow JSON export with top-level `session` and `messages` fields, or a WeFlow export directory containing `texts/`. |
| `jsonl` | One canonical `Message` JSON object per line, mainly useful for pipeline tests or custom importers. |

For WeFlow exports, the importer:

- Derives `group_id` from `session.wxid`, falling back to the filename stem.
- Derives `group_name` from `session.displayName`, `session.nickname`, or `session.remark`.
- Converts WeFlow `localType` values into normalized message types: text, image, voice, video, sticker, link, quote, forward, and system.
- Preserves quote replies using `reply_to_wx_msg_id` and `quote_text`.
- Parses merged-forward messages into `forwarded_records`, so `/find`, `/sum`, and agent history tools can search inside forwarded bundles. Forwarded child media gets its own `media_path` when WeFlow/export XML exposes a local file, or when `src_msg_id` matches an already archived media message.
- Copies referenced local media files from the export folder into `data/media/<group_id>/<kind>/` and stores a `data/`-relative `media_path`.

If a media file referenced by the export is missing, the message is still imported with a missing-media placeholder. OCR/ASR can only run for media files that exist under `data/media`.

Backfilled rows use `source='backfill'`. The dispatcher only wakes on new `source='live'` rows, so importing old messages will not make the bot reply to historical mentions. Backfilled messages are still available to `/find`, `/sum`, `/recent`, agent history search, and manual or automatic `lurk` learning.

## In-Group Commands

The dispatcher accepts explicit slash commands either as `@<bot> /cmd ...` or as a standalone `/cmd ...` group message.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/find [from:<person>\|@<person>] [since:YYYY[-MM[-DD]]] <query>` | Semantic search over the current group archive. |
| `/sum [from:<person>\|@<person>] [since:YYYY[-MM[-DD]]] [limit:N] [topic]` | Summarize current-group messages. |
| `/recent [N]` | Show recent ingested messages without calling an LLM. |
| `/ask <question>` | Lightweight LLM call with no group-history context. |
| `/explain [text]` | Explain quoted message or supplied text. |
| `/balance` | Query the configured DeepSeek-compatible balance endpoint. |
| `/help [command]` | Show command help. |

Examples:

```text
@Assistant /find from:Alice since:2026-05 about home renovation
@Assistant /sum limit:100 what did people discuss last night?
@Assistant /recent 20
@Assistant /ask What is SQLite WAL?
Reply to an image and send: @Assistant /explain
```

## Agent Behavior

There are four separate runtime paths.

### 1. Collection Path

`ingest live`, `ingest backfill`, and `worker mm` only write normalized data to SQLite. They do not decide whether the bot should speak.

### 2. Interaction Path

The dispatcher classifies each new live message:

| Trigger | Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `mention` | Text contains a real `@<WO_BOT_NAME>` mention. | Always wakes the bot. Slash commands are parsed; bare text enters agent chat. |
| `reply` | Message quote-replies to a prior bot message, and `WO_BOT_WXID` is known or auto-discovered. | Always wakes the bot. |
| `probability` | Not mention/reply, `WO_AGENT_PROACTIVE_MODE` is not `off`, and the message passes type gate, random threshold, and cooldown. | Agent decides whether to speak or `stay_silent`, following the configured participation posture. |
| none | No trigger. | No LLM call; message is finalized as no-trigger. |

Direct mention and reply-to-bot triggers run the agent directly. The bot sends a group reply only if the agent returns a non-empty response.

`WO_REPLY_MENTION_POLICY` controls whether outgoing group replies notify a member:

- `always`: every group reply attempts a real `@requester`.
- `explicit`: the default. Direct mentions, reply-to-bot turns, slash commands, and command errors `@` the requester; `probability` / `proactive` ambient replies do not.
- `never`: send plain group messages without `@`.

`WO_AGENT_PROACTIVE_MODE` controls only non-explicit probability wakeups:

- `off`: never wake from ambient chat; only direct mentions, reply-to-bot, and slash commands run the agent.
- `reactive`: the default. A probability wakeup may join the current topic only when it has useful context.
- `proactive`: a probability wakeup may also ask one short context-based question, connect an old thread, or start a light related topic when the timing is appropriate.

Continuation follow-ups are separate from probability. When `WO_AGENT_CONTINUATION_ENABLED=True`, the agent may call `schedule_followup` while replying. The system stores only an intent and reruns the agent later with fresh context:

- `committed`: the bot explicitly promised to come back, so the follow-up can run even if nobody speaks meanwhile.
- `thread`: the bot may continue only if new non-bot messages keep the same topic moving; otherwise the job is cancelled.

Follow-ups use the same per-group dispatcher queue and serialized wx4py sender as normal replies. They respect `WO_AGENT_CONTINUATION_MAX_FOLLOWUPS`, `WO_AGENT_CONTINUATION_DELAY_SECONDS`, `WO_AGENT_CONTINUATION_TTL_SECONDS`, and `WO_REPLY_MENTION_POLICY`.

The native agent has two phases:

- Phase A reads recent context, may call read-only tools, and returns either a chat reply or `stay_silent`.
- Phase B sees the Phase A trace and may update `group_memory` or `persona_drift`.

Phase A initial context includes the latest `WO_AGENT_RECENT_CONTEXT_CHAT` messages from the current group. Tools can search older history, expand quote chains, expand forwarded bundles, read OCR/ASR text, read images through a vision model, read voice transcripts, or read group memory.

### 3. Local Ask Path

The Textual UI and CLI can run an agent turn against a selected group without sending anything to WeChat.

```powershell
uv run wechat-oracle agent ask <group_id-or-name> summarize today's discussion
uv run wechat-oracle agent ask <group_id-or-name> summarize Alice in August 2024 and update memory --write
```

In the TUI, use keyboard shortcuts:

```text
g  open group picker
a  open Local Ask dialog for the selected group
m  edit group_memory / persona_drift for the selected group
c  edit agent backend / native model / OpenClaw agent id / probability wakeup / @ policy, then restart dispatcher
w  toggle read-only/write mode
```

Local Ask defaults to read-only: it may read recent context, search history, inspect media, and read group memory, but it will not update `group_memory` / `persona_drift`. Use `--write` in the CLI or press `w` in the TUI to run a `local_task` that may update memory. Local Ask writes an `agent_run_log` audit row with `trigger_kind='local_ask'` or `trigger_kind='local_task'`; it never writes `command_runs` and never calls wx4py.

### 4. Background Learning Path

`agent lurk <group_id>` and optional auto-lurk read a watermarked batch of new messages and update memory without replying.

- First run reads the latest `WO_AGENT_LURK_RECENT_MSGS` messages.
- Later runs continue from `agent_lurk_state.last_msg_id`.
- The lurk agent may call history tools to inspect older messages when the new batch points to prior context.
- It writes only stable, reusable knowledge to `group_memory` or long-term behavior adjustments to `persona_drift`.
- It never calls wx4py and never sends an acknowledgement.

Enable automatic lurk inside dispatcher with:

```env
WO_AGENT_LURK_ENABLED=True
WO_AGENT_LURK_INTERVAL_SECONDS=1800
WO_AGENT_LURK_MIN_NEW_MESSAGES=20
```

Auto-lurk uses a separate single worker, so it does not occupy chat response workers.

## Agent Backends

`WO_AGENT_BACKEND=native` is the default. It runs the tool-calling loop inside this process through your OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint.

`WO_AGENT_BACKEND=openclaw` delegates chat and lurk turns to an OpenClaw agent through a local OpenAI-compatible gateway. OpenClaw can use the project's MCP server to call WeChat-Oracle tools. This is useful if your production bot should use an existing subscription-backed agent runtime.

Switching between the two modes is controlled by one setting:

```env
# Use the ordinary OpenAI-compatible API directly.
WO_AGENT_BACKEND=native

# Or use OpenClaw as the agent runtime.
WO_AGENT_BACKEND=openclaw
```

Important distinction: OpenClaw here is an agent runtime backend, not a WeChat reply backend. Group replies still go through wx4py or `stdout`.

OpenClaw-related settings:

```env
WO_AGENT_BACKEND=openclaw
WO_OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18789
WO_OPENCLAW_TOKEN=<gateway-token>
WO_OPENCLAW_AGENT_ID=<your-agent-id>
WO_OPENCLAW_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300
```

## Real WeChat Mentions

`Wx4pyReplier` attempts to create a real WeChat group mention token by opening the group, typing `@`, selecting the requester from WeChat's candidate popup, then pasting the reply body. If the candidate cannot be detected, it falls back to plain text `@name` and logs a warning.

This path is used only when `WO_REPLY_MENTION_POLICY` says the current reply should mention someone.

This is intentionally serialized through `_SerialReplier`; multiple worker threads never manipulate the WeChat GUI at the same time.

## Multimedia

The mm worker fills `messages.transcript`:

- Images and stickers: local OCR through `rapidocr-onnxruntime`.
- Voice: local ASR through `faster-whisper`.

Transcript states:

- `NULL`: not processed yet.
- `''`: processed but no text recognized.
- non-empty text: usable OCR/ASR result.

If `WO_VISION_API_KEY` is configured, agent chat and `/explain` / `/ask` can send referenced images to a vision model for direct reading. Without it, native image handling falls back to OCR text and placeholders. In OpenClaw mode, MCP also exposes `load_image`, which returns the original image block for a vision-capable OpenClaw agent to inspect directly; `read_image` still means "return a textual vision-model reading".

## Data Model

For the full ingestion contract, including WeFlow `localType` handling, app-message subtypes, media storage, quote/forward normalization, and LLM-visible rendering, see [docs/message-model.md](docs/message-model.md).

Key tables:

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `messages` | Normalized WeChat messages. |
| `forwarded_records` | Children inside merged-forward messages. |
| `command_runs` | Dispatcher idempotency and command status. |
| `group_state` | Live/backfill per-group cursors. |
| `persona_drift` | Per-group evolvable behavior supplement. |
| `group_memory` | Per-group freeform long-term memory document. |
| `agent_run_log` | Agent audit traces for chat, lurk, and Local Ask turns. |
| `agent_lurk_state` | Lurk cursor, separate from audit logs. |
| `agent_proactive_outbox` | Delayed proactive continuation jobs. Stores intent, not pre-generated reply text. |

All write paths for imported messages go through `ingest/writer.py:write_messages()` and rely on `UNIQUE(dedupe_key)` for cross-source deduplication.

`group_memory` and `persona_drift` are replace-on-write. Write tools force the agent to read current state before writing, and they check that state did not change in between. If another concurrent agent run updated memory first, the tool asks the model to re-read and merge.

`WO_WHISPER_MODEL` is read directly by the mm worker and defaults to `small`; accepted values depend on faster-whisper, commonly `tiny`, `base`, `small`, `medium`, and `large-v3`.

## Logs and Debugging

- `data/dispatcher.log`: compact human-readable command and agent traces.
- `data/llm_debug.log`: LLM prompts, raw replies, parsed results, and full traces.
- `data/events.jsonl`: lightweight machine-readable lifecycle events for ingest batches, trigger decisions, command/agent runs, native tool calls, memory writes, and reply attempts. Use this to answer operational questions such as "why did this message trigger?" or "where did the latency go?" without reading full prompts.
- `data/*.process.log`: rotating loguru process logs for long-running processes such as `live` and `dispatcher`.
- `data/openclaw.log` / `data/mcp.log`: JSONL audit logs for OpenClaw gateway calls and MCP tool invocations.
- `wx4py_send_audit.jsonl`: wx4py send audit records when wx4py emits them.

Useful checks:

```powershell
uv run wechat-oracle status
uv run wechat-oracle verify roundtrip
uv run wechat-oracle agent show-runs <group_id> -n 20
```

`verify roundtrip` confirms whether WeFlow echoes the bot's own wx4py-sent messages back into `messages`. That echo is required for bot wxid auto-discovery and reply-to-bot triggers.

## Known Limits

- wx4py depends on a visible Windows desktop and WeChat Qt UI. It is not an official WeChat API.
- Group reply delivery is implemented only through `wx4py` or local `stdout`.
- OpenClaw is supported as an agent runtime backend, not as a group-message reply backend.
- If WeFlow does not expose historical media files, old images/voices imported by backfill cannot be OCRed/transcribed until you provide media.
- Video content is stored as metadata/path only; video understanding is not implemented.
- Deduplication is best-effort when WeFlow lacks `wx_msg_id`.
