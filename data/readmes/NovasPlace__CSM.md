> AgentBook is not a replacement for Git. Git versions files; AgentBook versions the intent, evidence, decisions, tests, and recovery state behind agent work. Cross-Session Memory (CSM) is the runtime underneath it.

## Why CSM exists

Coding agents are effective inside one context window and unreliable across many of them. Important decisions disappear into old transcripts, project state drifts, mistakes repeat, and every fresh session spends tokens rebuilding a partial understanding of the work.

CSM turns continuity into infrastructure.

## Version control for agent work

AgentBook combines the workspace truth already held by Git with CSM's append-only events,
checkpoints, goals, provenance, and re-entry compiler:

| AgentBook operation | Current implementation |
|---|---|
| Status | Git workspace identity plus AgentBook state, goals, events, and unresolved work |
| Checkpoint | Durable session summary with source references, files, tests, risks, and next steps |
| Log | Append-only AgentBook events and bounded summaries |
| Resume | Project-scoped re-entry, active checkpoint, context cache, and handoff state |
| Branch and compare | Git branches/worktrees for files; AgentBook records each attempt's goal, evidence, tests, and decision |
| Game iteration | Baseline → one-variable change → playtest evidence → keep/revert → checkpoint |

Native content-addressed checkpoint DAGs, semantic merge, blame, and bisect are future work. The
current product uses Git for file authority instead of pretending CSM has already replaced it.

| Failure mode | CSM response |
|---|---|
| Fresh-session amnesia | Turn-1 AgentBook state and structured re-entry |
| Long-session context pressure | Compaction, context budgeting, checkpoints, and cached context |
| Repeated mistakes | Durable lessons, experience packets, and failure evidence |
| Weak retrieval | Hybrid vector, full-text, entity, type, tag, and importance signals |
| Unverifiable memory | Provenance, quality scoring, governance reports, and source attribution |
| Project-state drift | Append-only operational events, rolling summaries, and current-state projection |
| Storage lock-in | Full PostgreSQL path plus a local SQLite core mode |

## At a glance

| Surface | Current implementation |
|---|---|
| Runtime tools | Up to **50** registered tool surfaces in the full PostgreSQL path |
| Persistence | PostgreSQL 14/16 and SQLite core mode |
| Verification | More than **1,500 automated tests**, type checking, lint gates, CI matrix, and backup/restore drill |
| Session continuity | AgentBook front page plus layered re-entry and onboarding |
| Recall | Vector, text, entity, relationship, and fallback retrieval paths |
| Internal state | Experience packets, self-model, belief knowledge, and advisory context |
| Governance | Deduplication, merge/supersede, archive candidates, quality reports, and continuity health |
| Host | OpenCode plugin, a native Claude Code plugin (hooks + MCP tools + slash commands + subagents + skills), and a packaged Codex MCP command / installable Codex plugin |

## Capability map

| System | What it provides |
|---|---|
| **Memory engine** | Durable memories, lessons, transcripts, hybrid search, related-memory traversal, distillation, and embedding backfill |
| **AgentBook** | Append-only project events, rolling summaries, explicit rules, current-state projection, and a turn-1 front page |
| **Re-entry and onboarding** | Identity, project state, constraints, goals, checkpoints, relevant memories, advisories, and source-aware injection |
| **Context control** | Token-pressure measurement, compaction, context cache, selective fetch, checkpoints, and recovery surfaces |
| **Living State** | Experience packets, capability confidence, belief candidates, promoted knowledge, and preview/debug tools |
| **Governance** | Recall-quality scoring, provenance checks, duplicate detection, safe merge, archive candidates, and continuity reports |
| **Work continuity** | Goals, checkpoints, decision/error retrieval, work-ledger survival, causal stitching, and session handoff |
| **Auto-documentation** | Project-scoped architecture, decisions, changelog, runbook, system-map, debug, and memory artifacts |
| **Storage layer** | PostgreSQL for the complete feature set; SQLite for a zero-service local core |

The complete subsystem and tool inventory is in [docs/FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md).

## How continuity flows

```mermaid

    A[OpenCode agent] --> H[Hooks and tool surface]

    H --> AB[AgentBook]

    H --> LS[Living State]

    AB --> FP[AGENTBOOK_STATE.md]

```

The architecture is intentionally layered:

- **AgentBook** answers: “What is happening in this project right now?”
- **Memory** answers: “What has been learned across sessions?”
- **Re-entry** answers: “What does this agent need before it acts?”
- **Governance** answers: “Why should this information be trusted?”
- **Context control** answers: “What should remain active, cached, compacted, or fetched later?”

See [docs/PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md) for the runtime boundaries and data paths.

## Major systems

### AgentBook: operational continuity

AgentBook records meaningful tool and session events in an append-only journal, summarizes them in bounded ranges, projects an authoritative current state, and writes a markdown front page for cold-start recovery.

- Tool events are classified by their actual operation.
- Failures retain error and exit-code evidence.
- File operations retain path evidence.
- Rules support project, session, and global scopes with explicit override behavior.
- `AGENTBOOK_STATE.md` is read at startup through `opencode.json`, before plugin hooks need to run.

### Durable memory and recall

CSM stores conversations, project facts, preferences, lessons, episodic evidence, procedures, and continuity records.

Recall combines:

- vector similarity
- full-text search
- entity boosting
- memory type, tag, and importance filters
- relationship traversal
- text-only and vector-only fallback paths

Maintenance tools support embedding backfill, exact duplicate detection, safe merge/supersede, archive candidates, and governance reporting.

### Re-entry and onboarding

A fresh agent can receive a structured continuity block containing:

- identity and self-continuity
- active project and phase
- current goal and checkpoint
- constraints and operating rules
- relevant memories and decisions
- promoted beliefs and advisories
- handoff state and readiness summary
- source attribution and provenance

The compiler applies priority-aware trimming rather than blindly injecting every available record.

### Context control

CSM treats the context window as a managed resource.

- compaction with audit telemetry
- token-bucket and pressure analysis
- persistent context cache and manifest
- selective file-region, decision, and error retrieval
- checkpoints and checkpoint references
- source-only re-entry guards
- goal-aware system transformation
- causal stitching across sessions

### Living State

The Living State layer records structured experience and derives revisable internal state.

- experience packets for successes, failures, milestones, decisions, and observations
- per-capability confidence with success/failure reconciliation
- belief candidates and evidence-backed knowledge
- controlled promotion into durable memory
- advisory preview and debug surfaces
- explicit preview and enablement gates for higher-risk behavior

### Governance and trust

Memory is useful only when its limits are visible.

CSM includes:

- append-only evidence where history matters
- provenance and source attribution
- direct, inferred, and gap evidence distinctions
- recall-quality scoring
- duplicate and archive-candidate reports
- non-destructive merge/supersede behavior
- continuity resilience reporting
- database migration ledgers
- PostgreSQL matrix verification and backup/restore drills

## Quick start

Runtime requirement: Node.js `^22.22.2`, `^24.15.0`, or `>=26.0.0`.

### 1. Configure the project

Create a `.env` in the project where the agent host will run. SQLite is the smallest local setup:

```dotenv
CSM_DATABASE_PROVIDER=sqlite
CSM_SQLITE_PATH=.data/csm-memory.db
CSM_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434
```

For the complete feature path, use PostgreSQL instead:

```dotenv
CSM_DATABASE_PROVIDER=postgres
CSM_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://csm_user:replace-me@localhost:5432/csm
CSM_REQUIRE_EXPLICIT_DATABASE_URL=true
CSM_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434
```

Use `CSM_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai` with `OPENAI_API_KEY` if OpenAI embeddings are preferred. Never commit `.env`.

### 2. Initialize storage

```bash
npx --yes --package=opencode-cross-session-memory@1.0.0 csm-init
```

This applies the versioned schema safely and can be rerun during an upgrade. Back up production storage before upgrading.

<details>
<summary>No npm package? Use a source checkout instead</summary>

If the npm package is not yet available or you prefer to build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NovasPlace/CSM.git
cd CSM
npm ci
npm run build
node dist/cli/init-db.js
node dist/cli/doctor.js --online
```

</details>

### 3. Verify before first use

```bash
npx --yes --package=opencode-cross-session-memory@1.0.0 csm-doctor --online
```

Doctor checks the package, Node runtime, strict configuration, security baseline, database, complete migration history, and configured embedding model. It never includes credentials or memory content in its report. See [CSM Doctor and Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for JSON output and common fixes.

### 4. Connect an agent host

For OpenCode, add the pinned package and turn-1 continuity file to `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "instructions": ["AGENTS.md", "AGENTBOOK_STATE.md"],
  "plugin": [["opencode-cross-session-memory@1.0.0", {}]]
}
```

For Codex, add the packaged MCP command to project `.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.cross_session_memory]
command = "npx"
args = ["--yes", "--package=opencode-cross-session-memory@1.0.0", "csm-mcp"]
cwd = "."
startup_timeout_sec = 30
tool_timeout_sec = 120
required = true
default_tools_approval_mode = "writes"
```

The Codex MCP bridge exposes explicit memory, context, lesson, checkpoint, and handoff tools; it does
not receive OpenCode's automatic lifecycle hooks. See [Codex Installation](docs/CODEX_INSTALLATION.md)
for live verification and the PostgreSQL-only marketplace-plugin option.

For Claude Code, install the native plugin — it wires the full CSM runtime into Claude's own
lifecycle hooks, MCP tools, slash commands, subagents, and skills:

```
/plugin marketplace add <repo>/.agents/plugins
/plugin install cross-session-memory
```

See [Claude Code Installation](docs/CLAUDE_INSTALLATION.md) for build, configuration, verification,
and concurrent-host isolation details.

Pin the package version so an upgrade is an intentional, testable change.

### 5. Start a fresh task

Start the configured host in the project. OpenCode creates and updates `AGENTBOOK_STATE.md` as
activity is captured. In Codex, verify `csm_runtime_status`, then explicitly request a context brief
or memory operation for the current project before normal work begins.

### Source checkout for contributors

The package entrypoint is `dist/index.js`. For local development rather than a packaged install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NovasPlace/CSM.git
cd CSM
npm ci
npm run build
npm run db:setup
npm run doctor -- --online
```

Maintainers can run the complete release gate with:

```bash
npm run verify:release
```

## Database modes

| Capability | PostgreSQL | SQLite |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Core save, search, list, delete, lessons, and transcripts | Yes | Yes |
| AgentBook events, state, summaries, and rules | Yes | Yes |
| Runtime status and local continuity basics | Yes | Yes |
| Vector backfill and advanced maintenance | Yes | No |
| Belief promotion and Living State analysis | Yes | No |
| Recall-quality and continuity resilience reports | Yes | No |
| Context cache, checkpoints, goals, and advanced review tools | Yes | No |
| Enterprise backup/restore verification | Yes | No |

SQLite is deliberately a smaller local mode. PostgreSQL is the target when the entire continuity stack is required.

## Tool surface

The full PostgreSQL runtime can register up to 50 tools across six groups:

| Group | Count | Examples |
|---|---:|---|
| Memory and governance | 19 | `csm_memory_search`, `csm_memory_lesson`, `csm_memory_merge`, `csm_memory_governance_report` |
| Living State | 8 | `csm_belief_scan`, `csm_belief_promote`, `csm_self_model`, `csm_living_state_preview` |
| AgentBook | 3 | `csm_agentbook_events`, `csm_agentbook_state`, `csm_agentbook_rule` |
| Continuity and runtime | 7 | `csm_onboard_agent`, `csm_reentry_preview`, `csm_continuity_report`, `csm_runtime_status` |
| Checkpoints and goals | 6 | `create_checkpoint`, `expand_checkpoint_ref`, `goal_set`, `goal_list` |
| Context cache and review | 7 | `context_search`, `context_fetch_file_region`, `context_fetch_last_error`, `context_fault` |

Some tools are conditional on provider or runtime state. The exact catalog and availability rules are documented in [docs/FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md).

## Configuration

Core environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CSM_DATABASE_PROVIDER` | `postgres` | Select `postgres` or `sqlite` |
| `CSM_DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://localhost/csm` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `CSM_SQLITE_PATH` | — | SQLite database path |
| `CSM_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` | `ollama` | Embedding provider |
| `CSM_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS` | `768` for Ollama, `1536` for OpenAI | Expected vector dimension; changing it requires a schema migration |
| `OLLAMA_HOST` | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama endpoint |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | Required when the OpenAI embedding provider is selected |
| `CSM_REENTRY_PREVIEW_ONLY` | `false` | Preview re-entry instead of injecting it |
| `CSM_BELIEF_PROMOTION_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable controlled belief promotion |

Configuration is loaded from the environment and validated before the runtime starts.

## Development gates

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run lint:src
npm test
npm run drill:backup-restore
```

The source lint gate is locked at zero errors and a bounded warning baseline. Database-sensitive changes should also exercise schema initialization, migration compatibility, and the backup/restore drill.
