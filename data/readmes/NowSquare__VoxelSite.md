# VoxelSite

Open-source AI website builder. Describe your business in plain language and VoxelSite generates a complete, self-hosted website — pages, layout, copy, styling, and forms. Plain PHP and SQLite, no framework, no SaaS, no vendor lock-in. You own every file.

## What's included

- **AI Studio** — a chat-driven interface to create and edit multi-page websites in plain language; every new site starts from a drawn design direction so no two sites come out the same, and an optional design review scores each generation the way a studio would
- **Code Editor** — built-in Monaco editor with file explorer, multi-tab editing, and create/delete
- **Site** — a structural graph of pages, partials, routes, tokens, and assets, with impact analysis, blast-radius queries, page management (rename, change URL, move, delete with automatic reference cleanup), and an AI orchestration console for site-wide changes you review and apply transactionally
- **Visual Editor** — click-to-edit text, swap images, adjust styles, reorder sections, add sections from a picker, and describe changes with AI — all on the live preview
- **Live Preview** — see every change before publishing
- **AI Router** — optional Jev routing selects the model, instructions and site context for each request. Small edits can use a faster model; larger changes use a stronger one
- **Undo/Redo** — revision history for generated edits, including exact text replacements through AI Router
- **Website References** — paste any public URL as design inspiration to create or restyle sites
- **Snapshots** — save and restore entire site states
- **Design Library** — save, compare, and switch between entirely different designs
- **Notes** — a private scratchpad that doubles as AI prompts
- **Board** — a kanban task tracker with cards, drag-and-drop, and linked pages
- **Asset Manager** — upload images, files, and fonts
- **Actions** — define interactions (reservations, signups, inquiries) that serve both human visitors (a form bar with file uploads) and AI agents (MCP tools) at once
- **Forms** — submission handling with validation, spam protection, and email notifications
- **Agent API** — authenticated REST endpoints for external AI agents and automation tools (Zapier, Make.com, n8n) to manage pages, settings, assets, publishing, and prompts
- **Team** — invite editors and viewers with role-based access
- **AEO** — built-in AI discoverability (`llms.txt`, schema, MCP endpoint)

### Supported AI providers

Anthropic Claude (recommended), OpenAI, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. You bring your own key; keys are encrypted at rest.

### AI Router

AI Router uses TypeSafe's Jev model to assess each request, then selects the
writing model, prompt instructions and relevant site context. Small copy edits
can use your **Faster model** with focused context; new pages, layouts and
site-wide changes use your **Stronger model**. Both belong to your selected AI
provider. Questions have a read-only answer path. Exact replacements of a
uniquely selected text element can apply without a writing-model call and support
normal undo.

To enable it, open **Settings → AI Router**, turn **Enable AI Router** on, enter
your TypeSafe key, choose both models and click **Save AI Router**. Off uses your
default model and instructions with no TypeSafe calls. If the key, routing or
model choices are unavailable, the request uses normal editing and reports the
fallback. All editing tools remain available. The TypeSafe key is encrypted and
never returned by settings reads.

Routing applies to Studio and Agent generation requests. It does not check every
manual edit or file sent to publish. TypeSafe remains optional. Live token and
dollar savings have not been verified; the classification call also has a cost.

## What you get

Everything VoxelSite needs to run ships in the repository. Clone it and it runs as-is — no build step, no `composer install`, no Node.js on your server.

| Included | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| PHP source + engine | Plain PHP, custom micro-router — no Laravel or Symfony |
| `vendor/` | Composer dependencies, committed and ready |
| Compiled Studio assets | `_studio/ui/dist/` CSS and JS, pre-built — no Node.js required |
| SQLite database | Created by the installer — no database server to set up |
| Migrations | Applied automatically on every Studio load |

The websites VoxelSite generates are standard HTML, CSS, PHP, and vanilla JavaScript — they keep running even if you delete the Studio.

### Requirements

| Requirement | Minimum |
|-------------|---------|
| PHP | 8.2+ |
| Web server | Apache or LiteSpeed (`.htaccess` included), Nginx, or any PHP host |
| Database | SQLite — bundled with PHP, nothing to install |

**Required PHP extensions:** `pdo_sqlite` `openssl` `json` `curl` `mbstring` `gd` `zip`

Most shared hosts include all of these. The installer's system check confirms every requirement before you continue.

---

## Installation

Three steps: get the files, point your web server at the project, and open the Studio. The first visit launches a short setup wizard that creates your database and configuration for you. Nothing to compile, no config file to edit by hand.

### Step 1 — Get the files

Clone the repository into your web root (a VPS, or any shared host with SSH and Git):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NowSquare/VoxelSite.git .
```

The clone includes `vendor/` and the pre-built Studio assets, so it runs immediately — no `composer install`, no `npm install`.

**No SSH or Git on your host?** Download the latest [release archive](https://github.com/NowSquare/VoxelSite/releases), extract it, and upload the contents with FTP/SFTP or your control panel's file manager. The result is identical.

### Step 2 — Point your web server at the project root

VoxelSite serves from the **project root** — not a `public/` subfolder, because it is not a Laravel app. Put the files in your document root (typically `public_html/`). The bundled `.htaccess` handles clean URLs and protects the Studio, data, and uploads on Apache and LiteSpeed.

On Nginx, add the one-time clean-URL rules from the [installation guide](https://voxelsite.com/docs/getting-started/installation) — there is no `.htaccess` equivalent for Nginx.

Make these directories writable by the web server (`755` or `775`): `_studio/data`, `_studio/preview`, `assets`.

### Step 3 — Open the Studio and run the installer

Open `yourdomain.com/_studio/`. With no configuration yet, VoxelSite takes you straight to the installer — there is no special URL to remember. The wizard takes about a minute:

| Step | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| System check | Verifies your PHP version, required extensions, and writable directories |
| AI provider | Pick a provider and paste your API key (encrypted at rest) |
| Admin account | Creates your Studio login |
| Site name | Names your site and finishes setup |

When it finishes you land in the Studio. Describe the website you want and VoxelSite builds it.

> Your site's root URL returns 403 until your first publish — that is expected. Work in `/_studio/` and publish when you are ready.

---

## Updating

Update from **Studio → Settings**, on two paths.

- **Git updates (recommended for Git installs).** When VoxelSite is a Git checkout, Settings shows a **Git Updates** card. It reports your branch and whether a new version is available, then applies it in one click — it pulls the latest release and runs any pending database migrations. It refuses to run if you have local changes or are ahead of the repository, and never touches your pages, database, settings, or uploads.
- **Release archive (for shared hosting without Git).** Upload the latest [release archive](https://github.com/NowSquare/VoxelSite/releases) from the same Update card, or drop it in `/dist/` via FTP and apply it there. VoxelSite replaces system files only.

Your pages, settings, SQLite database, and uploaded files are preserved on both paths. The full guide, including the shell `git fetch --tags` / `git checkout <tag>` workflow for pinning a version, is in the [Updating documentation](https://voxelsite.com/docs/getting-started/updating).

## Package structure

```
/                   → Your live website (generated by AI)
/_studio/           → Admin Studio, installer, engine, compiled UI
/_partials/         → Shared site partials (header, footer, nav)
/assets/            → CSS, JS, images, fonts, data, forms
/_data/             → Form submissions and uploads (private)
/vendor/            → PHP dependencies (required — do not delete)
```

---

## Demo mode

Show the Studio to others without giving them real access:

1. Create a `.demo` file in the project root: `touch .demo`
2. The login page pre-fills demo credentials (`demo@example.com` / `welcome3210`)
3. The Studio runs in **read-only mode** — write operations (publish, delete, AI generation) are blocked. The preview Actions Bar stays interactive but uses a safe stub that writes no real data
4. A persistent DEMO badge appears in the top bar
5. Your site's root URL serves a complete, styled demo website with an interactive Actions Bar
6. The Designs gallery shows curated, industry-specific landing pages
7. To disable: `rm .demo` (instant, no restart)

**Hide chrome for screenshots:** add `hide_banner=true` to the `.demo` file to suppress the DEMO badge and login chrome while keeping read-only enforcement active.

Demo mode never modifies your live workspace — it reads shipped fixture data. Real owner login still works alongside the demo session.

> The `.demo` file is an installation-wide switch. While it exists, all Studio writes and all `submit.php` form submissions are blocked. If your site is published, unpublish first so the live `index.php` (with demo detection) is restored and live forms keep working.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Root URL returns 403 | Normal before your first publish. Go to `yourdomain.com/_studio/` instead |
| Installer says "Cannot reach server" | **Apache:** enable `mod_rewrite` and `AllowOverride All`. **Any server:** verify PHP 8.2+ runs and `.php` files are processed |
| Blank page / 500 error | Verify PHP 8.2+ is active and the required extensions are installed |
| Permission errors | Make `_studio/data`, `_studio/preview`, and `assets` writable (`755` or `775`) |
| Routes return 404 (Apache) | Enable `mod_rewrite` and `AllowOverride All` |
| Pages show the homepage (Nginx) | Add clean-URL rewriting to your Nginx config — see [Installation → Nginx](https://voxelsite.com/docs/getting-started/installation) |
| AI not responding | Check your API key in Settings; verify cURL and outbound HTTPS work |
| Upload fails (file size) | Increase `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` in PHP settings |
| Generation stops early, missing CSS/JS | PHP execution timeout is too low. Set `max_execution_time`, `request_terminate_timeout`, and `fastcgi_read_timeout` to at least 600 — see [Server timeouts](https://voxelsite.com/docs/getting-started/requirements) |

---

## Security

- The Studio is protected by login, session tokens, and CSRF checks
- Use HTTPS in production
- Keep regular backups of `_studio/data/`, `assets/`, and `_data/`
- Do not remove the shipped `.htaccess` files — they protect the Studio, data, and uploads

---

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Backend | PHP 8.2+ — custom micro-router, no Laravel or Symfony |
| Database | SQLite 3 (via PDO) |
| Studio frontend | Vanilla JavaScript (ES modules, bundled with esbuild) |
| Studio styling | Tailwind CSS (compiled with `@tailwindcss/cli`) |
| Code editor | Monaco Editor |
| Generated websites | HTML, CSS (Tailwind utilities compiled to static CSS), PHP, vanilla JavaScript |

No Node.js or Composer is needed at runtime. The full Studio source and build system ship in the repo, so you can modify and rebuild the interface if you want — see the [Tech Stack docs](https://voxelsite.com/docs/getting-started/tech-stack).
