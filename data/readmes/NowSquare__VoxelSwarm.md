# VoxelSwarm

**Deploy VoxelSite for everyone.**

VoxelSwarm is a free, open-source deployment layer that turns one [VoxelSite](https://voxelsite.com) installation into a multi-tenant platform. Each user gets their own isolated hosting account, their own AI website builder, their own API key. No SaaS. No shared infrastructure. No middlemen.

> ⚠️ **Early Access** — VoxelSwarm requires extensive testing across different hosting environments and control panels. Please read [docs/testing-feedback.md](docs/testing-feedback.md) before reporting issues.

## Why not just build a SaaS?

You could run VoxelSite as a centralized SaaS — one app, shared database, monthly subscriptions. But:

- You'd need to build and maintain a multi-tenant codebase
- You'd handle all user data (GDPR, compliance, security breaches)
- One shared AI API key — one user violating terms gets your entire platform suspended
- Billing, subscriptions, churn — revenue depends on retaining paying users month to month
- One bug affects everyone

**VoxelSwarm takes a different approach.** Each client gets a full, isolated VoxelSite installation. Each brings their own AI API key. One VPS, predictable costs. No billing system needed — charge per project, per month, or give it away. Your business model.

## How it works

### 1. Clone VoxelSwarm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NowSquare/VoxelSwarm.git
cd VoxelSwarm
```

That's it — all dependencies are included in the repo. No `composer install` or `npm install` needed.

### 2. Point your domain & open the wizard

Point your domain to the VoxelSwarm directory (see [installation docs](docs/installation.md) for Nginx/Apache config).

Then open `https://yourdomain.com` in your browser — VoxelSwarm detects it's not installed and launches the **setup wizard** automatically.

The wizard runs system checks, then lets you configure your domain, operator account, control panel adapter, and email — all from the browser. No SSH required.

> CLI alternative: `php scripts/install.php`

### 3. Prepare your VoxelSite template

Add a [VoxelSite](https://voxelsite.com) release ZIP to `template/voxelsite/` and process it from the **Templates** page in the operator dashboard. VoxelSite is free and open source — get it from [voxelsite.com](https://voxelsite.com) or [github.com/NowSquare/VoxelSite](https://github.com/NowSquare/VoxelSite).

This extracts VoxelSite, moves the image library to a shared location (saving ~15 MB per instance), and generates the image manifest. ZIPs can have any filename — VoxelSwarm reads the `VERSION` file inside.

> CLI alternative: `php scripts/prepare-template.php /path/to/voxelsite.zip`

### 4. Provision instances

By default, VoxelSwarm runs in **operator-only mode** — `GET /` redirects to the operator login. You provision instances from the dashboard at `/operator`. When you're ready for public self-service signups, enable the public site in Deployment settings.

## Requirements

- **PHP 8.2+** with extensions: `pdo_sqlite`, `mbstring`, `openssl`, `fileinfo`, `zip`, `curl`
- **Web server:** Nginx (recommended) or Apache with `mod_rewrite`
- **Wildcard DNS:** `*.yourdomain.com → your server IP` (required for Nginx and DirectAdmin adapters — Forge, cPanel, and Plesk handle this automatically)
- **Wildcard SSL:** for `*.yourdomain.com` (required for Nginx and DirectAdmin adapters — other adapters provision SSL per-subdomain)
- **VoxelSite:** [voxelsite.com](https://voxelsite.com) or [github.com/NowSquare/VoxelSite](https://github.com/NowSquare/VoxelSite) — free and open source (AGPL-3.0)
- No MySQL. No Node.js. No Redis. No Composer required — `vendor/` is included in the repo.

## Control Panel Adapters

VoxelSwarm uses an adapter system to create hosting accounts and configure your control panel. Each adapter implements the same interface for subdomain provisioning, custom domain management, and maintenance mode:

| Adapter | Status | Configuration |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| **Filesystem** (Local) | ✅ Working | [docs/adapters/local.md](docs/adapters/local.md) |
| **Nginx** | ✅ Working | [docs/adapters/nginx.md](docs/adapters/nginx.md) |
| **Laravel Forge** | 🧪 Testing | [docs/adapters/forge.md](docs/adapters/forge.md) |
| **cPanel/WHM** | 🧪 Testing | [docs/adapters/cpanel.md](docs/adapters/cpanel.md) |
| **Plesk** | 🧪 Testing | [docs/adapters/plesk.md](docs/adapters/plesk.md) |
| **DirectAdmin** | 🧪 Testing | [docs/adapters/directadmin.md](docs/adapters/directadmin.md) |
| **CloudPanel** | 📋 Planned | [docs/adapters/cloudpanel.md](docs/adapters/cloudpanel.md) |
| **HestiaCP** | 📋 Planned | [docs/adapters/hestiacp.md](docs/adapters/hestiacp.md) |
| **CyberPanel** | 📋 Planned | [docs/adapters/cyberpanel.md](docs/adapters/cyberpanel.md) |

**Two users, one platform:**

- **The Operator** — installs VoxelSwarm, configures the adapter, manages instances from the dashboard
- **The Tenant** — signs up, gets a hosting account, builds their website with AI
