# Your SQL is the API

**Automatic REST API for PostgreSQL** | [2.7x faster than PostgREST, #2 of 20 services benchmarked](https://npgsqlrest.github.io/blog/benchmarks-2026-07/)

> SQL files and PostgreSQL objects become REST endpoints. TypeScript clients are generated automatically. Tests are SQL files too.

**3,500+ req/s** on 4 dedicated cores · **2,484 integration tests** · **12K LOC SQL** in production · **MIT** licensed

*"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."* — Leonardo da Vinci

SQL is declarative — your API should be too. With NpgsqlRest, you write SQL and annotate it with comments to declare what you want from your endpoint: caching, timeouts, retries, authorization, rate limiting, and everything in between. No controllers, no models, no mapping layers. Backend features become simple declarations on your SQL objects, putting PostgreSQL at the dead center of your architecture — the opposite of Clean Architecture, which treats the database as a detail. Here, PostgreSQL *is* the architecture.

## Install

| Method | Command |
|--------|---------|
| **NPM** | `npm i npgsqlrest` |
| **Bun** | `bun add --trust npgsqlrest` |
| **Deno** | `deno install --allow-scripts=npm:npgsqlrest npm:npgsqlrest` |
| **Docker** | `docker pull vbilopav/npgsqlrest:latest` |
| **Direct Download** | [Releases](https://github.com/NpgsqlRest/NpgsqlRest/releases) |
| **.NET Library** | `dotnet add package NpgsqlRest` |

Requires PostgreSQL >= 13. Native executables have zero runtime dependencies. See the [Installation Guide](https://npgsqlrest.github.io/guide/installation) for all options and details.

## From SQL to REST API

Write a SQL file:

```sql
-- sql/process_order.sql
-- HTTP POST
-- @authorize admin
-- @result validate
-- @single
select count(*) as found from orders where id = :order_id;
update orders set status = 'processing' where id = :order_id;
-- @result confirm
select id, status from orders where id = :order_id;
```

That gives you `POST /api/process-order`:

```json
{"validate": 1, "result2": 1, "confirm": [{"id": 42, "status": "processing"}]}
```

And a generated TypeScript client with full type safety:

```typescript
interface IProcessOrderResponse {
    validate: number;
    result2: number;
    confirm: { id: number, status: string }[];
}

export async function processOrder(
    request: IProcessOrderRequest
) : Promise<ApiResult<IProcessOrderResponse>> {
    const response = await fetch(baseUrl + "/api/process-order", {
        method: "POST",
        body: JSON.stringify(request)
    });
    return {
        status: response.status,
        response: response.ok ? await response.json() as IProcessOrderResponse : undefined!,
        error: !response.ok && response.headers.get("content-length") !== "0" ? await response.json() as ApiError : undefined
    };
}
```

No framework, no ORM, no boilerplate. The named placeholder `:order_id` — used three times, bound once — *is* the API parameter, and every result key is typed, down to the `@single` scalar and the column shapes. `ApiResult<T>` carries the status and a typed error, so failures are type-safe too.

## Endpoint Sources

| Source | What it's good for | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **SQL Files** *(recommended starting point)* | Simple queries, multi-command batch scripts, no DB deployment needed | `sql/get_users.sql` → `GET /api/get-users` |
| **Functions & Procedures** | Full PL/pgSQL power, static type checking, reusable logic | `get_user_by_id(int)` → `GET /api/get-user-by-id` |

SQL files are the easiest way to get started — drop a `.sql` file in a folder and you have an endpoint. Functions give you the full power of PL/pgSQL with true end-to-end type checking. Use both together, or whichever fits.

All sources share the same annotation system: `@authorize`, `@param`, `@returns`, `@void`, `@single`, `@cached`, `@path`, and 50+ others.

## Declarative Annotations

Declare what you want from your endpoint — caching, authorization, timeouts, retries, rate limiting, output format — right where the SQL lives:

```sql
/*
HTTP GET /users/
@authorize admin, user
@cached
@cache_expires_in 30sec
@timeout 5min
@table_format = excel
@excel_file_name = users.xlsx
*/
select id, name, email, role
from users
where $1 is null or department_id = $1;
```

Same pattern for PostgreSQL functions via `comment on function ... is '...'`. No middleware to register, no decorators, no controllers — the SQL is the source of truth. See [all annotations](https://npgsqlrest.github.io/annotations/).

## Tests Are SQL Files Too

No test framework, no running server, no mocks. `npgsqlrest --test` invokes the **real endpoint pipeline in-process, on the test's own transaction** — insert fixtures, call the endpoint (it sees your uncommitted rows), assert with SQL, roll back:

```sql
-- tests/get_users.test.sql
begin;

insert into users (email) values ('fixture@example.com');

/*
GET /api/get-users
# @claim user_id=1
*/
select status = 200, 'authenticated caller gets 200' from _response;
select body::jsonb @> '[{"email": "fixture@example.com"}]', 'fixture is listed' from _response;

rollback;
```

```
npgsqlrest ./config.json --test

PASS  tests/get_users.test.sql  (2 assertions, 52ms)
19 passed, 0 failed, 0 error(s)  —  19 assertions in 9 files
endpoint coverage: 2/2 (100%)
```

Parallel isolated connections, throwaway test databases (`create database app_test_{rnd5}` as a plain setup step), per-test database clones, tags, JUnit XML, and **endpoint coverage** with a CI threshold gate — [Testing Guide](https://npgsqlrest.github.io/guide/testing).

## Watch Mode

```sh
npgsqlrest ./config.json --watch
```

Save a `.sql` file and the running API restarts with the change (~1s). `create or replace` a function in psql and the endpoint is live seconds later — **the database itself is watched**, annotations included. The TypeScript client regenerates every cycle, so your frontend types follow your SQL as you type. Add `--test` and it becomes a millisecond test loop instead — a changed test re-runs alone; a changed endpoint rebuilds in-process. [Watch Mode](https://npgsqlrest.github.io/config/watch).

## Features

- **Multi-command SQL scripts** — multiple statements in one file execute as a batch, returning named result sets
- **Named parameters in SQL files** — `where email = :email`; the placeholder is the API parameter, repeated names bind once
- **SQL test runner** (`--test`) — tests as plain SQL files, in-process endpoint invocation inside the test's transaction, throwaway test databases, JUnit XML, endpoint-coverage gating
- **Watch mode** (`--watch`) — restart on SQL file, configuration, and database routine changes; test watch re-runs in milliseconds
- **MCP server** — `@mcp` exposes any endpoint as a Model Context Protocol tool for AI agents, same auth and rate limits
- **AI function-calling schemas & llms.txt** — project the MCP tool set into OpenAI and Anthropic `tools` array documents plus an llms.txt capability document, generated and served even without the /mcp endpoint
- **TypeScript/JS code generation** and `.http` files — types flow from PostgreSQL to your frontend, with optional **TanStack Query (React Query) v5 hooks** (`useQuery`/`useMutation` + query-key factories)
- **Dart client generation** — typed Flutter clients on `package:http`: request/response models with `fromJson`/`toJson`, multipart uploads with progress, SSE subscriptions, `MockClient` testability
- **AOT-compiled native binaries** — zero dependencies, instant startup
- [**2.7x faster than PostgREST**](https://npgsqlrest.github.io/blog/benchmarks-2026-07/npgsqlrest.html) at 100 concurrent users — #2 of 20 services in the July 2026 benchmark, ahead of hand-written .NET endpoints on the same driver by 50%+
- **50+ comment annotations** — `@authorize`, `@param`, `@returns`, `@void`, `@single`, `@result`, `@skip`, `@cached`, `@proxy`, and more
- **Auth** — cookie auth, Basic auth, JWT claims, role-based access, `@authorize`, `@allow_anonymous`
- **Column-level encryption**, security-sensitive endpoints, IP address binding
- **Response caching** with per-endpoint expiration control
- **Rate limiting** per endpoint
- **SSE streaming** via `RAISE INFO/NOTICE` with graceful shutdown
- **HTTP QUERY method** — the standardized safe method with a request body; parameters bind from the JSON body, clients treat it as a cacheable read
- **File uploads** — large objects, file system, MIME filtering
- **Reverse proxy** — forward to upstream services, transform proxy responses
- **HTTP custom types** — PostgreSQL composite types that call external APIs and return structured responses
- **Composite type support** — nested JSON, arrays of composites, `@returns` to skip Describe
- **OpenAPI 3.0 / 3.1** spec generation (configurable `SpecVersion`)
- **CSV/Excel/HTML** table format response handlers

## Claude Code skill

A [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skill that teaches the agent how to build with NpgsqlRest — both endpoint sources (database functions/procedures/tables/views and `.sql` files), the full annotation set, configuration, HTTP custom types, proxy, caching, auth, SSE, MCP, client code generation (TypeScript/React Query hooks, Dart), the SQL test runner (`--test`), and watch mode (`--watch`). It lives in [`.claude/skills/npgsqlrest/`](.claude/skills/npgsqlrest/) and bundles a complete annotation reference and a full annotated `appsettings.json`.

Install it for your own NpgsqlRest projects — per-user (available everywhere):

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.claude/skills/npgsqlrest"
for f in SKILL.md annotations-reference.md configuration-reference.jsonc; do
  curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NpgsqlRest/NpgsqlRest/master/.claude/skills/npgsqlrest/$f" \
    -o "$HOME/.claude/skills/npgsqlrest/$f"
done
```

…or scope it to a single project by copying those three files into `<your-project>/.claude/skills/npgsqlrest/`. The agent then loads it automatically when you work on NpgsqlRest SQL, annotations, or config. The two reference files are generated from `npgsqlrest --annotations` and `npgsqlrest --config`; regenerate them with those commands if your installed version differs.
