## Overview

**mysql_samp** is a modern MySQL plugin for SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer) and [Open Multiplayer](https://open.mp) (open.mp), written entirely in Rust. It provides a complete API for database connectivity, non-blocking queries, prepared statements, transactions, a cache system, an ORM and Argon2id password hashing, with zero external runtime dependencies.

The same binary loads on SA-MP and on Open Multiplayer — natively as a component (recommended) or via legacy mode.

> owners and are referenced here solely to describe what this plugin is
> compatible with.

### Highlights

- **Zero external dependencies** — no `libmysqlclient`, no OpenSSL. The MySQL protocol and TLS (via rustls) are compiled directly into the binary.
- **All queries are non-blocking** — `mysql_query` runs on background threads and the server never stalls. **That does not mean a callback for everything:** the callback is optional, so a write is one line (`mysql_query(conn, "UPDATE …")`) with no forward and no public. You pass a callback only to read a result back.
- **Connection pool** — automatic reuse through `mysql::Pool`, thread-safe by design, with a configurable ceiling.
- **Credentials out of the source** — `mysql_connect_file` reads them from a config file your repository does not have to carry.
- **Schema scripts** — `mysql_query_file` runs a `.sql` file's statements in order, non-blocking.
- **Built-in ORM** — maps Pawn variables to columns with CRUD helpers.
- **Cache system** — results accessible through an automatic stack or persisted manually with `cache_save`, including multi-result sets from stored procedures.
- **Prepared statements** — `mysql_stmt_*` binds values server-side over the binary protocol. Nothing to escape, so nothing to get wrong: the safe way to handle player input.
- **Transactions** — `mysql_transaction_*` runs a batch atomically on one connection and rolls it back if any step fails.
- **Argon2id password hashing** — `mysql_hash_password` / `mysql_verify_password`, off the server thread on a bounded worker pool. The plaintext never reaches SQL, so it never reaches your logs.
- **TLS** — rustls compiled in, with CA pinning, mutual TLS and certificate verification on by default.
- **Two naming styles** — write the API in its original snake_case (`mysql_connect`) via `<mysql_samp>`, or in open.mp's `Prefix_PascalCase` (`MySQL_Connect`, `Cache_GetRowCount`) via `<mysql_samp_omp>`. Same plugin, aliases only, no runtime cost.
- **Safe by default** — `sql_mode`-aware escaping, forced UTF-8, protection against SQL injection and memory exhaustion.
- **Universal binary** — built on top of [rust-samp](https://github.com/NullSablex/rust-samp) v3.5.0; one `.so`/`.dll` runs on SA-MP and on Open Multiplayer (native component or legacy).
- **Simple deploy** — drop the `.so` or `.dll` in and you are done. No system libraries to install.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release for your platform:
   - `mysql_samp.so` (Linux i686)
   - `mysql_samp.dll` (Windows i686, MSVC ABI)
   - `mysql_samp.inc` (Pawn include, shared between SA-MP and Open Multiplayer)
   - `mysql_samp_omp.inc` (optional — the same API in open.mp's `Prefix_PascalCase` naming style)
2. Place the binary in the server's `plugins/` directory.
3. Copy the include(s) you want to your compiler's include folder:
   - **Windows:** `pawno/include/` or `qawno/include/`
   - **Linux:** `include/` (at the server root)

   Both files can sit side by side — they are alternatives, so pick one per script, never both in the same one.
4. Register the plugin:
   - **SA-MP** — add to `server.cfg`:
     ```
     plugins mysql_samp.so
     ```
     (or `mysql_samp.dll` on Windows)
   - **Open Multiplayer (native, recommended)** — drop the binary into the `components/` folder. open.mp auto-discovers it on start and loads it via `ComponentEntryPoint`, with access to `ICore`, `ITimersComponent` and the other native APIs. No `config.json` entry required.
   - **Open Multiplayer (legacy)** — same binary works as a legacy plugin. Drop it into `plugins/` and add it to `legacy_plugins` in `config.json` (this one DOES need to be declared, otherwise open.mp skips legacy plugins).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> No `libmysqlclient` or other system library is required. The plugin is self-contained.

## Quick start

```pawn
#include <a_samp>
#include <mysql_samp>

new gMysql;

public OnGameModeInit() {
    gMysql = mysql_connect("127.0.0.1", "root", "password", "samp_db");

    if (mysql_errno()) {
        return 1;
    }

    // Reading a result: needs a callback, because the rows arrive later
    mysql_query(gMysql, "SELECT * FROM players LIMIT 10", "OnPlayersLoaded");

    // Writing: no callback, no forward, no public - and still non-blocking
    mysql_query(gMysql, "UPDATE server_state SET last_start = NOW()");
    return 1;
}

forward OnPlayersLoaded();
public OnPlayersLoaded() {
    new rows = cache_get_row_count();
    printf("Players found: %d", rows);

    new name[MAX_PLAYER_NAME];
    for (new i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        cache_get_value_name(i, "name", name);
        printf("  - %s", name);
    }
}

public OnGameModeExit() {
    mysql_close(gMysql);
    return 1;
}
```

Browse the [examples/](examples/) folder for self-contained `.pwn` scripts covering connection setup, threaded queries, ORM, TLS, error handling, prepared statements, transactions, password hashing, config files, `.sql` scripts and multi-result sets. For anything carrying player input, start with [`08_prepared_statements.pwn`](examples/08_prepared_statements.pwn); for the callback-free form and for what is and is not ordered, see [`12_no_callback.pwn`](examples/12_no_callback.pwn) and [`13_ordering.pwn`](examples/13_ordering.pwn). The plugin natives (`mysql_*`, `cache_*`, `orm_*`) and the `OnQueryError` forward are identical across SA-MP and Open Multiplayer, so every example builds and runs on both — the only thing that differs between servers is the installation path documented above.

## Building from source

### Requirements

- Rust stable toolchain with the targets `i686-unknown-linux-gnu` and `i686-pc-windows-msvc`
- `cargo-xwin` for cross-compiling the Windows `.dll` from Linux (installed automatically by the script)
- **32-bit C support**, for the Linux target. The TLS backend (`ring`) compiles C and 32-bit assembly, so `gcc -m32` must work: `apt install gcc-multilib g++-multilib` on Debian/Ubuntu (`glibc-devel.i686` on Fedora, `lib32-glibc` on Arch). Both build scripts check this up front and name the package, because the underlying error is an opaque missing-header message.
- **LLVM**, only when cross-compiling the Windows `.dll` *from Linux*. Archiving `ring`'s objects for MSVC needs `llvm-lib`, which cargo-xwin does not ship; `scripts/build-linux.sh` finds it under `/usr/lib/llvm-*/bin` automatically. Not needed when building on Windows — MSVC's own `lib.exe` handles it, and `ring` ships pre-assembled objects so NASM is not required either.
- No MySQL or TLS system libraries — no `libmysqlclient`, no OpenSSL.

### Development build

```bash
cargo build --target i686-unknown-linux-gnu
```

### Release build (Linux + Windows)

From Linux:

```bash
./scripts/build-linux.sh
```

From Windows (Git Bash):

```bash
./scripts/build-windows.sh
```

Both scripts produce `dist/mysql_samp.so` and `dist/mysql_samp.dll`, each with full SA-MP + Open Multiplayer native support.
