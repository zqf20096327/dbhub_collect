# OpenAnalytics

Open-source, privacy-first web analytics. One lightweight tracker script, no
cookies, no cross-site profiles, aggregate-only reads — self-hostable on your
own hardware under AGPL-3.0.

A hosted instance runs at **[getopen.so](https://getopen.so)**, operated by the
authors: the same code, someone else's servers.

**Sponsored by the [Neon Open Source Program](https://neon.com).** Neon is the
managed Postgres behind getopen.so and the one we recommend for self-hosting —
see [Deploying with Neon](infra/selfhost/NEON.md).

## What is in this repository

The product, as one pnpm monorepo:

| App                  | Role                                                                                                                                         |

| `apps/realtime`      | The SSE stream behind the live dashboard                                                                                                     |

| `apps/cli`           | `oa` — site setup, stats, device-flow login                                                                                                  |

Stores: **Postgres** (control plane), **ClickHouse** (events and rollups),
**Valkey ×2** (one durable event queue, one losable realtime cache).

What it does, in one list: page views, custom and attribute-driven events,
sessions, web vitals, funnels, per-site retention, embeddable widgets, public
share links, revenue analytics from _your_ Stripe account, CSV/JSON import and
export, an MCP server, and a CLI.

**Who is on the site now**, from a presence cache rather than a table scan.
Names are generated per visitor and mean nothing outside the day they were
minted.

![The realtime screen: five visitors online with the page each is on, and
everyone seen in the last 24 hours below them](docs/images/realtime.png)

**Where one visitor went**, session by session. The identity behind a trail is
a salted hash that rotates every night, so the trail is as long as a visit and
never as long as a person.

![One visitor's trail: two visits, one arrived direct and one from X, each
listing the pages opened inside it](docs/images/visitor-journey.png)

**Where they are**, at city level and only when a site opts in. The lookup runs
against a database on your own disk and never leaves the host.

the Middle East and South America](docs/images/live-globe.png)

Architecture rules CI enforces, not conventions:

- `apps/web` may import only `packages/contracts` — the OpenAPI document is the
  single seam between frontend and backend.
- ClickHouse is reachable only through the query gateway, which verifies
  Ed25519-signed query envelopes minted by the api.
- The tracker has a hard byte budget; a change that exceeds it fails CI.
- The Postgres schema this repository builds contains no billing tables, and a
  CI job asserts that against a real database rather than a file list.

## Self-hosting

**[SELF-HOSTING.md](SELF-HOSTING.md)** is the guide: a generator script, one
`docker compose up -d`, automatic TLS, and an explanation of every secret and
every failure mode. Requirements are a Linux host with Docker, four DNS records,
about 4 GB of RAM and 25 GB of free disk.

**Installing is a pull, not a build.** A release publishes ten images to
`ghcr.io/openlabs-so/openanalytics`, so a fresh host is a few minutes and needs
no toolchain on it.

**Point four names at the host before you start.** Certificates are issued on
the first boot and issuance fails without them, half an hour later and nowhere
near the cause:

```
app.example.com   api.example.com   c.example.com   rt.example.com
```

```sh
git clone https://github.com/OpenLabs-so/openanalytics
cd openanalytics
git checkout "$(git tag -l 'v*' --sort=-v:refname | sed '/-/d' | head -1)"   # newest release, not main
cd infra/selfhost
./generate-secrets.sh --domain example.com --email you@example.com --with-geoip
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
# then open https://app.example.com and create the first account
```

**The checkout is where the version is chosen, and it is chosen once.** The
generator reads the tag back out of the tree it is standing in and points `.env`
at that release's images, printing which it picked and why; on a branch, on
`main`, or with no git at all it writes the build defaults instead. That is not
a convenience — the compose file, the env templates and the migrations ship
_with_ the images, so a release's images against another tree is a configuration
nobody has tested.

**Postgres can live on Neon instead of on the host.** The stack bundles a
Postgres container, and [Neon](https://neon.com) is the managed option we
recommend: four environment variables and one line in `.env`, and Postgres
backups and point-in-time restore become Neon's job.
**[infra/selfhost/NEON.md](infra/selfhost/NEON.md)** walks through it, including
moving an existing install across.

Images are amd64. On arm64, or to run a branch, build the ten here instead:
same compose file, one flag, about ten minutes and swap on a 4 GB box. Later,
`./upgrade.sh` moves between releases and takes the snapshot `./rollback.sh`
needs, because **migrations do not go down**: the way back is a restore, and a
restore discards what arrived after the upgrade. It tells you that before it
starts, not at rollback time when you no longer have a choice.
[RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) is what a version number here means.

To run it from source instead — for development, or to slot the services into
infrastructure you already have — follow
[Running from source](SELF-HOSTING.md#running-from-source). **The order matters
and one obvious order does not work:** the migration runners are compiled
output, so `pnpm run build` comes before `pnpm run migrate:postgres`.

`infra/selfhost/env/*.env.example` documents every variable each service reads,
and there is one file per service on purpose — the environment schema forbids
some keys to some services, so a single shared `.env` cannot be correct. The
AI assistant (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) and object storage are optional: unset, those
surfaces disable themselves and everything else runs.

Run the test suite the way CI does:

```sh
pnpm run test          # unit + contract + tracker, no infrastructure needed
pnpm run verify        # everything CI checks, including boundaries and the size budget
```

## Privacy model

No cookies, no fingerprinting, no cross-site identifiers. Visitor identity is a
daily-rotating salted hash; raw IP addresses are never stored. Do Not Track and
Global Privacy Control are honored at the collector, before anything is written.
City-level geolocation is opt-in per site.

Geolocation is resolved locally against a database on your own disk — no lookup
ever leaves the host. None is bundled (a 60 MB download, and stale within a month);
`infra/selfhost/geoip/fetch-dbip.sh` downloads one.

## License and trademark

Code: [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE). If you run a modified OpenAnalytics as a network
service, the AGPL requires you to offer your modified source to its users.

The browser tracker is the exception: `apps/tracker/` and the `oa.js` it builds
are [MIT](apps/tracker/LICENSE), because it is the one file that runs on your
site, not on the server. Embedding it creates no obligation under the AGPL.

The "OpenAnalytics" name and the hosted service's domain identify the instance
its authors operate and are **not** part of the license grant. A self-hosted
instance runs the software, not the brand.
