# Gotcha

[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/13985/badge)](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/13985)

Gotcha is a self-hosted observability platform: error tracking, performance
tracing, metrics, uptime monitoring, and profiling in one Go binary backed by
PostgreSQL and ClickHouse. It accepts data via the Sentry SDK ingestion
protocol and via OTLP (traces, metrics, and logs), so it interoperates with
the existing Sentry SDK ecosystem — point an official Sentry SDK at a Gotcha
project DSN and it works.

## Features

- **Project overview** — one way in instead of six separate lists: uptime, hosts over threshold, and new issues on a single line, and below them the open incident groups with their members, open incidents outside any group across every source, and whatever resolved within the selected window.
- **Issues / error tracking** — event ingestion via the Sentry protocol, automatic grouping into issues, stack traces, breadcrumbs, tags/contexts.
- **Performance / tracing** — distributed traces and transactions, Web Vitals, performance-issue detection, regression detection.
- **Metrics** — ingestion via OTLP, metric queries, threshold-based alert rules and incidents.
- **Logs** — OTLP and NDJSON log ingest, canonical severity levels, full-text search, cross-linked with errors, traces, and hosts.
- **Dependency map** — a service's external dependencies (databases, caches, outbound HTTP calls), derived from traces with no extra setup, showing call volume, latency, and error rate.
- **Deployment markers** — CI reports each release with a single request; deploys show up as markers on performance/metrics/host/uptime charts and are flagged against regressions that started shortly after.
- **Profiling** — CPU/flamegraph profiles from Sentry profiling payloads and pprof, with regression detection.
- **Uptime monitoring** — HTTP checks from a built-in local region or remote probes, incident detection, public status pages.
- **Hosts** — system metrics for your servers (CPU, memory, disk, network, load average, processes) via the native `gotcha-agent` (installed with one command straight from the instance) or an OpenTelemetry Collector; environment/role labels for filtering and grouping, built-in thresholds (with per-label overrides) and incidents.
- **SLOs and error budgets** — availability/latency/uptime objectives with two-window burn-rate alerting and an attainment/budget dashboard.
- **Service monitoring recipes** — ready-made OTel collector configs, live-data detection, prebuilt charts and one-click recommended thresholds for common services (PostgreSQL, nginx, Redis, Docker, MariaDB).
- **Alerting** — delivery via email, webhook, and Telegram; rules for new issues, spikes, metric thresholds, and performance/uptime regressions.
- **Escalation** — per-severity ladders that widen who gets notified the longer an incident stays open, with acknowledgment to stop paging.
- **Incident groups** — a cascading outage (a downed node and everything that depends on it) collapses into a single card instead of a storm of separate alerts.
- **Maintenance windows** — silence notifications from every source for a scheduled or open-ended window without pausing data collection.
- **Exports** — background CSV/JSON/NDJSON exports of a project's error groups or raw events, filtered by time range/environment and PII-masked by default.
- **Organizations, teams and RBAC** — multi-tenant organizations, projects, membership roles.
- **SSO** — OIDC (generic), Yandex ID, and VK ID login, each independently configurable.
- **Scoped ingest keys** — each DSN key is typed (browser/server/agent) and limited to what that source actually needs, so a publicly-exposed browser key can't register hosts or post deployment markers.
- **Self-monitoring** — the instance reports its own state: `/healthz`, `/readyz` and `/version` for liveness, readiness and build metadata, and Prometheus counters on `/metrics` for ingest buffers, drops, insert failures and background-evaluator liveness. `/metrics` touches neither database, so it still answers when PostgreSQL or ClickHouse is down — which is exactly when you need it.
- **Privacy by default** — server-side PII scrubbing (IP/email zeroing, key-based redaction) and SSRF protection for outbound webhook/uptime requests, both on by default.

## Versioning and stability

Since 1.0, part of gotcha's contract is frozen: environment variable names,
ingest endpoints and request body formats, the migration schema, the backup
format, self-metric names, and the outgoing webhook body only change in a
backward-compatible way, or with a major version. See the
[Versioning policy](internal/docs/en/versioning.md) for the full promise and
what stays out of it, and the CHANGELOG for what changed release to release.

## Architecture

The server ships as a single binary, `gotcha`, with a `--mode` flag that
selects which subsystems run in a given process; a separate small binary,
`gotcha-agent`, runs on monitored hosts and reports system metrics (see
Hosts above) — it's served by the instance itself and installed with one
command, no manual build needed:

- `--mode=ingest` — HTTP ingestion (Sentry envelope endpoints, OTLP metrics), event/span/metric/profile batching, alert evaluation on ingested data.
- `--mode=web` — the SSR web UI (templ), auth, org/project administration, dashboards, public status pages.
- `--mode=uptime` — the uptime check runner, incident watchdog, performance-regression and metric-threshold evaluators.
- `--mode=probe` — a remote uptime probe: talks only to a central Gotcha instance over HTTP, no direct database access.
- `--mode=all` (default) — everything above in a single process; the natural mode for a small/self-hosted install.

Storage: PostgreSQL holds relational state (organizations, projects, users,
issues, alert rules, incidents); ClickHouse holds high-volume event/span/
metric/profile/uptime-result data, with configurable per-signal retention.

## Quick start

Requires Docker and Docker Compose.

```bash
# gitflic (main, guaranteed anonymous HTTPS)
git clone https://gitflic.ru/project/otezvikentiy/gotcha.git
# GitHub (mirror, if published)
git clone https://github.com/OtezVikentiy/gotcha.git
# Contributors with SSH access can use:
# git clone git@gitflic.ru:otezvikentiy/gotcha.git
cd gotcha
docker compose up -d
```

This builds the `gotcha` image and starts three containers: `gotcha` (the app,
`--mode=all`), `postgres`, and `clickhouse`. The app listens on
`http://localhost:59080` by default (the compose file maps host port 59080 to
the container's 8080 to avoid clashing with other local stacks). Override the
host port with `GOTCHA_COMPOSE_PORT`, e.g.
`GOTCHA_COMPOSE_PORT=8080 docker compose up -d`.
Equivalent `make` targets exist: `make up`, `make logs`, `make down`, `make
health` (see the Makefile for the full list).

Wait for the app to come up (readiness: PostgreSQL and ClickHouse are
reachable; `/healthz` only reports the process is alive):

```bash
curl -sf http://localhost:59080/readyz
```

### First run

1. Open `http://localhost:59080/register` and create the first user. On a
   fresh instance, the first registered user always succeeds regardless of
   `GOTCHA_REGISTRATION_MODE` and is automatically granted instance-admin
   ("bootstrap" — see `GOTCHA_REGISTRATION_MODE` below for how later signups are
   gated).
2. Create an organization and a project from the UI.
3. Open the project's **Setup** page for its DSN and per-language snippets —
   the button is in the project list, or via Project settings → DSN keys.
4. Point an official Sentry SDK at that DSN — Gotcha speaks the Sentry
   ingestion protocol, so any language's Sentry SDK works unmodified, e.g.:

   ```go
   sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{Dsn: "<YOUR_PROJECT_DSN>"})
   ```

   Trigger an error in your app; it shows up under **Issues** within seconds.

More in-product documentation is available at `/docs` once the app is
running (also in source under `internal/docs/{en,ru}/`), including
[Getting Started](internal/docs/en/getting-started.md),
[SDK & Integrations](internal/docs/en/sdk.md), and per-section guides for
issues, performance, metrics, uptime, alerts, and profiling.

## Configuration

Gotcha is configured entirely through `GOTCHA_*` environment variables (see
`cmd/gotcha/config.go` for the authoritative source). Copy `.env.example` to
`.env` and adjust as needed; the most important variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GOTCHA_LISTEN_ADDR` | `:8080` | HTTP listen address. |
| `GOTCHA_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Public URL of this instance; used to build project DSNs, alert links, and invite links. Must match how users reach the instance. |
| `GOTCHA_PG_DSN` | `postgres://gotcha:gotcha@localhost:5432/gotcha?sslmode=disable` | PostgreSQL connection string. |
| `GOTCHA_CH_DSN` | `clickhouse://localhost:9000/gotcha` | ClickHouse connection string. |
| `GOTCHA_SECRET_KEY` | `insecure-dev-secret` | Signs OAuth state/session cookies. **The default is public** (it's in the source) and enables account takeover via OAuth on any non-localhost deployment — the process refuses to start in the `web`, `all`, `ingest`, and `uptime` modes (everywhere except `probe`) on a non-local `GOTCHA_BASE_URL` unless this is overridden (escape hatch: `GOTCHA_SECRET_KEY_ALLOW_INSECURE=1`, dev only). Generate a strong random value for any real deployment. |
| `GOTCHA_SMTP_HOST` / `_PORT` / `_USER` / `_PASSWORD` / `_FROM` | unset / `587` / unset / unset / unset | Outbound email for invites and email alert channels; email delivery is disabled until `GOTCHA_SMTP_HOST` is set. |
| `GOTCHA_EVENT_RETENTION_DAYS` | `90` | Retention for events/transactions/Web Vitals in ClickHouse. |
| `GOTCHA_SPAN_RETENTION_DAYS` | `30` | Retention for trace spans. |
| `GOTCHA_METRIC_RETENTION_DAYS` | `30` | Retention for metric points. |
| `GOTCHA_PROFILE_RETENTION_DAYS` | `7` | Retention for profile samples. |
| `GOTCHA_INCIDENT_RETENTION_DAYS` | `90` | Retention for resolved uptime incidents in PostgreSQL. Separate from the others because an incident has no telemetry of its own and the public status page shows 90 days of history. |
| `GOTCHA_PROJECT_PURGE_RECONCILE_HOURS` | `24` | How often to look for ClickHouse telemetry of projects that no longer exist and queue it for deletion. Deleting a project queues that work in the same transaction; this check covers the case where no request was ever queued. `0` turns it off. |
| `GOTCHA_EDITION` | `oss` | `oss` or `saas`. Controls the default for the quota variables below (`oss` → 0/unlimited, `saas` → 1,000,000/month). |
| `GOTCHA_DEFAULT_EVENT_QUOTA` / `_TRANSACTION_QUOTA` / `_METRIC_QUOTA` / `_PROFILE_QUOTA` / `_LOG_QUOTA` | `0` in `oss` (unlimited) | Default monthly ingest quota assigned to new organizations. **If you expose a project DSN publicly, set these to a real cap** — `oss` defaults to unlimited. |
| `GOTCHA_REGISTRATION_MODE` | `invite` | `open` (anyone can self-register), `invite` (self-registration closed except invite links), or `closed` (no self-registration at all). The very first user always succeeds regardless of this setting (instance-admin bootstrap). |
| `GOTCHA_SCRUB_IP` / `GOTCHA_SCRUB_EMAIL` | `true` / `true` | Zero out the reporting user's IP/email server-side before storage. On by default. |
| `GOTCHA_SCRUB_DENY_KEYS` | built-in denylist (`password`, `token`, `secret`, `authorization`, `cookie`, `api_key`, `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `session`, `credit_card`, `card_number`, `cvv`, …) | Comma-separated key names redacted from tags/contexts/stack traces/span data. This variable extends the built-in list (use `GOTCHA_SCRUB_KEEP_KEYS` to drop a specific built-in key). |
| `GOTCHA_SSRF_ALLOW_PRIVATE` | `false` | Allow uptime checks and outbound webhooks to target private/loopback/link-local addresses. Keep `false` on any multi-tenant instance. |
| `GOTCHA_OIDC_ENABLED` / `GOTCHA_YANDEX_ENABLED` / `GOTCHA_VK_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable each SSO provider independently; each requires its own client ID/secret (and issuer, for OIDC) once enabled. |

Further runtime variables (`GOTCHA_MAX_EVENT_BYTES`,
`GOTCHA_METRIC_EVAL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, `GOTCHA_PROFILE_EVAL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`,
`GOTCHA_HOST_EVAL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`,
`GOTCHA_OUTBOX_RETENTION_DAYS`, `GOTCHA_AUTO_MIGRATE_ENABLED`,
`GOTCHA_EXTERNAL_CHANNEL_DETAILS_ENABLED`, `GOTCHA_UPTIME_CONCURRENCY`,
`GOTCHA_UPTIME_LOCAL_REGION`, `GOTCHA_PROBE_KEY`, `GOTCHA_PROBE_SERVER_URL`,
`GOTCHA_SCRUB_FREETEXT`) and the full OIDC/Yandex/VK variable set are listed
with their defaults in [`.env.example`](.env.example) and described in the
built-in [Configuration](internal/docs/en/configuration.md) guide. They are
ordinary environment variables — no rebuild needed; `GOTCHA_PROBE_KEY` and
`GOTCHA_PROBE_SERVER_URL` are in fact required to run a remote probe.

## Build from source

Requires Go 1.26+.

```bash
go build -o gotcha ./cmd/gotcha
# or, via make:
make go-build

# the host-metrics agent is a separate binary:
go build -o gotcha-agent ./cmd/gotcha-agent
# or:
make go-build-agent
```

Running locally still needs PostgreSQL and ClickHouse. The bundled
`docker-compose.yml` only publishes the app's port to the host (Postgres and
ClickHouse are reachable from the `gotcha` container over the compose
network, not from your host by default). For source-level development,
either point `GOTCHA_PG_DSN`/`GOTCHA_CH_DSN` at your own local Postgres 17 /
ClickHouse 25.3 instances, or publish their ports yourself (e.g. a
git-ignored `docker-compose.override.yml` adding `ports: ["5432:5432"]` /
`ports: ["9000:9000"]` to those two services), then:

```bash
go run ./cmd/gotcha
```

To regenerate templ-generated Go files after editing a `.templ` file:

```bash
make templ
```
