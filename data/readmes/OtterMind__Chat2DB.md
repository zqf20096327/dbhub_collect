## What is Chat2DB?

Chat2DB Community is a free, cross-platform database client for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It runs entirely on your machine and combines a full-featured SQL workspace with an AI assistant that you connect to your own model.

- **40+ databases** — MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, ClickHouse, MongoDB, Redis, SQLite, MariaDB, TiDB, Hive, DB2, Snowflake, BigQuery, Elasticsearch, Trino, TimescaleDB, Greenplum, YugabyteDB, CrateDB, QuestDB, Apache IoTDB, Firebird, HSQLDB, Apache Derby, and more via plugins — new JDBC databases can be added through configuration only, without code changes.
- **SQL workspace** — editing, completion, formatting, execution, saved SQL, and execution history.
- **AI assistant** — bring your own AI model to generate, explain, and optimize SQL in natural language.
- **Database management** — browse metadata, manage tables and objects (DDL/DML), and edit data in place.
- **Data import and export**, **dashboards and charts**, and an **[open-source CLI with MCP support](https://github.com/OtterMind/Chat2DB-CLI)**.

## Early preview

The next feature line ships as an early preview before it reaches the regular Beta channel:

- **[Chat2DB Community 5.4.0-beta.1 (early preview)](https://github.com/OtterMind/Chat2DB/releases/tag/v5.4.0-beta.1)** — installers for macOS, Windows and Linux.
- It adds an optional local agent runtime with skills, external MCP servers, and file and terminal tools; choose **Pi Agent** in the AI input's runtime selector to enable it (the first selection asks for confirmation and downloads the runtime).
- This preview is neither the stable nor the regular Beta release: `Latest` stays on the stable build, and the regular Beta line continues with `5.3.8-beta.x`. Enable **Receive Beta versions** in **Settings → About Us** to receive it in the app.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Desktop App

Download the installer for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/OtterMind/Chat2DB/releases), install it, and start connecting to your databases. No further setup is required.

### Option 2: Docker

Requirements: Docker 19.03.0+, Docker Compose 2.0.0+ (Compose V2, only for the Compose variant), 2+ CPU cores, 4+ GiB RAM.

First create the encryption key (see [Encryption Key](#encryption-key) for why it matters), then start the container:

```bash
# Run once from a repository checkout. Re-running reuses the same valid key.
git clone https://github.com/OtterMind/Chat2DB.git && cd Chat2DB
./script/security/init-community-encryption-key.sh

docker run --detach \
  --name chat2db-community \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --publish 127.0.0.1:10825:10825 \
  --volume "$HOME/.chat2db-community-docker:/root/.chat2db-community" \
  --env CHAT2DB_COMMUNITY_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/chat2db-community-encryption.key \
  --volume "$HOME/.config/chat2db-community/encryption.key:/run/secrets/chat2db-community-encryption.key:ro" \
  chat2db/chat2db:latest
```

Then open `http://localhost:10825` in your browser.

Alternatively, use the bundled Compose definition:

```bash
./script/security/init-community-encryption-key.sh
docker compose --file docker/docker-compose.yml up --detach
```

Notes:

- To update, pull the new image, remove the old container, and run the start command again. Keep `~/.config/chat2db-community/encryption.key` across rebuilds.
- The `docker run` example stores application data in `$HOME/.chat2db-community-docker`; the Compose definition uses the `chat2db-community-data` named volume. These locations do not share data.
- Chat2DB Community 5.3.0 uses the independent `/root/.chat2db-community` directory and does not automatically migrate data from earlier images that used `/root/.chat2db`.

## Security Notes

Chat2DB Community is a single-user, local-first application. It has no user
accounts or authorization boundaries between users. Keep the HTTP service
bound to `127.0.0.1` or `::1` and do not expose it to other users or
untrusted networks.

Custom JDBC drivers are executable Java code — install them only from
sources you trust. Imported configuration files, archives, SQL files,
database contents, and AI responses remain untrusted data. See the
[Security Policy](SECURITY.md) for the complete trust boundary and
vulnerability reporting process.

## Encryption Key

Chat2DB Community encrypts stored datasource passwords and AI model API keys with AES-256-GCM using a per-installation key. Create it once from a repository checkout (requires `openssl`):

```bash
./script/security/init-community-encryption-key.sh
```

The key is written to `~/.config/chat2db-community/encryption.key`. **Back this file up separately and keep it across upgrades and container rebuilds** — replacing or losing it makes previously stored datasource passwords and AI model API keys unreadable. Web/headless startup fails when no valid key is provided; only Desktop mode creates a missing key automatically.

<details>
<summary>Key configuration reference (custom paths, resolution order, validation)</summary>

The key must be valid Base64 that decodes to exactly 32 bytes. The bundled initializer generates the standard padded form: 44 Base64 characters ending in `=`. It is cryptographic key material, not a human-readable password. Datasource passwords and AI API keys use the same key with separate authenticated AAD values, so ciphertext from one purpose cannot be decrypted as the other.

To use a custom path, pass it to the script and configure the same path when starting Chat2DB:

```bash
./script/security/init-community-encryption-key.sh /secure/path/chat2db-community.key

java -Dloader.path=chat2db-community-server/chat2db-community-start/target/lib \
    -Dchat2db.runtime.mode=community \
    -Dchat2db.mode=WEB \
    -Dchat2db.gui=false \
    -Dchat2db.network.status=OFFLINE \
    -Dchat2db.community.encryption-key-file=/secure/path/chat2db-community.key \
    -Dserver.address=127.0.0.1 \
    -Dserver.port=10825 \
    -jar chat2db-community-server/chat2db-community-start/target/chat2db-community.jar
```

The script's key-file path priority is the positional argument, `CHAT2DB_COMMUNITY_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE`, then the default path. It reuses a valid regular file, rejects symbolic links and non-regular files, and refuses to overwrite an invalid file. Keep the key readable only by the Chat2DB process owner.

Key configuration is resolved in this order:

1. JVM property `chat2db.community.encryption-key` containing the Base64 key.
2. Environment variable `CHAT2DB_COMMUNITY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` containing the Base64 key.
3. JVM property `chat2db.community.encryption-key-file` containing a key-file path.
4. Environment variable `CHAT2DB_COMMUNITY_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE` containing a key-file path.
5. Default file `~/.config/chat2db-community/encryption.key`.

The first configured value is authoritative. A blank value, malformed Base64, a key that does not decode to 32 bytes, or an invalid key file fails startup instead of falling through to the next source. File-based configuration is recommended because it avoids placing the key value directly in process arguments or environment variables.

Automatic key-file creation depends on `chat2db.mode`, not `chat2db.gui`. Community Desktop mode (`chat2db.runtime.mode=community` with `chat2db.mode=DESKTOP`) creates the selected key file when no inline key is configured and the file is missing. Any non-Desktop mode, including normal Web/headless startup, never creates a missing key and fails until a valid key is provided or initialized. The resolved key is cached for the process lifetime, so changing key configuration requires an application restart.
