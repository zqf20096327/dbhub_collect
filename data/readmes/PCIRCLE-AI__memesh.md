## What it does

Switching sessions or coding agents can mean repeating a decision, explaining the same architecture, or revisiting a fix that was already found.

MeMesh lets agents share memory and exchange messages locally. Its main uses are carrying your preferences, decisions, and lessons across sessions; sending work, questions, progress, and results between agents; and keeping a handoff of where work stopped so a later session has context to check. Claude Code and Codex are primary examples; Cursor and other MCP clients can use the documented integrations. Automatic capture and delivery depend on the host integration below.

```
   you work with the agent
            |
            v
   +------------------+      +------------------+
   |  Claude Code     |      |  Claude Code     |
   |  capture         |      |  recall          |
   |  sessions,       | ---> |  at session      |
   |  commits, fixes  |      |  start and       |
   |  (automatic)     |      |  before edits    |
   +------------------+      +------------------+
            |                         ^
            v                         |
   +----------------------------------------+
   |  ~/.memesh/knowledge-graph.db           |
   |  decisions, lessons, links between them |
   +----------------------------------------+
```

- **Capture, recall, reminders, and safeguards at the right time.** MeMesh ships **9 hooks** (nine hook commands) across its Claude Code and Codex integrations: eight Claude Code hooks run at session start, before file edits, after `git commit`, after a plan is approved or a question answered, when Claude stops, before context compaction, when you say "remember this" (5 languages), and before a risky command that repeats an accepted lesson. The plan/question and "remember this" hooks only remind the agent to call `remember`; the ninth command handles both Codex SessionStart and SessionEnd to register and retire an eligible ordinary Codex CLI session.
- **One memory for all your tools.** A decision stored from Claude Code is available to Codex or Cursor the next day.
- **Agents can leave each other messages.** A durable inbox survives restarts; on macOS or Linux, an ordinary Codex CLI thread with the MeMesh plugin can keep a bounded post-turn native queue window and consume the accepted message when that same thread resumes.
- **Keep a work handoff.** Claude Code can save its latest substantive reply for the next session in the same project. Use `task_state` to record a stated goal, next step, blocker, or completion, and `message` to send evidence locations or follow-up questions to an exact recipient.
- **A dashboard** to browse it all: 4 tabs, 11 languages, at `http://localhost:3737/dashboard`.

## Works with

| Platform | How | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | Plugin: hooks, MCP tools, `/memesh` skill | Full automatic capture and recall |
| Codex CLI | Plugin, or MCP server (`memesh-mcp`) | Zero-config plugin install, or `codex mcp add memesh -- memesh-mcp` |
| Gemini CLI | MCP server (`memesh-mcp`) | `gemini mcp add -s user memesh memesh-mcp` |
| Cursor, Cline and other MCP clients | MCP server (`memesh-mcp`) | Point the client at `memesh-mcp` |
| Hermes Agent | Native memory-provider plugin | [docs/platforms/hermes-agent.md](docs/platforms/hermes-agent.md) |
| OpenClaw | Native memory plugin | Source only; not published or live-tested: [docs/platforms/openclaw.md](docs/platforms/openclaw.md) |
| Your own scripts and apps | HTTP API from `memesh serve` | [docs/platforms/universal.md](docs/platforms/universal.md) |
| ChatGPT, Gemini web and other hosted chat | HTTP API through a local bridge you run | [docs/platforms/README.md](docs/platforms/README.md) |

Claude Code's eight hooks provide automatic capture, recall, reminders, and safeguards. The Codex plugin loads the same hook file: once Codex is allowed to run the plugin's hooks, its SessionStart hook injects the same memory block, and it starts the messaging companion for eligible ordinary CLI threads. Which of the other hooks fire under Codex is not yet verified. With the Codex plugin, call `briefing` only when that block is missing; in MCP-only clients, call `briefing` at session start. Use `recall` for specific questions.

Recall and capture are local and deterministic: SQLite FTS5 search, explicit memory tools, and rule-based hooks. This version does not configure or call an LLM, embedding, or vector provider. Retired provider settings from older versions stay on disk but are ignored; `memesh doctor` names the top-level keys without reading or printing their values.

## Install

Plugin installs and the npm-global CLI share one database. Most Claude Code users want its plugin plus the CLI; Codex can use its own plugin or the CLI's MCP server.

```
   Claude Code chat                Terminal, Codex, Cursor
         |                                  |
         v                                  v
   +-----------------+              +------------------+
   | A: plugin       |              | B: npm global    |
   | /plugin install |              | npm install -g   |
   | hooks + tools   |              | memesh CLI       |
   | + /memesh skill |              | + memesh-mcp     |
   +-----------------+              +------------------+
         |                                  |
         +---------------+------------------+
                         v
            ~/.memesh/knowledge-graph.db
               (one file, both paths)
```

**A. Inside Claude Code** (hooks, tools and the `/memesh` skill are wired for you):

```
/plugin marketplace add PCIRCLE-AI/memesh
/plugin install memesh@pcircle-memesh
```

Restart Claude Code. A `◉ MeMesh` line appears at the top of the next session.

**B. In a terminal** (needs [Node 22.13+](https://nodejs.org)):

```bash
npm install -g @pcircle/memesh
memesh doctor          # checks local install health and prints fixes
memesh install-hooks   # only if you skipped A: wires Claude Code, keeps your own hooks
```

For a zero-config Codex install, run `codex plugin marketplace add PCIRCLE-AI/memesh` and `codex plugin add memesh@pcircle-memesh`. The manual alternative is `codex mcp add memesh -- memesh-mcp`. For Cursor, add `{ "mcpServers": { "memesh": { "command": "memesh-mcp" } } }` to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`. The Dashboard's doctor banner can apply the two recoverable local repairs it knows how to verify; it never changes files just because the page was opened.

> **The plugin does not install the CLI.** After `/plugin install`, typing `memesh` in a terminal says `command not found` until you also run `npm install -g @pcircle/memesh`. If you only use Claude Code chat, A alone is enough.

**Update:** Claude Code plugin: `memesh upgrade-plugin` (or `npx @pcircle/memesh upgrade-plugin` without the CLI). Codex plugin: `codex plugin marketplace upgrade pcircle-memesh && codex plugin add memesh@pcircle-memesh`. npm-global CLI: `memesh update`. **Installing with an AI agent?** Point it at [llms-install.md](llms-install.md).

## Get started

```bash
memesh remember "Login uses OAuth 2.0 with PKCE"
memesh recall "login"
# -> finds the PKCE decision

memesh briefing        # what the agent knows about this project
memesh serve           # starts the local server and prints the dashboard URL
```

Keep `memesh serve` running and open the printed URL. In Claude Code you do not even need the terminal for memory tools: say "remember this" in chat, and once there is something to show, the briefing arrives on its own at session start.

Two things worth knowing once you have memories:

- `forget` archives a memory instead of deleting it. A newer memory can replace an older one.
- A running agent can call `work_package` to prepare one calendar digest or bounded visible turns from the newest eligible recent Claude Code transcript. Transcript mode requires the client's single matching MCP file root; missing or ambiguous roots and bounded scan failures fail closed. Submission retains redacted source turns and only stages pending human review; agents cannot apply or reject it, and MeMesh calls no provider. The exact discovery bounds are in the [API reference](docs/api/API_REFERENCE.md#work_package).

For a handoff, Claude Code's Stop hook saves its latest substantive reply as a replaceable project note. A recent, trusted note appears ahead of ranked memories in the next Claude Code session and in `briefing` on any client; it is a reminder to check, not a guaranteed task restart. Record only the work state you actually know with `task_state`, and send evidence locations or follow-up questions with `message` ([agent messaging guide](docs/platforms/agent-messaging.md)). A stored message is available for recovery, but delivery, fetch, and native queue acceptance do not mean the recipient completed the task.

In the briefing, recent project decisions get priority over routine activity, and up to five project lessons are selected separately. The handoff, displayed task state, ranked memories, global memory at `full`, and injected index share one 4000-character memory-block limit. If the index says more memories were omitted, use `recall`; `memesh briefing --index` shows the standalone index under its separate 40-line/3072-byte caps.

## All 12 Memory and Coordination Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `work_package` | Prepare one bounded untrusted calendar digest or Claude Code transcript package under one matching MCP workspace root; submit one strict result for pending human review, or defer without durable change. Transcript submission retains bounded redacted source turns; no file path, hidden reasoning, provider, embedding, or vector data is exposed. |
| `remember` | Store knowledge as observations, relations and tags — or pass free text as `note` and the title, observations and name are derived; `replace` corrects a memory in place |
| `recall` | Local FTS5 search with multi-factor scoring (relevance, recency, frequency, confidence, recall impact) |
| `forget` | Soft-archive (never deletes) or remove specific observations |
| `export` | Back up, migrate, or move memories as JSON between compatible agents |
| `import` | Import memories with merge strategies (skip / overwrite / append) |
| `learn` | Record structured lessons from mistakes (error, root cause, fix, prevention) |
| `task_state` | Read or record where the work stands — goal, next step, blocker, what was just finished |
| `briefing` | The assembled work topology for any MCP client — an eligible project handoff precedes ranked memories at every level; `minimal` then shows this project's decisions, lessons, knowledge and recent activity, `standard` adds fresh task state and a capped durable-memory index, and `full` adds other projects and global memory; exact `project` + `recipient` can surface only that recipient's unfetched deliveries |
| `user_patterns` | Analyze your work patterns — schedule, tools, strengths, learning areas |
| `improvement` | Stage an evidence-linked product improvement for human review, or read its status; agents cannot accept or reject it |
| `message` | Discover live agents, then exchange exact-recipient untrusted messages. Durable JSON payload max: 64 KiB; complete native envelope max: 16 KiB with distinct `native_message_too_large` and `recipient_unavailable` failures. Native acceptance, discovery, poll, and fetch never imply acknowledgement or disposition |

## The fine print

**Scored Ranking** — Results ranked by relevance (30%) + recency (25%) + frequency (18%) + confidence (17%) + recall impact (10%).

**Agent messaging, the exact rules** (full guide: [docs/platforms/agent-messaging.md](docs/platforms/agent-messaging.md)):

- Works today: an MCP, HTTP, or CLI sender can durably send one untrusted JSON-encoded payload of at most 65,536 UTF-8 bytes (64 KiB) to one named local recipient. A receiver can fetch it separately, resume from an opaque cursor after restart, and record intake, acknowledgement, workflow disposition, and host activation as separate facts.
- With the MeMesh Codex plugin enabled, each startup or resumed ordinary Codex CLI thread with a valid thread identity and existing working directory registers automatically under a thread-scoped identity; no manual `agent setup` is required. SessionStart launches an owner-private companion. SessionEnd keeps a bounded 45-second idle queue window, resume replaces the prior exact generation, and expiry removes the registration. A message accepted during that idle window becomes model-visible when the same thread resumes; it is not a claim that a stopped UI was awakened. `memesh agent setup codex-session` remains available only when one workspace needs a stable named principal. The complete native envelope, including routing metadata and payload, is capped separately at 16,384 bytes (16 KiB). An exact-session send returns success only after that native queue accepts it; an oversized full envelope reports `native_message_too_large`, an unreachable local router reports `router_unreachable`, and other unavailable or rejected sessions report `recipient_unavailable`. Scoped recovery data remains durable for all sender-side and recipient-side failures. Principal targets retain durable store-and-forward behavior. Native acceptance is not acknowledgement or disposition, and native messages must contain no secrets.
- A stopped, missing, or disconnected Codex session is not woken up or replaced, and a failed exact-session native delivery is not replayed automatically; the sender must retry deliberately. Its scoped recovery data stays available; `memesh message storage report` shows what is stored. Native delivery works on macOS and Linux only.
- This documented native path covers ordinary Codex CLI. Do not assume Codex Desktop or an unattached task registers unless that exact running session appears in `message discover`; this is an evidence boundary, not a claim that those hosts are universally incompatible.
- When pairing Claude Channel with automatic Codex registration, pass the complete `project` value from `memesh briefing --json` to `memesh agent setup claude`; the repository basename is not the same routing scope.
