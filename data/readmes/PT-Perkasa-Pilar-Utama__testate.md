**Git for your test database.** Snapshot it, break it, put it back in seconds.

**Website:** [pt-perkasa-pilar-utama.github.io/testate](https://pt-perkasa-pilar-utama.github.io/testate/)

Testate runs beside the system under test, takes data-only snapshots of its databases, and puts any of them back on demand. One container, one volume, no account, no telemetry. Version 1.2.0.

## The problem

Every QA team knows this chat:

> "Could you wipe the transactions on UAT? I can't create another order."
> "Reset DEV to the seed again please, the master data is off."

So a developer stops, SSHes in, and resets a database by hand. Or writes a reset endpoint that must never ship, and sometimes ships. Meanwhile QA does not automate, because every automated run needs a clean database first. And nobody lets an AI agent near a shared database to debug anything, because one hallucinated `DELETE` is one too many.

## What Testate does

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  take["Take a state"] --> break["Run the test, dirty the data"] --> back["Check the state out"] --> take
```

- **Take a state.** A data-only snapshot of every database in a project, at one moment, with a name and tags.
- **Break it.** Run the suite, click through the app, edit rows in the grid, load a fixture.
- **Check it out.** One click or one API call puts every database back and reports per database. A stash is taken first, so even that is reversible.
- **See what moved.** Diff two states, or a state against the live database, down to the changed cell.

Nothing gets added to your application. Testate is a separate service that talks to the databases directly.

## Quick start

```sh
openssl rand -base64 32 > testate.key     # keep this file; every upgrade needs the same key
docker run -d --name testate -p 7378:7378 -v testate-data:/data \
  -e TESTATE_SECRETS_ACTIVE_KEY="$(cat testate.key)" \
  -e TESTATE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me-now-1234 \
  ghcr.io/pt-perkasa-pilar-utama/testate:1.2.0
```

The same image is on Docker Hub as `snowfluke/testate`, under the same tags.

The key encrypts the stored database credentials. Lose it and every saved connection has to be entered again, so keep `testate.key` out of the volume and out of git. If you started a container with a key generated inline, read it back before you remove that container: `docker inspect testate --format '{{range .Config.Env}}{{println .}}{{end}}' | grep TESTATE_SECRETS_ACTIVE_KEY`.

Testate dials the database from inside its container, so `localhost` there means Testate itself. A database in another container on the same machine is reached by its container name once both share a network: `docker network create testate-net`, then `docker network connect testate-net testate` and the same for the database container, and the host is that container's name with the engine's own port. A database running natively on the machine is `host.docker.internal`, which Docker on Linux defines only when the run command above carries `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway`.

Open <http://localhost:7378>, sign in as `admin` with that password, and change it when asked.

Then: add a database under **Databases**, take a state under **States**, break something, click **Check out**. Where to point the host is the one thing that catches people, so read [Connecting a database](docs/CONNECTING.md) before you add the first one.

For anything you rely on, use Compose and an `.env` file: [Deployment plan](docs/DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md). No Docker? There is [one binary per platform](#one-binary-no-docker).

## A look around

**States.** A project opens here: every state, newest first, HEAD marked, Check out on each one.

![The states tab: a timeline of states with HEAD marked, kind, size and author](docs/assets/screens/states.png)

**The API, documented by the instance itself.** Everything the dashboard does is a REST call, and the running instance serves its own reference at `/api/v1/docs`.

![The API reference, rendered by Scalar from the live OpenAPI contract](docs/assets/screens/openapi.png)

**An agent, looking.** Register the MCP endpoint with an agent token and Claude reads the guide, finds the database, and answers in rows. Masked columns stay masked.

![An agent session over MCP: register the server, ask a question, read ten rows with the card column masked](docs/assets/agent-session.svg)

## Where it sits

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph server["Your test server: dev, SIT or UAT"]
    app["Your app"] -- "reads and writes" --> db[("Its databases")]
    t["Testate"] -- "snapshot, put it back" --> db
  end
  qa[Testers] --> t
  dev[Developers] --> t
  ci[CI/CD] --> t
  agent[AI agents] --> t
```

Testate is one container on the same server, or the same network, as the databases. Nothing installs inside your app. Remove the container and nothing remains but the volume.

| The database runs                        | Point the adapter at                             | Details                                                                                               |

## Who it is for

- **QA.** The main user. Test freely, reset in seconds, ask nobody.
- **Developers.** Reproduce a bug from the exact state QA saw it in. Let an agent inspect the data without a VPN and without fear.
- **Infra.** One image, one volume, one reverse proxy line. No reset scripts to babysit.

## What it works with

| Tier     | Engines                                       | What you get                                           |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tabular  | PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB                    | view, snapshot, checkout, diff, extract, edit, import  |
| Document | MongoDB                                       | view, snapshot, checkout, diff, extract                |
| Files    | Object storage (any S3-compatible), SFTP, FTP | view, preview, download, insert, rename, delete, batch |

Every engine here is real, driven over its own protocol, and proven in a contract suite against a real server. S3-compatible means Amazon, Cloudflare R2, Google Cloud Storage, Backblaze B2, MinIO and anything else that speaks the protocol; the [connecting guide](docs/CONNECTING.md#d-an-object-store-that-is-not-amazons) has the endpoint for each.

Also in the box: a data grid with filters, keyset paging and write mode; a read-only SQL console with saved queries; CSV and XLSX import with a dry run; fixture extraction as SQL or JSON; three roles (Administrator, Tester, Guest); an audit log of every write.

## Reset from a pipeline

Every screen sits on the REST API, so a pipeline resets a database with one call before a run:

```sh
curl -sf -X POST "$TESTATE_URL/api/v1/projects/shop/checkouts?wait=120" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TESTATE_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"state_name": "seeded-baseline"}' | jq -r '.data.job.status'
```

Gate the step on the job's `status`, not the HTTP code. The full pattern, tokens, idempotency and the reference are in [CI/CD](docs/CI_CD.md).

## Let an agent look

Testate speaks MCP. An admin creates a token of kind **agent**, scoped to a project, with a role: **Guest** reads, **Tester** may also write to a sandbox, take a state and put one back. The token reaches `/api/v1/mcp` and nothing else.

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http testate https://testate.example.internal/api/v1/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer tst_YOUR_TOKEN"
```

The first tool the agent sees is `help`. Reads run in a read-only transaction, results are capped, column policies mask values before the agent sees them, and every call is audited. Everything else, including what happens when a token expires: [Agent access](docs/AGENT_ACCESS.md).

## Know the limits

Testate is honest about what it is. Read these before you install it.

| Limit                             | What it means                                                                                                                             | What to do                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Databases go one at a time        | One project, several databases: each is snapshotted and restored on its own. Each is correct alone; the set is not guaranteed to line up. | Keep the app idle while you snapshot or reset.                                                                               |
| It only resets what you add       | An untracked database survives a reset, and Testate cannot warn you about a database it has never heard of.                               | Put every database the app writes to in one project.                                                                         |
| One project, one tester at a time | Two testers on one database share every reset. Two projects on one database are worse.                                                    | The connection test warns when another project already tracks that database.                                                 |
| Tabular first                     | PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB get everything. MongoDB gets snapshots and diffs, not edits or imports. Files get a browser.                | Keep the transactional database in the tabular tier.                                                                         |
| It needs a real connection        | Firebase, Firestore, DynamoDB and Cosmos hand you an SDK, not a connection.                                                               | Supabase, Neon, RDS and Cloud SQL all work. On Supabase, use the direct connection, not the pooler.                          |
| Databases only                    | Caches, queues and whatever a service holds in memory stay as they were.                                                                  | Restart the service, or clear its cache, after a reset.                                                                      |
| Microservices are out of scope    | Every limit above compounds across services, and nothing orders the resets.                                                               | Stay inside one service. Add the others as read-only adapters, which can be browsed, snapshotted and diffed but never reset. |

## One binary, no Docker

Every release carries a standalone executable for macOS on Apple silicon, Linux on x86-64 and Windows on x86-64, with the dashboard and the migrations inside it. Download from the [releases page](https://github.com/PT-Perkasa-Pilar-Utama/testate/releases), then:

```sh
chmod +x testate-*-darwin-arm64          # macOS and Linux only
TESTATE_DATA_DIR=./testate-data \
TESTATE_SECRETS_ACTIVE_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
TESTATE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me-now-1234 \
./testate-*-darwin-arm64
```

It listens on 7378 and keeps everything under `TESTATE_DATA_DIR`, which has to be set. Every other variable in `deploy/.env.example` applies the same way.

## Verify a download

Every release is built by this repository's own workflow and leaves a trail you can check without trusting us: SLSA build provenance and a keyless Sigstore signature on the image and on every binary, plus a CycloneDX SBOM.

```sh
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/pt-perkasa-pilar-utama/testate:1.2.0 \
  --repo PT-Perkasa-Pilar-Utama/testate
cosign verify ghcr.io/pt-perkasa-pilar-utama/testate:1.2.0 \
  --certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github.com/PT-Perkasa-Pilar-Utama/testate/' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
```

Both commands hold for `docker.io/snowfluke/testate:1.2.0` too: it is the same manifest, copied by digest and signed again where it lives.

For a binary, run the same two commands on the archive, with `--bundle <archive>.sigstore.json` for cosign; the release also carries `testate-<version>.intoto.jsonl`, the provenance statement for every archive, for a check without network access (`gh attestation verify <archive> --bundle <that file>`). A download that fails either check is not ours; [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) says how to report it.

## Operate it

To upgrade a `docker run` install: pull the new tag, remove the container, run the same command again with the same key and volume and without `TESTATE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, then reconnect any network. The exact steps are under "Upgrade" in the [Deployment plan](docs/DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md). Rolling back a failed migration, backups, and rotating the sealing key: the same plan and [Key rotation](docs/KEY_ROTATION.md). Health lives at `/api/v1/health/live` and `/api/v1/health/ready`, with no credential, for the probes.

## Run it from source

```sh
bun install
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env      # set the key and the admin password
bun run dev                                 # API on :7378, dashboard on :7379
```

`bun run reset:dev --yes --engines`, then `bun run seed:dev`, then `bun run dev`: a clean dev instance holding the demo project the test suite uses, on the databases from `deploy/compose.engines.yml`, with the admin on the password from `apps/api/.env`. [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) has the rest of the commands.
