## ⭐ 如果它帮到了你

这个插件是 [DSH 插件家族](https://github.com/PerryLink)的一员（40+ 个，全部 Apache-2.0）。如果你在用，**给个 star** —— 它不会解锁任何功能，但会让下一个人在搜索里更容易找到它。

*English:* part of a 40+ plugin family for DeepSeek Harness. If it is useful, **a star helps the next person find it** — nothing is gated behind it.


## Compatibility

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| Harness | DeepSeek Harness `dsh-v0.1.7-rc.2` (verified 2026-09-25: dual typecheck rulers + 89 tests + self-contained/artifacts gates; peer range `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0 \|\| >=0.1.5-alpha.1 <0.2.0 \|\| >=0.1.6-0 <0.2.0 \|\| >=0.1.7-0 <0.2.0`). Home of the family's only exercised alpha.2 host smoke (2026-09-11). |
| Node | `^22.19.0 \|\| >=24.0.0` |
| Storage | Any storage-domain backend (JSON or SQLite); the index lives in the host's storage domain |
| Models | None required — the built-in embedder is deterministic hashing (zero downloads) |

## What you get

`dsh-library` turns local md/txt documents into a queryable knowledge base with a quality pipeline your agent can trust:

- **`library_add` / `library_remove` / `library_list`** — import a document by path (chunked and embedded), remove one with **purge verification** (signatures of the removed content are probed against the remaining index and any residue is reported), and list document metadata.
- **`library_search`** — hybrid semantic + keyword ranking, maximal-marginal-relevance diversity re-rank, relevance filtering, and **lost-in-the-middle avoidance** (strongest chunks pinned to head and tail). With `inject: true` the result page is injected into the calling agent; every hit carries a `[n]` source marker and the injection is reconstructable from the `library/inject` session event (host-gated; see Permissions & data).
- **`library_cite_check`** — verify the `[n]` citations in an answer against the search result page with a fuzzy token match AND a semantic similarity check.
- **`library_diagnose`** — chunk-size histogram, near-duplicate chunk pairs, a self-retrieval probe, and the middle-penalty signal.
- **`/library`** — one-line index summaries per library.

```text
document ── library_add ─▶ chunk (sliding window) ─▶ embed (hash / external cmd)
                                  │
                        storage domain (documents / chunks / purges)
                                  │
query ── library_search ─▶ hybrid score ─▶ MMR re-rank ─▶ relevance filter
                                  │                    ─▶ lost-in-middle order
                                  ▼
                    result page with [n] markers ── inject: true ─▶ agent + library/inject event (host-gated)
```

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. install the bundle into your profile
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:PerryLink/dsh-library#main"

# or from npm (published releases)
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-library

# 2. restart and verify the row
dsh --profile web --dump-config | grep -A2 'id: dsh-library'
```

Then ask the agent to import and use a document:

```
> Add ./docs/spec.md to library docs, then answer: what does the spec say about retries? Cite [n] markers.
```

## Install & uninstall

- **git channel** (latest `main`): `dsh plugin --profile web add "github:PerryLink/dsh-library#main"` — the `prepare` script builds with production dependencies only.
- **npm channel** (published releases): `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-library`.
- **tarball channel**: `pnpm pack` in this repo, then `dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-library-<version>.tgz`.
- **uninstall**: `dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-library` (or remove the row from the profile patch).

> If pnpm reports `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS` for this package (esbuild's harmless platform-binary validation), add `allowBuilds: { esbuild: true }` to your `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — the `dsh` CLI prints the exact snippet.

## Configuration

All tunables are Schemastery `Config` fields (changeable from cordis.yml). An id-targeted override replaces the whole row — restate every key you need. `cordis.patch.yml` documents each key inline.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `chunkSize` | `900` | Sliding-window chunk size in characters (≤ 4000) |
| `chunkOverlap` | `120` | Overlap between consecutive windows; must be smaller than `chunkSize` |
| `maxFileBytes` | `5242880` | Files larger than this are rejected on `library_add` |
| `embedding.dims` | `256` | Hash-embedding dimensionality (≥ 8) |
| `embedding.provider` | `hash` | Embedder backend: `hash` (built-in, zero downloads), `command` (external subprocess, requires `embedding.command`), or `ollama` (local Ollama, probed and degraded to `hash` when unreachable) |
| `embedding.command` | `''` | Optional external embedder command (space-separated argv, no shell) over `ctx.subprocess`; setting it selects the `command` provider |
| `embedding.ollamaUrl` / `ollamaModel` | `http://127.0.0.1:11434` / `nomic-embed-text` | Local Ollama endpoint + model for the `ollama` provider (zero cloud) |
| `embedding.timeoutMs` / `graceMs` / `maxOutputBytes` / `maxBatchItems` | `30000` / `1000` / `1048576` / `64` | Embedder subprocess budget |
| `search.topK` | `8` | Results returned after the full pipeline |
| `search.hybridWeight` | `0.6` | 0 = keyword-only, 1 = semantic-only |
| `search.minRelevance` | `0.15` | Chunks below this relevance threshold are filtered out |
| `search.diversityLambda` | `0.5` | MMR trade-off: 1 = pure relevance, 0 = pure diversity |
| `search.lostMiddleHead` / `lostMiddleTail` | `1` / `1` | Strongest chunks pinned to head / tail |
| `search.maxResultChars` | `16000` | Character budget of the model-facing result page |
| `injection.enabled` / `maxChars` | `true` / `12000` | `library_search` inject behavior and budget |
| `citation.windowChars` / `minScore` / `minSemantic` | `150` / `40` / `0.1` | `library_cite_check` thresholds |
| `purge.signatureLength` / `maxProbes` | `4` / `24` | Purge verification signatures and probe budget |
| `diagnose.maxDuplicatePairs` / `sampleCap` / `positionBins` | `24` / `200` / `5` | `library_diagnose` budget caps |

## Tools & surfaces

| Tool | Notes |
|---|---|
| `library_add` | `{ path, library, name? }` → document id; file read through the harness filesystem service |
| `library_remove` | `{ library, documentId }` → removal summary + purge verdict (residue reported) |
| `library_list` | `{ library? }` → document metadata (never text) |
| `library_search` | `{ query, library, topK?, inject? }` → ranked hits with `[n]` markers; `inject: true` seeds the calling agent |
| `library_cite_check` | `{ library, query, answer }` → per-citation valid/invalid verdicts (fuzzy + semantic) |
| `library_diagnose` | `{ library }` → chunk stats, duplicates, self-retrieval, middle penalty |
| `/library [name]` | Command: per-library document/chunk summaries |

## Permissions & data

- **Permissions**: the plugin only reads files you point `library_add` at (through the harness filesystem service and its policy) and writes into its own `dsh_library` storage domain. No network requests; an optional external embedder runs through `ctx.subprocess` without shell interpretation.
- **Data**: chunk text and embeddings live in the host's storage backend (same trust as the deployment's other durable data); the plugin adds no encryption. Document paths and embeddings never enter the session log.
- **Session log**: `library/inject` (id, query, chunk ids, page size) and `library/purge` (verdict) are log-only audit events — the model-visible injected page is reconstructable from them. The append is host-gated: harnesses whose known-type set covers the vocabulary get the events, `ignorable`-envelope builds get them with the marker, and envelope-less builds (0.1.1-rc.2, 0.1.2-rc.1) skip the append — the logged `tool/call` + `tool/result` events remain the reconstructable audit trail there.
0.1.2-rc.1 (adapted 2026-09-02): the session envelope keeps its ignorable field for stored-log read compatibility only - Session.append still cannot stamp it, so audit-gate behavior is unchanged.

## Security boundaries

- **Local by default.** Zero model downloads, zero network calls — scoring is deterministic hashing and token math. Only an explicitly configured embedder command runs code, and its protocol is completeness-checked and output-capped.
- **No fabrication.** Citation checks report what the pipeline can verify; failed repairs and suspicious citations are surfaced honestly, never guessed.
- **Purge is verified.** `library_remove` probes the remaining index with deterministic signatures of the removed content and reports residue instead of assuming success.
- **Fail loud.** Invalid library names, oversized documents, unreadable files, and a configured-but-absent embedder seam all fail the call with a clear error.

## Known limitations

- **Lexical-grade embeddings.** The built-in hash embedder scores surface similarity, not meaning; retrieval quality on paraphrases is lower than a real embedding model — configure `embedding.command` (any subprocess embedder) or `embedding.provider: ollama` (a local Ollama embedding model) for stronger semantics.
- **Local citation model.** `library_cite_check` validates against the search result page (the `[n]` numbering), not against free-form source names; the fuzzy score is a bounded token-sequence partial ratio.
- **No ingestion pipeline.** Documents must be imported by path (`md`/`txt`); PDF/docx extraction is out of scope for v0.1.0.
- **Host-gated audit events.** `library/inject` / `library/purge` are only appended on harnesses that can carry them (see Permissions & data); on the published `0.1.2-rc.1` line (as on earlier envelope-less lines) they are not appended, and every fact stays reconstructable from the tool call/result log.

## Development
