## ⭐ 如果它帮到了你

这个插件是 [DSH 插件家族](https://github.com/PerryLink)的一员（40+ 个，全部 Apache-2.0）。如果你在用，**给个 star** —— 它不会解锁任何功能，但会让下一个人在搜索里更容易找到它。

*English:* part of a 40+ plugin family for DeepSeek Harness. If it is useful, **a star helps the next person find it** — nothing is gated behind it.


## Compatibility

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| Harness | DeepSeek Harness `dsh-v0.1.7-rc.2` (adapted 2026-09-22): the `0.1.7` line replaced the whole settings registration surface (`installSettingsSection` / `SettingsProvider.installSection` / `SettingsNamespace` / `SettingsScope`) with live Config forms, so both halves follow the new contract — a form's namespace is the profile entry id (`memento`), its editable fields are the `.volatile()` ones, and an accepted edit is committed into the running plugin instead of remounting it. The browser half reads that form through `ctx.configForms.get(entryId)` (the `ctx.settingsScope` service is gone). Both halves keep their `installSection` / `settingsScope` branches for the `0.1.2-rc.1`, `0.1.5-alpha.1` and `0.1.6-0` lines the peer range still advertises, and the new `>=0.1.7-0 <0.2.0` clause is what makes the target host itself installable (the old range excluded it by semver's prerelease rule). Still no plugin event-registration surface — `KNOWN_SESSION_EVENT_TYPES` does not carry `memory/*`, and `Session.append`'s third argument only carries a `SurfaceIntent` for surface-eligible types, so the audit gate stays adaptive and skips as before (it says so once per process and in `/memory audit`). Type evidence comes from three faces: the local checkout's built types, the pinned published line in `node_modules`, and the browser half under a DOM lib. |
| Node | `^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0` |
| Platforms | Windows / macOS / Linux (pure host; no native code, no network) |
| Model | Any |

## What you get

`dsh-memento` is a capability seam, not another memory warehouse: a typed `ctx.memory` service, a local SQLite provider (`node:sqlite`, WAL, `0600`, at `$DSH_HOME/dsh-memento/memory.db`), and its consumers — the `memory` tool and a frozen snapshot injected into the system prompt.

- **The approval gate cannot be bypassed.** Every write path (`add` / `replace` / `remove` / `seed`) is forced through the approval waterfall inside the service, not in the tool layer. `writePolicy: ask | auto | off` is model-invisible configuration; `replace` / `remove` / `consolidate` carry the full text of the entries they change in the approval payload, and a denied write still lands a `*-denied` audit row.
- **Model-visible ⟺ logged.** The injected snapshot lands verbatim in `system/message`; every write is reconstructable from `approval/asked` + `approval/decided` + the plugin's own audit table.
- **Bounded and honest.** Hard per-track/per-layer character budgets (default user 2000 / agent 4000). A full store fails with a structured error (usage + limit) — never truncated, never auto-compacted.
- **The audit gap is visible.** `/memory audit` lists the plugin audit table and appends one line when the session-log side is not written: this harness does not know the `memory/*` session event types, and appending unknown types would make the session unloadable, so writes are audited through `approval/asked` + `approval/decided` and the plugin's table instead. The gate is adaptive — the line disappears on its own once the host knows those types.

Two tracks × two layers × per-agent key: a `user` track (facts about the user) and an `agent` track (environment facts and conventions), each split into `user-global` and `workspace` layers, isolated per `agentPreset`. The snapshot is frozen once per session at first prompt assembly and never changes mid-session.

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. install the bundle into your profile
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:PerryLink/dsh-memento#main"

# or from npm (published releases)
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-memento

# 2. restart and verify the row
dsh --profile web --dump-config | grep -A3 'id: memento'
```

## Install & uninstall

- **git channel** (latest `main`): `dsh plugin --profile web add git+https://github.com/PerryLink/dsh-memento.git`.
- **npm channel** (published releases): `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-memento`.
- **tarball channel**: `npm pack` in this repo, then `dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-memento-<version>.tgz`.
- **uninstall**: `dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-memento` (the memory database and session logs are kept).

## Configuration

All tunables are Schemastery `Config` fields (changeable from cordis.yml). Invalid values fail loudly at load. Override under the `memento` row.

**Settings panel.** On the `0.1.7` line the plugin's own `Config` **is** its settings page: the form's namespace is the profile entry id (`memento` — the `id:` of this bundle's row), the editable fields are exactly the ones the plugin declares `.volatile()` (every key below except `enabled`), and an accepted edit is merged into the profile's plugin row and committed into the running plugin — no file editing, no restart. Nearly everything applies live (write policies, language, budgets, limits, proposals, panel, `dbPath` / `auditRetentionDays` via a store reopen, `retrieval.vector` via a retriever swap); what a plugin registers at load time (`snapshotOrder`, tool descriptions) is re-read on reload, and the page marks those fields. Numeric bounds are declared in the schema as well, so an out-of-range edit is refused at write time instead of leaving an unusable config behind. On the older lines (`0.1.2-rc.1`, `0.1.5-alpha.1`, `0.1.6-0`) the same card edits the `dsh-memento` settings namespace exactly as before; with no settings service at all, everything falls back to the composed cordis config. The floating panel button can be hidden from the same page (`panel.enabled`).

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | Master switch; `false` removes the service, tools, snapshot, command, panel, and answerer (not editable from the settings page — a disabled plugin has no settings entry) |
| `panel.enabled` | `true` | Show the web panel's floating button; saving `false` from the settings page hides the 🧠 entry immediately, no reload needed (the settings page itself stays reachable) |
| `dbPath` | `''` → `$DSH_HOME/dsh-memento/memory.db` | Absolute, or relative to `$DSH_HOME` (falls back to `~/.dsh` on Windows) |
| `budgets.user.userGlobal` | `2000` | Hard character budget for the user track's user-global layer |
| `budgets.user.workspace` | `2000` | Hard character budget for the user track's workspace layer |
| `budgets.agent.userGlobal` | `4000` | Hard character budget for the agent track's user-global layer |
| `budgets.agent.workspace` | `4000` | Hard character budget for the agent track's workspace layer |
| `writePolicy` | `'ask'` | Default write policy: `ask` / `auto` / `off` (model-invisible) |
| `writePolicies` | `{}` | Per-track/scope or per-source overrides (e.g. `user/workspace`, `source:claude`) |
| `language` | `'en'` | Model-visible and command output language: `en` / `zh` |
| `snapshotOrder` | `-50` | Snapshot section order (after harness identity, before persona) |
| `maxEntriesPerQuery` | `20` | Default per-query result cap (hard-capped at 1000) |
| `commandListLimit` | `50` | Entries rendered per `/memory list` / `query` |
| `commandAuditLimit` | `10` | Audit rows rendered per `/memory audit` |
| `recall.historyLimitDefault` | `8` | `memory_recall` sessions scanned by default |
| `recall.snippetCap` | `5` | `memory_recall` snippets per session |
| `recall.snippetChars` | `300` | `memory_recall` snippet characters |
| `recall.windowDays` | `30` | `memory_recall` recency window in days |
| `retrieval.vector` | `false` | Semantic recall switch: `true` enables `memory_recall` vector recall (fake hash embedding) when an embedding provider is available; otherwise degrades to substring |
| `panelEntriesLimit` | `200` | Web panel entries page size |
| `panelAuditLimit` | `20` | Web panel audit rows by default |
| `auditRetentionDays` | `0` | Audit retention (0 = keep forever) |
| `proposals.enabled` | `true` | Auto-capture a memory proposal after each successful compaction |
| `proposals.maxChars` | `2000` | Proposal character cap |
| `proposals.maxPending` | `8` | Pending proposal cap |

## Tools & surfaces

| Surface | Kind | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `memory` | tool | add/replace/remove/consolidate/query with Save/Skip guidance; writes ride the approval gate |
| `memory_recall` | tool | Bounded memory matches plus recent session-history matches |
| `/memory` | command | `list` · `query` · `add` · `remove` · `consolidate` · `proposals` · `budgets` · `audit` · `export` · `import <path>` · `adapters` |
| web panel | client drawer | Read-only: browse entries, search, budget bars, audit tail; the floating entry button can be hidden (`panel.enabled`) |
| settings section | DSH settings sidebar → `dsh-memento` | Edit every config field except `enabled` without touching files (namespace = the `memento` profile entry on the `0.1.7` line, the `dsh-memento` settings namespace before it); live vs reload-required timing is marked on the page |

## MCP server

`dsh-memento` ships a read-only stdio **MCP server** (`dsh-memento-mcp`) so external MCP clients (Claude, Codex, …) can search the memory store without a harness. It speaks JSON-RPC 2.0 over newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON) — one JSON object per line, no `Content-Length` framing.

**Read-only.** The database is opened with `node:sqlite` `readOnly: true` (no migrations, no WAL writes, no recall-count bump); a missing database returns empty results instead of crashing.

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `memory_search` | `{query, limit?}` → ranked entries (case-insensitive substring via the retrieval Provider seam) |
| `memory_stats` | `{}` → `{total, namespaces}` entry count + per-track/scope overview |

Run it directly:

```sh
node bin/mcp-server.mjs
# or, after npm install: npx dsh-memento-mcp
```

The database path is `$DSH_MEMENTO_DB_PATH` (absolute, or relative to `$DSH_HOME`); it defaults to `$DSH_HOME/dsh-memento/memory.db`.

Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`) example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dsh-memento": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "dsh-memento-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DSH_MEMENTO_DB_PATH": "/home/you/.dsh/dsh-memento/memory.db"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The server is read-only: no network, no writes, no approval gate — search and stats only.

## How it's different

| Plugin | What it is | dsh-memento's difference |
|---|---|---|
| dsh-memory-evolve | memory warehouse / evolution loops | a typed service seam, approval gate, and session-log audit; no warehouse ambition |
| dsh-mnemon | memory store helper | protocol + gate + audit, not another store |
| dsh-kb-sieve | knowledge-base sieving | no retrieval engineering: small-corpus substring search, cross-session recall via `session_search`/`sessionQuery` |
| dsh-tdai-memory | task-driven memory tooling | budgets are per track×layer and enforced in the service, not best-effort |
| claude-bridge | Claude Code bridging | DSH-native; a future `seed(source:'claude')` path lets a bridge feed the same store |
| dsh-external/Recall | external agent memory | local-first, zero-network, rides DSH's own approval seam |
| Official MCP memory examples | DSH's stated "memory = external MCP" position | the **native first-party** complement: same goal, no external server; both coexist |

The name is **`dsh-memento`** (published on npm and GitHub). Not `dsh-recall` (confusable with dsh-external/Recall), not the deleted legacy name `dsh-memory`.

## dsh-memory-protocol v1

`dsh-memento` is the community rehearsal of the DSH memory protocol — a candidate shape for an official `ctx.memory` seam. The protocol normalizes this plugin's seam into a cross-plugin contract:

- **Entry spec** — two tracks × two layers × per-agent key, plus short `tags` (≤16 × ≤32 chars) and a per-entry `version` that increments on every `replace`.
- **Write semantics** — idempotent unique-substring conditional writes; approve-what-you-see payloads (`replace` / `remove` / `consolidate` carry the full text they change).
- **Audit contract** — every write reconstructable from `approval/asked` + `approval/decided` + the provider ledger.
- **Budget model** — `BUDGET_EXCEEDED` / `AMBIGUOUS_MATCH` semantics.
- **Schema versioning** — migration rules with loud version checks.

- **Spec** — [docs/protocol-v1.md](docs/protocol-v1.md) (中文: [protocol-v1.zh.md](docs/protocol-v1.zh.md)); normative JSON Schema at [docs/schemas/dsh-memory-protocol-v1.schema.json](docs/schemas/dsh-memory-protocol-v1.schema.json).

**Adapter registry** — `ctx.memoryAdapters` (`register` / `list` / `adapt` / `export`) lets third-party memory plugins speak the protocol by registering a pure data converter (reversible `register()`; import rides the approval-gated `seed`, export is read-only). Onboarding: [docs/adapters-guide.md](docs/adapters-guide.md) (中文: [adapters-guide.zh.md](docs/adapters-guide.zh.md)).

| Built-in adapter | External format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `mem0` | mem0 fact collections (`{facts: [{memory, metadata?}]}`) | `metadata.category` / `metadata.tags` become tags; raw `messages` arrays are rejected — adapters convert, never extract |
| `hermes-memory-md` | Hermes `memory.md` (`## section` + bullets) | section names become tags; non-bullet prose fails loudly |
| `claude-code-memory-md` | `CLAUDE.md`-style markdown (headings, bullets, paragraphs) | bullets and paragraphs become entries; section names become tags |

**Conformance suite** — [test/protocol-conformance/](test/protocol-conformance/README.md): a distributable case set any provider claiming compatibility runs (`node test/protocol-conformance/run.mjs --provider ./your-factory.mjs`); this repo's CI runs it against its own provider as the golden reference (`npm run test:conformance`).

- **Upstream proposal** — [docs/upstream-proposal.md](docs/upstream-proposal.md) (中文: [upstream-proposal.zh.md](docs/upstream-proposal.zh.md)): why the official `ctx.memory` seam should adopt the protocol, the differences, and the migration path.

## Permissions & data

- **Permissions**: declares `harness:tool`, `filesystem:read`, `filesystem:write`, and `network:none` / `subprocess:none` / `shell:none` / `python:none` / `credentials:none` in its workshop manifest. Write approval rides the official approval seam.
- **Data**: local SQLite database (`0600`), zero network, zero credentials.
- **Session log**: audit completeness comes from the approval pair (`approval/asked` + `approval/decided`) plus the plugin's own audit table; the session-log side of that gap is declared in `/memory audit` and disappears once the host registers `memory/*`.

## Security boundaries

- **Public services only.** Consumes `tools`, `systemPrompt`, and the approval seam; no engine / agent-loop / apiproxy / official-UI changes.
- **Zero network, zero credentials.** Local database with POSIX file mode `0600`.
- **Fail loud.** Corrupt DB, newer schema, or invalid config fails at load; full budgets and ambiguous substring matches fail with structured errors.
- **One process, one store.** Multiple sessions share the SQLite store; two processes sharing one `$DSH_HOME` write the same file (last-writer-wins under SQLite locking).

## Known limitations

- **Session events are declared, not yet emitted (rc.2).** `memory/added|updated|removed|recalled|snapshot` are merge-declared, but rc.2 has no registration surface for out-of-repo event types; emission turns on once a harness build registers them.
- **`ask` policy needs an answerer.** With no UI/ACP answerer composed, writes fail closed.
- **No FTS5 indexing.** Substring search runs on case-insensitive `instr` (correct for CJK).

## What we learned from the terminal memories

`dsh-memento` is not a port of Claude Code, Codex, or Hermes — but its design deliberately absorbed the parts each got right, and refused the parts that hurt:

| Terminal memory | What it got right | What dsh-memento adopted |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** — `CLAUDE.md` | hierarchical plain-text memory files (user-level → project-level), human-readable and human-editable, merged automatically into every session | plain-text entries; `user-global` / `workspace` layers merged per session; a store you can browse, `export`, and audit — transparency as a feature |
| **Codex** — `AGENTS.md` | per-directory scoped instructions auto-discovered and injected with zero model friction | the `workspace` layer keyed by the session cwd (Windows case-insensitive); the frozen snapshot injected automatically at session start |
| **Hermes** — `memory.md` | proactive memory saves and the security lesson that a gate enforced only in the tool layer is bypassable by late tool injection | the `memory` tool with Save/Skip guidance + approval-gated auto-capture proposals; the gate lives inside `ctx.memory`'s write methods, not in the tool layer |

Sources: [Claude Code memory](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory) · [Codex AGENTS.md](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/agents-md) · [Hermes memory](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/website/docs/user-guide/features/memory.md) · [Hermes #48181](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/48181).

And the parts deliberately refused: hidden auto-summarization into model-private state (compaction summaries here become **pending proposals** that wait for a human approve/dismiss), warehouse/vector-store ambitions, and any write that lacks a human-visible approval or audit trail. Also adopted: Hermes's documented caveat that two processes sharing one home directory write the same memory file — see Security boundaries.

## Development

```sh
npm install              # node ^22.19 || >=24
npm test                 # node --test: 187 tests
npm run lint             # oxlint
npm run test:conformance # dsh-memory-protocol v1 conformance suite
npm run typecheck        # host face vs a local D:\deepseek-harness checkout (prints "not verifiable" and exits 0 without one)
npm run typecheck:ci     # host face vs the pinned published line in node_modules
npm run check:client     # browser half (DOM lib) type gate
npm run check:coverage   # line-coverage gate
npm run check:readmes    # five-language README consistency gate
npm run verify:self-contained # reject out-of-repo dependency specs
npm run verify:artifacts # artifact presence + syntax + import
```

`lib/` is zero-DSH-dependency (node: builtins only); DSH imports exist only in `index.mjs`.

### Install from the DSH Desktop Market

All PerryLink plugins are browsable in the built-in DSH Desktop Market: **Market → Sources → add source → paste** `https://perrylink-dsh-catalog.perrylink.workers.dev/catalog-source.json` **→ select it**. Installation still goes through the Market's npm-identity verification and your confirmation.
