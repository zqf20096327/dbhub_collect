> **Hey, before you scroll.** Nodyx isn't trying to fight Discord, and it isn't trying to be the only open alternative. There are great projects out there. Matrix, Stoat, Fluxer, Mattermost, Rocket.Chat, Discourse, Haven and others. And we genuinely want you to know about them. We list them, with their GitHub repos, on a page we wrote ourselves: **[Why Nodyx, and the other alternatives we respect](https://nodyx.dev/why-nodyx)**.

## Why Nodyx

- **Most communities don't own where they live.** Years of history, knowledge, and memories sit on platforms that can change rules, ban accounts, or disappear. That's not malice, that's how closed systems work by default.
- **Self-hosting today is fragmented.** Forum, real-time chat, voice, and a public homepage usually mean stitching five separate tools together.
- **Nodyx ships them in one install** so a community can fully own its presence, text, voice, and homepage, on hardware its admins control.

One command. Your server. Forever.

### Built on

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend API | **TypeScript** + **Fastify v5** + Socket.IO, `nodyx-core/` |
| Frontend | **SvelteKit 5** + Tailwind v4 + TipTap editor, `nodyx-frontend/` |
| Database | **PostgreSQL 16** (FTS, migrations) + **Redis 7** (sessions, presence) <sup>[¹](docs/en/ARCHITECTURE.md#why-postgresql-16-and-not-17-or-18)</sup> |
| Voice relay | **nodyx-turn**, Rust STUN/TURN (replaces coturn, 2.9 MB binary) |
| P2P tunneling | **nodyx-relay**, Rust TCP tunnel (home server, no open ports) |
| Real-time | WebRTC P2P mesh + Socket.IO fallback |
| Auth (optional) | **Nodyx Signet**, ECDSA P-256 passwordless PWA, `nodyx-authenticator/` |
| Process manager | **PM2** under a dedicated `nodyx` system user |
| Reverse proxy | **Caddy**, automatic Let's Encrypt TLS |

> **No Docker required.** The installer deploys Node.js + PostgreSQL + Redis + Caddy + PM2 natively. `docker-compose.yml` is provided for local development only.

---

## Security

Self-hosting your community means the responsibility for keeping it safe sits with you. Nodyx is built to make that responsibility smaller, not bigger.

| Surface | How it's handled |
|---|---|
| Passwords | Argon2id, OWASP-recommended parameters, transparent migration off any legacy bcrypt hash |
| Direct messages | End-to-end encrypted, ECDH P-256 + AES-256-GCM. Private keys never leave the browser, the server only ever sees ciphertext |
| Sessions | JWT + Redis, configurable TTL, forced logout on demand |
| Two-factor auth | TOTP (Google Authenticator, Aegis, Bitwarden) or Nodyx Signet, a passwordless ECDSA P-256 PWA |
| Rate limiting | Trusted proxy chain scoped explicitly, so a forged `X-Forwarded-For` can't impersonate an internal request or dodge a limit |
| Every API input | Validated against a Zod schema, parameterized SQL only, no string concatenation |
| Every response | CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS headers, sanitized HTML rendering |
| Backups | Proven nightly by an automated restore, not just a file copy sitting untested |

Found a vulnerability? **Do not open a public issue.** Report it privately to `security@nodyx.org` or through [GitHub's private advisories](https://github.com/Pokled/nodyx/security/advisories/new). Acknowledged within 48 hours, assessed within 7 days, credited in the release notes unless you'd rather stay anonymous.

## The internet broke something.

Closed platforms ended up holding more conversations than the open web ever did. Not by malice, by default. They were free, easy, and everyone was already there.

But ten years of discussions, tutorials, and collective knowledge now sit behind login walls. Invisible to search engines. Bound to terms of service written in a Delaware courtroom. Gone when the platform decides.

**You never owned any of it.**

---

## Nodyx gives it back.

One command. Your server. Your rules. Your community, permanently.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://nodyx.org/install.sh | bash
```

Works on a Raspberry Pi behind a home router. No domain. No open ports. No cloud account.

---

## Where each project shines

The community-tools landscape isn't a battle. Each project optimizes for different things, and the right pick depends on what you're building. Here's how we'd recommend it to a friend:

| Project | What it does best | Where it fits |
|---|---|---|
| **Discord** | Real-time voice + chat for closed groups, mobile-first, 10+ years of bot ecosystem | If your community is private and ad-hoc |
| **Matrix** ([Element](https://github.com/element-hq/element-web)) | Federated protocol with bridges to almost everything (Discord, Slack, Telegram, IRC, ...) | If interoperability is non-negotiable |
| **[Discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse)** | Indexed, searchable forums and knowledge bases | If long-form async discussion is your core |
| **[Mattermost](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost)** / **[Rocket.Chat](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat)** | Enterprise compliance, Slack-replacement at scale | If you have a procurement team |
| **[Haven](https://github.com/ancsemi/Haven)** | Privacy-first chat, zero cloud, native Windows/Linux/Android clients, no telemetry | If keeping every byte on your own machine matters most |
| **[Stoat](https://github.com/stoatchat/self-hosted)** (ex-Revolt) / **[Fluxer](https://github.com/fluxerapp/fluxer)** | Discord-shaped UI, easy migration | If your members already know Discord |
| **Lemmy** | Federated, Reddit-style threaded forums | If you want a fediverse-native presence |
| **Nodyx** | Forum + chat + voice + canvas + homepage builder, in one self-hosted install with a P2P relay for home servers | If you want to fully own a multi-format community on your own hardware |

> Nodyx is **the only project** combining all of those formats in a single install, but if you only need one or two, another tool above may fit you better.
>
> [Read our honest take, including the alternatives we respect →](https://nodyx.dev/why-nodyx)

### What's inside the Nodyx single install

**Talk, in every form**
Indexed forum with canonical URLs, JSON-LD and a sitemap · real-time chat with replies, pins, reactions, unfurls · P2P voice channels with zero Big Tech relay in between · ephemeral whisper rooms for a side conversation that isn't meant to last.

**Build and create, together**
A collaborative P2P canvas for whiteboarding in real time · WebRTC DataChannels carrying typing indicators and reactions peer-to-peer · a rich article editor with a table of contents, image resize handles, protected code blocks and two-column layouts, all safe through the sanitizer on the way back out.

**Own your front door**
A drag-and-drop **Homepage Builder**, rows and columns on a 12-unit grid · an **Extension SDK** with a real security substrate (sandboxed identity, cloistered storage, a network proxy that pins the destination address), install from [extensions.nodyx.org](https://extensions.nodyx.org) in one click, no rebuild.

**Play together, without leaving the call**
Games and activities dock right inside a voice channel while you talk, a Play Store style gallery to pick one, full screen when you want it, the same extension surface as the marketplace above.

**Run it from a spare laptop**
Home server support with no port forwarding and no domain required · a federated community directory with cross-instance search · a collaborative jukebox, an event calendar with maps and RSVP, an asset library for frames, badges and banners, passwordless login via ECDSA P-256.

**Show what you make**
A public media showcase at `/musique`, categories and tracks managed entirely from the admin, reorder with a click, a provenance PDF generated on demand for anything you need to prove was made in-house. Title, subtitle and banner are editable too, not tied to any single use case.

**Keep it yours to moderate**
**OctoGuard**, native auto-moderation (regex/word/link/emoji-flood, ReDoS-safe via Google `re2`), a welcome bot, custom commands, mutes, signed webhooks, every switch admin-tunable and off by default.

**Stream without stitching five tools together**
A native **Streamer Hub**: Soundboard with ID3 tags and a viewer queue, a `!ns` Twitch chat command, a mobile multi-page Stream Deck, seven OBS browser-source overlay types, and audio playlists with per-playlist OBS scenes.

---

## Homepage Builder + Widget SDK

Nodyx ships with a **drag-and-drop Homepage Builder** (rows split into resizable columns on a 12-unit grid, 9 native widgets, per-widget audience rules, draft/publish) and a complete **Extension SDK**, plain JavaScript Custom Elements, no React, no Vue, no npm required. Any developer can package an extension as a `.zip` and install it on any Nodyx instance in one click, no rebuild, no deploy. An extension runs sandboxed: a projected identity instead of real accounts, storage cloistered per extension, network egress through a proxy that pins the target address. **[extensions.nodyx.org](https://extensions.nodyx.org)** hosts the marketplace, the registry and the index, games playable inside a voice channel included.

→ **[Build your first widget](https://nodyx.dev/create-widget)**, step-by-step SDK guide for non-developers

---

## Streamer Hub, your whole live stream from Nodyx

Nodyx ships a complete **Streamer Hub**: a native Soundboard (drag-and-drop upload, automatic ID3 tags, Redis-backed viewer queue, `!ns` Twitch chat command with fuzzy matching), a mobile multi-page Stream Deck, seven OBS browser-source overlay types (alert, goal, timer, ticker, leaderboard, clips, soundboard) with an OBS-style Scenes composer, and two-way Twitch chat integration. Start OBS, then barely touch it again. No wiring three SaaS together, no monthly bots, your community owns the whole setup.

---

## The P2P Stack, 100% handwritten Rust

This is where Nodyx goes further than anyone else. **nodyx-turn** is a 2.9MB Rust STUN/TURN server that replaces coturn (RFC 5389 + 5766 + 6062, zero coturn dependency in production). **nodyx-relay** is a Rust P2P TCP tunnel that runs Nodyx behind a home router with no domain, no port forwarding, no cloud account, validated on a real Raspberry Pi 4 with zero open ports. On top of both, WebRTC DataChannels move typing indicators and emoji reactions peer-to-peer at under 5ms, with automatic Socket.IO fallback under strict NAT.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

The installer handles everything automatically. Your system only needs **`curl`** and **`git`** to get started.

```bash
# Ubuntu / Debian
apt-get install -y git curl
```

**PM2 memory limits are automatically tuned to your machine:**

| Total RAM | nodyx-core | nodyx-frontend | Auto-swap | Works on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| < 1.5 GB | 256 MB | 192 MB | 2 GB created | Raspberry Pi 1 GB |
| 1.5 - 3 GB | 384 MB | 256 MB | 1 GB if needed | RPi 4 / small VPS |
| ≥ 3 GB | 512 MB | 512 MB | 1 GB if needed | Standard VPS |

> Raspberry Pi: use a **64-bit OS** (Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit or Ubuntu ARM64). 32-bit is not supported.

### One-click install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://nodyx.org/install.sh | bash
```

Or clone first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pokled/Nodyx.git && cd Nodyx && sudo bash install.sh
```

The installer offers **three network modes**:

| Mode | Requirements | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Nodyx Relay** *(recommended)* | Nothing, outbound TCP only | `yourclub.nodyx.org` in minutes |
| **Open ports** | Ports 80 + 443, domain or IP | Let's Encrypt HTTPS, full control |
| **Cloudflare Tunnel** | CF account + own domain | Your custom domain, no open ports |

> **Nodyx Relay** is the recommended default, works on a Raspberry Pi behind a home router.
> No domain. No port forwarding. No cloud account. Just run the script.

Installs automatically: **Node.js 22, PostgreSQL 16, Redis 7, Caddy (HTTPS), PM2, nodyx-turn** (Rust STUN/TURN).  
Generates secrets, runs all DB migrations, creates your admin account. **No Docker. No manual configuration.**

> Supported: Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04, Debian 11 / 12 / 13.

→ **[Complete installation guide (EN)](docs/en/INSTALL.md)**  
→ **[Guide d'installation complet (FR)](docs/fr/INSTALL.md)**

### Updating an existing instance

```bash
cd /var/www/nexus && git pull && \
  cd nodyx-core && npm run build && sudo -u nodyx pm2 restart nodyx-core && \
  cd ../nodyx-frontend && npm run build && sudo -u nodyx pm2 restart nodyx-frontend
```

Database migrations are applied automatically on startup, no manual SQL needed.

├── ecosystem.config.js  → PM2 process config (production)
└── docker-compose.yml   → Local development only, not used in production installs
```

### Federation, how it works

Each Nodyx instance runs a **Gossip Protocol** scheduler that periodically pings the central directory (`nodyx.org/api/directory`). Instances share their public metadata (name, slug, URL, member count) and are discoverable via the `/discover` page on any instance. Events (calendar) federate across instances through the same gossip mechanism. There is no dependency on ActivityPub, the protocol is intentionally minimal and self-contained.

## What's built. What's coming.

Nodyx has shipped 12 major releases since February 2026: the forum, chat and voice foundation, a full paranoid security audit (Argon2id, honeypots, fail2ban, 2FA), private E2E-encrypted DMs, a Homepage Builder with an Extension SDK and its own marketplace, games that dock inside a voice channel, a native Streamer Hub, a verified backup system with one-click restore, OctoGuard native auto-moderation, and now an experimental Rust SFU carrying voice and screen sharing through your own server.

## The Vision

Nodyx is not a Discord alternative.

It is a different answer to a different question.

Discord asked: *"How do we grow fast and capture communities?"*  
Nodyx asks: *"How do we give communities sovereignty over their own existence?"*

Every Nodyx instance is a sovereign node. It runs where you run it, a VPS, a Pi, a spare laptop. It stores what you choose to store. It shares what you choose to share. It shuts down when you decide, not when a company pivots.

The internet was decentralized by design. SMTP, IRC, NNTP, anyone could run a server and talk to anyone else's server. That was the promise. Big Tech centralized it into silos over two decades.

**Nodyx is the promise, kept.**

And it spreads the same way. Each instance that goes live exposes others to the idea. Each public event indexed by Google brings in someone new. Each community that chooses sovereignty inspires another.

> *"Fork us if we betray you."*, AGPL-3.0

## Contributing

Nodyx belongs to its community.

1. Browse [open Issues](https://github.com/Pokled/Nodyx/issues) or open a [Discussion](https://github.com/Pokled/Nodyx/discussions)
2. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/en/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a PR
3. Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), written in English

Contribute freely, no prior validation required:

```
docs/        →  improve or translate documentation
docs/ideas/  →  design thinking, UX proposals, new ideas
```

The core (`nodyx-core/src/`) requires discussion first, open an Issue.

### Translate Nodyx

Nodyx ships in 8 languages. French and English are complete, the core interface is translated in all of them, and the rest is open.

**[nodyx.org/translate](https://nodyx.org/translate)** shows the exact state of every language, live avatars of who last worked on it, and links straight to the file you would edit.

No account to create, no tool to install, no platform in the middle. Each language is one flat JSON file in `nodyx-frontend/src/lib/locales/`. Pick your language, fill in the missing keys, leave every `{{variable}}` alone, open a Pull Request. CI checks the placeholders, so translating cannot break the app.

Two people already brought a whole language in this way, and both are in the Nodyx Stars below.

## Nodyx Stars, Contributors

Every external contribution earns a star. Every Star goes on [our Hall of Fame](CONTRIBUTORS.md), with avatar, profile link, and rank. **Recognition is not optional here.** Open source without recognition is just free labor, and that's not how we roll.
