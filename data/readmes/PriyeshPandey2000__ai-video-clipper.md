# Clipper

Open-source alternative to OpusClip, Descript & Submagic. Turn long recordings into viral shorts for TikTok, Reels & YouTube Shorts — runs fully local, bring your own API key, no subscription, no watermark.

**Mac only for now.** Windows support planned.

## What it does

- Transcribes video locally via Whisper (no data leaves your machine)
- AI detects the best clips with reasons; the app ranks them with display scores
- Review, trim, and approve clips in a visual editor
- Export clips as 9:16 vertical video with burned-in subtitles
- Export full episode with filler words and silences removed

## Install

**macOS, Apple Silicon (M1 or later).** Windows support planned.

1. Download the latest `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/PriyeshPandey2000/ai-video-clipper/releases/latest)
2. Open it, drag Clipper to Applications
3. Launch Clipper, add your [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com) (free) in Settings

The app is signed and notarized — no Gatekeeper warnings.

### Build from source

For development or contributing. Requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PriyeshPandey2000/ai-video-clipper.git
cd ai-video-clipper
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

The script installs Node.js, pnpm, dependencies, and the bundled FFmpeg/Whisper. It also creates a `.env` template.

Add your Groq key to `.env`:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## How it works

Think of Clipper as an **assembly line**, not a video editor. A long recording goes in one end, ready-to-post shorts come out the other. You just review the parts the AI picks.

    C --> D["4 · Review & approve"]:::human
    D --> E["5 · Export 9:16 shorts"]:::step
```

1. Drop a video file into the app
2. Pick a Whisper model and click Transcribe
3. AI suggests the best clips with reasons; the app assigns display scores — review and approve
4. Toggle 9:16 reframe if needed, drag to set crop position
5. Click Export Clips or Export Episode

## Architecture

The packages are pure, stateless "stations" — no package but `database` ever touches SQLite. One conductor, [`apps/desktop/src/main/ipc.ts`](apps/desktop/src/main/ipc.ts), drives every station in order and persists the result after each one. The UI lives in [`apps/desktop/src/renderer`](apps/desktop/src/renderer) and only ever talks to the conductor over IPC.
