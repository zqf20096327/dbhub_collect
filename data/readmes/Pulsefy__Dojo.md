**Launch. Pump. Own.**  
The simplest, fairest, and cheapest meme coin & token launchpad on **Stellar**.

Dojo lets anyone create a viral meme coin in under 2 minutes — no coding required. Upload a funny meme, choose a ticker, and launch with a transparent **bonding curve** that automatically bootstraps liquidity on the Stellar DEX.

Built for speed, low fees, and community fun — perfect for creators in Nigeria and across Africa.

## ✨ Why Dojo?

*   **⚡ Ultra-cheap & instant** — Launch and trade for pennies with 3-5 second finality.
*   **⚖️ Fair by design** — Bonding curve prevents sniping and gives everyone equal opportunity.
*   **🌌 Stellar-native** — Powered by Soroban smart contracts with optional **X-Ray ZK stealth mode** for private early launches.
*   **📱 Mobile-first** — Seamless experience with Freighter wallet on phones.
*   **🤝 Fully open-source** — Built by the community, governed by the community.

**Tagline:** *Turn your meme into a movement on Stellar.*
