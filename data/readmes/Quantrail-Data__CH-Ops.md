## What is CHOps?

CHOps is for the people who run ClickHouse&reg; themselves: data platform teams, DBAs, and the DevOps engineer who inherited the cluster. CHOps brings the daily work of operating ClickHouse&reg; into one browser UI. You find a slow query, stop a runaway, check replication, watch merges, or review access with a click, not a command.

ClickHouse® includes basic tools, such as the Play UI, a simple dashboard, and clickhouse-client. These are useful, but they are not enough to operate a cluster. You still write queries against the right system table, on the right node, and you must know which table that is. CHOps brings this work into one UI. Then cluster operations are no longer the job of one or two specialists. The whole team can do them.

Point CHOps at your cluster. It reads everything it needs over HTTP. You install nothing on your ClickHouse&reg; servers.

**What it does**

- Shows every query that runs right now. You sort by memory, runtime, or rows read, and you can kill queries.
- Searches query history. You find what was slow, when, and who ran it.
- Tracks merges, mutations, parts, replication lag, and the distributed DDL queue.
- Provides a SQL editor with autocomplete, tabs, cost estimates, and EXPLAIN.
- Saves queries with their parameter defaults. Tomorrow's check is one click.
- Exports results in 22 formats, such as CSV, JSON, Parquet, and ORC. Compression is optional.
- Builds charts and dashboards from your own queries. Filters drive every chart at once.
- Sends email alerts when a threshold you define is crossed.
- Runs BACKUP and RESTORE against S3-compatible storage. It lists what you already have.
- Manages ClickHouse&reg; users, roles, and grants on one screen.
- Reads clusters that run under a Kubernetes operator and keeps the host list current.

The [Feature Overview](#feature-overview) covers all of it in more detail.

**Why use it**

- It answers in seconds. You do not need to know where ClickHouse&reg; keeps the data.
- It gives one place for the whole cluster, not one session per node.
- It runs as a single binary or a container that you host. Your credentials and query history stay with you.
- It is free and open source under the Apache License 2.0.
- It does not replace `clickhouse-client`. The SQL editor is there when you want to write queries yourself.

**Your ClickHouse&reg; deployment does not matter.** If CHOps can reach the HTTP endpoint, it works:

| Your ClickHouse® runs on | Connect via | Kubernetes Insights |
|---|---|---|
| Bare metal or a VM | Direct connection | no |
| Docker or Docker Compose | Direct connection | no |
| Kubernetes with the Altinity® operator (AKOC) | Kubernetes tab | yes |
| Kubernetes with the official ClickHouse® operator (OCKO) | Kubernetes tab | yes, early access |
| Kubernetes with no operator | Direct connection | no |
| ClickHouse® Cloud, Altinity.Cloud®, other managed services | Direct connection | no |

Clusters that run under a Kubernetes operator get more than a connection. You pick the installation instead of typing host names. The list stays correct as the cluster scales up or down. You also get eight extra screens for pods, storage, networking, and events. See [ClickHouse® Running in Kubernetes](#clickhouse-running-in-kubernetes).

CHOps stores its own configuration (alerts, dashboards, users, cluster definitions, and so on) in a small SQLite file on disk. It does not touch your ClickHouse&reg; data or schema. It changes data only when you run a query that does so.

CHOps is built on [Bun](https://bun.sh), with a React frontend and an Express backend. It compiles to a single self-contained binary with no runtime dependencies. To deploy, you copy one file to a server.

---

## Feature Overview

CHOps groups its features into ten sidebar sections. Each item below is a page or a toolset. The [full documentation](https://ch-ops.io/docs) covers every feature in depth. This list is short.

A global page search is available everywhere. Open it from the navbar Search button, the floating bubble, or Ctrl/Cmd+K. Then type a page name, a feature, a heading, or on-page text to jump straight there.

**Overview**: cluster health. A live query monitor with sortable columns, per-user memory and read-volume charts, a detail popup for any running query, and bulk kill by selection. Query analytics and log. Tables and parts inspection. Merges and mutations. The distributed DDL queue. Kubernetes Insights for clusters under the Altinity&reg; or the official ClickHouse&reg; operator.

**Tools**: the SQL editor is a full IDE. It has tabbed queries, schema-aware autocomplete, typed query parameters, and a configurable row ceiling. Every EXPLAIN type is a toggle (indexes, projections, distributed, sorting, actions, analyzer passes), so you do not have to remember the syntax. Save a query and it keeps its parameter defaults, ready to rerun. You can export and share saved queries. A cost estimate shows what a query will read before you run it. Comparison mode puts two runs side by side with their metrics. The export wizard writes results in 22 formats, with optional gzip, zstd, or zip. It runs in the background, so a large extract does not block the browser.

Tools also has an interactive flame-graph query profiler, a per-second query metrics timeline, Schema Studio for guided table creation, and Qurioz, an AI assistant that turns plain-English questions into ClickHouse&reg; SQL.

**Custom Dashboards**: a chart builder with 10 or more chart types, configurable grid dashboards, and a chart browser. Every chart has an HTML control toolbar (zoom, save as PNG, and full screen). Add a parameter to a chart's SQL and it becomes a dashboard filter by itself. The filter is shared with every chart that uses the same name, so one control updates them all.

**Indexes**: data-skipping index visualization, projection management, and secondary index creation.

**Logs**: crash, error, and text log viewers with calendar heatmaps and filtered search.

**Monitoring**: many system charts, plus a DVR-style playback mode to replay historical metrics frame by frame.

**Alerting**: SQL-based alert rules with threshold evaluation, an email notification channel, and a live firing-alert marquee.

**Access Control**: ClickHouse&reg; user and role management, grant visualization, and settings-profile editing.

**Backups**: BACKUP and RESTORE to S3-compatible storage, backup discovery, and storage profile management.

**Administration**: CHOps user management with four roles, multi-cluster configuration, application-data backup, and AI provider key management.

## Run CHOps

The fastest way to run CHOps is the Docker image, Docker Compose, or a prebuilt binary. You do not need Bun or a build step.

You need a ClickHouse&reg; server that you can reach over the network. You need its host name, its HTTP port (usually 8123), and its credentials. Confirm the server is reachable:

```bash
curl http://your-clickhouse-host:8123/ping
# Should print: Ok.
```

CHOps needs a session secret and one super-admin account. The `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` must be 32 characters or more. Make one with `openssl rand -hex 32`.

### Run with Docker

```bash
# 1. Make a session secret.
export ENCRYPTION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# 2. Start the container.
docker run -d --name chops -p 3000:3000 \
  -e ENCRYPTION_SECRET="$ENCRYPTION_SECRET" \
  -e SUPER_ADMIN_1=admin \
  -e SUPER_ADMIN_1_PASSWORD=change-this-password \
  -e SUPER_ADMIN_1_EMAIL=you@example.com \
  -v chops-data:/app/data \
  quantrailadmin1/ch-ops:latest
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`. Log in with the super-admin user name and password that you set.

The image is also on GitHub Container Registry: `ghcr.io/quantrail-data/ch-ops:latest`.

### Run with Docker Compose

Make a file named `docker-compose.yml`. Put this content in it. Change the session secret and the admin password first.

```yaml
services:
  chops:
    image: quantrailadmin1/ch-ops:latest
    container_name: chops
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - ENCRYPTION_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-value
      - SUPER_ADMIN_1=admin
      - SUPER_ADMIN_1_PASSWORD=change-this-password
      - SUPER_ADMIN_1_EMAIL=you@example.com
    volumes:
      - chops-data:/app/data

volumes:
  chops-data:
```

Start it:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`. To stop CHOps, run `docker compose down`. Your data stays in the `chops-data` volume.

### Run a prebuilt binary

Prebuilt binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows are on the [Releases page](https://github.com/Quantrail-Data/CH-Ops/releases). Download the file for your platform (`chops-linux-x64`, `chops-darwin-arm64`, or `chops-windows-x64.exe`). Then run it with the required variables:

```bash
chmod +x chops-linux-x64
SUPER_ADMIN_1=admin \
SUPER_ADMIN_1_PASSWORD=secret \
SUPER_ADMIN_1_EMAIL=you@example.com \
ENCRYPTION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
./chops-linux-x64
```

The binary makes `data/chops.db` in its working directory at startup.

### Required configuration

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` | Yes | Signs sessions and derives the encryption key. Use 32 characters or more. Keep it. Do not change it later, or stored ClickHouse&reg; passwords become unreadable. |
| `SUPER_ADMIN_1` | Yes | The first admin user name. |
| `SUPER_ADMIN_1_PASSWORD` | Yes | The first admin password. Change it. |
| `SUPER_ADMIN_1_EMAIL` | Yes | The first admin email. |

Everything else is optional. The `SMTP_*` values drive alert emails and the password reset code. Leave them blank and both features stay off. The docs list all variables: https://ch-ops.io/docs/getting-started/configuration

### Update to a new version

With Docker:

```bash
docker pull quantrailadmin1/ch-ops:latest
docker rm -f chops
# Then run the "docker run" command again.
```

With Docker Compose:

```bash
# 1. Change the image tag in docker-compose.yml.
# 2. Pull and restart:
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

The `chops-data` volume keeps your settings across an update.

---

## Build from source

Build from source only if you want to change the code, or make your own image or binary.

### Before you begin

You need two things.

**1. Bun 1.4.2**, the JavaScript runtime CHOps is built on. We test CHOps with this version. Install it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.com/install | bash -s "bun-v1.4.2"
```

Close and reopen your terminal. Then check the version:

```bash
bun --version
```

**2. A ClickHouse&reg; server** you can reach, as described in [Run CHOps](#run-chops).

### Install

**1. Get the code:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Quantrail-Data/CH-Ops.git
cd CH-Ops
```

**2. Install dependencies:**

```bash
bun install
```

**3. Make your configuration file.** CHOps reads its settings from a file named `.env`. Copy the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**4. Edit `.env`.** Only four values are required to start. Set them:

```env
SUPER_ADMIN_1=admin
SUPER_ADMIN_1_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
SUPER_ADMIN_1_EMAIL=you@example.com
ENCRYPTION_SECRET=paste_a_random_string_here
```

Make the session secret with `openssl rand -hex 32`. It must be 32 characters or more. Keep it private. Do not change it later, or stored ClickHouse&reg; passwords become unreadable.

**5. Run the database migration** to make CHOps's internal SQLite tables:

```bash
bun run db:migrate
```

You should see "Database migration complete." This makes `data/chops.db`. The file keeps its original name for backward compatibility.

### Start in development

Development mode reloads on code changes:

```bash
bun run dev
```

This starts the backend API on port 3000 and the Vite frontend dev server on port 5173. Open `http://localhost:5173`.

### Start in production

```bash
bun run build
bun src/backend/server.js
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

### Build your own Docker image

The repository has a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` for a local build. The build does not need a `.env` file. The repository compose reads run-time settings from `.env` through `env_file`, so make a `.env` with the four required variables first.

Build and run with Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Rebuild after you pull new code with the same command. Stop with `docker compose down`. Your data stays in the `chops-data` volume.

Or build and run by hand:

```bash
# Build the image.
docker build -t chops:latest .

# Run it (mount a volume so the data survives).
docker run -d --name chops -p 3000:3000 \
  --env-file .env \
  -v chops-data:/app/data \
  chops:latest
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. A `VITE_*` change needs a rebuild, because those values are compiled into the frontend. Everything else takes effect on the next restart.

### Build a standalone binary

CHOps compiles into a single executable with no runtime dependencies on the target machine.

```bash
# Build for your current platform
bun run build:binary

# Cross-compile for a specific platform
bun run build:binary:linux      # produces chops-linux-x64
bun run build:binary:mac        # produces chops-darwin-arm64
bun run build:binary:windows    # produces chops-windows-x64.exe
```

During the build, `vite build` compiles the React frontend into `dist/`. Then `bun build --compile` bundles the backend, all dependencies, and `dist/` into one binary. Run the binary with the same variables shown in [Run a prebuilt binary](#run-a-prebuilt-binary).

---

## Logging In

Open CHOps in your browser. Sign in with the `SUPER_ADMIN_1` user name and password. You land on the Cluster Overview page.

---

## Connecting to ClickHouse®

After you log in, CHOps does not yet know where your ClickHouse&reg; server is. Point it there:

1. Go to **Administration > Cluster Management**.
2. Click **Add Node**. Fill in the node name (a unique friendly label), host or IP, port (usually 8123, the HTTP port, not the native 9000), user, and password. Check **HTTPS** if your server uses TLS.
3. Click **Test** to verify. On success you see the ClickHouse&reg; version and uptime.
4. Click **Save**.

The navigation bar updates at once with no re-login. You can configure up to 3 clusters, with a combined maximum of 18 nodes. Switch between them from the dropdown in the top bar.

### ClickHouse® Running in Kubernetes

If your ClickHouse&reg; runs in Kubernetes under an operator, use the **Kubernetes** tab instead of entering hosts by hand. CHOps reads the host list from the installation and keeps it current as the cluster scales.

Both ClickHouse&reg; Kubernetes operators are supported:

| Operator | Abbreviation | CRD group | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Altinity® Kubernetes Operator for ClickHouse® | AKOC | `clickhouse.altinity.com` | Supported |
| Official ClickHouse® Kubernetes Operator | OCKO | `clickhouse.com` | Early access |

OCKO support is new. The two operators describe a cluster differently. CHOps handles each on its own terms and does not treat them as interchangeable. The Kubernetes screens look and behave the same whichever one you run.

OCKO is early access because its custom resources are at `v1alpha1`. Under Kubernetes convention, that means the schema may change with no deprecation cycle. CHOps discovers the served API version and does not hardcode it. So a version promotion needs no change, but a renamed field would.

CHOps runs outside your Kubernetes cluster. It makes two separate connections. One goes to the Kubernetes API to read the shape of the cluster. The other goes to ClickHouse&reg; to run queries. The second connection needs an address that is reachable from outside the cluster, because internal Kubernetes addresses do not resolve from there. That is the step people miss.

`scripts/chops-k8s-setup.sh` makes a read-only service account for both operators. It prints the three values the wizard asks for.

Full instructions:

- [Connecting a Kubernetes Cluster](docs/guide/kubernetes-connect.md) for AKOC
- [Connecting a Cluster Managed by OCKO](docs/guide/kubernetes-ocko.md)
- [The Kubernetes Page](docs/guide/kubernetes-page.md) for the eight insight screens

Kubernetes support is on by default. Set `app_setting['k8s.enabled']` to `false` to hide the tab.

Managed services such as ClickHouse&reg; Cloud and hosted Altinity.Cloud&reg; do not use this path. They expose a database endpoint and no Kubernetes API. Add them under **Direct connection**, which gives everything except the Kubernetes screens.

### Setting Up a Dedicated ClickHouse® User
 
For production, do not connect CHOps as the ClickHouse® `default` user. Make a dedicated user and a role. Grant the role only the privileges CHOps needs.
 
Run this in your ClickHouse® client. Replace the password.
 
```sql
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS chops_admin;
 
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO chops_admin;
GRANT SHOW ON *.* TO chops_admin;
GRANT KILL QUERY ON *.* TO chops_admin;
GRANT INTROSPECTION ON *.* TO chops_admin;
GRANT BACKUP ON *.* TO chops_admin;
GRANT ACCESS MANAGEMENT ON *.* TO chops_admin;
GRANT ALTER INDEX ON *.* TO chops_admin;
GRANT ALTER PROJECTION ON *.* TO chops_admin;
 
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS chops IDENTIFIED BY 'your_secure_password';
GRANT chops_admin TO chops;
SET DEFAULT ROLE ALL TO chops;
ALTER USER chops SETTINGS allow_introspection_functions = 1;
 
SHOW GRANTS FOR chops;
```

A complete grant script with comments ships at [`clickhouse-user-setup.sql`](clickhouse-user-setup.sql) in the project root.

---

## User Roles

CHOps has four application roles. They are separate from ClickHouse&reg;'s own users.

| Role | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| **Super Admin** | Full access. Can be seeded from `.env` for first-time setup or recovery, or created in the UI. Maximum of 3. |
| **Admin** | Same access as super admin but UI-created only. Cannot change or delete super admins. |
| **Editor** | All sections except user and cluster management. Can build dashboards and charts and use the SQL editor. Cannot manage alerts, backups, indexes, projections, or users. |
| **Readonly** | View-only across overview, SQL editor, dashboards, logs, monitoring, and alerts. Cannot create, edit, or delete anything. |

Role changes follow a strict order. Super admins can change admins, editors, and readonly users. Admins can change editors and readonly users. Nobody can change a super admin's role.

---

## Security

CHOps ships with several hardening measures. Here is what each does and why it matters.

**Password hashing (Argon2id)**: CHOps hashes account passwords with Argon2id before storage. Argon2id is a memory-hard algorithm and the current industry recommendation. Even with the SQLite file in hand, an attacker cannot reverse the hash. Older SHA-256 hashes upgrade on each user's next login.

**Encrypted credentials**: CHOps encrypts ClickHouse&reg; connection passwords with AES-256-GCM before it writes them to SQLite. The key comes from `ENCRYPTION_SECRET`, so the database file alone is not enough to read them. Legacy plaintext values keep working and are encrypted on the next save.

**Login protection**: After 5 failed attempts for the same user name within 15 minutes, CHOps locks that account for a time. Error messages stay vague ("Invalid credentials.") so an attacker cannot find valid user names.

**Session tokens**: Sessions use JWTs that expire after 2 hours. Each token carries a unique revocable ID. If you delete a user, their session ends at once, because every request re-reads the account. A role change is not immediate. The role travels in the token, so a demotion takes effect on the next login or when the token expires. Force a logout if you need it sooner. Revocations are held in memory, so a server restart clears the list.

**Disabling `.env` login**: By default, the `.env` super admin credentials work as a permanent login fallback. This is convenient for setup, but it acts as a backdoor. To close it after setup, set `DISABLE_ENV_LOGIN=true`. The `.env` credentials then seed the initial migration only.

**HTTP security headers**: Every response carries a Content Security Policy, Strict Transport Security, clickjacking protection, and MIME-sniffing prevention.

**Request size limits**: SQL sent to `/api/query` and `/api/export` is capped at 512KB. Other endpoints allow up to 2MB.

**Reverse proxy**: Rate limiting is per client IP. Behind a proxy (such as the Caddy setup below), set `TRUST_PROXY` to the number of proxies in front of CHOps, or every client shares one bucket. Leave it unset when CHOps is exposed directly, so `X-Forwarded-For` cannot be spoofed.

---

## Running Tests

CHOps has an automated test suite for the backend and the frontend. The tests need no running ClickHouse&reg; server, no S3 bucket, and no external service. They test the application code in isolation with mocks and static analysis.

```bash
# Everything (backend then frontend), about 15 to 20 seconds
bun run test

# Backend suites (Bun test runner)
bun test tests/backend
bun test tests/isolated
bun test tests/no-mocks

# Frontend only (Vitest)
npx vitest run tests/frontend
```

`tests/no-mocks` holds suites written without any module mocking, so they run under Bun's test runner, not Vitest. The split is deliberate. `vi.mock` works through Vite's transform pipeline, which Bun's loader does not run. So the call becomes a no-op and the real module loads instead. A few frontend suites that need mocking are excluded from the Bun run for the same reason. They are documented in `vite.config.js`.

Backend tests cover password hashing, JWT handling, AES-256-GCM encryption, rate limiting, security headers, alert scheduling, SQL formatting, the Drizzle schema, environment parsing, and the four-tier RBAC system. Frontend tests cover route definitions, chart types, the plugin architecture, heatmap color scales, tree-chart utilities, scrollbar behavior, and UI contracts.

Coverage runs are available too:

```bash
bun run test:coverage              # backend then frontend
bun run test:backend:coverage      # backend only
bun run test:frontend:coverage     # frontend only
```

Most frontend tests are static analysis. They read source files as strings to verify structure, so runtime line coverage is low by design.

---

## Backing Up CHOps's Database

CHOps uses SQLite in WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode. Do not copy `chops.db` while the server runs, because the WAL file may hold data not yet flushed to the main file. Use the built-in command instead. It is safe during operation:

```bash
bun run db:backup
```

This writes a self-contained file to `data/backups/` with SQLite's `VACUUM INTO`. To restore, stop the server, replace `data/chops.db` with the backup (delete any `-wal` and `-shm` files), and restart.

---

## Deploying with Caddy and systemd

For production, run CHOps behind [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) for automatic HTTPS, and as a systemd service for automatic startup and crash recovery.

**1.** Build CHOps (`bun run build` or `bun run build:binary:linux`).

**2.** Make `/etc/systemd/system/chops.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=CHOps
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=chops
WorkingDirectory=/opt/chops
ExecStart=/opt/chops/chops
Restart=on-failure
EnvironmentFile=/opt/chops/.env
NoNewPrivileges=true
ProtectSystem=strict
ReadWritePaths=/opt/chops/data

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**3.** Configure Caddy at `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`:

```
chops.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}
```

**4.** Enable and start both:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now chops
sudo systemctl restart caddy
```

Caddy obtains and renews Let's Encrypt certificates automatically. The full guide, with security hardening, IP allowlisting, and automated backups, is at [ch-ops.io/docs](https://ch-ops.io/docs).

---

## Troubleshooting

**Cannot connect to ClickHouse&reg;**: In Administration > Cluster Management, verify host, port, user, and password. Then click Test. Make sure the HTTP port (8123) is open, not the native protocol port (9000).

**"Frontend not built" error**: Run `bun run build` before you start the server.

**"Invalid credentials" on login**: Recheck `.env`. The user name and password are case-sensitive.

**Backup listing shows "Unable to connect"**: Verify the S3 endpoint and credentials in Storage Profiles. The error message separates authentication, connectivity, and bucket problems.

**Empty monitoring charts**: Click "Load Charts" after you select a time range. Charts load only for the active tab. If charts fail instead of staying empty, check the `chops` user has `GRANT merge ON *.*` (see [Setting Up a Dedicated ClickHouse User](#setting-up-a-dedicated-clickhouse-user)).

**Read-only queries fail with "Cannot modify ... setting in readonly mode" (code 164)**: CHOps sends `readonly=1` with a result-size ceiling on read-only requests. If the ClickHouse user's own profile already pins `readonly` to 1 or 2, the two collide. Run `bun run check:readonly -- --host <host> --user <user> --password <pw>` to confirm and get the exact fix.

**DDL cards show zeros**: This is normal on single-node setups with no distributed DDL queue.

**Port already in use**: Set a different port in `.env` with `PORT=3001`.

**Binary crashes on startup**: Make sure `SUPER_ADMIN_1`, `SUPER_ADMIN_1_PASSWORD`, `SUPER_ADMIN_1_EMAIL`, and `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` are set. The binary needs them, just like the dev server.

**Container starts then restarts in a loop**: Check `docker logs chops`. A missing `SUPER_ADMIN_1_EMAIL`, or a `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` shorter than 32 characters, exits on startup. Both report which value is wrong.

**Password reset emails never arrive**: Set the `SMTP_*` values in `.env` and restart. Without them, CHOps cannot send the reset code.
