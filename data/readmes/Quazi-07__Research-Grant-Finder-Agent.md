## From Grant Search to Grant Intelligence

Researchers often spend hours manually searching funding databases, reviewing long opportunity announcements, and deciding whether a funding opportunity aligns with their expertise.

The **Research Grant Finder Agent** explores a different approach.

Instead of treating funding discovery as a simple keyword search problem, this AI tool organizes the process as an **agent-oriented research workflow**.

It searches public funding sources, collects available opportunities, analyzes their content, and ranks them based on research and computational relevance. The goal is to help researchers quickly identify opportunities that may be worth exploring further.

The objective is simple:

> **Turn fragmented public funding information into actionable research intelligence.**

## Why This Tool?

Finding the right NIH funding opportunity is not always easy.

A researcher interested in data science, or computational health research may search for those exact terms. However, a relevant funding announcement may use different language, such as:

- Predictive modeling
- Clinical prediction
- Multimodal data
- Bioinformatics
- Omics
- Medical imaging
- Statistical modeling
- Data integration

A simple keyword search may miss these opportunities.

The **Research Grant Finder Agent** provides an intelligent first review of available funding opportunities. It searches official funding sources, screens opportunity descriptions, and ranks potentially relevant grants for researcher review.

The tool is designed to answer a simple question:

> **Which funding opportunities should I look at first?**

## How Does It Work?

The system separates major grant intelligence tasks into specialized AI agents.

| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NIH Guide Ingestion Agent**  | Discovers and normalizes NIH Guide funding announcements               |
| **Grants.gov Ingestion Agent** | Searches and enriches federal opportunity records                      |
| **Grant Parser Agent**         | Converts heterogeneous funding records into a common opportunity model |
| **ML Relevance Agent**         | Evaluates computational and data-science relevance                     |
| **NIH Context Agent**          | Retrieves related funded-project context from NIH RePORTER             |
| **Digest Agent**               | Produces prioritized funding intelligence reports                      |
| **Review Feedback Agent**      | Captures researcher feedback for future relevance tuning               |

These agents support a coordinated workflow for funding discovery and prioritization.

## How the Intelligence Engine Thinks?

The system does not rely on a single keyword.

Each funding opportunity is evaluated using multiple computational signals.

### 1. Computational Keyword Intelligence

The engine searches for signals associated with:

* Artificial intelligence
* Machine learning
* Deep learning
* Predictive modeling
* Data science
* Bioinformatics
* Omics
* Medical imaging
* Statistical modeling
* Multimodal data
* Data integration

### 2. Title Centrality Analysis

Computational concepts appearing directly in the opportunity title receive stronger relevance weighting.

The assumption is that a computational concept appearing in the title is more likely to represent a central scientific theme.

### 3. Grant Similarity Analysis

Opportunity descriptions are compared with curated AI and data-science grant examples.

Text similarity provides an additional relevance signal when explicit computational terminology is limited.

### 4. NIH/HHS Source Intelligence

The scoring system considers whether the opportunity originates from an NIH or HHS source.

### 5. Deadline Awareness

Active deadlines contribute to prioritization so researchers can focus on actionable opportunities.

### 6. Record Completeness

Opportunities with richer metadata receive additional consideration.

### 7. Biomedical Noise Reduction

Generic biomedical terminology can create false-positive computational matches.

The intelligence engine applies penalties when biomedical language is broad but computational evidence is weak.

---

## Opportunity Intelligence Classification

Each opportunity receives a relevance score from **0–100**.

| Intelligence Level | Interpretation                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔴 **HIGH**        | Strong evidence that AI, ML, statistics, or computational expertise may be central to the opportunity |
| 🟠 **MEDIUM**      | Potential opportunity for interdisciplinary data-science collaboration                                |
| 🟡 **WATCHLIST**   | Weak or emerging computational signals; retained for monitoring                                       |

The score is designed to **prioritize expert review—not replace scientific judgment**.

---

## Research Intelligence Dashboard

The Streamlit interface provides an interactive environment for grant opportunity analysis.

Researchers can:

* Search NIH Guide and Grants.gov
* Filter by relevance classification
* Filter by NIH institute
* Search within computational signals
* Review relevance score distributions
* Monitor upcoming deadlines
* Inspect why an opportunity matched
* Open official NIH Guide and Grants.gov records
* Export selected opportunities to Excel

### Dashboard Intelligence Metrics

The dashboard automatically displays:

* **Visible Opportunities**
* **High-Priority Matches**
* **Median Relevance Score**
* **Next Funding Deadline**

---

## Explainable Opportunity Matching

A major design principle of the system is **transparent prioritization**.

For each opportunity, this tool  preserves:

* Relevance score
* Priority classification
* Matched computational terms
* Reasons for the match
* NIH institute
* Opportunity status
* Open and close dates
* Funding category
* Opportunity description
* Official source links

Researchers can inspect **why an opportunity was prioritized** before deciding whether to pursue it.

---

## NIH RePORTER Research Context

The architecture includes an **NIH Context Agent** designed to retrieve related funded projects from NIH RePORTER.

This capability creates a foundation for future research intelligence tasks such as:

* Identifying previously funded work
* Exploring related scientific topics
* Understanding funding patterns
* Comparing new opportunities with funded projects
* Identifying potential research gaps

---

## Human-in-the-Loop Research Intelligence

The system includes a **Review Feedback Agent** that records researcher assessments of opportunities.

Researchers can identify whether an opportunity was useful and preserve review notes.

This creates the foundation for a future adaptive recommendation system in which researcher feedback can improve opportunity prioritization.

```text

Useful / Not Useful
        │
        ▼
Feedback Store
        │
        ▼
Future Relevance Tuning
```

The long-term objective is a **human-AI collaborative grant discovery environment**.

## Research Software Status

> **Current Stage: Functional Research Prototype**

The system currently implements an agent-oriented funding discovery and prioritization workflow.

It is intended as a research software platform for exploring how data science, AI, and agent-based architectures can support research development and funding intelligence.

The current intelligence engine uses explainable computational scoring and text similarity.

It does **not currently rely on a Large Language Model for autonomous scientific reasoning**.

This distinction is intentional and provides a transparent baseline for evaluating future LLM-based agents.

---
## Long-Term Vision

The long-term vision is to evolve the Research Grant Finder Agent into an **Agentic Research Grant Finding Intelligence Platform**.

A future research team could provide:

* Research interests
* CVs or biosketches
* Publication histories
* Technical expertise
* Prior grant experience

Autonomous research agents could then:

1. Continuously monitor funding sources.
2. Detect newly published opportunities.
3. Analyze scientific and computational requirements.
4. Compare opportunities with researcher expertise.
5. Review related NIH-funded projects.
6. Explain why an opportunity may be relevant.
7. Identify expertise gaps.
8. Recommend potential collaborators.
9. Monitor deadlines and announcement changes.
10. Deliver personalized research funding intelligence.

> **The goal is not to replace researchers or research development professionals. The goal is to give them an intelligent research agent that continuously searches, analyzes, and prioritizes opportunities on their behalf.**
