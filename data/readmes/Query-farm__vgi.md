# VGI — Vector Gateway Interface for DuckDB

**VGI** (Vector Gateway Interface) is an Apache Arrow–based protocol for extending DuckDB
using *any* language — without writing, compiling, or linking a DuckDB-native C++ extension.
Workers run as separate programs, so there is no DuckDB build to match and nothing to link
in-process. Use an interpreted language like Python or TypeScript, or ship a compiled binary
written in Go, Rust, or Java — VGI only cares that the program speaks the protocol over
Apache Arrow IPC.

This repository contains the **DuckDB extension** (the C++ side of VGI). It loads into
DuckDB and lets you `ATTACH` a *worker* — a program written in any supported language (see
[Worker SDKs](#worker-sdks)) — and then call the scalar, table, and aggregate functions that
worker exposes as if they were native DuckDB functions. Data moves between DuckDB and the
worker over Apache Arrow IPC, across a subprocess pipe, an HTTP connection, or a Unix domain
socket.

The reference worker SDK is **vgi-python** — `pip install vgi-python`.

Created by [Query.Farm](https://query.farm).

## Worker SDKs

A VGI worker can be written in any language that implements the protocol. Query.Farm
maintains reference SDKs in five languages. **vgi-python** is the most complete reference
implementation and is published to PyPI; the others are developed in the open.

## Why VGI?

| Traditional DuckDB extensions | VGI workers |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| C/C++ compilation required | Any language — write a script or ship a binary |
| Tied to a specific DuckDB version | Version independent |
| Complex build / release cycle | Ship a script or executable |
| Runs in-process | Process isolation |
| Shares DuckDB's process and runtime | Pool of independent worker processes — true parallelism even under a GIL |

**Use cases:** call REST APIs from SQL, run ML inference (PyTorch, scikit-learn),
process data with Python/pandas/numpy, build custom ETL transforms, or expose external
data sources as queryable tables and views.

## Quick Start

Install the extension and attach a worker:

```sql
-- First time only
INSTALL vgi FROM community;
LOAD vgi;

-- Attach a worker as a catalog
ATTACH 'my_funcs' (TYPE vgi, LOCATION './my_worker.py');

-- Call the functions it exposes
SELECT upper_case(name) FROM users;
SELECT * FROM my_table_function('arg');
```

A minimal Python worker (using `vgi-python`):

```python
# my_worker.py
from typing import Annotated
import pyarrow as pa
import pyarrow.compute as pc
from vgi import ScalarFunction, Param, Returns, Worker


class UpperCase(ScalarFunction):
    """Convert string values to uppercase."""

    @classmethod
    def compute(
        cls,
        value: Annotated[pa.StringArray, Param(doc="String value to uppercase")],
    ) -> Annotated[pa.StringArray, Returns()]:
        return pc.utf8_upper(value)


class MyWorker(Worker):
    catalog_name = "my_funcs"
    functions = [UpperCase]


if __name__ == "__main__":
    MyWorker().run()
```

## Features

- **Function shapes** — scalar, table, table-in-out (streaming), buffered table
  (see-every-row-before-output), aggregate, and windowed aggregate functions, all defined
  in the worker and surfaced as native DuckDB functions.
- **Full catalog integration** — workers expose schemas, tables, views, and functions;
  DuckDB lazily loads catalog metadata, column statistics, and supports multi-branch
  (UNION-ALL) tables.
- **Multiple transports** — `LOCATION` accepts a bare command (subprocess, pooled per
  DuckDB process), `http(s)://` (HTTP), `tcp://host:port` (raw TCP, including DNS
  and bracketed IPv6), `unix:///path/to.sock` (AF_UNIX), or `launch:<argv>`
  (launcher-managed shared worker), plus cached workers from GitHub releases,
  OCI images, or a [`database://` package table](database-worker-transport.md).
- **Pushdown** — projection, filter, `ORDER BY` + `LIMIT`, and join-key pushdown to
  workers that opt in.
- **Worker pooling** — subprocess workers are pooled and reused across queries, with
  diagnostics (`vgi_worker_pool()`, `vgi_worker_pool_stats()`).
- **Performance** — optional POSIX shared-memory transport for zero-copy batch transfer.
- **Auth** — per-catalog OAuth / bearer tokens; OIDC identity introspection via
  `vgi_oauth_identity()`.
- **Remote secret provider** — a catalog can advertise a secret-service URL at `ATTACH`;
  DuckDB then fetches S3/HTTP/etc. credentials *lazily* from that remote service under the
  **same** identity (no `CREATE SECRET`), cached with a TTL bounded by the credential's
  own expiry. See [Remote secret provider](#remote-secret-provider) below.

## Building

This extension uses VCPKG for dependency management and is built with multiple modules,
so set `USE_MERGED_VCPKG_MANIFEST=1`. The Makefile auto-detects the VCPKG toolchain from
`vcpkg/` in the project tree.

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Query-farm/vgi.git
cd vgi

# Debug build
USE_MERGED_VCPKG_MANIFEST=1 GEN=ninja make debug

# Release build
USE_MERGED_VCPKG_MANIFEST=1 GEN=ninja make release
```

Installing [ccache](https://ccache.dev/) and [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) is
strongly recommended for fast incremental rebuilds.

The build produces:

```sh
./build/release/duckdb                                    # DuckDB shell with the extension preloaded
./build/release/test/unittest                             # test runner
./build/release/extension/vgi/vgi.duckdb_extension        # the loadable extension
```

## Testing

The extension supports two transports; subprocess is the faster default. Tests prefer the
release build:

```sh
# Subprocess transport (default, faster)
make test_launcher

# HTTP transport
make test_http

# Both
make test_all
```

The `VGI_TEST_WORKER` environment variable controls which worker is used and defaults to
the `vgi-python` fixture worker. See the project root `CLAUDE.md` for the full matrix of
test targets, debug builds, and environment variables.

## Remote secret provider

A VGI catalog can broker downstream credentials. When its `ATTACH` response advertises a
secret-service URL (via the catalog `tags["vgi_secret_service_url"]`), the extension
registers a custom DuckDB `SecretStorage` that resolves secrets **lazily** from that
service — so a consumer like httpfs resolving an `s3://` path "just works" with **no
`CREATE SECRET`**:

```sql
ATTACH 'orchard' AS orch (TYPE vgi, LOCATION 'https://orchard.example/');
SELECT count(*) FROM 's3://bucket/data.parquet';   -- credentials fetched on demand
```

- **One identity** — the secret service is called under the *same* OAuth / bearer auth the
  catalog established, so you authenticate once for both worker RPCs and credential fetches.
- **Lazy + cached** — credentials are fetched on first use and cached with a TTL bounded by
  the credential's own expiry (short-lived STS tokens are never served stale).
- **Any value type** — string, int64, bool, struct, list, and nested values round-trip
  through the Arrow→DuckDB bridge; the server marks sensitive keys `redact_keys` so they
  are hidden in `duckdb_secrets()`.
- **HTTPS required** — a remote secret broker must be reached over `https://` (only
  `http://localhost` is allowed, for testing).
- **Opt out per catalog** — add `secrets false` to the `ATTACH` options.

Diagnostics: `vgi_secret_providers()` lists registered providers; `vgi_secret_provider_flush([catalog])`
clears the TTL cache. The `vgi_secret_default_ttl_seconds` setting (default 300) bounds the
cache when the server suggests no TTL. The remote service speaks a separate, independently
versioned protocol (`VgiSecretProtocol`); the reference server is `vgi-secret-serve` in
vgi-python. See [the design notes](remote_secret_provider_plan.md) for the full architecture.
