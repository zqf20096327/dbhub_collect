## 🏗️ How the Architecture Works

The application follows a **3-layer structure**, with each layer responsible for a specific part of the application:

1. **👤 User Input (CLI)** — The user interacts with the application through the command-line interface by selecting menu options and providing input.

2. **🖥️ `SmartCityApp.java` — Controller Layer** — Handles application menus, reads user input, invokes the appropriate methods, and displays results to the user.

3. **🔌 `DBConnection.java` — Data Layer** — Manages connections to the MySQL database using JDBC and handles database operations.

4. **🗄️ MySQL Database — Storage Layer** — Stores and retrieves application data, including information from the `users` and `places` tables.

## About The Project

**Smart City Guide** is the premier open-source Java starting contribution project for beginners and intermediate developers. It provides a beginner-friendly environment to learn Java, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and backend database integration (JDBC/MySQL) through real-world features. By contributing to this robust, console-based city management simulator, you will gain practical, hands-on experience perfect for your first open-source pull requests.

## Features

### For Users & Admins
- **Live City Stats:** A no-login dashboard showing total attractions, registered users, a per-category breakdown, and the busiest area — all read live from the database.
- **Interactive Navigation:** Search and discover city attractions, restaurants, and parks.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Secure authentication for users and administrators.
- **Dynamic Data Management:** Admins can easily add, update, or remove city locations.
- **Advanced Searching:** Filter places by specific categories or geographical locations.

### For Developers & Contributors
- **Real-World DSA:** Apply concepts like HashMaps, Tries, and Dijkstra's algorithm to build actual features like caching and routing.
- **Monolithic to MVC Migration:** Participate in our active architectural refactoring.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Learn to write and maintain robust JUnit tests.

## Getting Started

> [!NOTE]
> This application requires a local or containerized **MySQL Database** for persistent storage.

### Local Setup

Ensure you have **Java JDK 8+** and **MySQL Server** installed. You will also need the `mysql-connector-java.jar` in your classpath.

1. **Initialize the Database:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p < db_setup.sql
   ```
   *Note: If upgrading an existing database without the `email` column, run the migration script:*
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p smart_city_guide < migrations/V2__add_email_column.sql
   ```
2. **Clone and Run:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rajath2005/SmartCityApp.git
   cd SmartCityApp/src
   
   ```
3. Compile (include the MySQL JDBC driver on the classpath)
   ```java
   javac -cp ".;mysql-connector-java-8.0.33.jar" src/com/smartcity/main/SmartCityApp.java

   ```
4. Run
    ```java
    java -cp ".;mysql-connector-java-8.0.33.jar" com.smartcity.main.SmartCityApp

    ```
    💡 On Mac/Linux, replace ; with : in the classpath separator.
   Download the JAR from: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/

### Docker Setup

For a seamless experience without local dependencies, use Docker Compose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rajath2005/SmartCityApp.git
cd SmartCityApp
docker compose run --rm app
```

## Architecture

The project currently utilizes a monolithic architecture, making it highly accessible for beginners understanding core Java flows.

## DSA Learning Program

SmartCityApp is uniquely designed to bridge the gap between algorithmic theory and practical application. We connect standard coding problems (e.g., from LeetCode or HackerRank) directly to feature implementations in the app.

> [!TIP]
> **Ready to level up your Java skills?**
> Start with the [DSA Master Guide](DSA_MASTER_GUIDE.md) to join the program. You will learn to implement custom comparators, command patterns, LRU caches, and complex graph routing.
## ❓ FAQ & Troubleshooting

**Q: I get `ClassNotFoundException: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver`. What do I do?**

You haven't added the MySQL JDBC JAR to your classpath. Download `mysql-connector-java-8.0.33.jar` from [MySQL's website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/) and include it with `-cp` when compiling and running.

**Q: The app asks for a MySQL password every time. Is that normal?**

Yes! `DBConnection.java` prompts for your local MySQL root password at startup. This keeps the password out of the source code. Just type your MySQL password when asked.

**Q: I get `Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'`. Help?**

Your MySQL password in the app doesn't match your actual MySQL password. Make sure you type the correct password when the app asks `"Enter MySQL password for user 'root':"`.

**Q: `smart_city_guide` database doesn't exist. What do I do?**

You need to run the setup script first:
mysql -u root -p < db_setup.sql

**Q: I ran the app but nothing happens / it hangs after asking for a password.**

This usually means MySQL isn't running. 
Start your MySQL service first (`mysql.server start` on macOS, or check Services on Windows), then run the app again.

**Q: I get a `Communications link failure` error.**

This means the app can't reach MySQL at all — double check MySQL is installed and running on `localhost`, and that no firewall is blocking the connection.
