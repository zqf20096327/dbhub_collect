# RoboSystems

RoboSystems is an open-source, AI-native financial intelligence platform for accounting, financial reporting, and investment management. It models your financial data as a **knowledge graph** — transactions, facts, reporting elements, and the calculation structures that relate them are all nodes and edges, with the semantics preserved rather than flattened into rows you query around. On top of that graph it gives AI agents and analysts a ledger-grade system of record they can both query and operate — closing the books, producing reports, and analyzing portfolios across your own ledger, your holdings, and SEC public filings queryable alongside them. Powers [RoboLedger](https://roboledger.ai) and [RoboInvestor](https://roboinvestor.ai).

**Every tenant gets their own graph.** Not a row-level slice of a shared table — a dedicated graph database on its own instance, with a dedicated OLTP schema behind it. Your ontology, your taxonomies, and your calculation structures live in it as artifacts you can read, export, and take with you.

## Platform

The platform provides the core infrastructure that all extensions build on:

- **Dedicated Infrastructure**: Tiered LadybugDB graph infrastructure with dedicated instances and configurable memory allocation
- **AI Operator System**: Autonomous financial Operators (Claude/MCP executors) with automatic credit tracking and SSE progress streaming.
- **Shared Repositories**: SEC XBRL filings knowledge graph for context mining and benchmarking
- **Document Management**: Upload, index, and search documents with full-text and semantic search via OpenSearch
- **Credit-Based Billing**: Flexible credits for AI operations based on token usage
- **Subgraphs (Workspaces)**: AI memory graphs and isolated environments for development and team collaboration
- **Web Application**: Primary web interface — graph management, the AI query console (natural-language + Cypher over MCP), schema explorer, document search, shared-repository access, and billing — [`robosystems-app`](https://github.com/RoboFinSystems/robosystems-app)

The **core platform API** lives at `/v1` — auth, orgs, billing, graph lifecycle (subgraphs, backups, materialize, tier changes), Cypher, and MCP — with reads as REST `GET`. Every write — across both the core and extensions surfaces — is a named **`OperationEnvelope`** operation with `Idempotency-Key` support, audit logging, and SSE progress streaming via `/v1/operations/{id}/stream`.

## Extensions

Extensions are domain-specific subsystems that bring their own schema, OLTP tables, API routes, data pipelines, and dedicated frontend apps. They share a single PostgreSQL database with schema-per-tenant isolation and materialize to the graph for analytical queries. Domain content is authored as **block molecules** — self-describing envelopes bundling atomic facts with their structure, rules, and verification — never bare rows.

The extensions API surface is **graph-scoped at the URL level** — `graph_id` is always a path parameter, never a query argument — and splits reads from writes by transport:

- **Reads** → `POST /extensions/{graph_id}/graphql` — Strawberry GraphQL, GraphiQL in dev, schema composed dynamically from enabled domains
- **Writes** → `POST /extensions/{roboledger|roboinvestor}/{graph_id}/operations/{operation_name}` — named REST commands
- **Analytical views** → `POST /extensions/{domain}/{graph_id}/operations/{view_name}` — read-only analytical operations (e.g. `build-fact-grid`, `live-financial-statement`), same envelope as writes

Behind the API is a CQRS operations kernel (`reads/` + `commands/` per domain, plus graph-backed `views/`) that's the single source of truth for business logic — GraphQL resolvers, REST operation routes, and MCP tools all delegate to the same functions. Per-domain feature flags (`ROBOLEDGER_ENABLED`, `ROBOINVESTOR_ENABLED`) gate both the routers and the GraphQL schema composition.

### [RoboLedger](https://roboledger.ai)

Accounting and financial reporting extension — a ledger-grade system of record that AI and analysts can both query and operate. Writes land as self-describing **molecules**: atomic facts bundled with their structural wiring, rules, and verification in one typed envelope, never bare rows. Three block molecules are the authoring substrate:

- **Information Blocks** — the envelope for reportable content: schedules, statements, metrics, and text-block disclosures bundled with their period-versioned fact sets, typed mechanics, and rules. `evaluate-rules` runs arithmetic checks (EqualTo, RollUp, RollForward, SumEquals, Exists, CoExists) over materialized facts; pinning a fact set separates a live closing book from a frozen report.
- **Event Blocks** — REA event capture: callers record what happened in the world (a sale, a payment, an asset disposal) through a structured action-verb vocabulary, and a handler registry derives the debits and credits across the three-level ledger (Transaction → Entry → LineItem). Preview handler resolution, execute to post GL atomically, and promote matured obligations (AR/AP, schedule entries) on demand.
- **Taxonomy Blocks** — accounting frameworks as data, not code: Elements, linkbase Associations (presentation / calculation / mapping), Structures, and auto-generated structural rules in one atomic write. Ships `fac` (fundamentals) and `rs-gaap` (~2,000 curated US-GAAP concepts) behind a two-tier public→tenant library, with CoA→GAAP mapping anchored to calc-DAG leaves.

Built on the blocks:

- **Close lifecycle** — fiscal calendar, close-target catch-up sequencing, and period close/reopen gated on the balance equation, [QuickBooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/partners/affiliates?cid=par_pim_4TcakSEFQs73) sync-staleness, and outstanding schedule obligations; every blocker names what is holding the close
- **Mapping** — CoA→GAAP mapping associations plus AI-assisted bulk mapping via the **MappingOperator** (confidence-tiered: auto-approve / review / skip)
- **Reporting** — multi-period reports rendered from shared facts through a Reporting Style; a report lifecycle (draft → under_review → filed → archived) with publish lists for distribution
- **Forecasting** — operating-plan scenarios projected through the same statement structures: rule-driven forecasts, per-line growth trajectories, and manual line assertions, with forecast periods returned alongside actuals on statement reads
- **Analytical operations** — `live-financial-statement` renders a statement straight from the OLTP ledger (no materialization required); `build-fact-grid` and `financial-statement-analysis` query the materialized XBRL hypercube in the graph
- **Serialization** — reports publish as an XBRL International **Tavi** compiled model (the stored anchor), with a **holon** (dataset-form JSON-LD) and a filing-grade **XBRL 2.1** package (Arelle-validated) built on first download, all three projections of the same assembled report
- **Pipelines & data** — QuickBooks ELT via dbt/Dagster with a configurable `write_policy`, and SEC XBRL financial reporting

Dedicated frontend app: [`roboledger-app`](https://github.com/RoboFinSystems/roboledger-app).

### [RoboInvestor](https://roboinvestor.ai)

Portfolio management and investment tracking extension — tracks holdings in private companies and links them back to the businesses that issued them.

- **Portfolio Blocks** — the same molecule discipline as RoboLedger: a portfolio plus its positions and securities are validated and written as one envelope, with cost basis and current value held as integer cents and dollar totals computed at the boundary. Positions move through an active / disposed / archived lifecycle; reads expose `portfolios`, `positions`, `holdings` (rolled up by issuer), and the assembled `portfolioBlock`.
- **Securities** — register and maintain ownership instruments (common stock, warrants, convertible notes, …) with an extensible `terms` blob for instrument-specific detail (strike price, liquidation preference, vesting)
- **Cross-graph research** — a security can point at the graph of the company that issued it, when that company also runs on the platform. The investor records the issuer's `source_graph_id` up front as a pre-association; when the issuer later shares a published report into the investor's graph, the issuer's entity is materialized there and any securities waiting on that `source_graph_id` link to it. A holding then traverses through to the issuer's own reported facts — `Portfolio → Position → Security → Entity → Report → Fact` — with authorization enforced at the report-sharing boundary, not the OLTP layer.

Dedicated frontend app: [`roboinvestor-app`](https://github.com/RoboFinSystems/roboinvestor-app).

## Architecture

Built end-to-end on open-source engines — PostgreSQL, LadybugDB, DuckDB, LanceDB, OpenSearch, and Valkey — assembled into a transactional core with a materialized analytical graph and integrated vector search, with no proprietary database lock-in.

That openness runs up the stack as well as down: the accounting ontology, reporting taxonomies, and calculation structures are inspectable, portable artifacts you own, not configuration trapped in a vendor platform — [semantic sovereignty](https://robosystems.ai/blog/semantic-sovereignty) for your financial data.

### Multi-Tenancy & Isolation

One rule: **every isolation primitive keys on `graph_id`, never on an organization** — session `search_path`, cache keys, idempotency keys, rate-limit buckets, and credit accounting all namespace on the graph. Two graphs inside the same organization are separated by the identical mechanism that separates two unrelated customers; there is no "internal" path that skips the boundary.

- **One graph database per tenant** — every tier runs `databases_per_instance: 1`, so tiers differ by instance size, not by how many tenants share one.
- **Schema-per-graph OLTP** — each graph gets its own PostgreSQL schema, with `search_path` re-stamped on every request rather than inherited from a pooled connection. A CI structural test pins the contract.
- **Two databases, two migration histories** — platform state (identity, orgs, billing) is separate from extensions OLTP; a migration to one never touches the other.
- **The graph is a derived projection** — OLTP rows are the system of record and the analytical graph is rebuilt from them blue-green, which is what makes a rebuild routine rather than risky.
- **Subgraphs** are isolated environments inside a tenant, sharing the parent's credits and permissions — AI memory, development, team workspaces.
- **Shared repositories** (SEC XBRL) are the one multi-reader surface: read-only, separately replicated, queryable alongside your own graph but never writable through it.

Because tenancy is enforced at the graph rather than in application predicates, the same codebase serves managed SaaS, a dedicated single-tenant deployment, and a fully self-hosted install with no fork. Details: [Graphs & Multi-Tenancy](https://robosystems.ai/docs/technical/graphs-and-multi-tenancy).

### Identity & Access

Programmatic access uses `X-API-Key`; the browser apps use short-lived JWTs. How a person _logs in_ is a deployment decision — password, WebAuthn passkey, or an enterprise identity provider — published at `GET /v1/auth/providers`, so one frontend build renders whichever posture the backend is configured for.

Enterprise SSO (OIDC) and SCIM 2.0 provisioning ship in the repository, off by default — available to any fork without a license gate. Provisioning is link-only: SCIM creates accounts and OIDC only resolves already-provisioned ones, so the identity provider owns the account lifecycle in both directions.

Details: [Enterprise SSO & SCIM](https://robosystems.ai/docs/technical/enterprise-sso-and-scim) · [Authentication & API Keys](https://robosystems.ai/docs/technical/authentication-and-api-keys) · [`SECURITY.md`](/SECURITY.md)

### Components

**Application Layer:**

- FastAPI REST API with versioned endpoints
- Extension GraphQL read API plus named REST command operations (CQRS)
- MCP server for AI-powered graph database access — every graph speaks the MCP Streamable HTTP transport, with OAuth or API-key auth
- AI Operator System for autonomous financial operations with automatic credit tracking
- Dagster for data pipeline orchestration and background jobs

**LadybugDB Graph Database:**

- Embedded columnar graph database purpose-built for financial analytics
- Base + extension schema architecture — extensions define domain models
- Native DuckDB integration for high-performance staging and ingestion
- LanceDB as the semantic-modality engine — per-graph, on-disk vector stores (IVF-PQ, 384-dim embeddings) for AI memory (remember/recall) and vector-search offload
- Tiered infrastructure with configurable memory, rate limits, and subgraph allocations
- Shared tier hosts public repositories with read replicas

**Data Layer:**

- PostgreSQL (RDS) for IAM, graph metadata, Dagster, and extension OLTP databases (schema-per-tenant)
- OpenSearch for full-text and semantic document search (BM25 + KNN)
- Valkey (ElastiCache) for caching, SSE messaging, and rate limiting
- S3 for data lake storage and static assets
- DynamoDB for instance/graph/volume registry

**Infrastructure:**

- CloudFormation deployed via GitHub Actions with OIDC
- ECS Fargate for API and Dagster
- EC2 (ASG) for LadybugDB writer clusters; EC2 (ALB + ASG) for shared replica clusters

## AI

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

- **Financial Analysis**: Natural language queries across enterprise data and public benchmark data
- **Cross-Database Queries**: Compare user graph data against SEC shared repository data
- **Tools**: Rich toolkit for graph queries, schema introspection, fact discovery, financial analysis, document search, and AI memory operations
- **Handler Pool**: Managed MCP handler instances with resource limits

### AI Operator System

- Unified architecture: stateless Operators (Claude/MCP executors) with protocol-based service injection
- Dual execution: API (sync/SSE) and background worker (Valkey queue + SSE progress)
- Automatic credit tracking per AI call — Operators cannot forget billing
- Extensible: add new Operators for new AI workflows; they inherit execution, credit tracking, and progress streaming automatically

### Credit System

- **AI Operations Only**: Credits are consumed exclusively by AI Operator calls (Anthropic Claude via AWS Bedrock)
- **Token-Based Billing**: Credits based on actual token usage and model cost
- **MCP Tool Access**: No credits consumed for MCP calls or database operations

## SEC Shared Repository

A curated knowledge graph of US public company financial data from SEC EDGAR XBRL filings. Runs on the shared LadybugDB tier, accessible via MCP tools, Cypher queries, and the AI Operator.

The full corpus is also published monthly as one LadybugDB file on Hugging Face — [robosystems/sec-xbrl-knowledge-graphs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/robosystems/sec-xbrl-knowledge-graphs) (tens of GiB to download, well over 100 GiB on disk; the dataset card carries each snapshot's exact sizes). `just sec-dump` pulls it into `data/lbug-dbs` for local Cypher, API, and MCP with no pipeline run; see the [SEC XBRL Pipeline](https://robosystems.ai/docs/technical/sec-xbrl-pipeline) wiki page.

- **Pipeline**: EDGAR → Download → Process (Parquet) → Stage (DuckDB) → Enrich (Icebug+fastembed) → Materialize (LadybugDB) → Index + Embed (OpenSearch)
- **Graph**: the base schema plus the `roboledger` extension — 20 node types and 41 relationship types modeling the full XBRL reporting hierarchy
- **Extraction**: every filing is parsed by [xbrlkit](https://xbrlkit.com) — the same open library behind the `disclosures` and `information-block` tools, the holon viewer, and its own MCP server
- **Search**: Hybrid BM25 + KNN vector search across narrative sections and iXBRL disclosures
- **Enrichment**: Semantic element mapping, statement classification, and disclosure tagging across the shared repository's disclosures

See [SEC Adapter](/robosystems/adapters/sec/README.md) for detailed documentation.

## Client Libraries

RoboSystems provides comprehensive client libraries for building applications:

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Every graph is an MCP server, and the graph's URL is the preferred way to connect — Claude, Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP client that supports HTTP transports, no install required. The URL picks the graph (`sec` for the public SEC repository, your graph id for your own); sign in with OAuth, or put your API key in the `X-API-Key` header — never in the URL.

**OAuth — sign in and pick a graph.** The graph-agnostic endpoint `https://api.robosystems.ai/v1/mcp` accepts OAuth only: an OAuth-capable client (claude.ai, Claude Code, ChatGPT, VS Code, Cursor) discovers the authorization server from the endpoint, you sign in and choose the graph the connection covers, and the client holds a revocable token bound to that graph — no key to paste. Per-graph URLs accept OAuth too, alongside the key header. (Deployment flag: `MCP_OAUTH_ENABLED`.)

**RoboLedger endpoint.** `https://api.robosystems.ai/v1/mcp/roboledger` is the same OAuth flow for RoboLedger graphs only: sign-in offers only your RoboLedger graphs, and the connection serves the accounting tool set without workspace and platform-administration tools (subgraphs, backups, materialization, write policy). It is the endpoint for RoboLedger directory listings, which freeze one tool list per URL.

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http robosystems https://api.robosystems.ai/v1/mcp
```

**Claude Code with an API key** — one command:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http robosystems-sec \
  https://api.robosystems.ai/v1/graphs/sec/mcp \
  --header "X-API-Key: <your key>"
```

**Cursor / VS Code** — add to `mcp.json`:

```json
"robosystems-sec": {
  "url": "https://api.robosystems.ai/v1/graphs/sec/mcp",
  "headers": { "X-API-Key": "<your key>" }
}
```

**Claude (claude.ai / Desktop)** — Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector with `https://api.robosystems.ai/v1/mcp` (or a per-graph URL): Claude detects OAuth and you pick the graph at sign-in. The **MCP page** in the app (`/connect`) has every snippet filled in for the selected graph, and mints graph-scoped keys for header-only clients.

- **Documentation**: [Wiki guide](https://robosystems.ai/docs/technical/ai-operators-and-mcp) | [stdio bridge](https://github.com/RoboFinSystems/robosystems-mcp-client) (proxy mode) for clients without HTTP transport support
