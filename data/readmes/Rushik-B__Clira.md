Clira is an AI executive agent that handles your email, calendar, and messaging across WhatsApp and Telegram. It prepares actions and drafts, but nothing executes without your approval. Self-hosted, open source, and architecturally designed so the AI cannot hallucinate facts into your outbox.

## Highlights

- Multi-channel agent across WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS, and web chat
- Nothing sends without explicit approval
- Planner/style architecture where the style layer cannot introduce facts
- Extensible through MCP server connections and user-authored skills
- Self-hosted with Docker Compose so your runtime and data stay under your control
- Gmail ingestion in push and pull modes with deterministic pre-filtering

## Architecture At A Glance

Clira is easiest to understand as two tightly connected systems: a multi-channel executive agent runtime that works across inbox, calendar, memory, and messaging context without bypassing approvals, and a draft-first reply pipeline that handles email as one capability inside that broader product.

### Executive Agent Runtime

The executive agent is not just "chat with tools." It runs inside a deterministic policy envelope that decides what tools can exist, when the agent must pause for approval, and when a rerun is allowed with broader capabilities.

  <em>Messaging channels feed a policy-bounded executive agent runtime with controlled tool access, explicit approval checkpoints, and rerun logic for broader capabilities.</em>
</p>

### Reply Pipeline

This path is intentionally strict: deterministic filtering first, then a schema-validated LLM gate, then a planner/style split where the style stage is not allowed to add facts.

## Fast Self-Host

This is the default launch path. It assumes Docker and Docker Compose are installed.

1. Clone the repo and copy the environment template.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Initialize local runtime state and generated secrets.

```bash
npm run selfhost:init
```

If you do not want to use `npm`, run `bash scripts/selfhost-init.sh` directly.

3. Configure Gmail Pub/Sub and write the generated values back into `.env`.

```bash
npm run setup:google -- --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID --mode pull --write-env
```

4. Fill in the remaining required values in `.env`.

- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- your AI provider key

5. Pull and start the default launch stack.

```bash
npm run selfhost:up
```

6. Open Clira.

- App: [http://localhost:13000](http://localhost:13000)
- Liveness: [http://localhost:13000/api/health](http://localhost:13000/api/health)
- Deep readiness: [http://localhost:13000/api/health?deep=1](http://localhost:13000/api/health?deep=1)

## Image Tags

Clira publishes two kinds of image tags:

- `main` and `sha-<commit>` for continuous builds from the `main` branch
- `vX.Y.Z`, `vX.Y`, and `latest` for release tags such as `v0.1.0`

For evaluation and internal testing, the default `CLIRA_IMAGE=ghcr.io/rushik-b/clira:main` is fine.
For production or any install you want to keep stable, pin `CLIRA_IMAGE` to an exact release tag in `.env`.

## What Starts By Default

`npm run selfhost:up` starts the `core` profile:

- `app`
- `worker`
- `gmail-pull-worker`
- `cron`
- `db`
- `redis`

`backfill-worker` is intentionally not part of the default launch profile. Add it only when you want inbox search backfill:

```bash
npm run selfhost:up:full
```

## Required Environment Values

Minimum first-run values live at the top of [`.env.example`](.env.example). The important ones are:

- `APP_PUBLIC_URL`
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- `CRON_SECRET`
- `EMAIL_ENCRYPT_SECRET`
- `EMAIL_ENCRYPT_SALT`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `GMAIL_PUBSUB_TOPIC`
- `GMAIL_PUBSUB_PULL_SUBSCRIPTION`
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
- `AI_PROVIDER`
- provider auth for the selected model backend

Clira stores local runtime secrets under `.clira-runtime/`. The default Gmail service-account file path is `./.clira-runtime/google-service-account.json`.

## Self-Host Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run selfhost:init` | Creates `.env` if missing, generates secrets, creates `.clira-runtime`, and runs diagnostics |
| `npm run selfhost:doctor` | Read-only diagnostics for env, Docker, ports, Gmail credentials, and AI provider config |
| `npm run selfhost:up` | Pulls and starts the default `core` self-host profile |
| `npm run selfhost:up:full` | Pulls and starts `core` plus `backfill-worker` |
| `npm run selfhost:down` | Stops the self-host stack |
| `npm run selfhost:logs` | Tails the main self-host services |
| `npm run setup:google` | Provisions Gmail Pub/Sub resources and optional `.env` updates |

## Contributor Workflow

If you are developing Clira rather than just hosting it, use [`docs/setup.md`](docs/setup.md). That doc covers:

- local `npm run dev`
- worker processes in separate terminals
- local builds with `docker-compose.dev.yml`
- contributor-oriented verification

## AI Provider Notes

Google remains the default provider. The OpenRouter env names are still used for compatibility, but `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` can point at any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. That includes OpenRouter, LM Studio, vLLM, and similar gateways. Details live in [`docs/ai-providers.md`](docs/ai-providers.md).
