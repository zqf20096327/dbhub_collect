# Shivani Technologies — Job Portal

A full-stack, multi-role recruitment platform built with Spring Boot and React. Candidates search
and apply for jobs; companies register and post openings once verified; administrators run the
whole platform; internal staff get their own logins. Built, runtime-verified, and documented as a
complete submission-ready project.

## Live Deployment

|---|---|
| **Frontend** | [shivani-tech-job-portal.vercel.app](https://shivani-tech-job-portal.vercel.app) (Vercel) |
| **Backend API** | [shivani-tech-job-portal.onrender.com](https://shivani-tech-job-portal.onrender.com) (Render, Docker) |
| **API docs (Swagger)** | [shivani-tech-job-portal.onrender.com/swagger-ui/index.html](https://shivani-tech-job-portal.onrender.com/swagger-ui/index.html) |
| **Health check** | [shivani-tech-job-portal.onrender.com/actuator/health](https://shivani-tech-job-portal.onrender.com/actuator/health) |
| **Database** | TiDB Cloud Serverless (MySQL-compatible) |

Demo credentials and full deployment details (architecture, env vars, known limitations) are in
[DEPLOYMENT_REPORT.md](DEPLOYMENT_REPORT.md).

Two things worth knowing about the free-tier hosting specifically:
- Render's free tier spins the backend down after 15 minutes idle — the first request after a lull
  takes 30-50 seconds to cold-start. This is a hosting-tier characteristic, not an application bug.
- Uploaded resume files don't survive a Render redeploy (ephemeral filesystem) — use the "resume by
  URL" option for anything you want to persist through a redeploy.

## Project Overview

Shivani Technologies needed an internal job portal to manage recruitment end to end — job postings,
candidate applications, employer self-service, and administrative oversight — without relying on
third-party job boards. This project delivers that as a containerized, four-role web application.

## Problem Statement

Traditional hiring workflows split across email, spreadsheets, and third-party job boards are slow
and hard to audit. This system centralizes the entire pipeline:

- Candidates need one place to search, filter, and apply for relevant openings, and track status.
- Companies need to post openings themselves, without an admin doing it manually every time.
- Administrators need oversight and control — who's allowed to post, what's been posted, and the
  ability to reach candidates/companies/staff directly.
- Everything needs to be auditable, secure, and running in a reproducible environment.

## Features

### Administrator
- Login, JWT-based auth, role-based access control
- Full CRUD for job categories, designations, locations, and skills
- Full job CRUD (create, **edit**, close, delete) with a filter for admin-posted vs. employer-posted
- **Create recruitment company accounts directly** (activated immediately), in addition to verifying
  companies that self-registered
- Company verification workflow (verify / reject pending company registrations, each triggering an
  email/SMS notification to the company)
- Employee account creation, with enable/disable control
- Targeted or broadcast email/SMS to candidates, employees, or companies
- Aggregate stats dashboard

### Candidates
- Registration with OTP email verification
- Login, JWT session
- Job search/filter by company, category, designation, location, skill, salary, experience, and
  qualification
- Apply to jobs (with duplicate-application prevention), track status in "My Applications"
- Full profile management: personal, education, professional, skills (from a managed list, plus
  free-text custom skills), and career preferences
- Resume upload (PDF) or resume-by-link, with a live profile-completion percentage
- Personal dashboard: stats, recent applications, recommended jobs
- Automatic application-confirmation email on apply

### Employer Zone
- Company self-registration, with an automatic email/SMS confirmation that registration was received
- **Admin can also create a company account directly** — activated immediately (skips the
  pending-verification step), for a recruiter the admin already knows and is vouching for
- Job posting gated behind admin verification for self-registered companies (a company can't post
  until approved)
- Company receives an email/SMS notification when an admin verifies or rejects their registration
- Post, **edit**, and close their own job openings
- View their own jobs list

### Employees
- Admin-provisioned login (no public sign-up) with a designation on file
- Scoped access — cannot reach admin or employer-only routes

- **Stateless authentication**: JWT in the `Authorization` header, no server-side session state.
  Role is enforced centrally in one Spring Security filter chain (`SecurityConfig`), not scattered
  per-controller.
- **One React SPA**, role-aware routing (`ProtectedRoute`) and a shared Axios client with a global
  401 interceptor.
- **Three containers** (MySQL, backend, frontend/nginx) orchestrated by a single `docker-compose.yml`.

## Installation

See **[INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md)** for full step-by-step setup (Docker install, cloning,
environment variables, troubleshooting). Quick version below.

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine + Compose v2 on Linux)
- Git

### Docker Setup (recommended — one command)

```bash
git clone <this-repository-url>
cd shivani-tech
docker compose up --build
```

- Frontend → http://localhost:5173
- Backend API → http://localhost:8080
- MySQL is not exposed on a host port by default (avoids clashing with a local MySQL install) —
  reach it via `docker exec -it shivani-mysql mysql -uroot -proot` if you need a SQL prompt.

First boot creates all tables automatically (`ddl-auto: update`). There's no seed data baked into
the image — see **[Database Setup](#database-setup)** below, or use the demo accounts already
seeded in this submission (see **Demo Accounts** in `DEMO_GUIDE.md`).

### Manual Setup (without Docker)

**Backend:** needs MySQL running locally, then:
```bash
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Full environment variable list in [`backend/README.md`](backend/README.md) or
[`docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`](docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md).

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

### Database Setup

Tables are created automatically on first boot. There's no public admin-registration endpoint (by
design — you don't want the internet creating admins), so the first admin is inserted directly:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, email, password, role, is_verified, is_enabled, created_at)
VALUES (UUID_TO_BIN(UUID()), 'admin@shivanitech.in', '<bcrypt-hash>', 'ADMIN', true, true, NOW());
```

**Important:** the `id` column is `binary(16)` (Hibernate 6's default UUID storage) — you must use
`UUID_TO_BIN(UUID())`, not bare `UUID()`, or the insert fails with `Data too long for column 'id'`.
This was confirmed by actually hitting that exact error against a live container during this
project's runtime verification pass.

### Running Frontend
```bash
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```
Or via Docker: it's already running at http://localhost:5173 after `docker compose up`.

### Running Backend
```bash
cd backend && mvn spring-boot:run
```
Or via Docker: it's already running at http://localhost:8080 after `docker compose up`.

## API Overview

Full endpoint-by-endpoint documentation is in **[API_REFERENCE.md](API_REFERENCE.md)**. Summary:

| Area | Base path | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| Auth (register/login/OTP) | `/api/auth/**` | Public |
| Public job search/detail | `/api/jobs/**` | Public |
| Admin | `/api/admin/**` | `ROLE_ADMIN` |
| Candidate | `/api/candidate/**` | `ROLE_CANDIDATE` |
| Employer | `/api/employer/**` | `ROLE_EMPLOYER` |

## User Roles

| Role | How an account is created | Can do |
|---|---|---|
| **Administrator** | Inserted directly into the DB (no public sign-up) | Everything — lookups, jobs, companies, employees, notifications, dashboard |
| **Employer** | Public company self-registration, gated by admin verification | Post/edit/close jobs for their own company once verified |
| **Candidate** | Public registration + OTP email verification | Search/apply for jobs, manage profile/resume, view applications and dashboard |
| **Employee** | Created by an admin (no public sign-up) | Log in with a scoped, non-admin/non-employer account |

## Future Enhancements

- Real email/SMS delivery (currently logs instead of sending until `MAIL_*`/`TWILIO_*` are set to
  real credentials — the code path is fully built and tested, just not connected to a live provider)
- Automated unit/integration test suite (JUnit/Vitest) — current testing is a comprehensive
  black-box API smoke test plus manual QA, not unit-level
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Resume viewing for employers/admins reviewing an application
- N+1 query optimization on job listing endpoints for larger datasets
- Move uploaded resumes to S3-compatible object storage (the current live deployment's filesystem
  is ephemeral — see **[DEPLOYMENT_REPORT.md](DEPLOYMENT_REPORT.md)**)

## Known Limitations

- No real email/SMS provider configured out of the box — see `docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` to
  connect one
- `JWT_SECRET` ships with a placeholder default for local/manual setups — the live deployment uses
  a real generated secret, but change the placeholder before any deployment of your own
- No rate limiting on login/OTP endpoints yet
- TLS/HTTPS is handled automatically by Vercel and Render on the live deployment; if you self-host
  instead (e.g. your own VPS via `docker-compose.yml`), put nginx/Caddy in front for HTTPS yourself
