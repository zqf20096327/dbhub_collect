# tracker

**Unified local usage tracker for Claude, Grok, Codex, Gemini, OpenAI, and Z.ai.**

See every subscription's quota in one terminal command — no more logging into
each account, checking usage, and logging out.

## Why

If you juggle multiple AI accounts, checking "who still has quota?" is a
ritual: log in, read a usage page, log out, repeat. **tracker** reuses the
credentials the official CLIs already wrote (or a pasted API key) and answers
the question in one command.

- `tracker` / `tracker list` — dashboard for **all** accounts at once
- Refresh-if-stale collection (cached when fresh, network when not)
- Honors usage-endpoint 429 backoff so you keep last-known bars
- Auto-detects API keys by shape (`sk-ant-`, `xai-`, `AIza`, `sk-`, GLM `id.secret`)
- Optional Discord webhook that posts and **edits** one live message
- `tracker status` names the account with the most quota left, so you don't
  have to eyeball five sets of bars
- Bars adapt to the terminal width instead of wrapping in a narrow pane

Read-only observability for the CLI sessions you already use. Token refresh
for Claude/Grok/Codex writes rotated grants back to the provider CLI file so
you are not forced into a re-login loop.

`tracker status` compresses the same data to one line, and names the account
with the most headroom left:

```
2 Claude · 2 Grok · 1 Codex · 1 Gemini · 1 OpenAI · 1 Z.ai · max 7d: 88% · 1 Grok blocked
  best: Grok main  95% free
```

> Demo data is synthetic (`scripts/generate_screenshots.py`); no real account

## Install

```bash
uv tool install ai-quota-tracker    # recommended — isolated, on PATH
# or:
pipx install ai-quota-tracker
# or:
pip install ai-quota-tracker

tracker --help
```

The distribution is **`ai-quota-tracker`**; the command and import package are
both `tracker`.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SakethKanchi/tracker.git
cd tracker
uv tool install .          # installs the `tracker` CLI
# or:  pip install .
tracker --help
```

Editable install for development:

```bash
uv sync
uv run tracker list
# or
pip install -e .
```

### Requirements

- Python **3.11+**
- For subscription windows: the official provider CLI already logged in
  ([Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code),
  [Grok](https://grok.x.ai/),
  [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex))
- For API-key accounts: a valid key from Anthropic / xAI / Google AI Studio /
  OpenAI platform / Z.ai (GLM Coding Plan)

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Import from a logged-in CLI
claude                 # or: grok login --oauth  /  codex (ChatGPT sign-in)
tracker add claude     # or: tracker add grok  /  tracker add codex

# 2. Or paste an API key — provider is auto-detected
tracker add sk-ant-api03-...     # Claude
tracker add xai-...              # Grok
tracker add AIza...              # Gemini
tracker add sk-proj-...          # OpenAI platform
tracker add 0f8c….AbCd…          # Z.ai / Zhipu GLM Coding Plan

# Or let tracker find an already-wired GLM Coding Plan key
# ($Z_AI_API_KEY, or $ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN + a z.ai base URL, or
#  the env block of ~/.claude/settings.json):
tracker add zai
# same thing via flag form:
tracker --add "AIzaSy..."

# 3. See everything
tracker                # same as: tracker list
tracker list --refresh # force network pass
tracker status         # one-line aggregate
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|----------------|
| `tracker` / `tracker list` | Primary dashboard — all accounts, refresh-if-stale |
| `tracker list --refresh` | Force-refresh every account, then show |
| `tracker list --watch [N]` | Live dashboard, redraws every N seconds (default 5) |
| `tracker add claude\|grok\|codex\|zai` | Import a live credential from the CLI/agent config |
| `tracker add <api_key>` / `tracker --add <api_key>` | Auto-detect provider from key and add |
| `tracker sync` / `tracker sync --label SELECTOR` | Force-refresh (all, or everything a selector names) |
| `tracker tokens [--since 7d] [--provider …]` | Historical token report |
| `tracker status` | Compact aggregate line |
| `tracker remove <SELECTOR>...` | Drop accounts + their credential files and usage history |
| `tracker log PROVIDER LABEL --msgs N --resets-in 1h30m` | Manual usage sample |
| `tracker webhook` / `tracker webhook --once` | Discord channel dashboard |
| `tracker -V` | Version |

`tracker -h` and every `tracker <command> -h` end in a block of
copy-pasteable examples, so the reference is in the tool as well as here.

## Providers

| Provider | How to add | What you see |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Claude** | `tracker add claude` or `sk-ant-…` key | 5h / 7d / scoped / spend (OAuth); key health (API key) |
| **Grok** | `tracker add grok` or `xai-…` key | Weekly + monthly credits (OAuth); key health (API key) |
| **Codex** | `tracker add codex` (ChatGPT login) | Primary + secondary rate-limit windows via WHAM |
| **Gemini** | `tracker add AIza…` | Key health + model list (no public % usage window) |
| **OpenAI** | `tracker add sk-…` | Key health (platform billing is separate from Codex) |
| **Z.ai** | `tracker add zai` or a `id.secret` key | GLM Coding Plan 5h + weekly token windows, monthly MCP quota |

### Naming an account

`remove`, `sync --label`, and `log` take a **selector**: a label, an email, a
provider name, `provider:label`, or an account id (in full, or a unique prefix
of 8+ characters).

```bash
tracker remove codex                    # by provider
tracker remove you@example.com          # by label or email
tracker remove codex:you@example.com    # when one email has two accounts
tracker remove 9f3c1a20                 # by account id, shown in error output
tracker remove codex zai                # several at once
tracker remove you@example.com --all    # every account that selector names
```

Labels are not unique — one email commonly has both a Grok and a Codex
account — so an ambiguous selector is reported with the exact alternatives and
their short ids instead of silently picking one. With several selectors, all of
them are resolved before anything is deleted: one bad selector aborts the whole
command rather than half-removing your accounts.

Removing an account deletes its credential file, usage samples, token history,
rate-limit events and fetch state. It is not reversible, and re-adding the
account starts its history over.

### Codex auth notes

Codex ChatGPT refresh tokens are **single-use**. After a successful refresh,
tracker writes the rotated tokens back to **both** its credential store and
`~/.codex/auth.json` so the Codex CLI is not left with a dead grant
(`refresh_token_reused`). Do not copy `auth.json` across machines while both
sides keep refreshing.

## How freshness works

| Situation | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| Sample younger than ~5 min | Serve cache (`cached`) — no network |
| Backing off after 429 | Serve last-good (`backing-off`) |
| Stale and eligible | Fetch live windows (`api` / `derived`) |
| Dead refresh token | Row stays; tagged for re-login |

Every account always gets a row so rate-limits never hide the rest of your
fleet.

## Discord (optional)

Post the same dashboard into a channel and auto-edit it every few minutes:

```bash
# ~/.config/tracker/webhook.json  (chmod 600)
{"url": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/…", "interval_sec": 300}

tracker webhook --once   # smoke test
tracker webhook          # long-running poller
```

Full setup (including systemd user unit): **[docs/discord-webhook.md](https://github.com/SakethKanchi/tracker/blob/main/docs/discord-webhook.md)**.

## Data locations

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.config/tracker/credentials/` | Per-account OAuth blobs (`0600`) |
| `~/.local/share/tracker/tracker.db` | Usage history + backoff state |
| `~/.config/tracker/webhook.json` | Discord webhook config |

Credentials are **local only**. See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/SakethKanchi/tracker/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## Architecture

Provider collectors → SQLite → rich TUI (and optional Discord embed).

Details: **[docs/architecture.md](https://github.com/SakethKanchi/tracker/blob/main/docs/architecture.md)**  
Original design notes: [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-28-tracker-design.md](https://github.com/SakethKanchi/tracker/blob/main/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-28-tracker-design.md)

## Prior art

- [realiti4/claude-swap](https://github.com/realiti4/claude-swap) (`cswap`) — Claude multi-account switcher + usage UI; endpoint/backoff patterns informed this project
- [ryoppippi/ccusage](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage) — local session token accounting across agent CLIs

**tracker** is provider-agnostic and intentionally **does not** auto-switch
accounts (that can come later on top of the same store).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `re-login needed — refresh token dead` | The provider CLI (or another machine) rotated the grant out from under tracker | Log in with the provider CLI again, then `tracker add <provider>` |
| Codex says `refresh_token_reused` | `~/.codex/auth.json` was copied between machines and both sides refresh | Re-run the Codex ChatGPT login on one machine only, then re-add |
| A row shows `backing-off` | The provider returned HTTP 429; tracker is respecting the window | Wait it out; the bars shown are last-known, not stale-forever |
| Gemini/OpenAI show only `key valid` | Those platforms expose no public per-key usage percentage | Expected — key health and model access is all that's available |
| `no account matches 'X'` | Selectors are exact — a label, email, provider, `provider:label`, or account id, never a partial string | Pick one of the lines it prints |
| `'X' matches 2 accounts` | Two accounts share that label or email (usually one email signed into two services) | Use `provider:label` or the short id it prints, or `--all` to remove every match |
| A code change to `remove` (or anything else) has no effect | `tracker` on `PATH` is a snapshot install, not your checkout — `head -1 $(which tracker)` points at a `uv tool` or pipx environment | `uv tool install --force --editable .` from the checkout, then restart any `tracker webhook` service |
| Z.ai row says `invalid z.ai API key` | The GLM Coding Plan key was rotated, or it belongs to the other platform (`api.z.ai` vs `open.bigmodel.cn`) | `tracker add zai` again with the current key |
| `tracker: command not found` | Installed into a venv that is not on `PATH` | `uv tool install .`, or use `PYTHONPATH=src python -m tracker.cli` |
| Bars look wrong after an upgrade | Old samples in SQLite | `tracker sync` to force a fresh network pass |

## FAQ

**Does this switch accounts for me?** No. It is deliberately read-only
observability. Auto-switching can be built on top of the same store later.

**Does it send my data anywhere?** No. Everything is local: credentials in
`~/.config/tracker/`, history in a local SQLite file. The only outbound calls
are to the providers themselves, plus your own Discord webhook if you enable it.

**Will this get my account banned?** It calls the same usage endpoints the
official CLIs call, with the same credentials, less often than an active
session would. That said, it is unofficial — see the disclaimer.

**Why is the PyPI name different?** `tracker` and `ai-usage-tracker` are both
taken on PyPI, so the distribution is `ai-quota-tracker`. The command and import
package are still `tracker`.
