# evestack

### Run AI agents on your own machine.

One command gives you the whole stack. Your conversations are saved in a database you own, code
runs in a safe sandbox, and a dashboard lets you watch every agent and approve anything risky
before it happens. Free, open source, and nothing phones home.

## Quickstart

```bash
npx evestack create my-agent
```

Four questions — where, which model, tools, and whether to bring it up — all asked before any
work starts. Answering **yes** to the last one starts Postgres, creates the schema, pulls the
dashboard and then offers to start the agent, so there is nothing left to paste. Answering
**no** — or running under `--yes`, or with Docker not running — leaves all of that to you, and
it prints the four commands that do it, after a `cd`:

```bash
cd my-agent
docker compose up -d postgres              # durable sessions
npm run db:bootstrap                       # create the workflow schema
docker compose --profile dashboard up -d   # the dashboard
npm run dev                                # the agent — holds this terminal
```

Either way it finishes by drawing the parts with the ports **your** machine actually had free.
[The quickstart](https://evestack.vercel.app/docs/quickstart) walks that manual path line by
line.

In another terminal:

```bash
npx evestack status                        # is it up? and if not, what to run
npx evestack tour                          # a guided first run: one message, followed
                                           # through the terminal, Postgres and the dashboard
```

`npx evestack verify` is the thorough version — every part, with the command that fixes anything
broken. All three work from anywhere inside the project.

`npx` because nothing has installed the command yet: scaffolding runs it once and leaves nothing
on your PATH. `npm i -g evestack` drops the `npx ` from every line above, and is worth it if you
run more than one of these.

The scaffolder generates your credentials and prints them once; `evestack open` prints them
again and opens the dashboard. Every route is behind that credential — the dashboard starts runs
and approves shell commands, so it fails closed.

The dashboard step is a **pull**, not a build: `ghcr.io/sammytourani/evestack-dashboard` is
published for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, ~230 MB compressed per platform, at the tag the
scaffolder pins. A `docker compose pull` that 404s means that tag has not been published yet —
[CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) names the release that is pending, and a checkout can always
`docker compose build dashboard` instead.

Already have an eve project? `npx evestack attach .` adds evestack to it without overwriting
anything, and prints an undo line for everything it writes.

## What you get

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Sessions** | Every run on your machine — turns, subagent trees, tokens, cached reads, tool counts | [docs](docs/dashboard.mdx) |
| **Cost** | Priced per turn from token counts. A model with no configured price shows `unpriced`, never a silent $0.00 | [docs](docs/architecture.mdx) |
| **Monitors** | p50/p75/p95/p99 turn latency, failure rates, throughput — computed in Postgres over a rolling window | [docs](docs/dashboard.mdx) |
| **Traces** | OpenTelemetry spans per session: model calls, tool calls, arguments and results | [docs](docs/observability.mdx) |
| **Control** | Start a session, stream the reply, send a follow-up, cancel a run — from the browser | [docs](docs/dashboard.mdx) |
| **Approvals** | Gated tool calls park the session and wait for a human, with an audit log of who decided what | [docs](docs/dashboard.mdx) |
| **Memory** | Semantic recall on the Postgres you already run, via pgvector. No vector service. Needs an embeddings provider — OpenAI, or Ollama locally; Anthropic has none | [docs](docs/memory.mdx) |
| **Schedules** | Durable cron with a history of every fire, and a pause switch that needs no redeploy | [docs](docs/proactive.mdx) |
| **Evals** | Promote any real session — especially one that went wrong — into an `evals/*.eval.ts` | [docs](docs/dashboard.mdx) |
| **Integrations** | 1,000+ toolkits via Composio; the managed-OAuth ones are one click | [docs](docs/composio-auth.mdx) |
| **Skills** | Inspect what the agent has loaded, and scan skills before it does | [docs](docs/dashboard.mdx) |
| **`evestack doctor`** | Read-only forensics for a durable job that is stuck. Prints the SQL; never writes | [docs](docs/cli.mdx) |

## Built on eve

Under the hood, evestack runs on [eve](https://github.com/vercel/eve), Vercel's open-source agent
framework. evestack is **not a fork** — it ships as an eve registry, so it adds to eve rather than
diverging from it, and it is pinned to upstream by a contract suite of **22 checks / 508
assertions** that runs on every commit and against every new eve release. When eve ships, evestack
tracks it in days.

That suite is not decorative. It is how we caught eve 0.31 removing `continuationToken` from the
HTTP session bodies — which broke every new chat and every fork — while both `tsc` and the static
contracts stayed green. Only the live seam probes saw it. `docs/upgrading.mdx` has the story.

## Why self-host

|  | Managed | evestack |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runs on | Vercel | your machine, VPS or cluster |
| Session state | Vercel Workflows | your Postgres |
| Run history | purged after 1–30 days depending on plan, then billed at $0.50/GB-month ([pricing](https://vercel.com/docs/workflows/pricing)) | a table you `SELECT` |
| Observability | 12 hours to 30 days depending on plan ([limits](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/observability-plus#limitations)) | your disk, your retention |
| Dashboard | Agent Runs — read-only | included, and it drives the agent |
| Memory | no first-party store | included, same Postgres |
| Your data | Vercel's platform | inside your network |

Off-platform the only thing that costs money is model tokens, and [Ollama](#local-models) takes
that to zero. One exception: Composio is a hosted third party and holds the OAuth tokens for
accounts you connect. It's off unless you set `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` — see
[docs/composio-auth.mdx](docs/composio-auth.mdx).

## Take one piece instead

evestack ships as an eve registry, so an existing project can take a single part:

```bash
eve registry add @evestack=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SammyTourani/evestack/main/registry/r/{name}.json
eve add @evestack/memory
```

Seven items: `memory`, `instrumentation`, `docker-sandbox`, `basic-auth`, and Slack, Telegram
and Discord channels. See [docs/registry.mdx](docs/registry.mdx).

## Local models

`EVESTACK_PROVIDER=ollama` runs the whole stack for nothing. Three things matter, and only two of
them are set for you: `modelContextWindowTokens` must be declared (eve sizes compaction from the
AI Gateway catalog, and a local model isn't in it), and `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` takes the bare host with
no `/api`. The third is yours: **the embedding model is a second pull.** `ollama pull
nomic-embed-text` (274 MB) is what makes `remember` and `recall` work — a chat model is not an
embedding model — and everything else runs without it. `npm run verify` checks for it by name.

**Check your RAM first.** On an 8 GB laptop already running Docker, Postgres, the dashboard and
the agent, loading qwen3 took over three minutes to answer "say ok" and the machine eventually
shut down. Budget **both model sizes + 4 GB** free — a `remember` call needs the chat model and
the 274 MB embedding model, not one of them. evestack never picks a local model on its own — you
have to ask for it.

## Requirements, and what is actually tested

Node 24, Docker, and a model API key (or Ollama).

"Node 24" is the floor, and there is now a tested range above it — all seven published packages
declare `"engines": { "node": ">=24" }`, as do the root manifest and the template a scaffold
gets, and CI installs both 24 and the current major on the two jobs cheap enough to matrix
(`typecheck` and `registry`). The other four Linux jobs still pin 24. The rest, stated plainly
because the code contains platform branches that might suggest otherwise:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Linux x86-64** | Tested. Every job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on `ubuntu-latest` bar the non-blocking `macos` one, and it is the only platform the runtime tier runs on at all |
| **Linux arm64** | The dashboard image is built and published for it; the CLI and template are not tested there |
| **macOS** | Partly tested. A non-blocking `macos-latest` job runs typecheck, the contract tier and the POSIX file-mode tests. The runtime tier cannot follow it — that needs a Docker daemon the runner does not have |
| **Windows** | **Untested.** Twelve `process.platform === "win32"` branches ship, and the only one with a test is exercised by passing `"win32"` in as an argument on Linux. Use WSL2 |
| **Postgres** | `pgvector/pgvector:pg17`, which is what both compose files run and what CI starts |

[docs/support.mdx](docs/support.mdx) has the rest of the support statement — which versions get
fixes (the newest, and only the newest), what a `0.x` bump promises, and where each of the
twelve Windows branches is. [docs/upgrading.mdx](docs/upgrading.mdx) is how you move an existing
project forward: new dashboard image, new template, new eve pin.

## Repository layout

```

`evestack create` and `npx create-evestack` run the same code, so a bug is fixed once. The
dashboard ships as a container rather than an npm package. Release order is in
[RELEASING.md](./RELEASING.md), and what actually changed in each of those releases is in
[CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) — grouped by package rather than by date, because the seven npm
packages and the one container image above are versioned independently.

## Things that cost us time

Written down so they don't cost you any.

- **Pin `@workflow/world-postgres` to an exact version — not `@latest`, and not `@beta`
  either.** npm `latest` is the 4.x line and eve rejects it outright, which is the easy half.
  `beta` is the trap: it looks right and it is a moving dist-tag, and upstream ships World
  **spec** breaks inside `5.0.0-beta.*` with no semver signal. Measured against eve 0.30.8:
  `world-postgres@5.0.0-beta.32` → `@workflow/world@5.0.0-beta.25` → spec 5 → boots, while
  `@5.0.0-beta.34` → `world@5.0.0-beta.27` → spec 6 → dies at startup. The tag moved `.34` →
  `.35` inside one afternoon. `templates/default` pins `5.0.0-beta.32` exactly; `^` and `~` both
  still admit `.34`.
- **Forward both `/eve/` and `/.well-known/workflow/`** through your proxy, unrewritten. Forward
  only the first and sessions start, then stall when callbacks can't get back.
- **In production, loopback gets a 401 too — that's correct.** From eve 0.30 `localDev()` grants
  only inside `eve dev`, so a built server needs Basic credentials from every host. On 0.29.x it
  was the reverse *and exploitable*: `localDev()` matched an unanchored `/^127\./` against the
  attacker-controlled `Host` header, so `127.evil.com` got an unauthenticated principal. We
  found and patched it; Vercel fixed it upstream in 0.30.0. Pin `eve` `>=0.30.0`.
- **Adding `agent/instrumentation.ts` disables eve's zero-config trace spool**, so `eve traces`
  stops working. The dashboard replaces it; delete the file to get it back.
- **Cancellation is cooperative.** The cancel route returns 202 immediately but the in-flight
  model call keeps streaming — we measured ~90 seconds. Don't build a stop button that assumes
  silence.
- **A failed turn still records `status = 'completed'`.** The stream emits `turn.failed`; the
  workflow row disagrees, because the workflow handled the error. `$eve.model` is only written
  once a model call reports usage, so its absence on a finished turn is the surviving evidence.
- **Watch your provider's daily cap.** An OpenAI account with no payment method allows 50
  requests per day, and the failure arrives as an opaque `MODEL_CALL_FAILED`.

We also found [vercel/eve#1658](https://github.com/vercel/eve/issues/1658) — denying a tool
approval permanently fails the durable session (p1, open).
