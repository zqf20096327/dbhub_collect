## Overview

**ScoopX** is a Windows desktop development environment manager built on [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/). It uses WinUI 3 for a native interface and brings PHP version management, configuration, and common developer tools into one place—so you spend less time on repetitive command-line work.

## Features

- **PHP version management**: Manage multiple PHP versions and the default CLI version in one place.
- **PHP configuration & extensions**: Manage each version’s `php.ini`, related environment variables, and common extensions.
- **Developer tools**: Manage MySQL, Redis, Node.js, Composer, and other tools from a single UI.
- **Scoop made visual**: Search, install, update, and uninstall packages through a graphical interface.
- **Native Windows UI**: Follows Windows 11 design and interaction patterns.

> Available package versions, extensions, and install options depend on Scoop buckets and package compatibility.

## Tech stack

| Area | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop UI | WinUI 3 / Windows App SDK |
| Language | C# |
| Runtime | .NET 10 |
| Package manager | Scoop |
| Target platform | Windows 11 |
| IDE | Visual Studio |

## Install & use

Check the [Releases](../../releases) page for available builds and install instructions. After installing, follow the in-app prompts to set up Scoop and the tools you need.

## Build from source

Two independent workflows:

| Goal | How |
| --- | --- |
| **Debug** | Open the project in Visual Studio, set platform to **x64**, select the **ScoopX** launch profile, press F5. This is unpackaged — no Deploy / MSIX step. |
| **Installer for users** | Do not use Visual Studio “Package and Publish”. From the repo root run: |

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/publish-setup.ps1
```

Output: `artifacts/ScoopX-Setup-x64.exe`.

Requires the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download), Windows App SDK build tools, and [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).

> The installer is **not code-signed**. SmartScreen may show “Unknown publisher”; choose **Run anyway**.
