_CatDat_ provides a growing collection of categorical structures such as categories and functors, each with detailed descriptions and properties. Built by and for those who love [category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory).

### [**https://catdat.app**](https://catdat.app)

## Features

- **Four Types of Categorical Structures**: Supports categories, functors, morphisms, and symmetric monoidal categories.
- **Structure Detail Pages**: Each categorical structure has a dedicated page with its definition, satisfied and unsatisfied properties, and related structures.
- **Property Detail Pages**: Explore the definition of a property and view categorical structures that satisfy it and those that don't.
- **Proofs and References**: Each property and implication includes a proof or reference, forming a data-driven knowledge base for category theory.
- **Deduction System**: Automatically infers properties of categorical structures from existing ones using a database of implications.
- **Automatic Dualization**: Automatically dualizes implications and property assignments.
- **Searchable Database**: Find categorical structures based on satisfied properties and unsatisfied properties.
- **Comparison Feature**: Compare multiple categorical structures to identify their differences and similarities.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Usable on both mobile and desktop. Supports Light/dark mode.

## Similar projects

_CatDat_ draws inspiration from and complements other resources in category theory:

- **[Catabase](https://catabase.fly.dev)**: A similar project that appears to be abandoned. It is more ambitious in terms of available data types but less complete for basic categories. The UI is not very intuitive, and it lacks an integrated deduction system between properties. See the [nForum announcement](https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/13419/catabase-a-database-of-categories/).
- **[SmallCategories](https://smallcats.info/)**: A database that systematically enumerates isomorphism classes of small finite categories. Each entry represents one finite category by its multiplication table and provides a visualization and selected properties of that category. The database is currently complete for categories with at most 8 morphisms.
- **[nLab](https://ncatlab.org)**: A wiki for (higher) category theory. _CatDat_ refers to nLab pages for detailed information on its entries.
- **[Clowder Project](https://clowderproject.com)**: A new online reference for category theory. Unlike _CatDat_, which is data-based, Clowder follows a textbook-based approach.
- **[Database of Ring Theory](https://ringtheory.herokuapp.com/)**: This database focuses on ring theory and module theory rather than category theory, but is very similar in nature and was a major inspiration for _CatDat_.
- **[pi-Base](https://topology.pi-base.org/)**: This is a database of examples and counterexamples in topology. Just like _CatDat_ it uses three types of entries (objects, properties, and theorems) and automatically derives properties from the theorems.

**[MathBases](https://mathbases.org/)** lists many other databases for other kinds of mathematical structure.

**Cost transparency.** The project currently only incurs domain costs of about $15 per year. There are no costs for hosting or the database. The project has no external funding.
