## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- MetaMask browser extension (or compatible wallet)
- Polygon Amoy testnet MATIC (for testing)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Crypto-Prediction-Market
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Contract Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ../contracts
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173` (or your configured port).

**Environment Variables** (create `.env` in `frontend/`):
```env
VITE_WAGER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...  # Deployed contract address
VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=...  # Optional: WalletConnect project ID
```

### Deploying the Contract

1. **Configure Network** (in `contracts/hardhat.config.js`):
   - Add your private key to `.env`
   - Configure network settings

2. **Deploy to Polygon Amoy**:
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   npm run deploy:amoy
   ```

3. **Deploy to Polygon Mainnet**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:polygon
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
cd contracts
npm test
```

All tests should pass (19/19).

## Smart Contract Functions

### Core Functions
- `createWager()` - Create a new prediction market wager
- `pledge()` - Pledge funds to join a wager
- `resolveWager()` - Resolve wager and set winner (creator/owner only)
- `signMultiSig()` - Sign multi-sig to approve fund release
- `releaseFunds()` - Release funds to winner (after deadline or all signed)
- `cancelWager()` - Cancel wager and refund participants (creator/owner only)

### View Functions
- `getWager()` - Get complete wager details
- `getParticipants()` - Get all participants for a wager
- `getUserWagers()` - Get all wagers for a user
- `hasSigned()` - Check if user has signed multi-sig
- `getWagerCount()` - Get total number of wagers

### Admin Functions
- `emergencyWithdraw()` - Emergency fund recovery (owner only)

## Development

### Contract Scripts

```bash
# Compile contracts
npm run compile

# Run tests
npm test

# Deploy to Polygon Amoy
npm run deploy:amoy

# Deploy to Polygon Mainnet
npm run deploy:polygon

# Export ABI
npm run export-abi

# Verify contract on explorer
npm run verify:amoy <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

### Frontend Scripts

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

## Security Considerations

- ✅ All critical functions use `nonReentrant` modifier
- ✅ State updates occur before external calls
- ✅ Access control enforced (creator/owner checks)
- ✅ Input validation on all user inputs
- ✅ Safe external transfers with proper error handling
