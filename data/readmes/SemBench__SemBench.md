SemBench is a benchmark targeting a novel class of systems: **semantic query processing engines**. Those systems rely inherently on generative and reasoning  capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). They extend SQL with semantic operators, configured by natural language instructions, that are evaluated via LLMs and enable users to perform various operations on multimodal data.

SemBench introduces diversity across three key dimensions: **scenarios, modalities, and operators**. Included are scenarios ranging from movie review analysis to car damage detection. Within these scenarios, we cover different data modalities, including images, audio, text, and table. Finally, the queries involve a diverse set of operators, including semantic filters, joins, mappings, ranking, and classification operators.

Currently SemBench is evalulated on **three academic systems (LOTUS, Palimpzest, and ThalamusDB) and one industrial system, Google BigQuery**. Although these results reflect a snapshot of systems under continuous development, our study offers crucial insights into their current strengths and weaknesses, illuminating promising directions for future research.

We understand that every system is under rapid development, which is why we maintain an [online leaderboard](https://sembench.org). We encourage you to submit your system's results and participate in the benchmark. Please reach out to discuss how to contribute your results to the leaderboard.

## To Users: SemBench — A Simple, Ready-to-Use Benchmark

We understand that downloading datasets, generating databases, and setting up environments can be tedious—especially in the systems area, where each system often requires a unique setup. SemBench automates all of these steps for you! It automatically downloads datasets and generates multi-modal databases. Setting up environments for SemBench and four supported systems (LOTUS, Palimpzest, ThalamusDB, and BigQuery) takes just one script.

So, enjoy using SemBench! We believe a good benchmark should minimize user effort—and SemBench is designed exactly for that.

## 🌟 Overview

Modern data systems increasingly need to process and reason over multi-modal data - combining traditional relational data with images, audio, and text. SemBench provides a standardized evaluation framework with:

- **5 Real-world Scenarios**: wildlife monitoring, car damage diagnosis, sentiment analysis of movie reviews, multi-modal question anwering, E-commerce product analysis
- **Multi-modal Queries**: Complex semantic operations across multi-modal databases: table, text, image, and audio  
- **System-agnostic Design**: Extensible and already supports LOTUS, Palimpzest, ThalamusDB, CAESURA, BigQuery, DuckDB FlockMTL
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Quality (precision/recall/F1, relative error...), cost (money, token consumption), efficiency evaluation (execution time), and memory usage
- **Rich Visualizations**: Automated generation of performance comparisons

## 🔧 System Support

SemBench supports evaluation of multiple multi-modal data systems:

- **LOTUS**: Semantic operators optimized by reducing costs with guaranteed accuracy
- **Palimpzest**: Semantic operators using cost-based optimization
- **ThalamusDB**: Semantic operators optimized with approximate query processing
- **CAESURA**: LLM-Based Multi-Modal Query Planner
- **FlockMTL**: An open-source extension of DuckDB   
- **BigQuery**: Google's analytics data warehouse

Each system implements a standardized runner interface enabling fair comparison across different architectural approaches. Also SemBench can be easily extended to support more systems.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Large Language Model Provider Setup
Please refer to the `.env.example` file and create a corresponding `.env` file to configure the necessary credentials or API keys for using Gemini, OpenAI, or models provided by other platforms.
For the list of supported models for each system, please consult the corresponding repository for detailed information.

### Automatic Environment Setup

SemBench uses per-system isolated virtual environments (managed by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)) to avoid dependency conflicts between systems. Setup takes a few minutes and requires no manual intervention:

```bash
# Set up all systems (installs uv automatically if needed)
bash scripts/setup_envs.sh

# Or set up specific systems only
bash scripts/setup_envs.sh lotus palimpzest
```

This creates:
- `.venvs/sembench/` — orchestrator environment (runs `run.py`, evaluation, plotting)
- `.venvs/{system}/` — isolated environment per system (e.g., `.venvs/lotus/`, `.venvs/palimpzest/`)

Each system gets its own environment with its own dependencies, so there are no conflicts (e.g., lotus-ai requires numpy<2 while palimpzest requires numpy>=2). See [ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md](ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md) for details.

### Automatic Dataset Download and Database Generation
Note

- SemBench automatically downloads the required datasets from Google Drive and constructs multi-modal databases according to the specified scale factor.

- The databases included in the repository are provided for demonstration purposes only. Before running your own experiments, please delete the existing `files/{scenario}/data` directory and execute the scripts to regenerate the data.

### Running Benchmarks
```bash
# Activate the orchestrator environment
source .venvs/sembench/bin/activate

# Run specific system on specific use case and queries
python3 src/run.py --systems lotus --use-cases movie --queries 1 3 --model gemini-2.5-flash --scale-factor 2000

# Run full evaluation on a use case
python3 src/run.py --systems lotus --use-cases movie --model gemini-2.5-flash --scale-factor 2000

# Compare multiple systems (each runs in its own isolated environment automatically)
python3 src/run.py --systems lotus thalamusdb --use-cases movie --model gemini-2.5-flash --scale-factor 2000

# Execute repeated experiments for error bars
# Please configure the script file first
cd scripts
./repeat_experiment.sh

# Generate performance visualizations
python3 src/plot.py

# Generate the latex table used in our paper
python3 src/table_brick_design.py

# Generate analysis report
python3 src/scripts/analysis.py
```

### Output Structure
Results are organized as:
- **Query Results**: `files/{scenario}/raw_results/{system}/Q{n}.csv`
- **Performance Metrics**: `files/{scenario}/metrics/{system}.json`  
- **Visualizations**: `figures/{scenario}/`

SemBench provides bar charts for every performance metric (money cost, latency, and result quality), pareto figure for cost-quality trade-off, and a comprehensive table in latex to compare all metrics.


## 🏗️ Extending the Benchmark

The modular architecture supports easy extension:

1. **Add New Use Cases**: Implement scenario-specific runner and evaluator
2. **Support New Systems**: Create system-specific runner inheriting from `GenericRunner`  
3. **Custom Metrics**: Extend evaluation framework with domain-specific quality measures
4. **Additional Queries**: Add query definitions in natural language and SQL formats
