| --------------------- | ------- |
| NexxCloud              | [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) |
| API readiness         | [http://localhost:4000/health/ready](http://localhost:4000/health/ready) |

The installer clones into `$HOME/NexxCloud` on Unix systems or
`%USERPROFILE%\NexxCloud` on Windows, creates production secrets, persistent data paths,
health-checked containers, and committed migration state. It waits for the API,
frontend, and background worker before announcing readiness, and never runs destructive
schema synchronization.

---

## Overview

NexxCloud is a LAN-friendly, self-hosted cloud storage application designed for people who
want the convenience of a polished cloud drive while keeping the binary data on hardware
they control. A Next.js interface speaks to an Express API; PostgreSQL owns metadata in
the standard Compose deployment, Redis and BullMQ operate asynchronous maintenance, and
the filesystem stores immutable SHA-256 addressed blobs. The Windows desktop server host
packages the same product experience with a local SQLite database, in-process background
workers, live service logs, and LAN dashboard URLs.

The platform is built around one principle: file operations must preserve storage
integrity. Uploads become reference-counted blobs, trash and restore operations recalculate
accounting transactionally, media is delivered through short-lived signed URLs, and
scheduled workers reconcile drift and clean stale state.

NexxCloud sits between a personal NAS and a modern hosted drive:

| Principle                  | What it means in NexxCloud                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Self-hosted by default     | PostgreSQL, Redis, the API, workers, and the UI run in your Compose deployment.                                             |
| Filesystem-first storage   | Original binary content lives under `STORAGE_ROOT`, with metadata in PostgreSQL.                                            |
| LAN-first access           | The API exposes network status and mDNS publishes local service discovery names.                                            |
| Integrity before expansion | Blob references, storage totals, stale chunks, and metadata are actively verified.                                          |
| One polished web surface   | A glass-panel file manager, previews, upload queue, sharing, settings, and landing experience ship in the Next.js frontend. |
| Desktop server option      | A packaged NexxCloud Server app runs the backend/frontend locally, shows live logs, and displays usable LAN URLs.           |

## Features

| Area                      | Implementation                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Content-addressed storage | Binary content is stored once per SHA-256 digest in `StorageBlob`; files and versions point to blobs.                                                                   |
| Deduplication             | Identical uploads increment a blob reference count instead of reusing another file's stored filename or copying bytes.                                                  |
| Direct uploads            | Multipart uploads stream to a temporary file on disk through Multer rather than accumulating the entire payload in memory.                                              |
| Chunked uploads           | Files larger than 10 MiB in the frontend are divided into server-sized chunks, hashed, retried, merged in a BullMQ worker, and finalized into blob storage.             |
| Upload validation         | Every extension, including custom and executable formats, is stored as opaque content; claimed preview formats still receive signature checks and active content is sandboxed on delivery. |
| Signed media access       | Authenticated clients request five-minute media URLs for preview, thumbnail, and download flows without placing access JWTs in media element URLs.                      |
| File management           | Nested logical folders, breadcrumb navigation, rename, move, copy, favorites, trash, permanent removal, bulk actions, and versions.                                     |
| Apps platform             | Authenticated Docker Hub marketplace search, per-image detail pages, admin-only container installs, installed app controls, logs, and Docker Engine detection.          |
| Sharing                   | Public share tokens support optional password protection and expiration.                                                                                                |
| Previews                  | Images, video, audio, PDF, and selected text/code content render in the browser; thumbnail generation uses Sharp, FFmpeg, and Poppler.                                  |
| Integrity maintenance     | Workers repair storage totals, reference counts, blob metadata, legacy attachment state, old chunks, trash retention, and unreferenced blobs.                           |
| Deployment                | Docker Compose provisions PostgreSQL 16, Redis 7, the Express API, the Next.js UI, and a dedicated worker process.                                                      |
| Native server             | Electron-based NexxCloud Server packages the app for desktop use with SQLite, in-process queues/cache, live logs, and LAN URL discovery.                                |
| Visual system             | Dark cinematic surfaces, glass treatments, cyan/violet accent lighting, Framer Motion landing transitions, and dense file-manager controls.                             |

## Screenshots

### Landing Atmosphere

The landing hero uses the committed cinematic poster as its loading and reduced-motion
fallback, with the accompanying background video rendered by the web application.

### Product Surfaces

The application contains these screenshot-ready product views. UI captures are intentionally
not committed to the repository at this time, so documentation does not ship stale images.

| Upload UI                  | Drag-and-drop dialog plus the persistent upload queue with per-file chunk progress and merge state.   |
| Settings                   | Profile, filesystem storage metrics, LAN access URLs, and QR access helper.                           |
| Sharing                    | Public file landing page with protected-share prompt and inline preview for supported content.        |

## Deployment Reference

### Customized Bootstrap

To deploy a selected branch or destination directory from the GitHub bootstrap:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShadowSafin/NexxCloud/main/install.sh |
  NEXXCLOUD_REPOSITORY_REF=my-branch NEXXCLOUD_INSTALL_DIR=/srv/nexxcloud sh
```

To test a second Windows installation beside a running NexxCloud instance:

```powershell
$env:NEXXCLOUD_INSTALL_DIR = "$HOME\NexxCloud-Test"
$env:NEXXCLOUD_PROJECT_NAME = "nexxcloud_test"
$env:NEXXCLOUD_FRONTEND_PORT = "3300"
$env:NEXXCLOUD_BACKEND_PORT = "4400"
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShadowSafin/NexxCloud/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

If the repository is already cloned, start it locally with `bash setup.sh` on Unix
systems or `setup.bat` on Windows.

### Startup Guarantees

Review scripts before piping remote code on sensitive servers. The standard deployment
path never uses destructive schema synchronization. Fresh databases run
`prisma migrate deploy`; databases created by the earlier schema-push startup are
detected on Prisma `P3005`, upgraded with committed additive baseline SQL, recorded in
migration history, and returned to normal migration deployment only after identifying
the expected legacy NexxCloud tables. The API becomes healthy
only after PostgreSQL, Redis, and writable storage pass readiness checks.

### Deployment Scripts

| Script        | Platform       | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `install.sh`  | Linux/NAS/macOS | Remote GitHub bootstrap: clone or launch, then run secure setup.        |
| `install.ps1` | Windows        | Remote GitHub bootstrap from PowerShell.                               |
| `setup.sh`    | Linux/NAS/macOS | First boot: secure `.env`, storage directory, port check, build/start.  |
| `setup.bat`   | Windows        | First boot through PowerShell with cryptographic secret generation.     |
| `start.sh`    | Linux/NAS/macOS | Validate existing configuration and start/rebuild healthy services.     |
| `start.bat`   | Windows        | Validate and launch an existing Windows installation.                   |
| `update.sh`   | Linux/NAS/macOS | Dump PostgreSQL, fast-forward source, migrate safely, restart services. |

### Useful Commands

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f backend worker
sh start.sh
sh update.sh
docker compose down
```

Persistent data remains in the PostgreSQL and Redis named volumes and in the bind-mounted
`./data` directory unless explicitly removed.

When upgrading an existing development installation, `setup.sh` and `setup.bat` preserve
explicit values already present in `.env`. Before exposing that installation outside a
trusted LAN, set `NODE_ENV=production`, replace any weak secrets, and configure HTTPS
proxy origins.

## Deployment Targets

The root [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml) is the deployment contract. It
builds `frontend`, `backend`, and `worker` from the repository and provisions internal
PostgreSQL and Redis services with health checks and persistent storage.

| Target                 | Deployment route                                                                                                               | Status                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Docker Compose         | Run the GitHub one-liner above, or run `bash setup.sh` / `setup.bat` from an existing checkout.                                | First-class                    |
| NexxCloud Server app    | Build `native/release/NexxCloud.Server.Setup.exe`; choose a data folder, then use the in-app LAN URLs and live logs.           | Desktop server package         |
| Portainer              | Create a Git Repository stack targeting `docker-compose.yml`; paste production variables generated from `.env.example`.       | Compose-compatible             |
| Coolify                | Add a Docker Compose resource from GitHub, set required variables, and publish only the `frontend` service on port `3000`.     | Compose-compatible             |
| Dockge                 | Clone locally, run setup once for `.env`, then manage the root Compose stack in Dockge.                                        | Compose-compatible             |
| Cosmos Cloud           | Run NexxCloud with Docker Compose on the managed host; a native Cosmos-Compose marketplace descriptor is not yet distributed.  | Host Compose path              |
| CasaOS / Umbrel        | Use the host terminal deployment command; branded marketplace packaging is intentionally separate from the production stack. | Host Compose path              |
| Railway / Render       | Service-by-service Docker deployment can be prepared from these Dockerfiles; persistent volume and managed DB wiring needed.  | Future hosted-platform target  |

For panel deployments, do not commit `.env`. Generate five distinct 64-character hex
secrets locally and enter them as stack environment variables:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Required variables are `DB_PASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`,
`MEDIA_TOKEN_SECRET`, and `BULL_BOARD_PASSWORD`. Keep `NODE_ENV=production`.
Missing or weak values cause application startup to fail.

<details>
<summary><strong>Portainer Git stack</strong></summary>

1. In **Stacks**, choose **Add stack** and the Git repository option.
2. Enter this repository URL and `docker-compose.yml` as the Compose path.
3. Define the five required secrets above plus `FRONTEND_URL` for the address users open.
4. For durable file bytes across Git redeployments, set `NEXXCLOUD_DATA_DIR` to an
   absolute persistent host path, such as `/srv/nexxcloud/data`.
5. Deploy the stack and wait for `frontend` and `backend` health checks to become healthy.

<details>
<summary><strong>Coolify Compose resource</strong></summary>

1. Create a new resource from the public Git repository using the Docker Compose build pack.
2. Supply the required production variables before the initial deployment.
3. Map a domain to the `frontend` service on container port `3000`.
4. Keep `postgres` and `redis` private; do not publish them as domains or host ports.
5. Persist `/app/data` for `backend` and `worker` through the same host-backed path.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Control panels and future hosted platforms</strong></summary>

Dockge can operate the standard Compose project after `setup.sh` has securely created its
configuration. Cosmos Cloud uses a related Cosmos-Compose format with proxy-specific
extensions, so the standard host Compose path is supported while a marketplace manifest
is prepared separately. Railway does not execute `docker-compose.yml` directly; its
deployment path maps each Dockerfile/database/volume to separate services. Render similarly
uses individual Docker services rather than this five-service Compose stack.

### Manual Development

Start PostgreSQL and Redis first, then configure a backend environment with a valid
`DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, storage path, and strong secrets.

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run dev
```

In another terminal:

```bash
cd backend
npm run worker
```

In another terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000" > .env.local
npm run dev
```

On PowerShell, create the frontend environment with:

```powershell
Set-Content .env.local "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000"
```

### Desktop Server Build

The native desktop server host is built from `native/`. It stages the current backend and
frontend into `native/runtime`, converts the Prisma schema for SQLite, then packages an
Electron app with the setup window, LAN URL display, and live service logs.

```powershell
npm ci --prefix native
npm run --prefix native prepare:runtime
npm run --prefix native build:host

The Windows installer is written to `native/release/NexxCloud.Server.Setup.exe`. In the
desktop runtime, `NEXXCLOUD_NATIVE_RUNTIME=true` disables Redis requirements and uses
in-process queues/cache instead of the Compose Redis/BullMQ transport.

## Local Network Access

NexxCloud binds the UI and API to all host interfaces by default for trusted home-network
installations. The launchers write detected network information into `.env`; LAN-connected
browser clients can then open the same interface:

```text
http://<host-lan-ip>:3000
http://<hostname>.local:3000
```

The API publishes both the web service and API service over mDNS. Private IPv4 origins and
local hostnames are accepted by the API CORS policy. For any network beyond a trusted LAN,
place NexxCloud behind HTTPS and a reverse proxy.

The desktop NexxCloud Server app also shows LAN dashboard URLs directly under the server
status. Detection prefers physical Wi-Fi/Ethernet adapters and demotes virtual or host-only
interfaces such as VirtualBox `192.168.56.*` addresses, so phones and other LAN devices see
the reachable URL first.

## Reverse Proxy and HTTPS

The recommended public shape publishes the frontend and keeps browser API requests
same-origin through the Next.js `/api` rewrite. Route `/ws` directly to backend port
`4000` when enabling WebSocket clients.

| Proxy                        | Setup                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Caddy                        | Copy [`deploy/Caddyfile.example`](./deploy/Caddyfile.example) and set your hostname. |
| Traefik / Coolify            | Apply [`deploy/compose.traefik.yml`](./deploy/compose.traefik.yml) as an overlay.    |
| Nginx Proxy Manager          | Proxy the hostname to `frontend:3000`; add a `/ws` advanced location to `backend:4000` with WebSocket upgrade headers. |
| Cloudflare Tunnel            | Tunnel the HTTPS hostname to the frontend; separately preserve `/ws` upgrades if realtime transport is enabled. |

For a public proxy host, restrict direct host exposure:

```dotenv
FRONTEND_BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
BACKEND_BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
FRONTEND_URL=https://cloud.example.com
CORS_ORIGINS=https://cloud.example.com
```

The PostgreSQL and Redis services are never bound to host ports in the production Compose
file; they remain on an internal data network.

## Persistence, Backups, and Updates

| Data                       | Location                                                | Backup rule                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| File blobs and thumbnails  | `${NEXXCLOUD_DATA_DIR:-./data}/storage` on the host      | Back up together with database metadata.        |
| PostgreSQL metadata        | Docker volume `${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}_postgres_data`    | Use `pg_dump` before updates and on a schedule. |
| Redis queue persistence    | Docker volume `${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}_redis_data`       | Useful for queued work; not file metadata.      |
| Temporary upload material  | Within the storage bind mount                           | May be cleaned after interrupted uploads.       |

On Linux-based hosts, `sh update.sh` creates a timestamped PostgreSQL dump under the
ignored `backups/` directory, pulls a fast-forward Git update, rebuilds, and allows only
committed migrations or the committed additive legacy baseline to run. The first upgrade
from an older schema-push installation is baselined automatically after that database
dump. Back up the storage tree separately before upgrades that affect binary handling.

To diagnose startup:

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=150 backend worker frontend
curl -fsS http://localhost:4000/health/ready
curl -fsS http://localhost:3000/health
```

For the desktop server, use the built-in **Live Logs** panel for backend, frontend, and
migration output. **Open Logs** still opens the persisted log directory inside the selected
NexxCloud data folder.

## Storage Engine

### Physical Layout

```text
STORAGE_ROOT/
|-- blobs/
|   `-- <first-two-sha256-characters>/
|       `-- <full-sha256-digest>
|-- tmp/
`-- <user-id>/
    |-- files/
    |-- thumbnails/
    |-- uploads/
    |   |-- incoming/
    |   `-- chunks/<session-id>/
    `-- versions/
```

Folders are metadata relationships, not nested physical directories. This permits move and
copy operations without moving binary data on disk.

### Blob Lifecycle

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  U["Temporary uploaded file"] --> H["Stream SHA-256 digest"]
  H --> E{"Blob already exists?"}
  E -->|"Yes"| R["Increment reference_count"]
  E -->|"No"| M["Move bytes to blobs/<prefix>/<hash>"]
  M --> C["Create StorageBlob record"]
  R --> F["Create or update File record with blob_id"]
  C --> F
  F --> A["Recalculate storage and trash totals in transaction"]
  D["Permanent deletion/version cleanup"] --> X["Release blob reference"]
  X --> Z{"References remain?"}
  Z -->|"Yes"| K["Keep physical blob"]
  Z -->|"No"| P["Delete record and physical binary after commit"]
```

`storageUsed` represents active file metadata bytes and `trashSize` represents trashed file
metadata bytes. Copying content can therefore increase logical user usage while preserving
one physical blob.

### Resumable Chunk Uploads

The browser sends files larger than 10 MiB through the chunk pipeline:

1. `POST /api/uploads/initiate` creates an upload session and expected chunk records.
2. Chunks are sent concurrently, up to three at a time in the current client, with
   optional SHA-256 verification for each part.
3. `POST /api/uploads/:sessionId/complete` queues a merge job.
4. The worker streams chunks into a temporary merged file while calculating the final hash.
5. Signature validation runs against the merged binary.
6. The merged file enters content-addressed storage and storage accounting is recalculated.
7. Chunk files are removed and preview generation can be queued.

## Security

| Control              | Current behavior                                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authentication       | Access JWTs and persisted rotating refresh tokens; protected REST requests use `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.           |
| Media access         | Preview and download elements use expiring signed media URLs issued by authenticated API requests.                        |
| Upload memory safety | Direct and chunk uploads are staged to disk by Multer with configurable size ceilings.                                    |
| Signature validation | Common media/document container signatures are checked against uploaded bytes.                                            |
| Dangerous content    | Executable and risky extensions/MIME types are blocked by default in the deployment configuration.                          |
| Filesystem safety    | Blob and user storage paths are resolved beneath the configured storage root before destructive work.                     |
| Deployment secrets   | Production startup rejects missing, weak, or placeholder signing and queue-dashboard secrets.                             |
| Database rollout     | Compose uses Prisma migrations; pre-migration installs receive a guarded additive baseline on Prisma `P3005`.           |

Important deployment guidance:

- NexxCloud accepts arbitrary file formats as stored content. Treat shared executable or
  active-document files with the same caution you would apply to downloaded attachments.
- Terminate HTTPS before exposing NexxCloud beyond a trusted local network.
- Protect `/admin/queues` with a strong unique password and restrict it at the proxy when possible.
- Back up PostgreSQL metadata and the entire `data/storage` tree together.

## Background Integrity Workers

| Queue                    | Responsibility                                                                    | Schedule or trigger               |

## API and Realtime

The REST surface covers authentication, files, folders, uploads, versions, sharing,
signed media, and LAN status. See [API.md](./API.md) for endpoints and request examples.

A WebSocket server and event transport are included at `/ws`. Compose deployments use
Redis for cross-process queue and event transport; the desktop server runtime uses
in-process equivalents. At present, the file and folder mutation services do not emit
through that event layer, so consumers should treat live mutation synchronization as
integration work still to be completed.

## Testing and Quality

```bash
cd backend
npm run test
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build

cd ../frontend
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

The current Vitest suite covers binary signature validation and dangerous-type detection.
Storage, blob-reference, chunk-session, and HTTP integration suites are high-priority
additions for contributors.

## Contributing

Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md), then use
[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) to understand invariants before changing storage or
upload behavior. Any change involving blob references, trash state, chunk sessions, or
media authorization should arrive with tests that exercise failure and cleanup paths.
