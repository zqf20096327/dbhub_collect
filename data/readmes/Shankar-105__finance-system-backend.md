## 🔥 Start Here: App Workflow

If you want to understand how this backend actually behaves from login to role-based usage, read:

**[docs/BASIC_FLOW.md](docs/BASIC_FLOW.md)**

It explains the real journey for `viewer`, `analyst`, and `admin`, including auth lifecycle, record lifecycle, dashboard usage order, and websocket presence flow.

## 🌟 What You Get

- Secure JWT auth with refresh rotation and revocation.
- RBAC with controlled role governance (viewer, analyst, admin).
- Dashboard APIs for summary, category distribution, trends, and recent activity.
- Recycle-bin workflow for deleted records with restore + retention policy.
- CSV import/export for bulk onboarding and reporting workflows.
- Search across records by category and notes.
- Redis-backed cache and rate limiting.
- Fully async architecture from routes to data layer.

## 📝 Project Context

This repository was developed as part of an internship assessment focused on secure backend engineering, role-based access control, and practical financial data workflows.

## ⚖️ Technology Choice

I thought to build this in Spring Boot because it is widely used in enterprise financial systems. But for this assessment, development speed mattered most, and I am currently much stronger with FastAPI and async Python. So I chose FastAPI to deliver a cleaner and more complete implementation within the timeline, while still following production-style backend practices.

## 🙏 Acknowledgement

Building it end-to-end gave me practical experience with RBAC. While I have previously explored caching, rate-limiting, and other system design concepts in my past projects, I had never worked on an RBAC project before, and this gave me great experience truly thankful.
