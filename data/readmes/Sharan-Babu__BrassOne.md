Easily build automations for HTML snippets that popup with helpful information when you visit websites. Enhances your browsing experiences.

We have built an autonomous web assistant that knows your web reading preferences and generates HTML snippets accordingly. To use it you can simply open the extension when you want to create a new kind of automation. These automations could be things like:

- When I visit a news article, give me a summary
- Estimate reading time for articles and display it
- When I visit a careers page, highlight jobs related to computer science
- When I visit a Hackathon page, list the top prizes

Once automations like these have been submitted, whenever you visit a website, the AI assistant (chrome extension) will search (vector search) for automations that may apply and accordingly display helpful HTML snippets in the extension. The extension will automatically open when needed! This way, you can setup automations to gain massive productivity boosts!

## Local Installation Steps
The extension can also be used locally by following these steps: 
1. Download this repository and remember the location of the 'Extension' folder
2. Visit chrome://extensions/
3. Switch on developer mode at top right
4. Click 'load unpacked'
5. Select the 'Extension' folder. That's it! Your extension is now ready to use.

   TiDB Vector Search (beta) provides an advanced search solution for performing semantic similarity searches across various data types, including documents, images, audio, and video. This feature enables            developers to easily build scalable applications with generative artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities using familiar MySQL skills.

   Note
   TiDB Vector Search is currently in beta and only available for TiDB Serverless clusters.

   Note
   Currently Vector data types cannot store double-precision floating numbers. This will be supported in future release.

   TiDB Cloud Data Service (beta) is a fully managed low-code backend-as-a-service solution that simplifies backend application development, empowering developers to rapidly build highly scalable, secure, data-      driven applications. You'll need to set up a server-side component to handle this, as Chrome extensions can't directly connect to databases. Data Service enables you to access TiDB Cloud data via an HTTPS         request using a custom API endpoint.
