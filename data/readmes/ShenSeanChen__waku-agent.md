# waku-agent

**Your own AI assistant. On your laptop. In code you can read in an afternoon.**

Meet **Waku** — a local-first personal assistant that shows the four pillars behind every
serious agent: **Harness · Loop · Memory · Eval/LLM-Ops**. No frameworks hiding the good parts.
Built by [seanchen.io](https://seanchen.io).

- **Local-first.** Your memory is one SQLite file. Open it. Read it. It's yours.
- **Memory is the hero.** Semantic + episodic + procedural — with a gate that decides *whether*
  to remember, and a pass that decides *what* to keep.
- **The loop is ~95 lines** of plain Python. Step through it.
- **Watch it think.** A local dashboard lights up every message as it flows through the harness.
- **Eval built in.** Deterministic tests *and* LLM-as-judge, side by side, with a release gate.

## Quickstart

Just want to run it:

```bash
pip install waku-agent
waku                                    # talk to your Waku in the terminal
waku dashboard                          # …or the browser cockpit → localhost:7777
```

It will tell you which key to set the first time. Want to **read the code** (the
point of this repo) or contribute — clone it instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShenSeanChen/waku-agent && cd waku-agent
uv venv && uv pip install -e .          # create the env + install the `waku` command
cp .env.example .env                    # pick a provider, paste ONE key
uv run waku                             # talk to your Waku in the terminal
uv run waku dashboard                   # …or the browser cockpit → localhost:7777
```

**Now try it.** *"Remember that Alex prefers morning meetings."* Quit. Restart.
*"Book a catch-up with Alex on Friday."* → it remembers, and books 9am. Your memory is one
file: `.waku/state.db`.

**Use the model you already pay for.** Anthropic (default), OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, MiniMax,
Kimi, GLM, OpenRouter (one key, hundreds of hosted models), OpenCode Zen, or OpenCode Go —
set `WAKU_PROVIDER=`, paste the key, done. One dialect in the loop;
a [~60-line adapter](waku/loop/models.py) handles the rest.

New to it? **[Getting started](docs/getting-started.md)** walks the whole setup, with a check
at the end of every step.

## Connect Waku Memory

Waku's own memory is local. **[Waku Memory](https://www.waku.one)** is the hosted memory you
share across agents: save something in Claude Code, recall it here.

```bash
pip install 'waku-agent[mcp]'           # in a checkout: uv pip install -e '.[mcp]'
waku connect waku-memory                # or /connect waku-memory in the dashboard chat
waku skill export --to claude,codex     # carry Waku's skills to Claude Code and Codex too
```

Your browser opens once to sign in. To connect Claude Code, Codex, Hermes or Grok Bot to the
same memory, see [integrations](docs/integrations.md#share-one-memory-with-your-other-agents-waku-memory).

## What's inside

| Pillar | In one line | Read more |
|---|---|---|
| **Harness** | gateways (terminal, dashboard, voice, Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp) and tools around one loop | [architecture](docs/architecture.md) |
| **Loop** | ~95 lines of plain Python: reason, act, repeat, with two ways to stop | [the tour](docs/tour.md#the-loop) |
| **Memory** | semantic, episodic and procedural (skills); a gate decides *whether* to remember, consolidation decides *what* to keep | [the tour](docs/tour.md#the-retrieval-gate) |
| **Eval / LLM-Ops** | deterministic tests and LLM-as-judge side by side, a release gate, a trace for every turn | [evals](docs/evals.md) |

**How is this different from ChatGPT or Claude Desktop?** Those are products you *use*. This is a
codebase you *own*: the loop, the memory schema, the gate and the eval harness are all yours to
read and change. Versus the big open-source assistants (OpenClaw, Hermes)? Same architecture,
1/100th the code.

## Community

Star the repo, join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/ebbdvSCXqu), and grab a
[good first issue](https://github.com/ShenSeanChen/waku-agent/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
— that link is the live list, so it's always current. Gateways, memory backends and
community skills are all shaped to be first PRs; the easiest needs no Python at all
(see [contributing a skill](CONTRIBUTING.md)).

**Comment on an issue before you start** and it gets assigned to you, so two people
never build the same thing.
