# AI17Z

A local-first platform for building and running autonomous agents.

An agent in AI17Z is an identity, a memory, a model, a policy, and the channels it
is allowed to act on. None of that is code: you create an agent, give it a voice,
point it at a model, connect an account, and turn it on. The runtime underneath
is deliberately boring — Postgres, a job table, typed contracts — so that the
interesting part is the agent, not the plumbing.

---

## What it does

- **Durable pipeline.** Every inbound event becomes an immutable record and a
  job. Jobs survive restarts and resume from the last completed step.
- **Answerable behaviour.** Every generation stores its prompt layers, the
  memories it retrieved and *why*, every model attempt, and the verification
  that preceded the action.
- **Idempotent execution.** The same event cannot produce two remote actions.
  Not by convention — by unique index.
- **Memory that spans conversations.** Six scopes, with an explicit write policy
  and deterministic retrieval you can inspect.
- **Replaceable models.** OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Ollama, any
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint, and a deterministic mock, behind one gateway with
  a fallback chain.
- **A safe default.** Dry run runs the whole pipeline, verifies the target, and
  stops before touching anything real.

---

## What you need

**The installer for your platform checks for all of this and handles what is
missing.** This is what it looks for, so you can install it yourself first if
you would rather.

| | Why | Who provides it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Docker** | Postgres, the API and the interface run in containers | Docker Desktop on Windows and macOS; Docker Engine on Ubuntu |
| **WSL 2** | what Docker Desktop runs on. **Windows only** — macOS and Ubuntu have no use for it | Microsoft, via `wsl --install` |
| **Node 22** | the worker that drives a real browser runs on your machine, not in a container | **bundled** on macOS and Ubuntu; from winget on Windows |
| **Google Chrome** | only for browser-backed channels such as X. Everything else works without it | Google |

**macOS and Ubuntu need no Node of their own.** Those packages carry the exact
Node they were built against, verified against nodejs.org's published checksums,
and never consult your `PATH`. Installing, removing or switching a system Node
cannot change how AI17Z behaves.

**No platform needs Git** for a normal install. The application arrives as a
release package that is downloaded and hash-checked, not cloned.

Chrome means Google Chrome. Not Chromium, not Edge. AI17Z spawns it and attaches
over the debugging protocol, and refuses to substitute another browser rather
than pretend one is the other.

About 6 GB of disk once the images are built, most of it the worker image, which
carries a browser. The first build takes a few minutes; after that, seconds.

You do **not** need: an OpenAI account, an X account, a server, a domain, or a
paid anything. A local model through Ollama costs nothing and the mock provider
costs less.

---

## Install

AI17Z installs on Windows, macOS and Ubuntu. Pick yours.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Windows** | one command in Windows Terminal — [below](#windows) |
| **macOS 13+** | download a short installer, read it, run it — [below](#macos) |
| **Ubuntu 22.04+** | download a short installer, read it, run it — [below](#ubuntu) |
| From source | any of the three, plus Git and Node — [Other ways to install](#other-ways-to-install) |

None of them needs Git. None needs a system Node: the macOS and Ubuntu packages
carry their own, verified against nodejs.org at build time.

All three need **Docker** for the database, and all three treat it as software
you own rather than software AI17Z manages. **Google Chrome** is optional
everywhere and enables browser-backed channels.

<a id="windows"></a>
## Windows

Open **Windows Terminal** and paste this:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShiftAboveCtrl/ai17z/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

That is the whole installation. It checks what this PC has, installs anything
missing, installs AI17Z, starts it, checks it actually works, and opens it.

**Install AI17Z only with the command published here.** Nowhere else distributes
it.

### Why a command and not a download

AI17Z is not a signed application. Code signing for open-source projects is
granted on the strength of an existing user base, and AI17Z does not have one
yet — we applied, and were turned down for exactly that reason. So an AI17Z
`.exe` would be an unsigned executable Windows has never seen, and Windows would
say so, loudly, and be right to.

The answer is not to talk you past that warning. It is to not ask for it:
**nothing above is an executable, nothing is double-clicked, and no Windows
security setting is touched, turned off, or argued with** — not SmartScreen, not
Defender, not your execution policy. Windows' default policy permits individual
commands and not script files; the command above is individual commands, and so
is the way the installer it fetches is run.

### What actually runs

[`install.ps1`](install.ps1) is short, public, and the file at the URL you just
pasted — read it first if you like, that is what it is there for. All it does is
work out the newest release, download the setup program from it, **check its
SHA-256 against the hash that release published**, write it somewhere you can
read it, and run the bytes it checked. A mismatch stops everything.

The setup program is [`packaging/windows/Setup-AI17Z.ps1`](packaging/windows/Setup-AI17Z.ps1)
— the whole installer, as a script, published with every release.

To see what it would do to this PC without doing any of it:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShiftAboveCtrl/ai17z/main/install.ps1))) -WhatIfOnly
```

**[How to audit it](docs/SETUP_AUDIT.md)** — every privileged action, every
download, everything it writes, and how to check it yourself. Read that before
you run it. It is the point of the thing being a script.

### More than one AI17Z

A machine can hold several independent installations — different agents,
different databases, different signed-in accounts. They share nothing, and
**updating one leaves the others exactly as they are.**

```powershell
$s = irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShiftAboveCtrl/ai17z/main/install.ps1
& ([scriptblock]::Create($s)) -List                 # what is installed
& ([scriptblock]::Create($s)) -NewInstance          # install another
& ([scriptblock]::Create($s)) -Instance AI17Z-test  # update that one
```

Run the plain command on a machine that already has AI17Z and it asks which you
meant rather than guessing.

Also: [Installing on Windows](docs/WINDOWS_INSTALL.md) ·
[Uninstalling](docs/WINDOWS_UNINSTALL.md)

### Code signing

AI17Z is **not signed**, and is not about to be: free certificates for
open-source projects are granted on the strength of an existing user base, we
applied, and we were turned down for not having one yet. Saying "signing is
coming" would be a nicer sentence and not a true one.

That is why the ordinary way in is a command rather than a download. **We will
never ask you to disable SmartScreen, Smart App Control or your antivirus, or to
click past a warning.** See [Windows trust and SmartScreen](docs/WINDOWS_TRUST.md)
for what those warnings actually mean, and
[docs/CODE_SIGNING_POLICY.md](docs/CODE_SIGNING_POLICY.md) for where this stands.

The one file on the releases page that is still an executable — the older full
installer, kept for installations made with it — is unsigned and labelled as
such. You do not need it.

<a id="macos"></a>
## macOS

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShiftAboveCtrl/ai17z/main/install-ai17z-macos.sh
less install-ai17z-macos.sh
bash install-ai17z-macos.sh
```

Reading it first is the documented route, not a fallback: macOS warns about long
commands pasted from web pages, and it is right to. The file is short so that
looking at it is reasonable.

It resolves the newest release, downloads the package for your architecture —
Apple Silicon or Intel, built natively, never relabelled — **checks its SHA-256
against the hash that release published**, and extracts it into your own Library.

**No `sudo`, ever, for AI17Z itself.** Everything lives in
`~/Library/Application Support/AI17Z/`, which is also why updates need no
authorization.

**AI17Z's macOS packages are not signed with an Apple Developer ID and are not
notarized**, and AI17Z does not disable Gatekeeper or strip quarantine
attributes to get around that. [What that actually means](docs/MACOS_TRUST.md)
is written out in full, including which prompts are Docker's or Google's rather
than AI17Z's.

**Every macOS package is built and run on a real Mac before it can be
released** -- Apple Silicon and Intel, on every push, including the installer.
What a hosted machine cannot represent is a person at one: Gatekeeper's dialogs,
a downloaded file's quarantine, and Docker Desktop's own setup. Those are listed
in [what still needs a Mac](docs/MACOS_TEST_CHECKLIST.md).

<a id="ubuntu"></a>
## Ubuntu

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShiftAboveCtrl/ai17z/main/install-ai17z-ubuntu.sh
less install-ai17z-ubuntu.sh
bash install-ai17z-ubuntu.sh
```

Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04 and 26.04 LTS, on amd64 and arm64. It downloads the `.deb`
for your architecture, checks its SHA-256, and installs it with `apt`.

Run it as yourself. It asks for `sudo` exactly where installing a system package
needs it, and refuses to run as root — your agents, keys and browser session
belong to you, and a root install makes files in your home you cannot then
delete.

**Ubuntu Server works and is a supported arrangement.** Everything runs except
browser-backed channels, which need a graphical session and Chrome; `ai17z
doctor` reports that as *not available* rather than as a failure, and nothing
installs a desktop to pretend otherwise. AI17Z binds to loopback and the docs
recommend an SSH tunnel rather than exposing it.

The package, the installer and the lifecycle are built and run on real Ubuntu
machines -- amd64 and arm64 -- and the package is installed and exercised on
22.04, 24.04 and 26.04, on every push. Chrome needs a graphical session and is
not among them; [what still needs a real machine](docs/UBUNTU_TEST_CHECKLIST.md)
says what else.

### Privacy

AI17Z collects nothing and has no servers. It talks only to the services you
configure, with the credentials you supply. See [docs/PRIVACY.md](docs/PRIVACY.md).

---

## Other ways to install

Three, and none of them is the one above. Use these if you are working on AI17Z,
running it somewhere other than Windows, or would rather not run an installer at
all.

**The full Windows installer**, `AI17Z-Setup-<version>.exe`, is also on the
releases page. It carries the application inside it rather than downloading it,
and it is what installations made before AI17Z Setup existed update with. It does
not install Docker, Node or Chrome for you beyond offering to; the wizard is a
wizard. Both kinds of installation end up with the same program directory, the
same data directory and the same updates.

### From source, on Windows

> **Not inside OneDrive, Dropbox or Google Drive.** npm links every package into
> `node_modules` with a symlink, and a syncing folder refuses those while it is
> reconciling, so the install dies several minutes in with `EBUSY: resource busy
> or locked, symlink`. On Windows your Desktop is inside OneDrive by default,
> which makes this the most likely way a first install fails. `C:\dev\ai17z` or
> `%USERPROFILE%\ai17z` are both fine. The installer checks and stops rather than
> letting you find out the slow way.

One line, in PowerShell, in a folder you can write to:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShiftAboveCtrl/ai17z/main/bootstrap.ps1 | iex
```

That clones the repository into `.\ai17z`, checks the machine, and starts it.

Piping a script from the internet into a shell asks you to trust whatever the
server sends, and you are allowed to want to look first:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShiftAboveCtrl/ai17z/main/bootstrap.ps1 -OutFile bootstrap.ps1
notepad bootstrap.ps1
.\bootstrap.ps1
```

Or do it by hand, which is the same three steps the bootstrap runs:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/ShiftAboveCtrl/ai17z.git ai17z
cd ai17z
.\install-ai17z.ps1 -Start
```

### Ubuntu

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShiftAboveCtrl/ai17z/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

or by hand:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShiftAboveCtrl/ai17z.git ai17z
cd ai17z
./install-ai17z.sh --start
```

Connecting an X account opens a real Chrome window for you to sign in to, so
that part needs a desktop session. The rest runs anywhere Docker does. See
**Support** below for what has and has not actually been verified.

### No git?

Download the zip from the repository's **Code â†’ Download ZIP**, extract it, and
run the installer from inside the folder. Nothing in AI17Z needs git after the
files are on disk:

```powershell
cd ai17z-main
.\install-ai17z.ps1 -Start
```

The bootstrap scripts do this for you if git is missing.

### Then

Open **http://localhost:8080**. The first screen asks you to create an account.
That account is yours, it lives on this machine, and there is no sign-up.

`install-ai17z.ps1` installs nothing behind your back: it checks what is there,
says where to get whatever is missing, runs `npm install`, and writes a `.env`
with a master key generated for your installation. It never overwrites an
existing `.env`, because that file holds the key your stored provider
credentials are encrypted with.

## Opening it

```powershell
.\launch-ai17z.ps1
```

```bash
./launch-ai17z.sh
```

Starts everything and opens the app. The Windows installer adds this to the
Start Menu, so there is something to click; `-NoShortcut` skips that. It reads
the port from your own `.env`, so a machine running two installations opens the
right one.

## If something is wrong

```powershell
.\doctor-ai17z.ps1
```

```bash
./doctor-ai17z.sh
```

It reports every part separately and tells three things apart that otherwise
look the same: working, not set up yet, and broken. A fresh installation with no
model provider and no X account is not broken, and it says so, with the step
that fixes each one.

## Stopping

```powershell
.\stop-ai17z.ps1
```

```bash
./stop-ai17z.sh
```

Data survives. `-Volumes` / `--volumes` deletes the database, every stored
provider key and every browser session, and asks for the word DELETE first.

## Restarting

```powershell
.\restart-ai17z.ps1
```

```bash
./restart-ai17z.sh
```

Your signed-in Chrome survives a restart: AI17Z spawns the browser rather than
letting the automation library launch it, so stopping AI17Z does not close a
window you are signed in to, and starting again reattaches to the tabs already
open instead of opening more. `-KeepStack` / `--keep-stack` restarts only the
worker and leaves the containers alone, which is faster and enough for anything
that is not a container change.

## Updating

AI17Z tells you when there is a new version on the **Version** panel in
Settings, with the release notes, and never updates itself. How you take one
depends on how it was installed, and the panel says which of these applies to
your copy.

**Installed with AI17Z Setup:** *Update AI17Z* in the Start Menu, or

```powershell
.\update-ai17z.ps1
```

which is the same thing. It hands over to the setup script that installed this
copy: stop, download the new release, check it against its published SHA-256,
replace the program, migrate, start, verify. If the hash does not match, nothing
is replaced.

**Installed with the full Windows installer:** download the new
`AI17Z-Setup-<version>.exe` and run it over your existing copy.

**A checkout:**

```powershell
.\update-ai17z.ps1 -Check
.\update-ai17z.ps1
```

```bash
./update-ai17z.sh --check
./update-ai17z.sh
```

`-Check` / `--check` says what an update would bring and changes nothing: the
commits, and any database migrations, which are the part that cannot be undone.
It refuses to run over uncommitted changes rather than discarding them, and works
out whether the update can be applied *before* stopping anything, so a checkout
it cannot update is left running rather than left down.

**However it was installed, your data and your `.env` are never touched.** The
program directory is replaced; the data directory — agents, memories, provider
keys, browser session, master key — is not.

**And an update updates one installation: the one it was started from.** The
Start Menu entry belongs to that installation and the Version panel names the
copy it is offering to update. Neither goes looking for another AI17Z on the
machine, and asking one to update a different one is refused rather than
redirected.

---

## Quick start with Docker

> You do not need this section if you used the install command above. It is here
> for people who would rather drive Docker themselves.

```bash
npm run setup          # writes .env with a master key, if there is not one
docker compose up -d
```

A containerised worker has no browser and no display, so it takes jobs and
leaves browser-backed accounts alone. Run a native worker alongside it for
those — the Windows script above does this for you, and
A containerised worker cannot drive a browser on the host: run the worker on
the machine that has the browser.

Then open **http://localhost:8080** and create your owner account.

| Service  | URL                   |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| Web      | http://localhost:8080 |
| API      | http://localhost:8787 |
| Postgres | localhost:55432       |

The API applies migrations on start, so a fresh stack comes up ready to use.

> The worker image is built on the Playwright base image and is large. If you do
> not need a browser channel, set `AI17Z_BROWSER_ENABLED=0` and the worker will
> decline browser work cleanly rather than failing mid-job.

---

## Quick start without Docker

You need Node 22 or newer and a Postgres you can reach.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev                   # api + worker + web
```

`dev`, `migrate` and `db:up` each make sure `.env` exists with a master key
before they run, so there is nothing to generate or paste. Point `DATABASE_URL`
at your own Postgres if you would rather not use the container.

Open **http://localhost:5173**.

---

## First run

1. **Create your owner account.** Local, one person, stored as a scrypt hash.
2. **Add a model provider.** Settings â†’ Add provider. Ollama needs no key.
   Everything else takes an API key, encrypted at rest with your master key and
   never returned by the API afterwards.
3. **Create an agent.** Eight short steps. Keep the mock channel.
4. **Inject a test event.** On the agent page, Activity â†’ *Inject a test event*.
   The whole pipeline runs locally: context, memory, prompt, model, validation,
   target verification. Only the final action is simulated.
5. **Open the job.** Every decision it made is on one page.

Nothing here requires X, or any external account at all.

---

## Easy Mode and Advanced Mode

Easy Mode is eight questions and is the default. It is not a cut-down second
system: it writes the same versioned persona, policy, cadence and radar
configuration the Advanced screens edit, and reads them back. Change something
in Advanced and Easy shows it; change it in Easy and Advanced shows it.

Advanced keeps everything -- prompt layers, pipeline nodes, memory scopes, model
roles and fallbacks, the stance ledger, cadence, capabilities, browser
diagnostics. Nothing was removed to make Easy Mode simple.

The switch is in the header, and it is one setting for the whole application.

---

## Where your data lives

Everything AI17Z stores is on your machine:

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Database (agents, events, jobs, memories, relationships) | Docker volume |
| Provider API keys | The same database, encrypted with your master key |
| X browser profiles and sessions | `storage/browser-profiles/` |
| Failure screenshots | `storage/diagnostics/` |
| The master key itself | `.env`, and nowhere else |

**Back up `.env`.** Losing the master key makes every stored provider credential
unreadable, and there is no recovery.

### What leaves your machine

The runtime is local. The model is not, unless you choose a local one.

- **Ollama** runs on your machine. Nothing leaves it.
- **OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, DeepSeek** and any other remote provider
  receive the context AI17Z sends them: the incoming post, the conversation
  around it, the retrieved memories and the persona. That is how they answer.

If that matters to you, use Ollama.

---

## Support

Honest about what has actually been verified:

| Platform | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Windows 11 + Docker Desktop + Google Chrome | Verified end to end, including real X |
| Ubuntu Desktop | Scripts written and syntax-checked; **not verified on Ubuntu** |
| Ubuntu Server (headless) | Not a supported flow. Signing in to X needs a real browser window |

Ubuntu is not claimed as tested. The install, start, stop and doctor scripts
exist and their logic runs, but nobody has yet taken a clean Ubuntu machine
through the whole flow. If you do, the doctor tells you what it finds.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Docker is installed but not running."** Start Docker Desktop and wait for it
to settle, then run the start script again.

**Ports already in use.** Something else has 8080, 8787 or 55432. Set
`AI17Z_WEB_PORT`, `AI17Z_API_PORT` or `POSTGRES_PORT` in `.env`.

**"Google Chrome not found."** Install it from google.com/chrome. Chromium and
Edge are different browsers and are not used as substitutes.

**An X account will not connect.** Connecting opens a real Chrome window and
waits for you to sign in by hand. If X asks for a code, a CAPTCHA or confirms an
unusual login, AI17Z stops and leaves the window alone -- it never answers a
security challenge, and there is no setting for that. Finish it yourself and it
carries on.

You can optionally store a username and password on the account so AI17Z can
fill the form itself after a session lapses. It is off unless you fill it in,
what you store is sealed under your master key, and it changes nothing about the
paragraph above: a challenge still stops everything and waits for you, which for
an account with two-factor authentication on is every fresh sign-in.

**The agent is running but never replies.** Open the agent's Activity. Every
decision is recorded, including the decision not to answer and the reasons
behind it. "Not worth answering: nothing to do with what this agent follows" is
the system working.

**Something is wrong and you cannot tell what.** Run the doctor.

---

**`EBUSY: resource busy or locked, symlink` during install.** The folder is
inside OneDrive, Dropbox or another syncing folder. Move the project somewhere
that is not synced and install again. Nothing is wrong with npm or the machine:
the sync driver holds the directory while it reconciles a freshly created tree,
and npm workspaces need real symlinks. It is intermittent, which makes it worse
rather than better, since one install can succeed and the next fail on a
different package.

## Running a second installation

This is about a second *clone*. For a second installed copy, the install command
does it in one flag — see [More than one AI17Z](#more-than-one-ai17z) above.

Every installation names itself after the folder it was installed into, and that
name decides which Docker volumes it uses. A clone into `ai17z-test` is
`ai17z-test`: its own database, its own browser profiles, its own containers.
Nothing is shared with any other checkout on the machine.

That name is written into `.env` once, when the installer creates it, and never
touched again -- so updating in place with `git pull` keeps the data it already
had.

Two of them can run side by side if you give the second one its own ports:

```
AI17Z_API_PORT=8797
AI17Z_WEB_PORT=8090
POSTGRES_PORT=55450
DATABASE_URL=postgres://xbam:xbam@localhost:55450/xbam
```

`DATABASE_URL` carries its own port and is what migrations and the native worker
dial, so it has to move with `POSTGRES_PORT`. The start script refuses if the two
disagree rather than letting one installation migrate another's database.
