Entropy is a relational database engine written from scratch in C++20. It
implements slotted-page storage, a latch-crabbing B+ tree, MVCC snapshot
isolation, ACID transactions, write-ahead logging with ARIES-style crash
recovery, and a cost-based query optimizer. A deterministic, FoundationDB-style
crash simulator exercises the whole stack.

## Highlights

- SQL engine: parser, binder, cost-based optimizer, executors.
- Storage: slotted-page heap, latch-crabbing B+ tree, buffer pool.
- ACID transactions: MVCC snapshot isolation, WAL, ARIES recovery.
- CRC-32 checksums catch torn writes and bit rot, on by default.
- Deterministic crash simulator: seeded faults, invariant checks.
- Optional terminal UI (boot, dashboard, console) in light and dark themes.
- Unit and integration tests on CTest + GoogleTest.
- Benchmarks vs SQLite with reproducible scripts.
- CI across Linux/macOS/Windows, ASan/UBSan/TSan, `find_package` smoke.

</p>

## Architecture Details

Each layer of the pipeline is its own C++ library, from the SQL parser down to
the storage engine.

### SQL Frontend

- Recursive-descent parser: SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, CREATE/DROP, EXPLAIN.
- Binder resolves names and types, rejecting type errors at bind time.

### Planning and Optimization

- Statistics track row counts and simple selectivity estimates.
- Cost model compares index scans and sequential scans for predicates.
- Index selector picks point-lookup or range-scan paths when an index exists.
- Join method chosen by cost: hash for equi-joins, nested loop otherwise.

### Execution

- Scan and join operators: seq scan, index scan, hash and nested-loop join.
- Sort, aggregate, filter, and limit operators.
- Projection and DML executors apply insert, update, and delete.

### Transactions and Recovery

- MVCC version store: snapshot isolation, first-updater-wins conflicts.
- Lock manager with wait-for-graph deadlock detection, wait-die victims.
- Rollback undoes writes through compensation log records.
- Write-ahead log fsync'd on commit, replayed on recovery.
- ARIES-style recovery in analysis, redo, and undo phases from a checkpoint.
- Redo is page-LSN-gated and idempotent, so recovery is safe to re-run.

### Storage and Buffering

- Slotted pages back a table heap for variable length tuples.
- B+ tree and extendible hash indexes support range and point access.
- Buffer pool uses an LRU replacer with pin and dirty tracking.
- Disk manager handles page and WAL IO.
- CRC-32 verified on every page read, catching torn writes and bit rot.

## Crash Simulation

Entropy ships with a deterministic, FoundationDB-style crash simulator that
drives the engine through fault-injected storage and replays failures from a
seed. One 64-bit seed drives independent PRNG streams for the workload, the page
device, and the log store, so a failing schedule replays byte for byte.

</p>

- `SimDiskManager` and `SimLogStore` replace the file backend.
- A crash keeps fsync'd writes and drops or tears the unsynced ones.
- Transient write errors are injectable at the same seam.
- Named schedules place the crash between WAL and page flush, replayable.
- After a crash, recovery runs and an oracle checks its result.
- Every committed row must survive, no uncommitted write visible.

Run a sweep of seeds:

```bash
entropy-sim --seeds 100 --schedule mixed
entropy-sim --list          # list available schedules
```

Each run appends one JSONL line (faults fired, redo/undo work, invariant
results) so a whole sweep is machine-checkable. The suite runs in CI.

## Performance Snapshot (vs SQLite)

Run file: `docs/benchmarks/runs/bench-20251226-214051.json`

- Machine: Apple M2 (arm64), macOS 15.5
- Compiler: Apple clang 17.0.0 (clang-1700.0.13.5)
- Build: Release (`-O3`)

SQLite baselines are collected when `ENTROPY_BENCH_COMPARE_SQLITE=ON`.

Per-iteration ns/op (ratio = Entropy / SQLite, lower is better):

| Case | Rows | Entropy (ns/op) | SQLite (ns/op) | Ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Insert batch (txn) | 1k | `940,970` | `1,048,274` | `0.90x` |
| Insert batch (txn) | 10k | `9,693,951` | `6,992,261` | `1.39x` |
| Point select | 1k | `46,041` | `23,020` | `2.00x` |
| Point select | 10k | `459,723` | `179,783` | `2.56x` |

Rows are the batch size for inserts and the table cardinality for point selects.

  </picture>
</p>

Chart units are microseconds per op. The insert and point select panels use different y axis ranges.

Full results: `docs/benchmarks/bench_summary.csv`

## Benchmarks

```bash
./scripts/bench/run.sh
```

Windows:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/bench/run.ps1
```

The script writes a timestamped JSON run file in `docs/benchmarks/runs/` and
updates `docs/benchmarks/bench_summary.csv`.

SQLite comparison is ON by default for the script. If SQLite3 headers are
missing, the script fails with an explicit error. To run without SQLite,
set `ENTROPY_BENCH_COMPARE_SQLITE=OFF`. Manual steps and methodology are in
`docs/benchmarks.md`.

## Quick Start

```cpp
#include <entropy/entropy.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    entropy::Database db("mydb.entropy");
    db.execute("CREATE TABLE users (id INT, name VARCHAR(100))");
    db.execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Alice')");

    auto result = db.execute("SELECT * FROM users");
    for (const auto &row : result) {
        std::cout << row["name"].as_string() << "\n";
    }
}
```

## Build and Test

### Prerequisites

- C++20 compiler (GCC 10+, Clang 12+, MSVC 19.29+)
- CMake 3.20+
- Git

### Configure + Build

Dependencies (spdlog, GoogleTest, Google Benchmark) are fetched with CMake
FetchContent on first configure (requires network access). Optional
comparisons use system SQLite3.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release
```

### Run Tests

```bash
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -C Release
```

### CMake Presets

```bash
cmake --preset dev
cmake --build --preset dev
ctest --preset dev
```

## Build Options

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| `ENTROPY_BUILD_TESTS` | &#10003; | Build unit + integration tests |
| `ENTROPY_BUILD_BENCHMARKS` | &#10007; | Build benchmarks |
| `ENTROPY_BENCH_COMPARE_SQLITE` | &#10007; | Build SQLite comparison benchmarks |
| `ENTROPY_BUILD_EXAMPLES` | &#10003; | Build example programs |
| `ENTROPY_ENABLE_ASAN` | &#10007; | Build with AddressSanitizer |
| `ENTROPY_ENABLE_TSAN` | &#10007; | Build with ThreadSanitizer |

## CI/CD and Releases

- CI builds and tests on Linux/macOS/Windows via GitHub Actions.
- ASan, UBSan, and TSan jobs run the full suite on Linux.
- A downstream job installs the package and consumes it with `find_package`.
- It links `entropy::entropy`, proving the exported config is usable.
- Releases are created automatically on `v*` tags with OS-specific binaries.

## Roadmap

Open work is tracked in GitHub Issues. Known limits for readers of this tree:
experimental single-node scope, a simple cost model with no runtime ANALYZE,
and point selects slower than SQLite on the M2 snapshot above.
