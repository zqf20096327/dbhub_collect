Polylogue is a local flight recorder for AI work: a cross-provider system of
record where sessions, tool receipts, lineage, usage, and costs remain tied to
their source evidence. It imports supported histories from ChatGPT, Claude and
Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Hermes, and other sources, then makes that archive
available through a CLI, Python API, local HTTP reader, and MCP server.

By default, the archive stays on your machine.

[Getting started](docs/getting-started.md) | [Live documentation](https://sinity.github.io/polylogue/) | [Demo](docs/demos.md) | [Published finding](https://sinity.github.io/polylogue/findings/claim-vs-evidence/) | [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) | [CLI reference](docs/cli-reference.md)

## Try it without importing personal data

Run the tour in a throwaway archive:

```bash
uvx polylogue demo tour
```

The command is complete when the terminal prints `Polylogue demo tour:
passed`. It writes a report, transcript, command outputs, and recording source
under `polylogue-demo-tour/`.

The tour imports sample files for the supported providers, queries structured
tool results, and reconstructs a parent session with its child branch while
preserving source references. It does not require a provider account or access
to the author's archive.

From a source checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sinity/polylogue.git
cd polylogue
uv run polylogue demo tour
```

## Search, analyze, audit, remember

- Search conversations and coding sessions across supported sources.
- Analyze tool calls, branches, usage, and costs from structured evidence.
- Audit provider-reported outcomes without inferring success or failure from
  prose.
- Remember work through source references, lineage, notes, tags, and MCP access
  for agents.

See the [published structured-failure finding](https://sinity.github.io/polylogue/findings/claim-vs-evidence/) for a concrete example of a claim whose evidence and limitations remain visible.

## Install

```bash
# Python package: CLI, daemon, and MCP server
pipx install polylogue
# or
uv tool install polylogue

# Homebrew CLI
brew tap sinity/polylogue
brew install polylogue

# Nix, without installing
nix run github:Sinity/polylogue -- --help
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
polylogue --version
polylogue --help
```

## Build a local archive

Detect supported sources already present on the machine:

```bash
polylogue init
```

Start continuous ingestion of configured live sources:

```bash
polylogued run
```

Import a one-off export or file:

```bash
polylogue import ~/Downloads/chatgpt-export.zip
polylogue import some-file.json --explain
```

Run queries:

```bash
polylogue "css refactor"
polylogue --origin claude-code-session find "migration" then read --view messages
polylogue "actions where tool:shell AND command:pytest | group by is_error | count"
```

`polylogue init` writes a starter `polylogue.toml` from detected sources.
`polylogued run` imports those sources and continues watching the live ones.

## Example: query tool outcomes

Tool execution is stored as structured data when the source provides it. Missing
outcome fields remain unknown rather than being guessed from assistant text.

```console
$ polylogue "actions where tool:Bash AND command:pytest | group by is_error | count"
is_error=0 count=12861
is_error=1 count=1039
is_error=unknown count=115
```

Example output from July 2026; abbreviated.

## Supported sources

| Source | Origin | Typical input |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `claude-code-session` | watched JSONL under `~/.claude/projects` |
| Codex CLI | `codex-session` | watched sessions under `~/.codex/sessions` |
| ChatGPT | `chatgpt-export` | export archive or opt-in browser capture |
| Claude web | `claude-ai-export` | export archive or opt-in browser capture |
| Gemini and AI Studio | `aistudio-drive` | Drive or AI Studio export |
| Gemini CLI | `gemini-cli-session` | watched local session data |
| Hermes | `hermes-session` | runtime-root ATIF or ATOF artifacts |
| Antigravity | `antigravity-session` | exported session data |

Parsers preserve the structure available in each source, including roles, prose,
thinking blocks, tool calls and results, attachments, and session metadata.
Provider-specific limits are documented in
[docs/provider-origin-identity.md](docs/provider-origin-identity.md).

## Storage

Polylogue keeps imported source artifacts and user-authored changes separate
from data that can be rebuilt.

| File | Contents | Durability |
|---|---|---|
| `source.db` | acquired source artifacts and runtime hook events | irreplaceable — back up |
| `index.db` | normalized sessions, messages, blocks, actions, lineage, FTS, analytics | rebuildable |
| `embeddings.db` | optional semantic-search vectors | expensive to rebuild — back up |
| `user.db` | notes, tags, corrections, candidates, and judgments | irreplaceable — back up |
| `audit.db` | previews, authorizations, attempts, continuity (append-only) | irreplaceable — back up |
| `ops.db` | daemon cursors, convergence state, and telemetry | disposable |

Large payloads are stored in a SHA-256 content-addressed blob store under the
same archive root.

The data model keeps several distinctions explicit:

- Unknown tool outcomes remain unknown.
- A message's provider role is stored separately from who or what supplied its
  content.
- Copied parent history is represented through lineage rather than counted as
  new work in every child session.
- Token counts are not combined when providers define them differently.

See [docs/data-model.md](docs/data-model.md) and
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Interfaces

### CLI

The query-first CLI supports full-text search, field filters, booleans, date
ranges, action queries, pipelines, and JSON output.

```bash
polylogue find 'repo:polylogue since:7d' then analyze --facets
polylogue find "urgent" then mark --tag-add review
polylogue find 'actions where tool:shell AND command:pytest' then read
```

### MCP

`polylogue-mcp` exposes the archive over stdio. It is read-only by default and
takes no CLI flags. Write, judge, and maintenance capability are each an
independent `polylogue.toml` `[mcp]` opt-in (or `POLYLOGUE_MCP_*_ENABLED` env
var) resolved at server startup, and remain subject to authorization and
confirmation rules.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "polylogue": { "command": "polylogue-mcp" }
  }
}
```

See [docs/mcp-reference.md](docs/mcp-reference.md).

### HTTP and Python

`polylogued run` can serve a local HTTP reader and metrics endpoint. Python
callers can use the asynchronous API over the same archive.

Semantic search is optional. It requires an embedding provider and is the only
normal path that sends archive text outside the machine. Run
`polylogue ops embed preflight` to inspect the work and estimated cost first.

## Status

Polylogue is pre-1.0. Import, continuous ingestion, local query, the demo, and
the CLI, MCP, HTTP, and Python interfaces are implemented. Provider formats and
public interfaces may still change between releases.

## Security

Polylogue assumes a trusted single-user machine. The daemon binds to loopback,
protected routes use bearer tokens, and browser capture is opt-in with its own
token. The archive may contain source code, credentials, and personal
conversations. Use disk encryption and read [docs/security.md](docs/security.md)
and [docs/daemon-threat-model.md](docs/daemon-threat-model.md) before exposing
anything beyond localhost.

## Development

```bash
devtools status
# Optional local static check; the hosted candidate gate covers publication.
devtools verify --quick
```
