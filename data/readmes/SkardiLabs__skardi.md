**Skardi is an open-source self-improving context framework.**

Let your agent query any of your data, declaring *why* it asks.
Skardi records every ask, so the intentions that keep coming back can become named tools and standing routines.

**Observe** · every query, with intent &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Learn** · what recurs across sessions &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Act** · new tools and routines — *automation in flight*

## The loop

Most agent stacks freeze their data tools at ship time: you guess which queries
the agent will need, wrap each one by hand, and find out in production what you
guessed wrong. Skardi inverts that. The agent gets one general way in, and the
tools it ends up with are the ones it demonstrably reached for.

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="asset/loop-dark.svg">
    <img src="asset/loop-light.svg" width="100%" alt="The loop — ① Observe: the agent asks anything, in SQL, and declares why (POST /query + ai_context → audit ledger). ② Learn: read the ledger, group by session and purpose, find the intentions that keep coming back. ③ Act: recurring queries become named pipelines; recurring intentions become routines that run before they're asked. The toolset grew itself.">
  </picture>
</p>

**1 — Serve your data, with the ledger on.** One `ctx.yaml` names your sources
([full reference](docs/server.md)); `--query-audit-db` turns on the durable
record that makes the rest of the loop possible.

```yaml
kind: context
metadata: { name: acme }
spec:
  data_sources:
    - name: warehouse            # step 2 queries warehouse.public.subs
      type: postgres
      hierarchy_level: catalog   # register every table in the database
      connection_string: postgres://localhost:5432/acme
```

```bash
# from a source checkout — Docker once --query-audit-db ships in a tagged release
git clone https://github.com/SkardiLabs/skardi.git && cd skardi
cargo run --release --bin skardi-server -- \
  --ctx ctx.yaml --query-audit-db ./audit.db --port 8080
```

**2 — Your agent explores freely, declaring intent.** Any SQL over any
registered source, federated in one statement. `ai_context` is how the agent
says *why* — `purpose` (this query), `session_id` (this run), and optional
`task` (the larger work a run of queries serves) are recorded, never executed.

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/query -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @- <<'JSON'
{ "sql": "SELECT plan, COUNT(*) AS cancels FROM warehouse.public.subs WHERE cancelled_at > now() - interval '7 days' GROUP BY plan",
  "ai_context": { "purpose": "weekly churn check, by plan", "session_id": "sess-1a2b", "task": "Q3 retention review" } }
JSON
```

**3 — Promote what recurs.** &nbsp;`in flight` — the
[`skardi-query-log`](https://github.com/SkardiLabs/skardi-skills/pull/25) skill
reads the ledger, writes the pipeline, reloads the server, health-checks it, and
rolls back if the install fails. Held until `--query-audit-db` lands in a tagged
release; today you can read the ledger yourself with plain SQL — it is a SQLite
file indexed on `(session_id, created_at)`.

```yaml
# /skardi-query-log --db ./audit.db --dir pipelines/ --port 8080 --restart-cmd '...'
#   → 4 sessions asked the same churn question with different windows
#   → wrote pipelines/weekly-churn.yaml, reloaded, /health/weekly-churn ok
kind: pipeline
metadata: { name: weekly-churn, version: "1.0.0" }
spec:
  query: |                                   # the varying window, parameterized
    SELECT plan, COUNT(*) AS cancels FROM warehouse.public.subs
    WHERE cancelled_at > now() - CAST({window} AS INTERVAL)
    GROUP BY plan ORDER BY cancels DESC
```

**4 — The agent has a new tool.** One definition, every binding — shell, REST,
and MCP over both transports (local stdio and remote streamable HTTP) — so the
same promoted pipeline works in Claude Code, Cursor, your own loop, claude.ai,
or any HTTP host, with no wrapper code to maintain.

```bash
# shell verb — any agent with a Bash tool, no MCP config
skardi run weekly-churn -p window='7 days'
# same pipeline, served as REST
curl -X POST localhost:8080/weekly-churn/execute \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"window": "7 days"}'
# same pipeline as an MCP tool — hosts that spawn a local process (Claude Desktop, …)
# from a source checkout until `skardi mcp` ships in a tagged release
skardi mcp
# … and as remote MCP — hosts that only take a URL (claude.ai, hosted agents):
# the server above already serves http://localhost:8080/mcp. With auth enabled
# every request carries a Bearer token; a public hostname is declared with
# --mcp-allowed-host api.example.com (loopback is always allowed).
```

Both MCP bindings — the local `skardi mcp` bridge and the server's `/mcp`
endpoint — project the same tool surface; [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md) covers
host setup, auth, the host allowlist, and reverse proxies for both.

Promoting queries into pipelines is only the simplest form of **Act**. The same ledger supports
acting on *intentions*: when every weekday morning ends with the same GitHub +
Slack queries, each declaring `purpose: "daily standup"`, the pattern isn't a
pipeline — it's a routine, and any harness that can run an agent on a schedule
(Claude Code routines, a cron-driven CLI run) can have the standup drafted
before anyone asks. And because the ledger is one SQLite file (or one
Postgres database, via `SKARDI_QUERY_AUDIT_PG_DSN` — same fail-closed
contract, storage swapped), you can hand a window of it to an LLM and ask
what keeps being needed that nobody turned into a tool — recurring
intentions the user hasn't noticed yet. One boundary is yours
to set: ledger rows carry raw SQL, literals included, so keep that analysis on a
local model or redact first — sending a window to a hosted LLM should be a
deliberate opt-in, not a default. Both land as skills on
top of the ledger, like
[`skardi-query-log`](https://github.com/SkardiLabs/skardi-skills/pull/25) —
no server changes required.

Then back to **Observe**, with one fewer thing your agent has to figure out from
scratch.

---

## Why it compounds

- **Intent is recorded, not inferred.** The ledger stores *why* each query ran,
  not just what ran. Two statements with different SQL and the same purpose are
  the same question — which is the difference between mining patterns and
  grepping strings.
- **One chokepoint means one memory.** Every source sits behind one engine, so a
  recurring need spanning Postgres, Parquet on S3 and a SaaS API is visible as
  *one* pattern. Across N SDKs it is N unrelated log files.
- **Promotion is reviewable.** What the loop produces is pipeline YAML you read,
  diff, edit and revert — not a learned weight you have to trust. Writes stay
  governed on the way in too: `access_mode` gates DML per source, DDL is always
  rejected, and literals never reach your logs or OTLP stream
  ([why](docs/server.md#query-confidentiality)).

## Install

Two skills. [`auto-context`](https://github.com/SkardiLabs/skardi-skills/tree/main/auto-context)
turns a folder of documents — or a datastore you already run — into governed,
searchable context served over HTTP by `skardi-server`: hybrid search (vector +
FTS + RRF), defaulting to a local SQLite file the skill creates and owns, or
pointed at Postgres + pgvector, MongoDB, or Lance.
[`retrieval`](https://github.com/SkardiLabs/skardi-skills/tree/main/retrieval)
teaches the agent to answer questions from a `skardi-server` you already run.

Both run on every [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) host below. They
differ only in where the skill directory goes.

**Claude Code** installs from the marketplace:

```text
/plugin marketplace add SkardiLabs/skardi-skills
/plugin install auto-context@skardi-skills
/plugin install retrieval@skardi-skills
```

Every other host installs from a checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SkardiLabs/skardi-skills.git && cd skardi-skills
```

**Codex, Cursor, Pi, dsh and OpenCode** all read the cross-tool
`~/.agents/skills/` convention, so one copy covers all five:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
cp -r auto-context/skills/auto-context ~/.agents/skills/auto-context
cp -r retrieval/skills/retrieval ~/.agents/skills/retrieval
```

**[OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai/cli/skills)** installs through its own CLI
instead of copying, and **[Hermes](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/skills)**
reads `~/.hermes/skills/`:

```bash
openclaw skills install ./auto-context/skills/auto-context   # add --global for every workspace
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/skills && cp -r auto-context/skills/auto-context ~/.hermes/skills/auto-context
```

Per-host native directories, project-scoped installs and the Hermes
`external_dirs` option are covered in the
[skardi-skills README](https://github.com/SkardiLabs/skardi-skills#installation).

**CLI** — pre-built for `x86_64`/`aarch64` Linux and Apple Silicon (Intel Macs:
build from source — the one-liner below has no published artifact there):

```bash
curl -fSL "https://github.com/SkardiLabs/skardi/releases/latest/download/skardi-$(uname -m | sed 's/arm64/aarch64/')-$(uname -s | sed 's/Linux/unknown-linux-gnu/' | sed 's/Darwin/apple-darwin/').tar.gz" | tar xz
sudo mv skardi /usr/local/bin/
```

Against **skardi-cloud**, one command signs the CLI in — the console
authenticates you in a browser and you approve one workspace, so there is no
OAuth client to provision per deployment:

```bash
skardi login --control-plane https://your-console.example.com
```

It writes a workspace-scoped token into `~/.skardi/config.yaml`. `--no-browser`
prints the approval URL instead of opening one, which is how a headless or
SSH'd host logs in: nothing has to come back to the machine running `skardi`.
See [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md#signing-in-to-skardi-cloud--login--logout) for the
other way in (`--client-id`, which selects workspaces from the terminal) and
for what a cloud context can and cannot do.

**Server** — a Docker image, or a source build (no pre-built binary yet):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SkardiLabs/skardi.git && cd skardi
cargo build --release -p skardi-server --features candle,chunking   # local embeddings + chunk(); pure Rust
cargo install --locked --path crates/cli                            # the CLI, from the same checkout
```

That gives the retrieval skills what they need — `chunk()` plus a local
embedding UDF — and builds with cargo alone. (`chunking` is already a default
server feature; naming it keeps the line correct against older tags.)

**`--features rag` widens that to all four embedding backends, and one of them
— `gguf` — compiles llama.cpp through `cmake`, so that build needs `cmake` and a
C++ toolchain on the machine.** Reach for `rag` when you want `gguf`, `onnx` or
`remote_embed`; otherwise the line above is the cheaper build. Or skip building
altogether and run a published server image that ships the embedding backends
(see **Docker & cloud** under More).

## What's underneath

One Rust process ([DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/) in-process) plus
a small SQLite file for the ledger and optional auth. One server serves many
agents; deploy it next to your data, behind your usual auth.

- **Federated SQL** — one statement across every registered source, no
  application-side joins. [docs/federated-queries.md](docs/federated-queries.md)
- **Pipelines** — a YAML file with parameterized SQL becomes a REST endpoint
  (schema inferred) *and* a `skardi run` verb. This is what the loop promotes
  into. [docs/pipelines.md](docs/pipelines.md)
- **Semantic overlay** — plain-English descriptions of tables and columns served
  on `GET /data_source`, so the agent reads what data *means* before querying
  instead of guessing from a schema dump. [docs/semantics.md](docs/semantics.md)
- **Offline jobs** — async batch writes with atomic commit, crash recovery and a
  run ledger you can list and inspect. [docs/jobs.md](docs/jobs.md)
- **Retrieval built in** — KNN, FTS and hybrid RRF in SQL; `candle()` embeddings,
  `chunk()`, `onnx_predict()` and `llm_extract()` as UDFs, so content and vector
  land on the same row atomically. [docs/embeddings/](docs/embeddings/)

Most sources read a store that already holds rows. **RSS/Atom** is the one that
reaches out over the open web at query time — one DataFusion partition per feed
so a dead feed degrades alone, and, because feed URLs are agent-authored input,
a fetch deliberately left un-sandboxed in OSS for operators to gate at the
infrastructure layer. See [docs/rss.md](docs/rss.md).

```

Two images are published per release: `skardi-server-lite` (default build —
chunking only) and `skardi-server-full` (every stable feature: RAG/embedding,
LLM extraction, documents, RSS). For anything in between, build locally with
`docker build -t skardi --build-arg FEATURES=<flags> .` (e.g. `FEATURES=rag`).
The fastest cloud path is the
[Sealos](https://sealos.io/products/app-store/skardi/) template.

The full image's `documents` support is **PDF-only**: it ships PDFium, but not
the LibreOffice/ImageMagick converters that Office/ODF/image inputs need, and
OCR is HTTP-only (`ocr_server_url`) in every build. For a non-PDF corpus,
derive an image that installs those tools —
`FROM ghcr.io/skardilabs/skardi/skardi-server-full:latest` plus
`apt-get install -y libreoffice imagemagick`. See
[docs/documents.md](docs/documents.md).

hybrid search, inline embeddings), [rag](demo/rag/),
[simple_backend](demo/simple_backend/) (REST on SQLite + auth),
[movie_recommendation](demo/movie_recommendation/) (ONNX NCF model).
