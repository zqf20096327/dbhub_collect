### What is DBackup?

DBackup is a comprehensive, self-hosted backup solution for **databases and the files that belong to them**. It provides AES-256-GCM encryption, flexible storage options, and intelligent retention policies to ensure your data is always protected and recoverable.

Whether you're running a single MySQL database or managing multiple PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQL Server instances, DBackup offers a unified interface with real-time monitoring, granular access control, and seamless restore capabilities. A job can also collect **directories and files** from any storage adapter - local paths, SFTP, SMB, FTP, WebDAV, S3, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, or rsync over SSH - so an application's dump and its data directory land in the same archive, at the same point in time, with one retention policy over both. There is no agent to install.

**No vendor lock-in by design** - every database backup is a standard dump (SQL, BSON, RDB, etc.) and every file backup is a plain TAR archive, both encrypted with open AES-256-GCM. Unencrypted, `tar -xf` is all you need. Encrypted, the format is specified byte by byte and the Recovery Kit reads it with a single Node.js script and your key. No proprietary formats, no dependencies on DBackup itself.

That promise shapes the architecture: incremental backups store whole changed files rather than deduplicated chunks, which uses more storage than a chunk-based tool like restic or Borg but keeps every backup an archive you can open by hand. See [the reasoning behind that trade](https://dbackup.app/blog/no-global-deduplication).

## ✨ Features

### 🗄️ Database Backup

- **10 Database Engines** - MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, Redis, Valkey, Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Database (beta), and Firebird (beta)
- **Selective Database Backup** - Choose exactly which databases to back up per job instead of creating separate sources for each database
- **Multi-Database Jobs** - Back up multiple databases from a single source in one job with a unified TAR archive format
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption** - Encrypt backups with managed Encryption Profiles, key rotation, and downloadable Recovery Kits for offline decryption
- **GZIP & Brotli Compression** - Reduce backup size and storage costs with built-in compression
- **SSH Remote Execution** - Run backup tools directly on the remote database host via SSH, eliminating the need to expose database ports to the DBackup server

### 📁 File & Folder Backup

Meant for the files that belong to the applications you already back up databases for - config, uploads, certificates - collected in the same job, on the same schedule, under the same retention and key. DBackup is agentless, so a full run stages the tree on the DBackup host before packing it and needs roughly twice the source size in free space; for bulk media libraries or anything needing block-level deduplication, restic or Borg are the better tool.

- **Directory Sources** - Any storage adapter can serve as a source: back up local paths, SFTP, SMB, FTP, WebDAV, S3, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, or rsync over SSH, with folders picked from a checkbox tree
- **Databases and Files in One Job** - One run produces one archive holding the dumps and the directory trees side by side, so an app's database and its data directory share a restore point
- **Incremental Backups** - Store only what changed since the last run, with a configurable full-backup interval and chains that are retained and deleted as a unit
- **Single-File Restore** - Browse a backup's file tree without downloading it and restore a single file, transferring only that file's bytes on destinations that serve byte ranges
- **Exclude Pattern Presets** - Reusable glob lists for caches, logs, and anything else you don't want stored - edit the preset, every source using it follows
- **SMB Shadow Copies** - Read from a VSS snapshot instead of the live share, so open files are readable and the backup reflects a single point in time, with no agent on the file server

### ☁️ Storage & Destinations

- **13+ Storage Adapters** - S3, Cloudflare R2, Hetzner, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, SFTP, FTP, WebDAV, SMB, Rsync, and local filesystem
- **Multi-Destination Jobs** - Upload each backup to multiple storage destinations simultaneously for redundancy or off-site copies
- **Storage Explorer** - Browse backup files across all destinations, inspect metadata, download files, or generate secure direct download links
- **Storage Monitoring & Alerts** - Per-destination alerts for usage spikes, storage limit warnings, and missing backups within a defined time window

### 🔄 Restore & Recovery

- **One-Click Restore** - Restore directly from the Storage Explorer to any configured database target
- **Granular File Restore** - Pick whole directory sources, single folders, or individual files, each with its own target: back to the original location, into any destination, or as a `.tar.gz` download
- **Database Remapping** - Restore databases under different names or map multiple databases to new targets
- **Version Compatibility Check** - Pre-restore validation warns about version mismatches before execution
- **Integrity Verification** - Post-upload SHA-256/MD5 checksum validation after every backup, plus scheduled full integrity scans across all stored backups (Jobs mode or full storage scan)
- **No Vendor Lock-In** - Database backups are standard dumps, file backups are plain TAR archives, both encrypted with open AES-256-GCM. Decrypt and restore manually with just Node.js, no DBackup required
- **Recovery Kit** - Downloadable ZIP with your encryption key and standalone scripts that decrypt dumps and list or extract single files from archives, offline

### 📊 Monitoring & Visibility

- **Live Backup Progress** - Real-time progress tracking shows exactly what's happening during backup and restore operations
- **Interactive Dashboard** - Activity charts, job status overview, KPI cards, and auto-refreshing activity feeds
- **Backup Calendar** - GitHub-style 12-month heatmap showing backup activity and success/failure patterns at a glance
- **Database Explorer** - Browse databases, tables, and live data directly from DBackup with server-side pagination, full-text search, schema inspection, and deep-link URL support across all 8 database engines
- **Database Version History** - Automatic tracking of database engine version changes over time with a timeline chart and change log
- **Storage Usage History** - Track storage growth over time with area charts and trend indicators
- **Execution History** - Full log of every backup and restore with duration, file size, status, and error details

### 🔔 Notifications

- **9 Notification Channels** - Discord, Slack, Teams, Telegram, Gotify, ntfy, Webhook, SMS (Twilio), and Email (SMTP)
- **Per-Job Notification Settings** - Configure which notification channels fire for each backup job individually
- **System Event Notifications** - Get notified about user logins, account creation, restore results, storage alerts, update availability, and system errors across all channels
- **Repeat Intervals** - Configurable reminder intervals for recurring alerts (storage warnings, update notices)

### ⏰ Scheduling & Retention

- **Cron-based Scheduling** - Flexible job scheduling with a visual Schedule Picker (Simple Mode + Cron Mode)
- **Retention Policy Templates** - Reusable named GFS (Grandfather-Father-Son) retention policies with per-destination assignment
- **Naming Templates & Schedule Presets** - Reusable filename patterns with tokens (`{job_name}`, `{db_name}`, date/time) and named cron presets for consistent scheduling across jobs
- **Automated Config Backups** - Self-backup of the entire DBackup configuration to any storage adapter

### 👥 Access Control & Security

## 📁 Directory Sources

**Every storage adapter listed below can also be a directory source**, with a live folder tree for picking what to back up. An adapter holds one role at a time, source or destination, so a job can never back up its own archives. The same server can serve both roles as two adapters - the "Create as Directory Source" action copies one over, credentials included.

The role matters for restores: adapters that serve byte ranges fetch only the file you asked for, while SMB downloads the archive once and takes the file out of it afterwards. That applies to the adapter *holding the backup*, not the one the files came from.
