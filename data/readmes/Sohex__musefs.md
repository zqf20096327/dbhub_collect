A read-only FUSE filesystem that presents a re-tagged, reorganized view of
your music library — without modifying or duplicating a single byte of the
original audio. Fix tags, art, and folder structure in a SQLite store; the
mount shows a clean library while your files stay exactly as they are.

Because the mount never rewrites a byte, every backing file keeps its exact
checksum forever. That suits two jobs the usual "edit tags in place" tools
can't: **archival**, where you retag and reorganize the presented library as
much as you like while the originals stay bit-for-bit verifiable; and
**torrents**, where you keep seeding from the untouched files while serving a
clean, re-tagged view of them on top.

Runs on **Linux**, **FreeBSD**, and **macOS\*** &mdash; *\*macOS builds and
passes unit tests, but mounted end-to-end behaviour is not yet validated.*

## Quick start

```bash
cargo install musefs    # compiles from source — needs a Rust toolchain,
                        # libfuse3-dev and pkg-config; prebuilt binaries
                        # and container images: see Installing

musefs scan ~/Music --db library.db        # ingest your library
mkdir -p ~/mnt/music
musefs mount ~/mnt/music --db library.db \
    --template '$albumartist/$album/$title'
# mount blocks until unmounted: fusermount3 -u ~/mnt/music (or Ctrl-C)
```

Mounting needs the `fuse3` runtime installed (`apt install fuse3` /
`apk add fuse3` / `dnf install fuse3`) and `/dev/fuse` present — see
[Installation](https://sohex.github.io/musefs/guide/installation.html).

`~/mnt/music` now serves your library as
`Album Artist/Album/Title.flac` — with each file's metadata generated fresh
from the database, spliced in front of your original, untouched audio.

See [Installation](https://sohex.github.io/musefs/guide/installation.html) for prebuilt binaries, container images, and platform notes.
