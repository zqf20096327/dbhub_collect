# Shaiya Core

Shaiya Core is a C++ library and patching framework designed to modernize, improve, and extend Shaiya private servers through an elegant, configurable, and easy-to-maintain universal base.

The repository contains a bundle of modules targeting the official server services (`ps_game.exe`, `ps_dbAgent.exe`, and `ps_login.exe`) and the client binary (`Game.exe`). It continues the former Shaiya Essentials project as its official successor, with a stronger focus on clean development practices, maintainability, documentation, and configurable behavior.

Shaiya Core is intended to be used with the official server, database, and client bundles maintained by the community. Updated bundles, guides, and support are shared through the Discord group:

The Core Discord community grew from the original ShaiyaGG Discord and focuses on open development, knowledge sharing, and building a healthy, stable community over time.

## Release Status

**Shaiya Core v1.4 - Stable.** This release is considered production-ready and suitable for public use on live Shaiya private servers.

## Release Notes

### v1.4

- Fixed a native item-icon texture leak that accumulated GPU memory on every device reset (alt-tab, resolution change).
- Fixed the client-side minimap zoom-out cap, which was stuck at 25 due to a stale patch; it now correctly allows zooming out to 200.
- Restored the emoji/GIF picker's per-type ON/OFF visibility toggles (previously a stub that always rendered both), now persisted to `CONFIG.INI`.
- Removed dead code across the client module: unused native-address constants, an unreferenced ImGui helper, a superseded packet-dispatch pipeline, and unused includes.
- Consolidated duplicated logic into shared helpers: PNG-to-D3D9 texture decoding, textured-quad drawing with render-state save/restore, ImGui panel button overlays, and INI setting read/write boilerplate.
- No gameplay-facing behavior changes beyond the two fixes above; the rest is internal cleanup with no functional impact.

## The Basics

- Shaiya Core provides a preconfigured and stable database, server-side files, SQL installers, tools, and client bundle.
- A detailed video guide for basic installation is available in the Discord group's `Guides` section.
- Core is highly declarative and configurable. Many features are controlled through `.ini` files instead of hardcoded binary edits.
- For example, you can skip stock startup screens through `CONFIG.INI`, and you can change the server level cap by editing a value in `ServerConfig.ini`.
- You keep control over the project. There are no direct manual assembly edits applied to released files; behavior is defined through source code, hooks, and configuration.
- Features can be disabled, adjusted, or extended in code, and many runtime options can be changed through configuration.
- The project does not assume advanced technical knowledge from the final user. It can be used by someone starting from zero, especially with the community guides and support.
- This repository includes extensive documentation, with more to be added over time. Reading the module READMEs is strongly recommended before making changes.


## Repository Layout

- `sdev/` - game-service/server hooks, packet handlers, configuration loaders, and gameplay fixes.
- `sdev-client/` - `Game.exe` hooks, ImGui overlay, UI patches, and client quality-of-life features.
- `sdev-login/` - login-service hooks.
- `sdev-db/` - database-agent hooks.
- `shaiya/` - shared game structures, enums, and packet definitions.
- `util/` - common memory patching helpers.
- `external/` - vendored third-party code used by client features.
- `mini-gmp/` - vendored dependency used by the project.

## Build

This project targets Windows, Visual Studio 2022/MSBuild, and x86 builds.

Server module:

```powershell
MSBuild.exe .\Shaiya-Core.sln /t:sdev /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x86 /m
```

All DLL modules:

```powershell
MSBuild.exe .\Shaiya-Core.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x86 /m
```

Client module:

```powershell
.\build-client.cmd
```

`build-client.cmd` and `build-client.ps1` wrap the standard client build. The PowerShell wrapper accepts `-Configuration Debug|Release` and `-Target Build|Rebuild|Clean`; by default it builds `sdev-client` as Release|x86. Build outputs are ignored by git. Public releases should be built from a clean checkout and tested against the matching binaries.

## Configuration

Runtime behavior is controlled through external files such as `CONFIG.INI`, server-side `.ini` files, PNG interface assets, and feature-specific configuration files. Keep production secrets and server-specific private data out of commits.

- The updater is skipped by default for testing. Change `SKIPUPDATER` in `CONFIG.INI` to restore updater-required behavior.
- Cosmetic and visual features can be toggled through commands such as `/wings off`, `/pets off`, `/costumes off`, `/titles off`, `/colour off`, and `/effects off`.
- FPS boost can also be controlled manually with `/fpsboost on` and `/fpsboost off`.
- Level cap and enchant cap are configured server-side through `ServerConfig.ini`.
- `/font` changes the live game font and persists the selected font properties.
- In-game ImGui buttons provide quick access to Roulette, rewards, remote NPCs, and quick visual settings where those features are enabled.

## Feature Documentation

- Client features are documented in `sdev-client/README.md`.
- Server features are documented in `sdev/README.md`.
- Shared packet/structure notes are documented in `shaiya/README.md`.

## Special Thanks

This project exists thanks to Bowie's work and contributions to the Shaiya community through the Episode 6 and Shaiya Essentials repositories. Without that foundation, Shaiya Core would not be what it is today.

The Shaiya development community changed because of that effort and standard of quality. Core aims to carry that spirit forward with the same level of care, respect, and long-term usefulness.

Thank you, my friend, for everything.
