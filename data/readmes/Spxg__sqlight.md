# SQLight

A SQLite Playground that runs completely locally.

## How it works

Run SQLite as wasm in the browser using [`sqlite-wasm-rs`](https://github.com/Spxg/sqlite-wasm-rs).

## About UI

Users who have used [rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) will feel very familiar. 

Because the layout and component design are derived from it, but rewritten using [leptos](https://leptos.dev).
