## Built with Claude Code

> [!WARNING]
> The project is vibe-coded and should be treated as such.

Claude Code wrote most of the code. My background is scientific computing with extensive
AWS experience and I did this project to learn frontend coding and agent orchestration in a full-stack application.


I wanted to ensure that no data is compromised when using the AWS cloud option as it has public facing endpoints. The security model is explained here: [security model](https://mcgamertime-docs.drmaggi.com/self-hosting/security/).

The setup used to build it is in [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md), with these plugins:

- [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) — brainstorming, subagent-driven development, TDD, systematic debugging
- [frontend-design](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-public/tree/main/plugins/frontend-design) — non-generic UI design guidance
- [chrome-devtools-mcp](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp) — live browser inspection and automation

## Quick start

### 1. Self-hosted with Docker

**To install:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Strandgaard96/mc-gamertime/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
echo "ADMIN_USERNAME=admin" >> .env
echo "ADMIN_PASSWORD=<your-password>" >> .env
docker compose up -d
```

`ADMIN_USERNAME`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD` are the **only required setting** — they bootstrap your
first admin account on first boot. Everything else — `BGG_TOKEN` for game search, `SMTP_*` for
password-reset email, `APP_BASE_URL`, `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, etc. — is optional with a
working default; see [`.env.example`](./.env.example) or the [full config
reference](https://mcgamertime-docs.drmaggi.com/self-hosting/configuration/).

Open <http://localhost:4263> and log in.

For setup of remote access see [HTTPS / Reverse
Proxy](https://mcgamertime-docs.drmaggi.com/self-hosting/https/) and the
[security model](https://mcgamertime-docs.drmaggi.com/self-hosting/security/).

### 2. Cloud-hosted on AWS

Host the app on AWS serverless infrastructure, provisioned by Terraform. Everything
is pay-per-request, which for regular personal use amounts to roughly **$0/month** — the free tier covers
it. Worth choosing if you want easy remote access and experience with cloud hosting while gaining the security benefits of AWS hosted infrastructure.

#### Prerequisites
An AWS account, plus Terraform, Node.js and Task installed — and **a domain name you own**.
The domain is not optional: CloudFront needs an ACM certificate, and ACM only issues one for
a domain you control.

```bash
cp infra/terraform.tfvars.example infra/terraform.tfvars
# then set: domain = "example.com"
```

`domain` in `infra/terraform.tfvars` is the **only required setting** - `terraform apply` refuses to run without it. Everything
else (`subdomain`, `bgg_token`, `alert_email`, `cloudfront_web_acl_arn`,
`extra_cors_origins`, `aws_region`) has a working default; see
[`infra/terraform.tfvars.example`](./infra/terraform.tfvars.example) or the [full AWS
guide](https://mcgamertime-docs.drmaggi.com/cloud-deploy/aws/) for what each does.

For full AWS installation instructions see: [Full AWS guide →](https://mcgamertime-docs.drmaggi.com/cloud-deploy/aws/).

The security considerations for the AWS hosted app are described here:
[Security & privacy on AWS →](https://mcgamertime-docs.drmaggi.com/cloud-deploy/security/).


## Stack

- **Frontend** — React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS 4, React Router 7, TanStack Query 5,
  Zod, Recharts
- **Backend** — Python, FastAPI; uvicorn when self-hosted, Lambda + Mangum on AWS
- **Data** — embedded SQLite, or DynamoDB
- **Storage** — local filesystem, or S3; uploaded media is served by the app behind auth,
  never straight from the bucket
- **Infra** — Terraform, GitHub Actions, release-please

![Architecture: the same FastAPI app and React build served either from one self-hosted container backed by SQLite and the local filesystem, or on AWS behind CloudFront with API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB and S3](docs-site/src/assets/architecture.svg)
