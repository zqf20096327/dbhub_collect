### Database support

PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB and SQLite ship built in. Everything else is a plugin. The built-in PostgreSQL driver is deprecated in favour of the [PostgreSQL plugin](https://github.com/TabularisDB/tabularis-postgresql-plugin), which Tabularis installs automatically. Current coverage, mirroring the [driver & plugin coverage](https://tabularis.dev/#driver-coverage) on the website:

## Installation

### Windows

#### WinGet (Recommended)

```bash
winget install Debba.Tabularis
```

#### Direct Download

Download the installer from the [Releases page](https://github.com/TabularisDB/tabularis/releases) and run it:

```
tabularis_x.x.x_x64-setup.exe
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

### macOS

#### Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew install --cask tabularis
```

[![Homebrew](https://img.shields.io/badge/Homebrew-Repository-orange?logo=homebrew)](https://github.com/debba/homebrew-tabularis)

#### Direct Download

Builds from **v0.13.1** onward are signed and notarized by Apple, so they open without any extra steps.

The notes below only apply to **older releases (before v0.13.1)** downloaded directly:

- You need to allow accessibility access (Privacy & Security) to the tabularis app. If you are upgrading and already have tabularis on the allowed list, remove it manually before accessibility access can be granted to the new version.
- You may need to run `xattr -c /Applications/tabularis.app` after copying the app to the Applications directory.

### Linux (Snap)

```bash
sudo snap install tabularis
sudo snap connect tabularis:password-manager-service   # allow keychain access for saved credentials
```

The `password-manager-service` interface is not auto-connected by the Snap Store yet. Without it, saving a connection fails with a `Platform secure storage failure` error.

[![Snap Store](https://img.shields.io/badge/snap-tabularis-blue?logo=snapcraft)](https://snapcraft.io/tabularis)

### Linux (Flatpak)

```bash
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flatpark https://dl.flatpark.org/flatpark.flatpakrepo
flatpak install flatpark dev.tabularis.Tabularis
```

### Plugin System

> [Full reference on tabularis.dev →](https://tabularis.dev/wiki/plugins)

Tabularis is **hackable with an external plugin system**. Plugins are standalone executables that communicate with the app over **JSON-RPC 2.0 via stdin/stdout**, and can be written in any language.

- **Install Plugins:** Browse and install community drivers from **Settings → Available Plugins**, no restart required.
- **Manage Drivers:** View all registered drivers (built-in and plugins) in **Settings → Installed Drivers** and uninstall plugins with one click.
- **Any Database:** Add support for DuckDB, MongoDB, or any other database by writing or installing a plugin.
- **Plugin Registry:** Official plugins are listed in [`plugins/registry.json`](./plugins/registry.json).
- **Developer Guide:** See [`plugins/PLUGIN_GUIDE.md`](./plugins/PLUGIN_GUIDE.md) to build your own driver in any language.
- **Declarative themes (development):** **Settings → Appearance → Manage themes** supports local packages, previews and personal/VS Code imports without executable plugin activation. See the [theme author guide](./packages/create-plugin/THEMES.md) for the separate `tabularis-theme` CLI, packaging and release gates; public runtime/tooling rollout is not implied by this development feature.

### Logging

- Real-time log viewer in Settings, with level filtering and export to `.log` files.
- Automatically expand and inspect SQL queries in logs.
- **CLI Debug Mode:** Start with `tabularis --debug` for verbose logging from launch.

### Configuration Storage

> [Full reference on tabularis.dev →](https://tabularis.dev/wiki/configuration)

Configuration is stored in `~/.config/tabularis/` (Linux), `~/Library/Application Support/tabularis/` (macOS), or `%APPDATA%\tabularis\` (Windows): connection profiles, saved queries, app settings (`config.json`), custom themes, and per-connection editor preferences. You can move this folder from **Settings > Storage** (or with the `TABULARIS_DATA_DIR` environment variable), for example to an iCloud Drive or Dropbox folder to sync connections across machines; installed plugins always stay local. Tabs and queries are restored when you reopen a connection. The wiki covers the full file layout and every `config.json` option, including custom AI model overrides.

On Linux, **Follow System** reads the XDG desktop settings portal's `org.freedesktop.appearance/color-scheme` preference and follows its live updates, including GNOME's dark-mode toggle with the standard Adwaita GTK theme. The resolved light/dark theme is applied explicitly to GTK window decorations and the webview. A portal value of `0` (no preference) resolves to light, so switching back to the desktop default cannot reuse the app's previously forced dark theme. If the portal is unavailable or returns an unsupported value, Tabularis falls back to the native window theme, then the browser media query. The default window capability grants `core:window:allow-set-theme` to allow native theme changes. macOS and Windows use native theme notifications. See [the portal specification](https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/docs/doc-org.freedesktop.portal.Settings.html).

Portal command reads reuse one cached D-Bus connection, while the live watcher keeps its own connection. Failed reads discard the cached connection so the next request can reconnect; failed connection attempts are not cached. The existing two-second command timeout also bounds concurrent requests waiting for the cache.

### AI Features (Optional)

> [Full reference on tabularis.dev →](https://tabularis.dev/wiki/ai-assistant)

Optional Text-to-SQL and query explanation powered by **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, **MiniMax**, **OpenRouter**, **Ollama** (local models, no API key, full privacy), and any **OpenAI-compatible API** (Groq, Perplexity, Azure OpenAI, LocalAI, ...). Model lists are fetched from your provider and cached locally; custom models can be configured per provider.

### MCP Server: AI Agent Integration

> [Full reference on tabularis.dev →](https://tabularis.dev/wiki/mcp-server)

Tabularis includes a built-in **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that lets AI agents read your database schema and execute queries directly from their chat interface.

```bash
tabularis --mcp
```

**One-click setup** for Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Windsurf: open **Settings → MCP Server Integration**, click **Install Config** next to your client, and restart it. Manual configuration is covered in the wiki.

#### Available tools

Once connected, your AI agent can:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_connections` | List all saved database connections |
| `list_databases` | List all databases available for a connection |
| `list_tables` | List tables in a connection (with optional schema filter) |
| `describe_table` | Get full schema: columns, indexes, foreign keys |
| `run_query` | Execute any SQL query and return results |

Every tool accepts an optional `output_format` argument. JSON is the default, preserving the existing response format for all clients. You can choose JSON or [TOON](https://toonformat.dev/) as the default under **Settings → MCP Server Integration**; a tool call's `output_format` argument overrides that preference. TOON is especially compact for tabular query results passed to an LLM. MCP transport remains JSON-RPC in either mode; only the text inside the tool result changes.

#### Example prompts

> "Show me all tables in my production database and describe the `orders` table"

> "Write and run a query to find the top 10 customers by total order value this month"

> "Check if there are any missing indexes on the `users` table"
