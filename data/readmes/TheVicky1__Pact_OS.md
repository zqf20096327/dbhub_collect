  <h2>About</h2>
</div>

Most productivity tools suffer from **passive accumulation**—tasks, habits, and aspirational goals are recorded with enthusiasm, then quietly neglected when friction strikes.

**Intent is easy. Execution is difficult.**

**PACT** is an open-source **Personal Operating System (OS)** built with **Next.js 16**, **React 19**, **TypeScript 5**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and **Supabase PostgreSQL** to bridge the critical divide between intention and action. Rather than functioning as a passive checklist, PACT provides an active governance system unifying time-blocked planning, strategic milestone tracking, deep work focus sessions, integer-cents financial cash flow, and unbreakable accountability contracts.

### Foundational Principles

1. **Unbreakable Accountability**: Commitments are bound to explicit deadlines, confidential consequences, and strict resolution workflows.
2. **Temporal Truth**: Time-blocked planning with bi-directional Google Calendar synchronization guarantees realistic daily execution capacity.
3. **Objective Proof Verification**: Automated external connectors validate technical proof-of-work via GitHub, LeetCode, and Codeforces.
4. **Holistic Governance**: Single unified operational system for tasks, strategic goals, scoped projects, recurring routines, deep work focus, and financial cash flow.
5. **Open Source & Beginner Friendly**: Designed as a welcoming hub for first-time open-source contributors with single-file micro-issues, zero-database local setup, and fast-track PR reviews.

<div align="center">
  <h2>Quick Start</h2>
</div>

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: `v20.x` (LTS recommended)
- **Package Manager**: `npm` (v10+)
- **Git**: Installed and configured

### Local Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone your fork or the repository
git clone https://github.com/TheVicky1/Pact_OS.git
cd Pact_OS

# 2. Install reproducible dependencies
npm ci

# 3. Configure local environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local

# 4. Start local development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access PACT.

### Validation & Quality Gates

Run the local verification suite prior to committing changes:

```bash
# Run ESLint check
npm run lint

# Run TypeScript type check
npm run typecheck

# Run automated domain, release, and security test matrix
npm test

# Run preflight release readiness audit
npm run release:check

node scratch/secret-scan.mjs

# Run documentation link verification
node scratch/check-links.mjs

# Run production build compilation
npm run build
```

### 🐳 Containerized & Staging Deployment

PACT OS includes a multi-stage production `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for self-hosted or staging environments:

```bash
# Build and start containerized PACT OS
docker compose up -d --build

# Verify operational readiness probe
curl -I http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

> 💡 **Having setup issues?** Consult our [**Troubleshooting Guide**](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) or [**Production Deployment Runbook**](docs/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md) for detailed environment configuration.

1. **Pick an Issue**: Browse open [**Good First Issues**](https://github.com/TheVicky1/Pact_OS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
2. **Claim It**: Leave a comment (e.g., *"I'd like to work on this!"*) so we can assign it to you.
3. **Fork & Clone**: Fork the repository and clone it to your machine (`git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Pact_OS.git`).
4. **Create a Branch**: Create a descriptive branch (`git checkout -b fix/issue-12-typo`).
5. **Make the Change**: Edit the single specified file following the issue instructions.
6. **Verify Locally**: Run `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, and `node scratch/run-tests.mjs`.

  <h2>Visual Identity & Design Philosophy</h2>
</div>

PACT features a distinctive luxury visual language designed for calm, executive focus:

- **Obsidian Canvas Foundation**: Deep OLED Obsidian (`#050505`, `#070707`, `#090909`) eliminating interface fatigue.
- **Solid Luxury Surfaces**: Rich card surfaces (`#0C0C0F`, `#101012`) with ultra-fine specular hairline borders (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.06)`).
- **Restrained PACT Gold**: Warm gold accents (`#D4AF37`, `#E6C34A`) applied with surgical discipline for active states, progress indicators, and specular crescent highlights.
- **3D Celestial Planetary Hero**: Volumetric SVG radial illumination, Rayleigh atmospheric back-scatter, and razor-thin gold crescent lighting.
