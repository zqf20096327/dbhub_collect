## Abstract
The rapid advancement of single-cell technologies has significantly enhanced our ability to investigate cellular diversity and heterogeneity within plant tissues. However, analyzing this complexity in plants involves generating different data types to enable marker selection, cell identification, and other computational operations. These processes typically require broad programming expertise, posing a challenge for researchers with a limited computational background. To address this, we present iPscDB, a comprehensive and multifunctional platform that facilitates the integration and analysis of plant single-cell data. iPscDB combines over 3.5 million cells and 274 thousand markers derived from 789 experiments, covering 35 tissue types and 276 annotated cell types across 23 plant species. More importantly, the platform provides a user-friendly online analysis pipeline capable of processing raw FASTQ files. Users can configure parameters via an intuitive interface and utilize an integrated image editor to customize visualization outputs such as UMAP plots. Additionally, iPscDB supports various analyses such as those related to cross-species gene expression, cell-cell interactions, electronic single-cell pictography, and developmental trajectory. By streamlining the complex workflows of single-cell transcriptomics, iPscDB offers a powerful yet accessible solution for researchers with diverse technical backgrounds. iPscDB is accessible at https://www.tobaccodb.org/ipscdb/homePage.
