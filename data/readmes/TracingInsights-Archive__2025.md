## Frequently Asked Questions

Data availability timeline:

*   Practice sessions: Approximately 30 minutes after session completion
*   Qualifying sessions: Approximately 30 minutes after session completion
*   Sprint races: Approximately 30 minutes after race completion
*   Grand Prix races: Approximately 30 minutes after race completion

All telemetry data is processed and made available as quickly as possible after each session concludes.

Tip: For race weekends, check back shortly after each session to access the latest data. Historical data from previous seasons is available immediately.

You can analyze comprehensive telemetry data including:

*   Speed (km/h)
*   Throttle input percentage
*   Brake application
*   Gear selection
*   DRS activation zones
*   Lateral acceleration (G-forces)
*   Longitudinal acceleration
*   Track elevation changes
*   Engine RPM
*   Vertical acceleration

Fuel Correction is a feature that adjusts lap times to account for the changing weight of fuel in Formula 1 cars during a race. As cars burn fuel, they become progressively lighter, resulting in naturally faster lap times even without any improvement in driving or track conditions.

#### Why Fuel Correction matters:

*   **Weight impact:** Each kilogram of fuel adds approximately 0.03 seconds per lap to a car's time
*   **Race strategy analysis:** Helps distinguish between genuine pace improvements and those simply due to fuel load reduction
*   **Fair comparison:** Enables meaningful comparison between laps from different stages of a race
*   **Performance evaluation:** Provides a clearer picture of true car and driver performance throughout a race

#### How Fuel Correction is calculated:

Corrected Lap Time = Original Lap Time - (Fuel Weight Effect)

Where:

Fuel Weight Effect = Remaining Fuel (kg) × 0.03 seconds

Remaining Fuel = Initial Fuel × (1 - Current Lap / Total Race Laps)

The calculation uses these standard assumptions:

*   **Initial fuel load:**
    *   Full Race: 100kg 
    *   Sprint Race: 30kg

*   **Fuel consumption:** Linear usage throughout the race (equal amount burned each lap)
*   **Performance impact:** 0.03 seconds per kilogram of fuel per lap (industry standard approximation)

#### How to interpret Fuel-Corrected lap times:

*   **Early race laps:** Will show faster corrected times than their actual times (compensating for heavy fuel load)
*   **Mid-race laps:** Will show moderate correction
*   **Late race laps:** Will show minimal correction (as cars are already light on fuel)
*   **Comparing drivers:** Reveals true pace differences independent of fuel load advantages
*   **Stint analysis:** Helps identify genuine tire degradation separate from the fuel weight effect

#### When to use Fuel Correction:

*   **Race pace analysis:** When comparing laps from different stages of a race
*   **Strategy evaluation:** When analyzing the effectiveness of different pit stop strategies
*   **Driver performance:** When assessing a driver's consistency throughout a race
*   **Team comparisons:** When comparing the race pace of different teams


**Note:** Fuel correction is an approximation based on standard assumptions. Actual fuel loads and consumption rates may vary between teams, cars, and race conditions. The correction provides a useful analytical tool but should be considered alongside other performance metrics.

The Elevation Chart is a critical tool for verifying data integrity and alignment between different drivers' telemetry. Since track elevation is a fixed geographical feature, all drivers should show nearly identical elevation profiles regardless of their performance.

#### Why the Elevation Chart matters for data integrity:

*   **Reference alignment:** Track elevation is a constant physical property that all cars experience identically
*   **Data synchronization check:** Misaligned elevation profiles immediately indicate synchronization issues
*   **Error detection:** Helps identify corrupted or incorrectly processed telemetry data
*   **Baseline verification:** Establishes confidence in the reliability of other telemetry channels

#### How to use the Elevation Chart for data validation:

*   **Visual inspection:** Compare elevation profiles between multiple drivers - they should closely overlap
*   **Pattern matching:** Look for consistent peaks and valleys across all selected drivers
*   **Offset detection:** Check for horizontal shifts that indicate distance measurement errors
*   **Anomaly identification:** Identify unusual spikes or drops that may indicate sensor errors

#### Common data integrity issues revealed by the Elevation Chart:

*   **Horizontal misalignment:** Indicates distance measurement or synchronization errors
*   **Vertical scaling differences:** May indicate drivers going over kerbs/bumps
*   **Missing segments:** Reveals data gaps or transmission failures during recording
*   **Noise or jitter:** Can indicate sensor interference or data processing problems
*   **Complete mismatch:** Suggests incorrect lap selection or major data corruption

**Pro tip:** Always check the Elevation Chart first before analyzing other telemetry channels. If elevation profiles don't align properly, it's a strong indication that other telemetry comparisons (speed, throttle, braking) may be unreliable for that particular dataset.

**Note:** Minor variations in elevation data between drivers are normal due to sensor precision and sampling rates. However, significant differences that alter the overall profile shape indicate data integrity issues.

What kind of data is available in these repositories? 

Our repositories contain various types of Formula 1 data including:

*   Detailed telemetry data (speed, throttle, brake, DRS)
*   Acceleration data (lateral, longitudinal, vertical)
*   Technical data (RPM, gear, elevation)
*   Race results and qualifying times
*   Lap times and pit stop information
*   Driver and constructor standings

The data is organized by season and follows a consistent format for easy access and analysis.

 Can I use this data for my personal projects? 

Yes, you can use this data as you wish. We encourage creative use of the data for:
