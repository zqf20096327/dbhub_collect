**Logs, traces and metrics in. A web UI, a terminal UI and an MCP server out.
One binary, no cluster, no sidecar, no database beside it.**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://miradb.dev/install.sh | bash
mira --data-dir ./data
```

Point any OTLP exporter at gRPC `4317` or HTTP `4318`, open
`http://localhost:4318/`, or point an agent at `POST /mcp`. The block directory
is the only state there is.

<img src="docs/assets/tui/investigation.gif" alt="A recording of Mira's terminal UI. The log list over the last hour; a filter typed live, severity_text=ERROR, narrowing 14,371 records to 824 in 7.3ms; the service map, where errors propagate frontend to checkout to payments while inventory stays clean; then the trace under the failure — eight spans over 76.08ms, with a retry and an exception marked on the timeline.">

`mira mira`, recorded against a running node. Not a mock-up: the footers are
that run's own query plans and wall clocks.

## The numbers

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **1,537,875 records/s** | ingest, on **2.23 of 12 cores** — 886k/s/core at one connection |
| **2.6 ms** | to prove a value is in **none** of 137 blocks, zero blocks opened |
| **4.7 ms** | every span of one trace, out of 27.1M spans on disk |
| **7 µs** | the durable log append inside an acknowledgement |
| **0.14** | bytes on disk per byte on the wire, once compacted |
| **6.20 MiB stripped, 149 crates** | `zstd-sys` is the only C dependency, and it vendors its source |

Apple M3 Pro, one process, reproducible with the load harness in this repository.
What each number measures — the numerator, the denominator, and what is outside
the measurement — is **[the measurement contract](docs/internals/measurement.md)**,
which also carries every published figure in one generated table. The full sweep:
**[end-to-end testing](docs/internals/e2e.md)**. Why they land there:
**[architecture section 11](docs/architecture/performance.md)**. How
they read against the market, including where Mira is behind:
**[docs/market.md](docs/market.md)**.

## Four surfaces, one read path

Same data, same filter grammar, same code underneath. Nothing to deploy for any
of them.

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Browser** | `http://localhost:4318/` | Served out of `include_bytes!`; the whole view lives in the URL, so an alert webhook links straight back into it. |
| **Terminal** | `mira mira` | The same views over a running replica — or over a block directory **with no server at all**. |
| **MCP** | `POST /mcp` | Nine tools, no session id, so any replica answers any call. The ninth writes the RCA. |
| **HTTP** | `/api/v1/…` | `query`, `correlate`, `map`, `entities`, `metrics`, `alerts`. |

The ninth tool is the one to look at. An agent hands over its findings and gets
back a root-cause document — but `render_rca` re-runs every citation against the
store first, so a claim it cannot re-prove fails the call by name and nothing is
written:

<img src="docs/assets/tui/write-up.gif" alt="A recorded terminal session. An agent's three claims are listed, then render_rca refuses them: nothing was rendered and nothing was stored, 1 of 3 citations do not hold against this store, naming the claim and the filter that matched no records. The claim is corrected and the call returns a 59-line document whose evidence section carries the record count beside every claim — 229, 229, and 8 for the trace. A last query finds the write-up itself stored as a log record.">

There is no incident store: `emit` writes the document back as an ordinary log
record, so it is searchable by the same query path and expires with the
telemetry it describes. The worked investigation behind it is in
**[docs/agents.md](docs/agents.md)**.

## See it

**[miradb.dev/demo](https://miradb.dev/demo/)** — one command, then six screens
of both UIs, from data you generated a minute earlier.

<img src="docs/assets/ui/trace.png" alt="The same trace in Mira's web UI: eight nested spans over 76.08ms across frontend, inventory, checkout and payments, the five failed ones in red, with the query cost in the header — 8 matched of 30,720 scanned, 1 block, 47.5ms.">

```sh
docker run -p 4317:4317 -p 4318:4318 -v mira-data:/data ghcr.io/trianalab/mira:latest
helm install mira-operator oci://ghcr.io/trianalab/charts/mira-operator \
  --namespace mira-system --create-namespace   # then: kubectl apply a MiraCluster
```

Linux glibc >= 2.34 and macOS, x86_64 and arm64. `--version v0.4.2` pins the
installer to a release; every one of them ships a CycloneDX SBOM, `SHA256SUMS`,
a cosign signature and a SLSA provenance attestation.

| Install it properly, on Kubernetes or otherwise | **[docs/install.md](docs/install.md)** |
| First query, and what the `stats` object tells you | **[docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md)** |
| Connect an agent, and a worked investigation | **[docs/agents.md](docs/agents.md)** |
| Every flag and config key | **[docs/config.md](docs/config.md)** · **[CLI](docs/reference/cli.md)** |

| Why it exists at all | **[MANIFESTO.md](MANIFESTO.md)** |

## Scope

Mira is pre-1.0 and says so. Ingestion is allocation-lean rather than zero-copy
(*queries* are zero-copy); a storage node answers only from its own blocks, and
the cross-replica merge lives in `mira proxy` rather than in the node, which
merges record search and refuses correlate, map, metrics and entities; there is
no entity predicate and no block cache. The full list, with the reasoning, is
[architecture section 0.1](docs/architecture/corrections.md#01-what-is-not-true-yet).

## Contributing

Every gate CI runs is a target in the [`Makefile`](Makefile), and CI calls
nothing else:

```sh
make            # the target list
make check      # fmt, clippy, tests, rustdoc, UI, supply chain, drift, docs, coverage
```

Read [architecture section 0](docs/architecture/corrections.md)
first if the change is structural — it lists the mechanisms that do not survive
contact with the formats. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) is the walkthrough,
with [the test levels](docs/internals/testing.md) and
[how a release is cut](docs/internals/releases.md) behind it. Vulnerabilities go
to [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not to an issue.
