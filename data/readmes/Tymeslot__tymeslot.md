> **Open source, and staying that way.** Calendly is closed SaaS. Cal.com relicensed away from open source in 2026. Tymeslot's source stays public and self-hostable under the [GNU AGPLv3](LICENSE) — what you run today, you can keep running tomorrow.
>
> **Actively developed.** Tymeslot is the engine behind [tymeslot.app](https://tymeslot.app), our managed cloud — so the code you self-host is the same code we run in production for paying customers. New releases ship regularly; see the [releases](https://github.com/tymeslot/tymeslot/releases).

---

## Quick start

One command. Postgres is bundled, so there is nothing else to install.

```bash
docker run --name tymeslot \
  -p 4000:4000 \
  -e SECRET_KEY_BASE="$(openssl rand -base64 64 | tr -d '\n')" \
  -e PHX_HOST=localhost \
  -v tymeslot_data:/app/data \
  -v tymeslot_pg:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  luka1thb/tymeslot:latest
```

Open **[http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)** — your scheduling platform is live. The first account you create becomes the admin. For SMTP, TLS, a reverse proxy and external Postgres, see the [Docker guide](README-Docker.md).

> **Keep `tymeslot_pg` as a named volume.** Swapping it for a host path can fail on Docker Desktop, rootless Docker and SELinux hosts. If you need a specific location, use [external Postgres](README-Docker.md#using-an-external-database) instead.

## Everything you need to take bookings

No add-ons, no per-feature upsells. It all ships in the box.

### One place to run your day

Upcoming meetings, quick actions and your whole setup on a single screen. No hunting through menus to change how you take bookings.

![Tymeslot dashboard — overview with upcoming meetings and quick actions](./priv/static/images/screenshots/dashboard.webp)

### Availability that mirrors reality

Keep as many named schedules as your week needs — weekday office hours, Tuesday evenings, one weekend a month — each with its own working hours, breaks, date overrides, buffers, booking window and minimum notice. Point each meeting type at the schedule it belongs to, and your booking page offers exactly the hours you meant for it.

![Availability editor — named schedules as tabs, with per-day hours and breaks](./priv/static/images/screenshots/availability.webp)

### Embed it anywhere

Inline on a page, a popup, or a floating button. Copy the snippet, paste it on your site. Tokens are signed and domain-locked, so your widget only runs where you put it.

![Embed & share — inline, popup and floating embed options with code snippets](./priv/static/images/screenshots/embed.webp)

### Never double-booked

Every connected calendar is checked the moment someone books. One conflict anywhere blocks the slot everywhere — across Google, Outlook, CalDAV and the rest.

---

## And there's more under the hood

- **Email that delivers** — responsive templates, an `.ics` file on every send, configurable reminders, and signed cancel/reschedule links that need no login.
- **Ask the right questions** — add custom questions to any meeting type, so you walk into every call already briefed.
- **Meet where it suits them**: offer in person, phone, video or somewhere else on any meeting type. Add several and your guest picks one when they book, including which video service.
- **SSO-first auth** — email/password, Google, GitHub, plus generic OAuth/OIDC for Keycloak, Authentik, Okta and Azure AD. Disable registration or password login independently.
- **Privacy by design** — credentials encrypted at rest, no third-party trackers or analytics pixels, rate-limited public endpoints, HMAC-signed webhooks, CSRF and signed tokens throughout.
- **Automate everything** — Slack and Telegram notifications, plus `meeting_created`, `meeting_cancelled` and `meeting_rescheduled` webhooks that plug straight into n8n, Zapier, Make or your own backend.
- **Make it yours** — two booking-page themes (Quill and Rhythm) with custom colours, backgrounds and white-label options.
- **Speaks your language** — the whole app in English, German, Ukrainian, French, Italian and Czech: your dashboard, your booking pages and every email, with dates and times in local convention. Guests get their own language automatically; pick yours in Account settings.
- **Get paid to meet** — optional paid bookings through [Stripe Connect](#meeting-payments), off by default and fee-free for self-hosters.

## Deploy your way

| Method | Guide | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Docker** | [README-Docker.md](README-Docker.md) | Single container, Postgres included — recommended |
| **Cloudron** | [README-Cloudron.md](README-Cloudron.md) | One-click install, automatic updates |
| **Railway** | [Deploy →](https://railway.com/deploy/tymeslot) | One-click cloud, no server to manage |
| **Managed Cloud** | [tymeslot.app](https://tymeslot.app) | Zero setup, free plan included |

Full configuration reference — SMTP, OAuth, OIDC, reCAPTCHA, external Postgres, SSO-only mode — lives in the [Docker guide](README-Docker.md). The first user to register on a fresh install becomes admin and gets `/admin`, where runtime settings (registration on/off, password auth, video transcoding) can be toggled without a redeploy. For promoting further admins on each target, see [`docs/ADMIN.md`](docs/ADMIN.md).

## Meeting payments

Optional. Charge attendees through Stripe at booking time. Off by default — self-hosters opt in by registering their own Stripe platform, and Tymeslot never holds the funds or takes a cut unless you set one.

<details>
<summary><b>Set up Stripe Connect</b></summary>

<br />

**Prerequisites**

1. Register a Stripe account for your instance and enable Stripe Connect.
2. Add Tymeslot as a Connect platform — your instance becomes the platform that hosts' Stripe accounts connect to.
3. Create a separate webhook endpoint in the Stripe dashboard for Connect events
   and copy its signing secret. Point it at
   `https://<your-domain>/webhooks/stripe/connect`, set it to listen to events
   on **Connected accounts**, and subscribe it to `checkout.session.completed`,
   `checkout.session.expired`, `charge.refunded`, `charge.dispute.created`,
   `charge.dispute.closed`, and `account.updated`.

Tymeslot pins its Stripe API calls to version `2025-11-17.clover`. Create the
webhook endpoint on that API version (or your account default, if newer);
endpoints on older versions keep working, as both payload generations are
read. Upgrading Tymeslot never rotates or invalidates webhook signing
secrets — existing endpoints and secrets stay valid.

**Environment variables**

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Your platform's Stripe secret key (`sk_live_…` or `sk_test_…`). Required when `MEETING_PAYMENTS_ENABLED=true`. |
| `STRIPE_CONNECT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Signing secret for the Connect webhook endpoint. Required to verify connected-account events. |
| `MEETING_PAYMENTS_ENABLED` | Set to `true` to expose the payments dashboard and the per-event payment toggle. Defaults to `false`. |
| `MEETING_PAYMENTS_APPLICATION_FEE_BP` | Optional platform fee in basis points (`100` = 1%). Defaults to `0`, so self-hosters never take a cut unless they opt in. Range `0`–`10000`. |

Once enabled, hosts connect their own Stripe account from **Dashboard → Integrations → Payments**, pick a currency, and switch on **Require payment** for any event type. Direct charges flow into the host's Stripe balance on their existing payout schedule.
