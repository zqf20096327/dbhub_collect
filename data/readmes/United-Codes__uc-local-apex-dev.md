# UC Local APEX Dev

**Get Oracle 26ai with APEX and ORDS running in minutes. Automate the tedious parts of local APEX development.**

A containerized development environment (works with Docker, Podman, or any container runtime) that automates common tasks and lets you focus on building APEX applications.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/United-Codes/uc-local-apex-dev.git
cd uc-local-apex-dev
./install.sh
```

The installer asks no questions and needs 20 to 40 minutes. Then open
http://localhost:8181/ords/apex. Log in to the `INTERNAL` workspace with the user
`ADMIN`. The password is the `ORACLE_PASSWORD` value from the generated `.env` file.

You need Docker or Podman with the `compose` subcommand, SQLcl in your `PATH`,
`unzip`, and `curl` or `wget`. The container needs 4GB RAM, 3 CPUs, and 35GB of disk
space. For the prerequisites and the details, read the
[Installation Guide](https://www.united-codes.com/products/uc-local-apex-dev/docs/getting-started/).

## Features

Everything is a single command via the `local-26ai.sh` wrapper — run `local-26ai.sh --help` or see the [Command Reference](https://www.united-codes.com/products/uc-local-apex-dev/docs/reference/commands/) for the full list.

**⚠️ This is not for production use!** Intentionally unsecure and optimized for ease of development. Passwords stored in plain text, security features relaxed. For local development only. To host it as a shared **test** database, read [Host as a Test Database](https://www.united-codes.com/products/uc-local-apex-dev/docs/getting-started/host-test-db/).
