## Executive Summary

Digital commerce loses between **3% and 9% of total gross merchandise value (GMV)** to silent, unrecovered payment failures:
- **Involuntary Customer Churn**: Card expiry, UPI network timeouts, and transient bank server outages prematurely terminate high-LTV customer accounts.
- **Dumb Retry Storms**: Inflexible scheduled cron jobs blindly re-attempt failed cards, triggering bank fraud velocity locks and high interchange fee penalties.
- **Fragmented Context**: Merchants cannot differentiate between a recoverable technical glitch (e.g. temporary UPI switch downtime) and an unrecoverable hard decline (e.g. stolen card or closed account).
- **Compliance Blindspots**: Naive customer re-engagement scripts risk breaching customer contact preferences and privacy policies without an immutable audit trail.

**RecoverAI** replaces dumb retry scripts with an **autonomous, safety-governed AI revenue recovery engine**. It detects revenue at risk in real time, diagnoses root causes using Google Gemini, evaluates bounded interventions through a deterministic 5-rule safety engine, safely executes approved workflows, and measures recovered revenue with exact decimal precision.

|   1. AI Recommends.                                                              |
|   2. Deterministic Policy Engine Decides.                                        |
|   3. Bounded Executor Executes ONLY approved, non-destructive actions.           |
|   4. AI NEVER directly charges money, holds card credentials, or bypasses rules. |

## Deterministic Policy Engine (5 Safety Rules)

The Policy Engine serves as the non-negotiable gatekeeper between AI recommendations and execution. Even if an LLM hallucinates an aggressive retry, the Policy Engine strictly enforces:

| Rule ID | Rule Name | Trigger Condition | Intercepted Action | Safety Action / Resolution |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RULE 1** | **Max Retry Cap** | `retryCount >= 3` | `RETRY_PAYMENT` | **Blocked**: Diverts to `HUMAN_ESCALATION` to prevent card issuer fraud flags. |
| **RULE 2** | **High-Value Merchant Guard** | `amount > ₹50,000` | Automated Retries | **Blocked**: Diverts to `HUMAN_ESCALATION` for personalized VIP concierge recovery. |
| **RULE 3** | **Customer Privacy Opt-Out** | `customerOptedOut == true` | `SEND_RECOVERY_MESSAGE` | **Blocked**: Prevents messaging; falls back to `OFFER_ALTERNATE_PAYMENT` or portal notice. |
| **RULE 4** | **Double-Charge Protection** | `payment.status == 'SUCCESS'` | Any recovery action | **Blocked**: Enforces `NO_ACTION` to guarantee zero double-charging. |
| **RULE 5** | **Unknown Failure Investigation** | `failureReason == 'UNKNOWN'` | `RETRY_PAYMENT` | **Blocked**: Diverts to `HUMAN_ESCALATION` to prevent blind retries on unknown errors. |

## Featured Hackathon Demo Scenarios

RecoverAI seeds a deterministic dataset with **5 featured presentation cases** (`CASE-1001` through `CASE-1005`) accessible directly from the interactive top banner in the **Recovery Cases** view:

| Case ID | Scenario Name | Details & Telemetry | Expected End-to-End Flow | Result |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **`CASE-1001`** | **High-Probability Recovery** | ₹2,999 · UPI · 0 retries · Transient timeout | AI recommends WhatsApp link → Policy evaluates **ALLOWED** → Executor recovers 100% | **RECOVERED** (₹2,999) |
| **`CASE-1002`** | **Retry Limit Enforcement** | ₹1,499 · Card · 3 prior retries · Repeated decline | AI recommends retry → Policy Rule 1 detects ≥ 3 retries → **BLOCKED** | **ESCALATED** |
| **`CASE-1003`** | **High-Value Merchant Guard** | ₹75,000 · NetBanking · Exceeds ₹50,000 cap | AI recommends retry → Policy Rule 2 detects cap violation → **BLOCKED** | **ESCALATED** (VIP) |
| **`CASE-1004`** | **Stopping Rules on Failure** | ₹5,999 · UPI · Consecutive execution failures | Executor detects 2nd failure → triggers `AUTOMATIC_RECOVERY_STOPPED` | **STOPPED & ESCALATED** |
| **`CASE-1005`** | **AI Outage Circuit Breaker** | ₹12,500 · Mandate failure · AI service outage | Circuit breaker engages → Structured fallback activates with zero downtime | **SAFE ESCALATION** |

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Telemetry-Driven Failure Intelligence
- Analyzes granular payment telemetry: gateway response codes, card brand/BIN, issuer bank, authentication challenge failures (3D-Secure), and network latency.
- Dynamically assigns **Risk Scores (1–100)** and categorizes transactions into **LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH risk**.

### 2. Multi-Channel Bounded Interventions
- **Smart Retries**: Calculates optimal retry windows to coincide with bank processing clearing cycles.
- **WhatsApp Checkout Links**: Instant, branded pre-filled checkout sessions delivered straight to customer messaging.
- **Alternate Gateway Routing**: Directs users to switch from congested UPI rails to NetBanking or Cards.
- **Human Escalation**: Seamless handoff to finance support teams for high-ticket or complex B2B invoices.

### 3. Batch Recovery Engine (`POST /api/recovery/run-batch`)
- Processes batches of **10, 25, 50, or 100 eligible cases** in an automated, concurrent-safe pipeline.
- Enforces global stopping rules: halts execution if error rates exceed safety thresholds.
- Generates real-time financial summaries: Revenue Recovered, Revenue Attempted, Successful vs. Blocked counts.

### 4. Enterprise Idempotency & Concurrency Guards
- Every recovery request requires an idempotent key or case reference.
- Duplicate execution requests on already recovered transactions are rejected with **HTTP 409 Conflict** and code `ALREADY_PROCESSED`.

### 5. AI Circuit Breaker & Graceful Degradation
- If Google Gemini API is unreachable, times out, or encounters rate limits, RecoverAI triggers an internal circuit breaker.
- The system automatically engages a **deterministic, rule-based diagnostic fallback** to ensure 100% platform availability.

## Mathematical Precision & Financial Metrics

RecoverAI eliminates floating-point rounding errors across all monetary calculations by computing aggregates using [Decimal.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/decimal.js) with 2-decimal fractional precision.

### 1. Revenue At Risk
The total monetary value of payments currently in an uncollected or at-risk failure state:

```text
Revenue At Risk = ∑ Amount(p)  for all p ∈ { FAILED, ABANDONED, SUBSCRIPTION_FAILED }
```

### 2. Revenue Attempted
The total monetary sum of payments where active recovery interventions have been initiated:

```text
Revenue Attempted = ∑ Amount(p)  for all p with active recovery execution
```

### 3. Revenue Recovered
The verified monetary sum of payments successfully resolved and credited via RecoverAI:

```text
Revenue Recovered = ∑ Amount(p)  for all cases where status = RECOVERED
```

### 4. Revenue Not Recovered
The remaining unrecovered balance across all unresolvable, failed, or blocked transactions:

```text
Revenue Not Recovered = Revenue At Risk - Revenue Recovered
```

### 5. Net Recovery Rate (%)
The definitive recovery efficiency metric of the merchant's payment pipeline:

```text
                       Revenue Recovered
Net Recovery Rate (%) = ───────────────── × 100
                        Revenue At Risk
```

> **Financial Precision Guarantee**: All database amounts are stored in PostgreSQL as `DECIMAL(12, 2)`. All arithmetic operations in Node.js utilize `Decimal.add()`, `Decimal.sub()`, `Decimal.mul()`, and `Decimal.div()` to ensure zero floating-point drift across enterprise transaction volumes.

---

## Interactive Dashboard & Analytics

The RecoverAI user interface includes:
- **Executive Metric Cards**: Real-time display of Revenue at Risk, Revenue Recovered, Net Recovery Rate, and Active Interventions.
- **Interactive Recovery Performance Chart**: Visualizes recovery trends, success rates, and attempted volumes over time.
- **Revenue by Failure Reason Breakdown**: Highlights top financial loss categories (e.g., Insufficient Funds, Technical Glitches, Network Timeouts, Mandate Failures).
- **Risk Level Distribution Chart**: Breakdown of exposure across LOW, MEDIUM, and HIGH risk categories.
- **Strategy Performance Matrix**: Quantifies ROI and conversion rates across WhatsApp Links, Smart Retries, and Alternate Gateways.
- **Conversion Funnel Visualization**: End-to-end telemetry from Payment Failure → Risk Evaluated → AI Diagnosed → Policy Approved → Action Executed → Revenue Recovered.
- **Interactive Modals**: One-click **"Run Recovery Batch"** and **"Reset Demo Environment"** controls directly accessible on the dashboard.
