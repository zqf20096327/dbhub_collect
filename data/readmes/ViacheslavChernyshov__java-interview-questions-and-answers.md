# Java Interview Questions and Answers

> **500+ Java interview questions and answers** for **Junior, Middle, and Senior Java backend developers**.
> Covers **Spring Boot, Hibernate / JPA, SQL, PostgreSQL, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, Collections, Concurrency, Stream API, REST / HTTP, JVM memory, design patterns, transactions, microservices**, and other high-frequency backend interview topics.

This repository is built as a **practical Java backend interview preparation system**, not a random dump of prompts. It combines broad topic coverage, layered explanations, multilingual access, and search-friendly landing pages so you can revise fundamentals fast and still go deep where strong interviews usually get difficult.

## Why This Repository Stands Out

- Covers the most common Java backend interview topics in one place instead of scattering them across separate notes
- Organizes questions by topic, so the repository works both as a roadmap and as a fast reference
- Keeps every answer structured by level, from fundamentals to senior-level depth
- Includes English, Russian, and Ukrainian public versions for easier study and wider reach
- Adds GitHub Pages topic hubs for faster browsing, better internal linking, and stronger search visibility

## Who This Helps

- Java developers preparing for Junior, Middle, or Senior backend interviews
- Engineers refreshing Spring Boot, JPA, SQL, Kafka, concurrency, or JVM internals
- Mentors building structured interview-prep roadmaps for teammates
- Candidates who prefer topic-by-topic repetition instead of scattered cheat sheets

## Coverage Snapshot

- **Core Java:** collections, HashMap, String, exceptions, Stream API, records, generics, immutability
- **JVM internals:** memory, garbage collection, object lifetime, reachability, GC tooling
- **Spring ecosystem:** DI, beans, proxies, AOP, transactions, Spring Boot internals
- **Data layer:** SQL, PostgreSQL, indexes, MVCC, Hibernate, JPA, locking
- **Distributed backend:** Kafka, microservices, retries, resilience, observability
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, health checks, configuration, rollout basics

## How to Use This Repository

- Pick one topic cluster that matches the role you are targeting, for example Spring Boot, SQL, Kafka, or Concurrency
- Start from the answer library on the site or from the section navigator in GitHub, then move in order because many questions build on previous ones
- Use the three-layer answer structure to calibrate how deep your own answer should sound in interviews
- Switch between English, Russian, and Ukrainian versions depending on study comfort or publishing needs
