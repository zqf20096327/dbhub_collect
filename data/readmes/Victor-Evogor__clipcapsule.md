**ClipCapsule** is a minimalist clipboard manager for Linux, built with **Go** and **WailsJS**. It supercharges your productivity by allowing you to manage and switch clipboard entries using only keyboard shortcuts—no mouse or GUI required.

> ⚠️ This is a **work-in-progress** project. Currently, the GUI must be open for shortcuts to work, but we're actively working on a background daemon to make the app run seamlessly without launching the interface.

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 **Keyboard-first Workflow**: Switch clipboard items instantly with `CTRL + SHIFT + 1~9`.
- 📜 **Clipboard History**: Automatically saves your recent copies in an embedded database.
- 🔄 **Dynamic Reordering**: Selecting an item with a shortcut moves it to the top of the stack.
- 🔐 **Local-Only**: Your data stays on your machine, no cloud syncing or telemetry.

## 🖥️ Example Use

When you copy items, the database stores them like this:

| text       | pos |
|------------|-----|
| item1text  | 1   |
| item2text  | 2   |
| item3text  | 3   |
| item4text  | 4   |
| item5text  | 5   |
| ...        | ... |

- The item at `pos = 1` is the active clipboard item (what gets pasted on `CTRL + V`).
- Pressing `CTRL + SHIFT + 3`:
  - Moves `item3text` to position 1.
  - Reorders the rest accordingly.

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone  https://github.com/Victor-Evogor/clipcapsule.git
cd clipcapsule
```

### 2. Install Wails

Follow instructions from the [Wails documentation](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation).

### 3. Build the application

You'll need to build with elevated privileges to allow the app to listen for global key events:

```bash
sudo wails build
```

> 🛑 Alternatively, give your user access to the keyboard input device path (e.g. `/dev/input/eventX`) by adding appropriate udev rules or group permissions.

Example (for testing):
```bash
sudo chmod a+r /dev/input/eventX
```

(Replace `/dev/input/eventX` with your actual keyboard event device.)

> ⚠️ A proper fix for permissions will be added soon. For now, elevated privileges or manual access setup is required.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut             | Action                                      |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `CTRL + V`           | Paste current top clipboard entry           |
| `CTRL + SHIFT + 1-9` | Move selected item to the top of the stack |

## 🛠️ Development

- Frontend: Wails + JS/TS (see `frontend/`)
- Backend: Go 
- Clipboard access and keyboard interception handled natively

## 🚧 Roadmap

- [x] Core clipboard logic
- [x] Keyboard shortcut mapping
- [X] Clipboard preview UI
- [ ] Daemon mode (run in background without GUI)
- [ ] Tray icon & preferences
- [ ] Configurable shortcuts
- [ ] Exclude sensitive entries (e.g., passwords)

---

## 🐞 Known Issues

- You need to run the app as `sudo` or manually allow access to keyboard input devices.
- No daemon yet — GUI must be open for shortcuts to work.
