REKOS is a terminal-native passive OSINT CLI for local-first public-source investigation workspaces. It helps organize targets, evidence, source outputs, entities, relationships, normalized findings, and correlation-quality scores in a SQLite-backed case folder.

REKOS is designed for passive public-source workflows:

- Public-source investigation workspace
- Target and evidence organizer
- Username, profile, domain, URL, and indicator correlation tool
- Local-first OSINT case workspace
- No login automation, bypass, credential collection, or active exploitation

A case is a local workspace for one public-source research thread. Cases are stored under `~/rekos_cases/<case_name>` by default. Each case keeps its own SQLite database, source outputs, evidence artifacts, graph records, findings, and exports.

## Installation

REKOS requires Python >=3.10. Python 3.12 is recommended.

### Windows PowerShell

Install:

```powershell
py -m pip install --upgrade rekos
```

Run:

```powershell
rekos
```

Uninstall:

```powershell
py -m pip uninstall -y rekos
```

### macOS / Linux

Install:

```bash
pipx install rekos --python python3.12
```

Run:

```bash
rekos
```

Uninstall:

```bash
pipx uninstall rekos
```

If your default Python is already >=3.10:

```bash
pipx install rekos
```

### Latest version from GitHub

Use this only if you need fixes that are already on GitHub but not yet published on PyPI.

#### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
py -m pip uninstall -y rekos
py -m pip install --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/VladTepes84/Rekos.git
```

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
python3 -m pip uninstall -y rekos
python3 -m pip install --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/VladTepes84/Rekos.git
```

### If the `rekos` command is not found

#### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
py -m pip show rekos
py -m rekos version
```

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
python3 -m pip show rekos
python3 -m rekos version
```

Run `rekos` with no arguments to open the quickstart screen.

Users run REKOS commands such as `rekos investigate username <case> <username>` and `rekos investigate domain <case> <domain>`. REKOS calls available passive sources through its source adapters and continues cleanly when optional external tools are absent.

### Local development install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VladTepes84/Rekos.git
cd Rekos
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
rekos
```

## Optional Integrations

- `sherlock` enables the `sherlock_username` source when the `sherlock` command is installed
- `maigret` enables the `maigret_username` source when available in the REKOS runtime
- `exiftool` or `mediainfo` for file metadata collection
- Playwright is optional for URL screenshots; HTTP snapshots still work without it

Users always run `rekos`, not Sherlock or Maigret directly. `rekos investigate username <case> <username>` automatically uses the username sources available in the current environment.

## Why Rekos Exists

Rekos is not trying to replace tools like Sherlock, Maigret, or theHarvester.

The goal is to provide a lightweight passive OSINT workflow with case-oriented investigations instead of isolated lookups and disconnected outputs.

Rekos focuses on:
- local-first investigations
- passive public-source workflows
- normalized findings
- relationship tracking
- evidence organization
- CLI-native workflows

The project intentionally avoids:
- active exploitation
- authenticated automation
- breached datasets
- aggressive crawling
- AI-generated investigation claims

## Quick Start

```bash
rekos new-case social_test
rekos investigate username social_test username
rekos investigate email social_test alice@example.com
rekos enrich email social_test alice@example.com
rekos check-breach social_test alice@example.com
rekos findings social_test
rekos findings social_test --verbose
rekos score social_test
rekos graph-summary social_test
rekos export-case social_test --output social_test.zip
```

Normal workflow:

1. Create a case with `rekos new-case`.
2. Add or investigate a target with `rekos investigate username`, `rekos investigate email`, `rekos investigate domain`, or `rekos snapshot-url`.
3. Review normalized results with `rekos findings`.
4. Score correlation quality with `rekos score`.
5. Inspect relationships with `rekos graph-summary` or `rekos list-entities`.
6. Export the workspace with `rekos export-case`.

Most users only need these commands:

```bash
rekos
rekos new-case acme-osint
rekos investigate username acme-osint alice.example
rekos investigate email acme-osint alice@example.com
rekos enrich email acme-osint alice@example.com
rekos check-breach acme-osint alice@example.com
rekos investigate domain acme-osint example.com
rekos snapshot-url acme-osint https://example.com/profile/alice
rekos findings acme-osint
rekos findings acme-osint --verbose
rekos score acme-osint
rekos search acme-osint example.com
rekos graph-summary acme-osint
rekos export-case acme-osint --output ./acme-osint.zip
```

Use `rekos findings <case> --verbose` for grouped analyst detail. Add `--show-uuids` only when full finding IDs are needed.

Users run only `rekos`. Sherlock and Maigret are optional integrations that REKOS orchestrates internally when available.

During `rekos investigate username <case> <username>`, REKOS generates safe username variants, runs available passive username sources, stores raw source output, normalizes discovered profile URLs into findings, updates the entity graph, records timeline events, and computes correlation-quality scores. Results are correlation indicators, not proof of identity ownership.

During `rekos investigate domain <case> <domain>`, REKOS runs passive DNS, RDAP with registry/WHOIS fallback, HTTP/HTTPS endpoint checks, TLS certificate metadata collection, and crt.sh certificate transparency lookup when available. It records registration evidence, DNS records, web endpoint metadata, redirects, TLS certificate summaries, SPF/mail-security summaries, provider hints from TXT records, and certificate transparency findings.

During `rekos investigate email <case> <email>`, REKOS validates and normalizes the address, extracts the domain, checks passive public DNS MX/SPF/DMARC records, records provider hints, and stores a local Gravatar MD5 hash without checking account existence.

Use `rekos enrich email <case> <email>` for optional passive enrichment such as unverified username candidates derived from the local-part and public Gravatar avatar metadata. Use `rekos check-breach <case> <email>` for passive breach exposure status: REKOS checks XposedOrNot without an API key and can additionally query Have I Been Pwned when `REKOS_HIBP_API_KEY` is configured. It records exposure metadata only and does not collect passwords or credential material.

Domain, URL, and snapshot workflows reject localhost, private/internal IP ranges, link-local addresses, metadata-service IPs, reserved, multicast, and unspecified IP targets. REKOS is for public-source targets only.

## How REKOS Works

- Target input: user-provided usernames, domains, URLs, files, notes, and indicators are stored in a local case.
- Source orchestration: REKOS runs passive adapters such as username sources, DNS, RDAP/WHOIS fallback, web/TLS checks, crt.sh, Wayback, metadata tools, and HTTP snapshots when available.
- Findings normalization: raw source output is converted into normalized findings such as discovered profiles, URLs, domains, metadata records, archive records, and registration records.
- Graph correlation: entities and relationships connect usernames, profiles, domains, URLs, files, and notes.
- Quality scoring: REKOS scores correlation quality from source confidence, exact or normalized matches, duplicate source confirmation, evidence presence, and graph relationships.
- Evidence export: raw outputs, artifacts, reports, SQLite data, and manifests can be exported with `rekos export-case`.

The project intentionally avoids:

## Passive Sources And APIs

REKOS uses only passive public-source integrations.

Current integrations include:
- Sherlock
- Maigret
- public RDAP services
- public DNS resolution
- crt.sh certificate transparency data
- Wayback Machine CDX API
- passive HTTP/TLS metadata collection

REKOS does not use:
- private breached credential datasets or password material
- private leaks
- authenticated scraping
- account automation
- active exploitation techniques

Optional breach exposure checks use legitimate public APIs such as XposedOrNot and Have I Been Pwned. XposedOrNot provides the default free breached/not-breached status; HIBP is used only when the user provides an API key. REKOS records exposure metadata only and does not collect passwords, credential material, or account ownership claims.

## Safety And Ethics

REKOS is passive-only OSINT tooling. Use it only for lawful, authorized, and ethical public-source research.

REKOS must not be used for:

- Logging into accounts or automating authenticated sessions
- Bypassing access controls, paywalls, CAPTCHAs, bot protection, or rate limits
- Credential collection, phishing, account abuse, or social engineering
- SMTP probing, password reset checks, breach checks, or account existence claims
- Exploitation, destructive operations, or aggressive crawling
- Claiming identity ownership from correlation results

Scores are correlation-quality indicators only. A high score means stronger local correlation support, not proof of identity, ownership, compromise, or intent.

## Local Data Model

REKOS stores:

- Case metadata in SQLite
- Targets, entities, relationships, notes, timeline events
- Raw source outputs under `exports/`
- Evidence and snapshot artifacts
- Normalized findings with correlation-quality scores
- Case ZIP exports with manifest data

## Development

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
rekos --help
```

Before submitting a change:

```bash
pytest
python -m compileall rekos
git diff --check
```

## Roadmap

- More passive source adapters with explicit safety boundaries
- Stronger report templates and case export validation
- Improved graph summaries and finding explainability
- Better import/export interoperability
- Optional UI views while keeping the CLI and local-first storage as the core
