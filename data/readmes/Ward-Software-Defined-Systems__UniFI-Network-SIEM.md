A self-contained, **AI-powered** Node.js application that collects syslog from UniFi consoles and gateways, parses all event types, stores them in SQLite (or OpenSearch/WardSONDB), and serves a real-time security dashboard with built-in AI threat hunting.

> **📊 Backend Recommendation for Scale:** Both **OpenSearch** and **SQLite** are production-ready at scale. OpenSearch uses native aggregations (`date_histogram`, `terms`, `cardinality`) for sub-second dashboard queries. SQLite uses five materialized rollup tables updated atomically on insert plus a dedicated stats worker thread, tested stable at 8M+ events. **WardSONDB** mirrors SQLite's rollup pattern (daily event partitions + five rollup collections) and is running live at 12M+ events — optimizations are still being iterated on and tested, so treat it as Beta for now. See [Using OpenSearch Backend](#using-opensearch-backend-optional) below to get started.

## Features

- **Syslog collector** — UDP listener for UniFi Traffic Logging and Activity Logging (CEF)
- **11 event type parsers** — firewall, threat, DHCP, DNS, DNS filter (CoreDNS ad-block), Wi-Fi, admin, device, client, VPN, system
- **Real-time live stream** — WebSocket-powered event table with type/action badges, search, and pause
- **Dashboard** — stats cards, event timeline chart, top blocked, top threats, top ports, top clients, top sources, top destinations; progressive loading with progress bar
- **Live Map** — Leaflet-based world map showing geo-enriched traffic with color-coded markers (normal/blocked/threat), flow lines, and stats overlay
- **Refresh controls** — Dashboard, Live Map, and Threat Intel all include manual refresh, pause/resume, and selectable auto-refresh rates (1m, 2m, 5m). Defaults to paused to reduce load on large datasets — especially useful with remote database backends (e.g., WardSONDB over VPN) where concurrent queries can be expensive
- **GeoIP & threat enrichment** — MaxMind GeoLite2 for geolocation, AbuseIPDB for threat scoring, reverse DNS — all async with caching
- **Country flags & abuse badges** — 🇺🇸 emoji flags with country codes on external IPs; color-coded abuse score badges across all views
- **Threat Intel** — sortable/filterable table of enriched IPs with abuse scores, event counts, and locations; period-filtered summary cards alongside all-time totals
- **Threat Hunt (Beta)** — AI-powered threat actor investigation with SSE streaming. Enter any IP and choose a time window (`1h / 6h / 24h / 7d / 30d`) — the same period selector used by Dashboard / Live Map / Threat Intel — and every local-intel query is scoped to that window. Returns a full profile: local SIEM activity (events, ports, timeline, IDS signatures, related /24 IPs), external intel (rDNS, WHOIS/ASN), and a structured AI threat assessment streamed token-by-token with PDF export. Supports Anthropic (Opus 4.8 with adaptive thinking at max effort, 128K output), OpenAI (GPT-5.4, 128K output), and Google (Gemini 3.1 Pro, 65K output) with on-page API key management. *Currently tested with Anthropic only — OpenAI and Google integrations are implemented but untested.*
- **HTTPS by default** — auto-generated self-signed TLS certificate
- **Pluggable storage backends** — SQLite (built-in default), WardSONDB (Beta), OpenSearch (Beta). OpenSearch runs via Docker with native aggregations (no rollup tables), batched enrichment backfill with `update_by_query`, and full Threat Hunt support. WardSONDB runs remotely over HTTPS with a per-client undici dispatcher for connect-timeout tuning
- **SQLite storage** — WAL mode, batched inserts, automatic retention cleanup, worker thread enrichment. Materialized rollup tables (event_stats_5m, ip/port/sig/client_stats_hourly) are updated atomically on insert for sub-second dashboard stats at scale (tested to 8M+ events). A dedicated stats worker thread keeps the event loop responsive during queries. Existing databases self-heal on restart: legacy indexes are automatically dropped and replaced with optimized compound indexes, and rollup tables are backfilled from existing events on first upgrade
- **WardSONDB storage** — daily event partitions (`events-YYYY-MM-DD`) with partition-drop retention (no `_delete_by_query` on event data), five pre-aggregated rollup collections matching SQLite's schemas exactly (`rollups-5m`, `rollups-ip-hourly`, `rollups-port-hourly`, `rollups-sig-hourly`, `rollups-client-hourly`). Phase 10 replaced the original read-then-PATCH flush with append-only `_bulk` deltas — each 5s flush emits new docs (`delta: true`) and a 30-minute compaction job folds older deltas into a canonical doc (`delta: false`). Dashboard stats, Live Map, and Threat Intel all query rollups exclusively; Threat Hunt fans out across the partitions overlapping the selected period with per-partition result merging. Running live at 12M+ events
- **Zero external services** — everything runs in one process

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js v22 LTS** — pinned via `.nvmrc`, so `nvm use` (or `fnm use` / `nodenv local`) will pick the right version automatically
- **C++ build toolchain** for `better-sqlite3`'s native build:
  - macOS: `xcode-select --install`
  - Debian / Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install build-essential python3`
  - Windows: Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools with the "Desktop development with C++" workload
- macOS, Linux, or Windows

### Install

```bash
# Backend
npm install

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env if needed (defaults work for most setups)

# Optional but recommended: download MaxMind GeoLite2-City.mmdb to ./data/
# Live Map and Threat Intel need this to populate geo data — see "Enrichment Setup" below
```

### Run

```bash
# Production (serves built frontend)
cd frontend && npm run build && cd ..
npm start

# Development (two terminals)
npm run dev          # Backend with auto-reload (port 3000)
cd frontend && npm run dev   # Vite HMR (port 5173)
```

Open https://localhost:3000 in your browser. Accept the self-signed certificate warning on first visit.

### Using OpenSearch Backend (Optional)

```bash
# Start OpenSearch via Docker (HTTPS + self-signed cert, 4GB heap)
./docker/opensearch/start.sh

# Start SIEM with OpenSearch env vars
OPENSEARCH_HOST=localhost OPENSEARCH_PORT=9200 \
OPENSEARCH_USERNAME=admin OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD='S!em_Secure9200' \
OPENSEARCH_USE_TLS=true OPENSEARCH_VERIFY_CERTS=false \
npm run dev
```

Or select OpenSearch from Settings > Database Engine in the web UI and restart. Configuration is persisted — env vars are only needed for initial setup.

### Test with fake syslog

```bash
node scripts/test-syslog.js
# Sends 10 msgs/sec by default. Set RATE=100 for more volume.
```

## UniFi Console Configuration

For full functionality, three logging sources on the UniFi Console should be configured. All share the same UDP port — the parser auto-detects the format.

### Source 1: Traffic Logging / Syslog (firewall, IDS, DHCP, Wi-Fi)

1. **Settings > Policy Engine** — for each firewall rule, Edit > Advanced > **Enable Syslog Logging**

> ⚠️ **Important**: This must be enabled on **every firewall rule** you want to monitor — including WAN IN/OUT and inter-VLAN rules. Rules without syslog enabled will pass/drop traffic silently with no log sent. This is the most commonly missed step and will result in missing events (especially external IP traffic needed for the Live Map and Threat Intel).

2. **Settings > CyberSecure > Traffic Logging**:
   - Flow Logging: **All Traffic** (or Blocked Only for less volume)
   - Activity Logging (Syslog): Enable **SIEM Server**
   - Server Address: `<your-machine-ip>`
   - Port: `5514`
   - Categories: Enable all desired (Firewall Default Policy, Security Detections, etc.)

### Source 2: Activity Logging / CEF (admin, device, client events)

1. **Settings > Control Plane > Integrations > Activity Logging**:
   - Enable **SIEM Server**
   - Server Address: `<your-machine-ip>`
   - Port: `5514`
   - Categories: Enable Clients, Devices, Security Detections, Triggers, VPN, Critical

### Source 3: Debug Logs (detailed DHCP, system processes)

1. **Settings > CyberSecure > Traffic Logging**:
   - Enable **Debug Logs**
   - This enables detailed `dnsmasq-dhcp` lease events, `ubios-udapi-server` messages, and other system process logs from the gateway
   - Without this, DHCP events and many system-level messages won't be forwarded

### Source 4: Netconsole (kernel-level logging)

1. **Settings > CyberSecure > Traffic Logging**:
   - Enable **Netconsole**
   - Server Address: `<your-machine-ip>`
   - Port: `5514`
   - Provides kernel-level messages including firewall rule hits and low-level network events

> **Note**: All four sources can point to the same IP and port. The parser auto-detects CEF, iptables, CoreDNS JSON, hostapd, dnsmasq, and other formats automatically.

## Event Types

| `vpn` | CEF / Traffic Logging | VPN tunnel up/down events |
| `system` | Either | Catch-all for unclassified messages |

## Configuration

Operator settings live in the SQLite database and are managed via the **Settings** view in the dashboard. `.env` is the bootstrap layer only — it carries the handful of values needed before the database is open, plus optional headless/CI overrides for the auth token and master key.

### Bootstrap (`.env`)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DB_PATH` | `./data/events.db` | SQLite database path. Required before the DB is open. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Logging level. Required for boot-time logs. |
| `HTTP_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | HTTPS bind address. Set to your LAN IP or `0.0.0.0` for remote dashboard access. |
| `SIEM_API_TOKEN` | *(auto-generated)* | API/WebSocket auth token. Auto-generated and logged once on first run if unset. Required for `/api` and `/ws` auth (Phase 3+). |
| `SIEM_MASTER_KEY` | *(auto-generated)* | 64 hex chars (32 bytes). Decrypts sensitive settings at rest (AES-256-GCM). Auto-generated and logged once on first run if unset. |

### First-run seeding (optional)

Any setting that has an `envVar` in the schema can be pre-populated on first run by setting it in `.env`. After the first run the value is in the DB and `.env` becomes inert for that key — edit through the Settings UI thereafter. See `.env.example` for the full list of seedable env vars.

### Settings UI

All other settings (syslog port, retention, AbuseIPDB key, WardSONDB tunables, OpenSearch credentials, Threat Hunt model + max tokens, HTTPS timeouts, health debounce, etc.) are configurable in **Settings → Operator Settings**, grouped by category. Sensitive values (API keys, passwords, tokens) are encrypted at rest with the master key and shown masked in the UI.

> **⚠️ Important:** Settings and configuration are always stored in the local SQLite database (`data/events.db`), regardless of which storage backend is active. Do not delete this file even when using WardSONDB or OpenSearch — it contains your backend configuration, API keys, and other settings needed to boot the application. Changing the storage backend requires a SIEM restart to take effect.

> **WardSONDB query timeouts:** Query duration is controlled by WardSONDB's server-side `--query-timeout` flag (default 30s). For large datasets or Threat Hunt queries, launch WardSONDB with `--query-timeout 120` or higher. By default the SIEM has no client-side query timeout — this is intentional. If you need to override per-request (e.g. unreliable network, long-running server-side queries you want to cap), set `WARDSONDB_QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS` in `.env` as an escape hatch.

> **Recommended WardSONDB launch flags (NEW-P9):** for production SIEM workloads. The bitmap-fields list below reflects what the reference deployment is actually running — every entry has been validated against real query patterns. `delta` is appended for the Phase 10 rollup model (see notes).
>
> ```bash
> ulimit -n 65536 && wardsondb \
>   --storage-engine rocksdb \
>   --bitmap-fields "event_type,network.action,severity,network.protocol,source_format,is_private,geo_country,geo_city,network.direction,direction,ids.classification,classification,hostname,wifi.action,bucket,protocol,delta" \
>   --query-timeout 120
> ```
>
> Notes:
> - `--storage-engine` is required (no default). Pick `rocksdb` for the SIEM's read-heavy + steady-write workload.
> - `--bitmap-fields` is a single comma-separated list. Some entries are dotted (`network.action`, `ids.classification`) for the nested event-document fields; others are flat (`is_private`, `geo_country`, `bucket`) because they live on the cache or rollup collections. Bitmap accelerates equality filters on low-cardinality fields up to `--bitmap-max-cardinality` (default 1000) — fields that exceed the cap are auto-disabled, so leaving extra entries is harmless.
> - `delta` is a field that Phase 10's append-only rollup model writes onto every flushed delta document (`delta: true`) and onto canonical docs from compaction (`delta: false`). Compaction filters on `{ bucket, delta: true }` to identify docs to delete after the canonical is written. **This works correctly whether or not `delta` is in `--bitmap-fields`** — the field is in `--bitmap-fields` here as a likely perf hint (cardinality 2, well under the cap, doesn't burn a useful slot). Whether bitmap actually accelerates the boolean filter vs the existing `bucket` bitmap pruning is unverified — measure `duration_ms` on `_delete_by_query` to confirm before/after.
> - `--query-timeout 120` covers Threat Hunt fan-out across many partitions; the default 30s isn't enough for multi-partition aggregations.
> - `ulimit -n 65536` is required per the `--help` "FILE DESCRIPTORS" notice — defaults are 256 (macOS) / 1024 (Linux), too low for production.
>
> Other flags worth tuning at scale (defaults shown): `--cache-size-mb 64`, `--write-buffer-mb 64`, `--memtable-mb 8`, `--flush-workers 2`, `--compaction-workers 2`, `--bitmap-max-cardinality 1000`. Increase memory-related flags proportionally to available RAM if you see disk read pressure or compaction lag.
>
> **Phase 10 rollup model:** rollup writes are now append-only via `/{col}/docs/_bulk`. Each flush emits delta documents tagged `delta: true` with deterministic `_id = ${bucket}|${keys}|${flushId}`. A 30-minute compaction job folds delta docs older than 1h into a single canonical doc per `(bucket, keys)` (`_id = ...|c`, `delta: false`) and `_delete_by_query` removes the deltas. Queries (`$group + $sum`) are unchanged — they correctly sum across deltas + canonical regardless of compaction state.

> **OpenSearch native rollup jobs (Phase 11A — H10):** the OpenSearch backend now creates five continuous rollup jobs on startup — `siem-rollup-{5m,ip-hourly,port-hourly,sig-hourly,client-hourly}` — paralleling SQLite's rollup tables and feeding the Index Management plugin's server-side rollup engine. New ingest is rolled up automatically every 5 minutes (60s delay buffer for late-arriving events). **Continuous rollup jobs do not backfill data that existed before they were created** — rollup indexes accumulate forward-only. Until enough history has accumulated for your longest dashboard window, the SIEM continues serving stats from raw `siem-events`; the speed-up landings as a follow-up (Phase 11B). Inspect a job's progress with `GET /_plugins/_rollup/jobs/<id>/_explain`; pause one with `POST /_plugins/_rollup/jobs/<id>/_stop`.

## Enrichment Setup (Optional)

### GeoIP (enables Live Map)

1. Sign up at [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup) (free)
2. Download `GeoLite2-City.mmdb`
3. Place in `./data/GeoLite2-City.mmdb`

### AbuseIPDB (threat scoring)

1. Get a free API key at [abuseipdb.com](https://www.abuseipdb.com) (1000 lookups/day)
2. Set `ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY` in `.env`, or save via the Settings page (no restart needed)
3. If the daily limit is reached, lookups automatically back off for 1 hour

## Security

The app runs HTTPS by default with an auto-generated self-signed certificate. Below are remaining security considerations.

| Concern | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Single shared API token | **Low** | The web UI, REST API, and WebSocket are bearer-token gated (Phase 3). The token is auto-generated on first run and logged once to the console — copy it to log in via the browser TokenGate or send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on API calls. It's a single shared token (no per-user accounts or RBAC) and can be rotated via Settings or by setting `SIEM_API_TOKEN`. For multi-user or internet-exposed deployments, put a reverse proxy (nginx/Caddy basic auth, OAuth2 proxy, mTLS) in front of port 3000. |
| Syslog spoofing | **Low** | UDP has no authentication by design — a device on your LAN could send crafted syslog to inject fake events. Mitigations available: set `SYSLOG_ALLOWED_SOURCES` to a CIDR allowlist (Phase 3B) so the listener drops packets from anywhere outside; the listener also has a per-source rate cap to limit a single misbehaving sender. Without an allowlist, any host on the broadcast domain can submit events. |
| TLS certificate trust | **Info** | The self-signed certificate will trigger browser warnings. For production, replace `data/server.key` and `data/server.cert` with certs from a trusted CA or your own internal CA. |

**Known advisories:** none. As of 2026-06-14, `npm audit` reports **0 vulnerabilities** in both the backend and frontend trees. The previously-residual dev-only esbuild advisory ([GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99) — Vite dev server / Vitest runner only; production builds and `npm start` were never affected) was cleared by the Vite 5 → 8 + Vitest 2 → 4 upgrade, and the runtime `ws` / `qs` advisories were patched in-range. The remaining dependency majors (`recharts`, `tailwindcss`, React 19 + `react-leaflet`, `express`) carry no open advisory.

**Already mitigated:**
- **API + WebSocket authentication** — bearer-token middleware on every `/api/*` route; WebSocket validates the same token via `?token=` query at upgrade time; frontend `TokenGate.jsx` login screen + global fetch wrapper. The reset-DB endpoint sits behind this same gate (Phase 3). The fetch wrapper scopes the `Authorization` header to **same-origin `/api/`** requests only, so the token is never attached to cross-origin URLs (e.g. map-tile CDNs)
- **Sensitive settings at rest** — AbuseIPDB / Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini keys, OpenSearch password, etc. are AES-256-GCM-encrypted in the SQLite settings table (`v1:iv:tag:ct` envelope). Master key auto-generated on first run, logged once, rotatable via Settings (Phase 2)
- **Default localhost bind** — `HTTP_HOST` defaults to `127.0.0.1`; the server is reachable only from the host until you explicitly set a LAN IP or `0.0.0.0`
- **Request body limit** — `express.json({ limit: '64kb' })` caps API request bodies; Helmet sets a CSP scoped for OSM/CartoDB tiles + `wss:`
- **LLM prompt-injection defense** — every attacker-influenceable Threat Hunt field (IDS signature, hostname, geo_country, whois fields) is wrapped in `<untrusted>...</untrusted>` after control-char strip + 256-char truncation + closing-tag entity-escape; system prompt sent via the elevated-trust channel of each provider (Phase 13)
- **LLM output rendering** — markdown rendered via `marked` + `DOMPurify` with `ALLOWED_TAGS` restricted to formatting + lists; no attributes, no `<a>`, no `<img>`. PDF export escapes operator-supplied interpolated values (Phase 13)
- **SQL injection** — all queries use parameterized prepared statements. The `getTimeline()` strftime format string is derived from a fixed internal lookup (not from caller input), eliminating the previous injection surface
- **XSS** — React auto-escapes all rendered content including untrusted syslog data
- **API key exposure** — sensitive keys are redacted to last 4 chars in API responses; writes containing the U+2022 mask sentinel are rejected and the Settings UI seeds sensitive fields empty, so a masked echo can't overwrite a stored secret
- **Transport security** — HTTPS/WSS enabled by default with auto-generated TLS certificate
- **Parser crashes** — all parsers wrapped in try/catch with fallback to system parser
- **AbuseIPDB rate limits** — automatic 1-hour backoff when daily limit is reached

## Known Issues

| Issue | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| AbuseIPDB scores not populating | **Fixed** | AbuseIPDB API field name was `abuseConfidenceScore` but code referenced `abuseConfidencePercentage` — scores were always `null`. Fixed in commit `11607e4`. Also added re-queue logic for cached IPs missing abuse scores. |
| Database reset pegs CPU on large datasets | **Fixed** | Using "Initialize Database" previously ran `DELETE` + `VACUUM` on millions of rows, pegging CPU at 100% for 10+ minutes. Fixed by switching to `DROP TABLE` + schema recreate, which is instant regardless of database size. Fixed in commit `11607e4`. |
| Enrichment backfill pegs CPU at 100% | **Fixed** | Backfill UPDATE queries blocked the main Node.js event loop via synchronous `better-sqlite3` calls, sustaining 99% CPU for 4+ hours. Fixed by moving all enrichment UPDATEs to a dedicated `worker_threads` Worker with its own DB connection. Backfill of 6,600+ IPs now completes in ~1.5 minutes with 0% main thread CPU. Fixed in commit `ca0f8ea`. |

## Roadmap

- [x] Abuse score badges on IPs in tables
- [x] Country flags on external IPs
- [x] Threat Hunting view — AI-powered investigation with SSE streaming, adaptive thinking (Anthropic), 128K token output, and structured threat assessments with PDF export
- [ ] CSV export
- [ ] Dark/light mode toggle
- [x] Performance optimization — enrichment backfill moved to worker thread for non-blocking operation
- [x] Storage backend abstraction — pluggable database engine (SQLite, WardSONDB, OpenSearch) selectable from Settings
- [x] WardSONDB integration — high-performance Rust-based JSON document database with deferred index creation and write pressure detection
- [x] OpenSearch integration — distributed search/analytics engine via Docker with native aggregations, batched enrichment backfill, and full Threat Hunt support
- [x] Query performance optimization — bitmap scan acceleration and compound range scans via WardSONDB, running live at 12M+ events
- [x] WardSONDB scale optimization — daily event partitioning with partition-drop retention and five pre-aggregated rollup collections mirroring SQLite's schema, flushed every 5 seconds. Threat Hunt queries fan out across the partitions overlapping the selected period
- [ ] launchd plist for macOS auto-start
