## Quick Start Guide

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wave-RF/WaveHouse.git && cd WaveHouse
docker compose -f deployments/compose/standalone.yaml up -d
```

The in-repo compose spins up WaveHouse and ClickHouse. Then, create a table (or import your existing schema):

```bash
docker compose -f deployments/compose/standalone.yaml exec clickhouse \
  clickhouse-client --query "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS events (kind String, user String, received_timestamp DateTime64(3,'UTC') DEFAULT now64(3,'UTC')) ENGINE=MergeTree ORDER BY kind"
```

Then, stream live events in one terminal, ingest one in another, and watch the ingested events arrive from the stream:

```bash
curl -N "http://localhost:8080/v1/stream?table=events" & sleep 1
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> No auth is needed to ingest with the trial policy the stack mounts from `deployments/compose/settings/`. The policy is VERY permissive, and not intended for production deployments.

```bash
curl -sX POST "http://localhost:8080/v1/ingest?table=events" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"kind":"click","user":"u_42"}'
```

> [!TIP]
> A 404 "unknown table" error here just means schema discovery hasn't seen the new table yet. Just retry; worst case 60s before discovery.

## Why WaveHouse?

ClickHouse is a phenomenal OLAP database, but pointing a frontend right at it leaves a lot to be desired: one-row inserts trigger `Too many parts`, there's no backpressure or edge validation, no real-time push, and no row/column security. You end up building custom APIs, a Kafka queue, a batch consumer, a cache tier, and an auth service. **WaveHouse is that whole stack as one binary** — the only external dependency is ClickHouse.

If you're building user-facing analytics, WaveHouse is like **Supabase for ClickHouse**. Or an **open-source Tinybird** that pushes data to the frontend in real time over SSE, not just pull-based REST.

- **Ingest** — async durable WAL (embedded NATS JetStream), `200 OK` instantly, background batch-flush; schema-validated against `system.columns`; optional ID-based dedup (idempotent ingest); dead-letter queue for rows ClickHouse rejects (an unavailable ClickHouse is retried with backoff, not dead-lettered).
- **Query** — result cache (in-process Ristretto, or a Redis shared by every instance) + `singleflight` coalescing; type-safe structured query AST; Tinybird-style named pipes (parameterized SQL endpoints).
- **Real-time** — native SSE push, broadcast *before* the ClickHouse flush, with JetStream gap-fill for late/reconnecting clients.
- **Security** — Hasura-style per-table, per-role column + row policies with JWT claim templating, defined in the hot-reloadable settings directory.
- **Client** — `@wavehouse/sdk`: TypeScript client with query builder, live queries, streaming, and schema codegen; one runtime dependency (an SSE frame parser, ~1.4 KB gzipped).

## How it compares

## Getting Started

Pick between the in-repo Docker Compose, pulling a container image, or `go install`. The Compose option starts WaveHouse; the other options just download/install a container or binary. Run the selected artifact before using `http://localhost:8080`.

### A. Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wave-RF/WaveHouse.git && cd WaveHouse
docker compose -f deployments/compose/standalone.yaml up -d
```

The stack bind-mounts `deployments/compose/settings/` as its [settings directory](https://wavehouse.dev/settings-directory) whose `policies.json` / `roles.json` carry a permissive trial policy, so you can ingest without a token; edit the files on the host and the running container adopts them. Create a table in ClickHouse (or import existing schema), then ingest — see the [getting-started walkthrough](https://wavehouse.dev/getting-started) for the full ingest → query → stream tour.

### B. Prebuilt container image

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/wave-rf/wavehouse:latest    # latest stable release 
docker pull ghcr.io/wave-rf/wavehouse:dev       # rolling main-branch build
```

Tags carry a signed [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) build-provenance attestation — verify before you deploy:

```bash
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/wave-rf/wavehouse:dev \
  --repo Wave-RF/WaveHouse \
  --signer-workflow Wave-RF/WaveHouse/.github/workflows/publish-dev.yml
```

Swap in `:vX.Y.Z` and `release.yml` for a release image. Pin the signer either way. `--repo` alone accepts an attestation from any workflow in the repo.

### C. `go install` (binary, no Docker)

```bash
go install github.com/Wave-RF/WaveHouse/cmd/wavehouse@latest
```

```bash
wavehouse bootstrap ./settings   # starter settings directory, every key at its default
WH_SETTINGS_DIR=./settings wavehouse
```

The settings directory is required (no default; the container images ship none — mount one at `/app/settings`). The seed ships no policy, so every request is denied until you write one to `./settings/policies.json` (and declare its roles in `roles.json`) — copy `deployments/compose/settings/policies.json` for the permissive trial policy. You'll still need ClickHouse reachable: the seed points at `localhost:9000`; for anything else, edit `clickhouse.addr` in `./settings/config.json`. Everything in the directory hot-reloads. See [Settings Directory](https://wavehouse.dev/settings-directory) and [Configuration](https://wavehouse.dev/configuration) for more information.

## Project status

WaveHouse is in **alpha**. See [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) for where to ask what, the alpha-stage response cadence (best-effort, 1–2 business days), and what's in vs. out of scope right now.

Track what's shipped, in progress, and planned on the [**project board**](https://github.com/orgs/Wave-RF/projects/7).

> **Alpha = expect change.** WaveHouse is pre-1.0: APIs, configuration, wire formats, and on-disk state can change between releases without a migration path, and some capabilities are still hardening. Pin a version and don't rely on stability guarantees until a tagged GA release.

## Local Development

You'll need **Go 1.26+, GNU Make 4+, Docker (Compose v2), Node.js 22 LTS, and pnpm 11.21+**. See [development docs](https://wavehouse.dev/development) for the authoritative source of truth with the full list, version requirements, and gotchas.

```bash
make tools    # one-time bootstrap
docker compose -f deployments/compose/dependencies.yaml up -d clickhouse
make dev      # hot-reload on .go save
```
