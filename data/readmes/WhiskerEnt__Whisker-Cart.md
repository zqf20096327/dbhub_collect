# 🐱 Whisker — Self-Hosted E-Commerce Cart

**A lightweight, self-hosted e-commerce platform for small businesses.**
Beautiful storefront. Powerful admin panel. Built-in AI chatbot. Zero monthly fees.

🌐 **[Live Demo](https://whisker.lohit.me)** · 📖 **[Documentation](https://github.com/WhiskerEnt/Whisker-Cart/wiki)** · 📧 **[mail@lohit.me](mailto:mail@lohit.me)**

> **v1.4.1, released 10 September 2026.** The cart gets a page of its own, carts follow a signed-in customer between devices, and pressing Pay twice can no longer place two orders. Uploaded images are resized and served as WebP, compression is on by default, and every page collapses properly on a phone. Customers can download their own invoice and reorder a past order. The admin lists the pages a shop is expected to have and what each is for. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full list.

## Why Whisker?

Most e-commerce platforms are either expensive (Shopify charges ₹2,000+/month), bloated (WooCommerce needs WordPress + dozens of plugins), or complex (Magento requires a DevOps team). Whisker is none of those.

Upload it to any ₹99/month shared hosting, run the 6-step installer, and you have a professional store running in 5 minutes. No Composer, no Node, no command line. Just PHP + MySQL.

**100+ stores deployed in the first month. One user processing 500+ orders/day.**

## What Makes Whisker Different

**🤖 Built-in AI Chatbot** — Your customers get instant answers without leaving the storefront. Order tracking, support tickets, policy lookups, product questions — all handled by a chatbot widget that works out of the box. No API keys, no third-party service, no monthly fees. No other lightweight cart has this.

**🌍 Global Tax Engine** — GST (India, with CGST+SGST/IGST split), VAT (all 27 EU countries + UK), US Sales Tax (all 50 states, nexus-based). Custom rates per country/state. Tax breakdown on invoices. Works automatically based on customer address.

**📦 Zero Dependencies** — No Composer, no Node, no framework. Pure PHP. Upload to any hosting and it works. The entire cart is ~290KB zipped.

**🇮🇳 India-First Payments** — Razorpay (UPI, cards, netbanking) is a first-class citizen, not a third-party plugin. Plus Stripe, CCAvenue, and crypto via NOWPayments.

**⭐ Social Proof Built In** — Star ratings with verified-purchase badges, and a question-and-answer thread on every product. Decide who may review: anyone, customers who bought it, or customers who received it. Questions come to you first — a question only ever appears on a product page together with your answer, so a sales page never shows an unanswered one. Ratings feed Google rich snippets automatically. No plugin, no third-party review service, no per-review fee.

**🔄 One-Click Updates** — Built-in auto-updater checks for new versions, creates a backup (code + database), verifies SHA256 integrity, applies updates, and runs database migrations automatically. Rollback to any previous version if something goes wrong.

**🔒 Security-First** — Full file-by-file security audit covering all 119 PHP files. Rate limiting on all forms, CSRF on every action, webhook signature verification on all payment gateways, GD image re-encoding to prevent upload attacks, atomic stock deduction to prevent overselling.

## Features

### Storefront
- Two homepage layouts: **Classic** (simple hero + grid) or **Modern** (hero banner, category grid, sale section, carousel)
- Responsive mobile-first design with 5 color themes
- Product catalog with nested categories and search
- **Shop page** with pagination, category filters, and sorting (price, name, date)
- Product variants (Size × Color) with individual SKU, price, stock, and images per combination
- Multi-currency display (30+ currencies via Frankfurter API with 6-hour cache)
- Shopping cart drawer with real-time updates
- Guest checkout + customer accounts with saved addresses
- **Instant product search** — type-ahead dropdown with relevance ranking across name, SKU and category
- **Pickup point / locker delivery** — customers collect from admin-configured pickup locations (InPost, Mondial Relay, DHL Packstation-style), with per-location fee override and destination-based tax
- **Ratings and reviews** — star ratings with a score breakdown, verified-purchase badges, and public replies from the store. The shop chooses who may review: anyone, customers who bought the product, or customers who received it
- **Questions and answers** — a shopper asks about a product, the shop answers, and the pair appears on the page for the next person with the same question
- **Guest order tracking** — order number plus email, no account needed
- **Shipping destinations** — checkout only offers the countries the shop posts to, and refuses any other
- **Cookie consent** — optional banner with per-category choices (necessary, analytics, marketing), an equally easy refusal, and a recorded answer
- Coupon codes (percentage & fixed, min order, usage limits, expiry)
- Contact form with admin email notifications
- **AI chatbot widget** — order tracking, ticket creation, FAQ, policy lookups
- Image carousel with thumbnails

### Tax Engine
- **India GST** — CGST + SGST (intra-state) or IGST (inter-state) at 18%, 12%, or 5%
- **EU VAT** — per-country rates for all 27 member states
- **UK VAT** — 20% standard, 5% reduced
- **US Sales Tax** — state-level rates, nexus-based
- Custom tax rates per country/state via admin panel
- Per-product tax class (standard, reduced, zero, exempt)
- Tax breakdown on invoices (shows each tax line individually)
- Automatic fallback to global rate for unlisted countries

### Admin Panel
- Dashboard with revenue charts, order stats, and trend data
- Product management with drag-drop image upload
- Category management (nested, with sort order)
- Order management with status tracking, shipping info, and tracking numbers
- **Refunds** — full or partial, issued through the payment gateway, with a `RFN-…` reference alongside the gateway's own refund id and an email to the customer. A call the gateway never confirmed is held as unresolved rather than reported as failed, so a timeout cannot lead to refunding twice
- **Review moderation** — approve, reject, unpublish or reply, with a waiting count in the sidebar
- **Question queue** — write an answer and publish it in one step; nothing reaches a product page unanswered
- **Shipping zones** — different rates for different countries, by flat rate, free, free over a threshold, per item, or by weight
- Invoice/receipt generation with tax breakdown, store logo, address, and GSTIN/VAT number
- Customer management with order history and spend totals
- Coupon system with usage tracking
- **CSV import** — categories, products, and variants in a single file
- Email template editor with variable placeholders, seeded with working templates for welcome, order confirmation, payment pending, cancellation, payment receipt, refund and shipping mail
- Page/policy editor (Privacy, Terms, About — any custom page)
- **Abandoned cart tracking** with email reminders
- **Support ticket system** with admin replies and status tracking
- SEO settings with live Google preview
- Sitemap & robots.txt generator
- Shipping carrier & rate configuration
- **Shipping destination control** — domestic only, a chosen list of countries, or everywhere
- Pickup point / locker management (locations, fees, opening hours)
- **Auto-updater** with backup, SHA256 verification, auto-migrations, and one-click rollback
- **Homepage style picker** — switch between Classic and Modern layouts
- **Admin forgot password** — email-based reset with rate limiting
- **Low stock email alerts** — daily notification when products hit ≤5 stock

### Payments

**Setting up a gateway.** Open **Admin → Payment Gateways**, expand **Configure** on the gateway you want, paste its credentials, and press **Test connection** — Whisker calls the provider and tells you whether the keys are accepted before you take a single order. Tick **Test Mode** while you are trying things out; the test credentials are stored separately from the live ones.

**Webhook URL.** Each gateway card shows the exact URL to paste into the provider's dashboard, with a copy button:

```
https://yourstore.com/webhook/{gateway}/callback
```

| Gateway | Where the keys live | What to subscribe to |
|---|---|---|
| **Stripe** | Developers → API keys (or the Workbench panel) | Add a webhook endpoint for `checkout.session.completed`; paste the `whsec_…` signing secret into Whisker |
| **Razorpay** | Account & Settings → API Keys | Settings → Webhooks, subscribe to `payment.captured`, and use the same secret in both places |
| **CCAvenue** | Merchant panel → Settings → API Keys | Set the URL above as your Response URL |
| **NOWPayments** | Settings → API keys | Settings → IPN — set the URL above as the callback and paste the IPN secret |

Whisker refuses to process a webhook when its secret is missing, rather than trusting an unsigned request, so payments will not be confirmed until the secret is saved.


- **Razorpay** — UPI, Cards, Netbanking (webhook signature verified)
- **Stripe** — 150+ countries (webhook signature + replay protection)
- **CCAvenue** — Indian payment gateway
- **NOWPayments** — Bitcoin, Ethereum, 300+ cryptocurrencies (webhook signature verified)
- Payment amount verification against order total
- Idempotent webhook processing (no duplicate order credits)

### SEO
- Auto-generated meta tags (title, description, keywords)
- Open Graph + Twitter Cards for social sharing
- JSON-LD product schema for Google rich snippets
- Aggregate rating in product schema, published only once real reviews exist
- Sitemap.xml generator
- Robots.txt generator
- Per-product and per-category SEO overrides
- Google/Bing verification meta tags

### Security
- Bcrypt password hashing (cost 12)
- CSRF protection on all forms (62 verification points)
- 100% PDO prepared statements
- Session fingerprinting (IP + User-Agent) with 15-min timeout
- Rate limiting on login, registration, forgot password, contact, chatbot, coupons, password change, order tracking, reviews and questions (15 endpoints)
- XSS output escaping via `View::e()` plus HtmlSanitizer for admin-authored HTML
- File upload validation (MIME + extension whitelist + GD re-encoding)
- Content-Security-Policy, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options headers
- PHP execution blocked in uploads directory
- Webhook signature verification on all payment gateways (HMAC + timing-safe compare + replay protection where the gateway supports it)
- SSRF protection on admin-controlled outbound calls (port whitelist + private-IP rejection)
- Atomic stock deduction (prevents overselling under concurrency)
- Atomic compare-and-set on order cancellation (no double restocks)
- Non-blocking checkout emails on PHP-FPM servers
- Timing-safe login (prevents user enumeration)
- URL-encoded slugs in all templates (prevents slug injection)
- Update download host check with strict dot-boundary validation
- Refunds are POST-only, CSRF-checked before any money moves, capped at the order total, and idempotent per attempt
- Database errors are logged rather than shown to shoppers, so table and constraint names never reach a storefront page
- Shipping destinations are enforced server-side, not only in the checkout dropdown

### Performance
- **Settings cache** — all settings loaded once per request (1 query instead of 10+)
- **Currency cache** — exchange rates cached 6 hours
- **Tax rate cache** — loaded once per request from DB
- **Atomic stock** — `WHERE stock_quantity >= ?` prevents race conditions
- **Non-blocking emails** — `fastcgi_finish_request()` on PHP-FPM
- **Compression on by default** — gzip/brotli via the shipped `.htaccess`; a
  storefront page goes from ~110 KB to ~30 KB
- **Assets cached for a year** — every asset URL carries `?v=<mtime>`, so an
  edited file is a new URL and there is no cache to clear
- Runs on shared hosting, handles 500+ orders/day on a decent VPS
