## Features

- **Keep your history**: persist CPA usage in SQLite with scheduled backups.
- **Understand costs**: analyze usage, caching, and estimated costs by model, API Key, and provider.
- **Investigate requests**: inspect and export request details, and explore success rates, time to first token (TTFT), and total latency.
- **Track quotas**: monitor credential health and remaining quotas, refresh quotas, edit priorities, and explore Codex quota history.
- **Share scoped access**: provide a read-only usage view for an individual CPA API Key.

Optional community rankings and CPA plugin embedding in CPAMC are also available. Deploy with Docker Compose, Homebrew, or binaries; login protection is enabled by default.

## Sponsors and Special Thanks

- Thanks to [CLIProxyAPI (CPA)](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI) for providing the upstream CPA foundation and data source this project builds on.
- Thanks to [@YouShouldBetOnMe](https://github.com/YouShouldBetOnMe) for supporting CPA Usage Keeper.
- Thanks to the CPA discussion group for their discussions and feedback.

## Quick Start

> Before using CPA Usage Keeper, enable CPA usage statistics. Set `observability.usage.usage-statistics-enabled` to `true` in v8 configurations; legacy configurations use the top-level `usage-statistics-enabled` setting.
>
> When multiple usage collectors share one CPA instance, ensure they all use subscription mode; otherwise, collection may stop or become incomplete.

Docker Compose is the recommended deployment method. Use the full stack when deploying CPA and Keeper together, or the Keeper-only stack when CPA already exists.

Docker deployment requires Docker and Docker Compose; you do not need Go, Node.js, or a source build. For an existing CPA, have its address and management key ready, and choose a Keeper login password.

| Setup | Recommended path | Architectures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New CPA + Keeper deployment | [Docker Compose: CPA + Keeper](#cpa--keeper) | `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64` |
| Existing CPA deployment | [Docker Compose: Keeper only](#keeper-only) | `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64` |
| Existing CPA, Docker CLI preferred | [Docker](#docker-cpa-already-runs-on-the-host) | `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64` |
| macOS | [Homebrew](#macos-homebrew) | `amd64`, `arm64` |
| Linux without containers | [Linux binary](#linux-binary) | `amd64`, `arm64` |
| Windows | [Windows binary](#windows-binary) | `amd64`, `arm64` |

Login protection is enabled by default. Configure `LOGIN_PASSWORD` before starting Keeper, or explicitly set `AUTH_ENABLED=false` only when access is reliably isolated by the deployment environment.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.26+
- Node.js 24+
- npm
- A running [CLIProxyAPI (CPA)](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI) instance

### Run Locally

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then set at least `CPA_BASE_URL`, `CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY`, and a private `LOGIN_PASSWORD`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
vim .env
```

2. Start the backend.

```bash
go run ./cmd/server/main.go
```

3. In another terminal, install frontend dependencies and start the development server.

```bash
npm --prefix ./web ci
npm --prefix ./web run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`. The frontend proxies `/api` to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`; override it with `VITE_API_PROXY_TARGET` when the backend uses another port.

### Tests

Run the full verification baseline:

```bash
make verify
```

Or run checks individually:

```bash
go test ./cmd/... ./internal/...
npm --prefix ./web run test
npm --prefix ./web run lint
npm --prefix ./web run typecheck
npm --prefix ./web run build
```

</details>

## Deployment

After startup, open `http://your-server-address:8080` (`http://127.0.0.1:8080` for a local deployment) and sign in with your Keeper login password. Adjust the URL if you configure a different port, HTTPS, or a base path.

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

Docker Compose is recommended for both a complete CPA + Keeper stack and a Keeper-only deployment.

#### CPA + Keeper

**1. Prepare the configuration files**

First, download the configuration example from the [official CPA repository](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI) into `./cpa/config.yaml` in your deployment directory:

```bash
mkdir -p cpa/auths cpa/logs keeper
curl -fL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/main/config.example.yaml \
  -o cpa/config.yaml
```

In the same directory, download the [CPA + Keeper Compose template](./deploy/docker-compose.full.example.yml):

```bash
curl -fL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Willxup/cpa-usage-keeper/main/deploy/docker-compose.full.example.yml \
  -o docker-compose.yml
```

Use this download command for a new deployment only; edit an existing configuration directly to avoid overwriting it.

**2. Configure CPA and Keeper**

The official template uses the v8 configuration layout. Edit the existing settings in `cpa/config.yaml` as listed below, preserving YAML nesting and indentation. Dots in the table denote nested paths, not literal YAML keys to add:

| Setting | What to configure |
| --- | --- |
| `management.allow-remote` | Set to `true` so Keeper can access CPA management features from another container. |
| `management.secret-key` | Set a private management key and use the same original key for `CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY` in `docker-compose.yml`. |
| `observability.usage.usage-statistics-enabled` | Set to `true` to enable usage statistics. |
| `access.api-keys` | Replace the example keys with your own client API keys; these are separate from the CPA management key and Keeper login password. |

Keep `server.host` as an empty string, `server.port` as `8317`, and `oauth.auth-dir` as `"~/.cli-proxy-api"` to match the container network and volume mounts in the template. Do not append equivalent legacy settings to the v8 template.

Edit the downloaded `docker-compose.yml` and fill in two values under Keeper's `environment`:

- `CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY`: use the same original management key configured in CPA.
- `LOGIN_PASSWORD`: replace the empty string `""` with your own Keeper login password.

Alternatively, put the settings in `./keeper/.env`; the template loads it through an optional `env_file` entry and accepts a missing file. Values in `environment` take precedence, so remove the corresponding entries, including empty placeholders, to use values from the file.

**3. Start and open Keeper**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://your-server-address:8080` and sign in with your Keeper password. Run `docker compose down` to stop the stack.

For a new deployment, add model credentials in CPA and make a model request to generate usage records.

CPA data is stored under `./cpa`, and Keeper data is stored under `./keeper`.

#### Keeper Only

**1. Prepare the configuration files**

When CPA is already deployed, download the Keeper-only Compose template and environment configuration into a new deployment directory:

```bash
curl -fL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Willxup/cpa-usage-keeper/main/deploy/docker-compose.example.yml \
  -o docker-compose.yml
curl -fL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Willxup/cpa-usage-keeper/main/.env.example -o .env
vim .env
```

For an existing deployment, edit the existing files directly to avoid overwriting your configuration.

**2. Set the connection details and login password**

For CPA running on the Docker host, start with:

```env
CPA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8317
CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY=replace-with-your-management-key
AUTH_ENABLED=true
LOGIN_PASSWORD=
```

Set a private `LOGIN_PASSWORD` before starting the container.

Whether CPA runs on the Docker host or another machine, it must allow remote management and listen on an address reachable from the Keeper container; a listener bound only to `127.0.0.1` is not reachable. In v8 configurations, set `management.allow-remote: true` and check `server.host`; legacy configurations use `remote-management.allow-remote` and the top-level `host` setting.

For other network layouts, set `CPA_BASE_URL` to a CPA address reachable from the container. Set `REDIS_QUEUE_ADDR` only when the Redis/RESP address differs from the automatically derived address.

**3. Start and open Keeper**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://your-server-address:8080` and sign in with your Keeper password. Run `docker compose down` to stop the stack.

Keeper data is stored under `./data` by the provided template.

#### Logs and Updates

For either Compose setup, view Keeper logs from the deployment directory:

```bash
docker compose logs --tail=100 -f cpa-usage-keeper
```

To update Keeper, keep your configuration and data directories and run:

```bash
docker compose pull cpa-usage-keeper
docker compose up -d cpa-usage-keeper
```

#### No Data After Startup?

- Check that CPA usage statistics are enabled: `observability.usage.usage-statistics-enabled` must be `true` in v8 configurations, or the top-level `usage-statistics-enabled` in legacy configurations.
- Ensure Keeper can reach `CPA_BASE_URL` and that `CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY` matches the CPA management key.
- Check that CPA has received new model requests. If data is still missing, use the log command above to look for connection or authentication errors.

### Docker (CPA Already Runs On The Host)

Use the same `.env` values as the Keeper-only Compose setup when you prefer `docker run`:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name cpa-usage-keeper \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v "$(pwd)/keeper:/data" \
  --env-file .env \
  ghcr.io/willxup/cpa-usage-keeper:latest
```

### macOS Homebrew

Homebrew is the recommended macOS installation method:

```bash
brew tap Willxup/cpa-usage-keeper
brew install cpa-usage-keeper
```

Set `CPA_BASE_URL`, `CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY`, and a private `LOGIN_PASSWORD`, then start the service:

```bash
vim "$(brew --prefix)/etc/cpa-usage-keeper.env"
brew services start cpa-usage-keeper
```

Upgrade and service commands:

```bash
brew services list
brew services restart cpa-usage-keeper
brew update
brew upgrade cpa-usage-keeper
```

Data is stored under `$(brew --prefix)/var/cpa-usage-keeper`; logs are written under `$(brew --prefix)/var/log/`.

### Linux Binary

Download the `linux_amd64` or `linux_arm64` archive from [Releases](https://github.com/Willxup/cpa-usage-keeper/releases/latest), then extract and run it:

```bash
mkdir -p cpa-usage-keeper
tar -xzf ./cpa-usage-keeper_*_linux_*.tar.gz -C cpa-usage-keeper --strip-components=1
cd cpa-usage-keeper
cp .env.example .env
vim .env
./cpa-usage-keeper
```

#### systemd

The Linux package includes a service template. Run these commands from the extracted package directory:

```bash
sudo cp cpa-usage-keeper.service /etc/systemd/system/cpa-usage-keeper.service
sudo sed -i "s|__CPA_USAGE_KEEPER_DIR__|$(pwd)|g" /etc/systemd/system/cpa-usage-keeper.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now cpa-usage-keeper
```

```bash
sudo systemctl status cpa-usage-keeper
sudo journalctl -u cpa-usage-keeper -f
sudo systemctl restart cpa-usage-keeper
```

### Command-Line Options

The binary supports optional startup flags:

```bash
cpa-usage-keeper --env /path/to/keeper.env # Use a specific environment file.
cpa-usage-keeper --host 127.0.0.1 # Override APP_HOST for this process.
cpa-usage-keeper -v               # Print the build version and exit; --version is also supported.
```

### Windows Binary

Download the `windows_amd64` or `windows_arm64` ZIP package from [Releases](https://github.com/Willxup/cpa-usage-keeper/releases/latest) and extract it. In PowerShell, open the extracted package directory and run:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
notepad .env
.\cpa-usage-keeper.exe
```

Set `CPA_BASE_URL`, `CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY`, and a private `LOGIN_PASSWORD` before starting. Authentication is enabled by default; set `AUTH_ENABLED=false` explicitly only for an isolated deployment.

## Configuration

Copy the example config:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

For a first deployment, set the CPA address, CPA management key, and Keeper login password. Most other settings can keep their defaults. Read the relevant sections when you need a domain, HTTPS, or a base path.

### Minimum Required

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CPA_BASE_URL` | Yes | - | URL used by the Keeper server to call CPA. In Docker Compose this is usually `http://cli-proxy-api:8317`, and it can be a private address or container service name |
| `CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY` | Yes | - | CPA management key used to read CPA management APIs |

### Web Access And Reverse Proxy

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `APP_HOST` | No | all interfaces | Keeper HTTP listen host; native deployments can set `127.0.0.1` for local-only access |
| `APP_PORT` | No | `8080` | Keeper HTTP listen port |
| `APP_BASE_PATH` | No | root path | Keeper subpath prefix, such as `/keeper`; empty means `/` |
| `CPA_PUBLIC_URL` | No | current browser origin root | Public CPA URL for the "Back to CPA" link and CPAMC frame trust |
| `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` | No | local loopback only | Additional reverse-proxy CIDRs allowed to provide `X-Forwarded-For`, separated by commas |

- The `--host` startup flag overrides `APP_HOST`. When neither is set, Keeper preserves its existing behavior and listens on all available network interfaces.
- For Docker/Compose, keep `APP_HOST` empty. To restrict access to the Docker host, publish the port as `127.0.0.1:8080:8080`.
- `APP_BASE_PATH` must be empty or start with `/`; `/cpa/` is normalized to `/cpa`.
- `CPA_BASE_URL` is the server-side CPA address and may use a private host or Docker service name.
- `CPA_PUBLIC_URL` controls browser navigation and cross-origin CPAMC frame trust. Leave it empty for same-origin `/management.html`, or set an explicit public CPA URL when domains, ports, or paths differ.
- Keeper trusts `X-Forwarded-For` only from local loopback and `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`. Direct clients cannot change their login-rate-limit source with this header. Configure only the exact proxy address or network; universal CIDRs are rejected.

For cross-origin CPAMC embedding, `CPA_PUBLIC_URL` must be a complete `http://` or `https://` URL with a host. Relative paths affect navigation only.

### Login Protection

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AUTH_ENABLED` | No | `true` | Enable login protection |
| `LOGIN_PASSWORD` | When auth is enabled | - | Login password |
| `CPA_REQUEST_LOG_ACCESS_ENABLED` | No | `false` | Allow administrators to view and download CPA request logs through Keeper; corresponding logs must exist in CPA and may contain request or response data |
| `AUTH_SESSION_TTL` | No | `168h` | Login session lifetime |
| `API_KEY_VIEWER_LOCAL_RANKING_ENABLED` | No | `false` | Allow API Key viewers to read Local Ranking; Community Ranking remains read-only |

### Timezone And Request Behavior

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TZ` | No | `Asia/Shanghai` | Timezone used for statistics and display; Today, daily totals, page timestamps, log timestamps, and daily cleanup are calculated in this timezone |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | No | `30s` | Timeout for CPA HTTP requests and Redis queue operations |
| `TLS_SKIP_VERIFY` | No | `false` | Skip TLS certificate verification for CPA HTTPS and Redis queue TLS; enable only with self-signed certificates |

### Auth Files Quota Refresh

Scheduled Auth Files quota refresh is configured from the gear button in the Auth Files inspection dialog. The setting is stored in the local SQLite database and does not require the page to stay open.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `QUOTA_REFRESH_WORKER_LIMIT` | No | `10` | Maximum Auth Files quota refresh concurrency for manual and scheduled refresh, capped at `100` |
| `QUOTA_UPSTREAM_RESPONSES_ENABLED` | No | `false` | Cache each credential's latest raw upstream quota responses and return them through quota task/cache APIs for browser Network debugging; responses may contain account data |

### Redis Queue Advanced Settings

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `REDIS_QUEUE_ADDR` | No | Derived from `CPA_BASE_URL` | An explicit value takes precedence. When empty, use the hostname and explicit port from `CPA_BASE_URL`, or `8317` if no port is specified. Set `host:port` for a separate address |
| `REDIS_QUEUE_TLS` | No | `false` | Use TLS for Redis queue connection; set `true` when `REDIS_QUEUE_ADDR` is explicit and requires TLS |
| `REDIS_QUEUE_BATCH_SIZE` | No | `10000` | Maximum queue records per pull |
| `REDIS_QUEUE_IDLE_INTERVAL` | No | `1s` | Empty queue check interval |

### Storage, Logs, And Backups

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `WORK_DIR` | No | `./data` | Application work directory; database, logs, and backups default to `app.db`, `logs/`, and `backups/` under it |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | `info` | Log level |
| `LOG_FILE_ENABLED` | No | `true` | Write persistent log files |
| `LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` | No | `7` | Combined-log history days, plus the current day; `0` disables cleanup. Error-only logs keep 30 history days plus the current day |
| `BACKUP_ENABLED` | No | `true` | Enable SQLite database backups |
| `BACKUP_INTERVAL` | No | `24h` | Database backup interval |
| `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` | No | `7` | Backup retention days |
| `USAGE_RAW_RETENTION_DAYS` | No | `0` | Total raw-request retention in days; only archives are deleted. `0` retains archives forever; `>=90` enables cleanup. Negative values and `1–89` fall back to `0` with a warning without preventing startup |

Keeper archives raw request records older than 90 local calendar days daily at 04:30 in the configured timezone. Archives are retained permanently by default. With `USAGE_RAW_RETENTION_DAYS>=90`, daily maintenance deletes expired archived records in batches after archiving, using the request timestamp and local calendar days in the configured timezone. The 90-day hot-table window remains unchanged. Normal pages do not directly query archived records; historical aggregates and backups keep their own retention policies. Deleted raw records cannot support later historical recalculation. Deletion may not immediately shrink the SQLite file: freed space can be reused and is reclaimed by the existing conditional compaction policy.

When file logging is enabled, `cpa-usage-keeper-YYYY-MM-DD.log` contains all emitted levels. Error, fatal, and panic entries are also copied to `cpa-usage-keeper-error-YYYY-MM-DD.log`, which keeps the previous 30 local calendar dates plus the current date.

### Built-In HTTPS

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TLS_ENABLED` | No | `false` | Let Keeper serve HTTPS/TLS directly |
| `TLS_CERT_FILE` | Required when TLS is enabled | - | HTTPS certificate file path |
| `TLS_KEY_FILE` | Required when TLS is enabled | - | HTTPS private key file path |

Usually, HTTPS should be terminated at nginx, Caddy, or another reverse proxy. Set `TLS_ENABLED=true` only when the Keeper process must serve HTTPS directly, and provide `TLS_CERT_FILE` and `TLS_KEY_FILE`; relative paths are resolved against the `.env` file directory.

Security and data notes:

- Browser APIs redact key-like fields, but the SQLite database and its unencrypted backups contain original data.
- Authentication is enabled by default. If it is explicitly disabled, restrict Keeper access at the deployment boundary; terminate public HTTPS at a reverse proxy.
- Login session hashes persist in SQLite until logout or `AUTH_SESSION_TTL` expiry.
- CPAMC uses a separate embed session: an `HttpOnly` cookie when available, or a per-tab header token in browser session storage as a fallback.
- Same-origin embedding works by default. For cross-origin embedding, set `CPA_PUBLIC_URL` to the public CPA/CPAMC origin used for `frame-ancestors`.
- Redis inbox messages are retained through the current day after success or for 7 days after failure.

## Nginx Reverse Proxy

When serving under `/cpa`, set `APP_BASE_PATH=/cpa` and keep the prefix in your reverse proxy:

```nginx
location /cpa/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
}
```

The loopback Nginx configuration above works without additional Keeper settings. If the reverse proxy reaches Keeper from a container or another host, or a CDN such as Cloudflare sits in front of the reverse proxy, add the exact proxy networks, for example `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS=172.18.0.0/16`.

When CPA and Keeper share a browser origin, `CPA_PUBLIC_URL` can be omitted and "Back to CPA" uses `/management.html`. For another domain, port, or path, set the public CPA URL:

```env
CPA_PUBLIC_URL=https://cpa.example.com
```
