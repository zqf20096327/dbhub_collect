[CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI) (CPA) is an API gateway: it
adapts protocols, holds credentials and proxies requests. **Oh My CPA** (OMC) is a web
console for it. OMC manages the gateway's providers, credentials and configuration, and
records the usage and cost of every request, which CPA does not store. It is a single Go
binary with the React console embedded and a local SQLite database, runs offline, and
signs in with CPA's management key.

### Observe

A live dashboard, a year-long token heatmap, and a faceted browser over every request
with latency, TTFT, tokens and cost.

</td>
<td width="25%" valign="top">

### Manage

Providers, OAuth sign-in, client keys, quotas, plugins and CPA's `config.yaml`, as forms
or as YAML. Model Square lists the model names clients can call, by maker, with price, recent requests and models.dev specifications.

</td>
<td width="25%" valign="top">

### Price

The cost of a request is fixed when it completes. Prices come from OpenRouter or custom
rates, and later price changes do not alter past records.

</td>
<td width="25%" valign="top">

### Automate

A built-in Agent and a remote MCP endpoint operate the console through declared capabilities.
Changes beyond low-risk writes run only after approval.

## Install

### Install with an agent

Paste the following into Claude Code, Codex, Cursor or another coding agent. The agent
inspects the machine, picks the matching method and installs it:

```text
Install Oh My CPA for me by following
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WizisCool/oh-my-cpa/master/docs/install-for-agents.md
```

### Install with Docker Compose

Requires Docker Engine with the Compose plugin and CLIProxyAPI v8.0.0 or later. The
commands assume a Linux or macOS shell with `curl` and `openssl`. The console's sign-in
password is CPA's management key.

| Scenario | Method |
| --- | --- |
| CPA is not deployed yet | [New install](#new-install) |
| CPA is deployed with Docker Compose | [CLIProxyAPI is already installed](#cliproxyapi-is-already-installed) |
| CPA is deployed another way | [Standalone](#standalone) |

#### New install

Save the following as `compose.yml` in a new directory:

```yaml
services:
  cli-proxy-api:
    image: eceasy/cli-proxy-api:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8317:8317"
    environment:
      MANAGEMENT_PASSWORD: ${CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY:?}
    volumes:
      - ./config.yaml:/CLIProxyAPI/config.yaml
      - ./auths:/root/.cli-proxy-api
      - ./logs:/CLIProxyAPI/logs
      - ./plugins:/CLIProxyAPI/plugins

  oh-my-cpa:
    image: wiziscool/oh-my-cpa:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - cli-proxy-api
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8080:8080"
    environment:
      OMCPA_CPA_BASE_URL: http://cli-proxy-api:8317
      OMCPA_CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY: ${CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY:?}
      OMCPA_MASTER_KEY: ${OMCPA_MASTER_KEY:?}
      OMCPA_DATA_DIR: /data
    volumes:
      - oh-my-cpa-data:/data

volumes:
  oh-my-cpa-data:
```

In that directory, download CPA's starter configuration, generate the two keys and start
both services:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/WizisCool/oh-my-cpa/releases/latest/download/cpa.config.example.yaml -o config.yaml
printf 'CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY=%s\nOMCPA_MASTER_KEY=%s\n' "$(openssl rand -hex 24)" "$(openssl rand -hex 32)" > .env
chmod 600 .env
docker compose up -d
```

Open **`http://127.0.0.1:8080/omc/`** and sign in with the `CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY` value
from `.env`. Providers and client keys are added in the console; clients send requests
to CPA at `http://127.0.0.1:8317`.

#### CLIProxyAPI is already installed

Add the service under `services:` in the Compose file that runs CPA, and merge
`oh-my-cpa-data:` into the top-level `volumes:` key if one exists. `cli-proxy-api` is
the service name in CPA's own Compose file; replace it if the service is named
differently.

```yaml
  oh-my-cpa:
    image: wiziscool/oh-my-cpa:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8080:8080"
    environment:
      OMCPA_CPA_BASE_URL: http://cli-proxy-api:8317
      OMCPA_CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY: ${OMCPA_CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY:?}
      OMCPA_MASTER_KEY: ${OMCPA_MASTER_KEY:?}
      OMCPA_DATA_DIR: /data
    volumes:
      - oh-my-cpa-data:/data

volumes:
  oh-my-cpa-data:
```

Add two lines to `.env` in the same directory:

```dotenv
OMCPA_CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY=<CPA's management key in plaintext, not the hash in config.yaml>
OMCPA_MASTER_KEY=<output of: openssl rand -hex 32>
```

Run `docker compose up -d oh-my-cpa`, which leaves the CPA container running as it is.
Open **`http://127.0.0.1:8080/omc/`** and sign in with the management key.

#### Standalone

Save the following as `compose.yml` in a new directory. `OMCPA_CPA_BASE_URL` is CPA's
address as seen from inside the container: the value below reaches a CPA on the same
machine that listens on all interfaces, and [reaching CPA](docs/install.md#reaching-cpa)
lists the other cases.

```yaml
services:
  oh-my-cpa:
    image: wiziscool/oh-my-cpa:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8080:8080"
    extra_hosts:
      - host.docker.internal:host-gateway
    environment:
      OMCPA_CPA_BASE_URL: http://host.docker.internal:8317
      OMCPA_CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY: ${OMCPA_CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY:?}
      OMCPA_MASTER_KEY: ${OMCPA_MASTER_KEY:?}
      OMCPA_DATA_DIR: /data
    volumes:
      - oh-my-cpa-data:/data

volumes:
  oh-my-cpa-data:
```

Create `.env` in the same directory:

```dotenv
OMCPA_CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY=<CPA's management key in plaintext, not the hash in config.yaml>
OMCPA_MASTER_KEY=<output of: openssl rand -hex 32>
```

Run `docker compose up -d`, then open **`http://127.0.0.1:8080/omc/`** and sign in with
the management key.

### Install a native executable

[Tagged releases](https://github.com/WizisCool/oh-my-cpa/releases) include executables
for macOS (Darwin), Windows, Linux and FreeBSD, on amd64 and arm64. Each archive embeds
the console and includes an environment template; verify its SHA-256 hash against the
release's `checksums.txt`. No Go, Node or Docker is required. CPA must be installed
separately. Follow the [native installation guide](docs/install.md#native-executable)
for configuration, permissions and upgrades.

### Notes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Back up `.env`. `OMCPA_MASTER_KEY` encrypts the database, and the data cannot be read
> without it.

CPA hands each usage record to a single reader. If another usage tracker reads the same
CPA, stop it, or add `OMCPA_USAGE_INGEST_MODE: "off"` under `environment:` to use OMC
for management only. Other management panels do not conflict.

The [installation guide](docs/install.md) covers the hardened Compose files published
with each release, remote access, HTTPS, building from source, upgrades and
troubleshooting.

## Features

<details open>
<summary><b>Gateway & providers</b></summary>

- **AI providers**: Codex, Claude, Gemini, Meta Muse, xAI, Vertex AI, Gemini Interactions, DeepSeek and OpenAI-compatible services, each with credentials, advanced model options, runtime retry/error policies, priority, weight, proxy and an enable switch enforced by the gateway.
- **OAuth management**: sign in from the console for Codex, Claude, Antigravity, xAI, Kimi (kimi.com and kimi.ai), Devin and Meta Muse, or import a Vertex service account key. Auth files, manual token refresh, model lists, Meta quota, live xAI/Antigravity plan readings and credential-specific aliases are managed per credential; shared model aliases and exclusion rules apply provider-wide. Window capacity is estimated for Codex, Claude and supported Antigravity groups, with the previous cycle shown as a labelled reference.
- **Client keys**: create, name and revoke gateway API keys. Names appear in request records and filters.
- **Model catalog**: pull model lists straight from upstream providers.
- **Playground**: test any routed model with text and images, streamed multi-turn answers and request diagnostics.
- **Plugins**: installed plugins, a plugin store, typed settings forms, and trusted plugin pages with native CPA management/model-directory compatibility. See [the trust boundary](docs/operations.md#plugin-pages).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Observability</b></summary>

- **Dashboard**: request volume, token throughput, cache hit rate and cost over presets from 15 minutes to 90 days, an all-time window since installation, or any custom range, plus a year-long token heatmap. Statistics are kept permanently; request records roll out of a configurable retention.
- **Model panels**: token trend and usage ring by call point or by upstream model, with cost shares.
- **Request records**: multi-select facets and full-text search; a detail drawer with duration, TTFT, token breakdown and the raw per-request log. Each record keeps the model the upstream reported serving, and flags the ones where it differs from the model requested.
- **Background collection**: usage is ingested by stream or polling whether or not a browser is open.
- **Logs and audit trail**: tail the gateway log, read the console's own service log, and review an append-only audit trail with filters and JSON export.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Pricing & cost</b></summary>

- **Request-time snapshots**: a request's cost is fixed by immutable price versions when it completes.
- **OpenRouter price book**: every served model priced from OpenRouter's public list, including long-context and time-of-day tiers.
- **Linked and custom prices**: pin a model to an OpenRouter entry or set custom rates, with tier presets and a calculator.
- **Channel multipliers**: scale everything one provider answers, for example a relay billed at 30% of list.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Configuration & security</b></summary>

- **Dual-mode config editor**: structured forms, or a Monaco YAML editor that preserves comments.
- **Automatic config backups**: an encrypted copy of `config.yaml` before every change, restorable from the console.
- **Encryption at rest**: stored credentials and raw usage messages are AES-GCM encrypted.
- **Audited sensitive actions**: revealing keys, downloading auth files and exporting logs are written to the audit log, and refused if that write fails.
- **Offline operation**: every asset is embedded in the binary; no CDN is contacted.
- **Personalization**: four interface languages, light and dark themes with custom palettes, a deployment time zone, and K/M/B or 万/亿 number units.

</details>

## Agents and MCP

**In the console.** On the `/agent` page, a model routed through CPA answers questions
and operates the console: usage and request analysis, providers, OAuth, quota, client
keys, configuration and pricing. Reads run directly. Changes are prepared server-side
and run only after an Allow in the console. Secrets, tokens and OAuth authorization
never enter the model's context. Answers can mix text with inline interactive components that
appear while they are generated: local filters, calculators, diagrams and charts. Components
use the console's visual system; follow-ups needing new data or actions stay in the reviewed
conversation flow.

**From an external agent.** The same capabilities are served over MCP at
`<console URL>/api/mcp` (Streamable HTTP), so an agent on another machine connects by
URL with the CPA management key as a bearer token. Nothing is installed on the agent's
side. The **Connect** action at the top of `/agent` shows the deployment's own endpoint
with ready-to-copy configuration.

Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http oh-my-cpa https://cpa.example.com/omc/api/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $OMCPA_CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY"
```

Codex (`~/.codex/config.toml`):

```toml
[mcp_servers.oh-my-cpa]
url = "https://cpa.example.com/omc/api/mcp"
bearer_token_env_var = "OMCPA_CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY"
```

Clients configured in JSON, such as Cursor:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oh-my-cpa": {
      "url": "https://cpa.example.com/omc/api/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <CPA management key>" }
    }
  }
}
```

<details>
<summary>Clients that only support stdio</summary>

The binary carries a stdio bridge that forwards to the console:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oh-my-cpa": {
      "command": "/path/to/oh-my-cpa",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OMCPA_SERVER_URL": "https://cpa.example.com/omc",
        "OMCPA_CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY": "<CPA management key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

An external agent reads state and makes low-risk writes, such as display names and
preferences, directly. Every other change it can only prepare: it cannot approve the
operation, submit a secret or complete an OAuth sign-in, and the prepared change returns a
link that opens its approval in the console. The management key is administrator-equivalent, so connect only
trusted agents, and serve the console over HTTPS before connecting one remotely.
[`docs/agent-capabilities.md`](docs/agent-capabilities.md) is the contract.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OMCPA_CPA_BASE_URL` | required | CPA's address |
| `OMCPA_CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY` | required | CPA's management key, and the console's sign-in password |
| `OMCPA_MASTER_KEY` | required | At-rest encryption key (`openssl rand -hex 32`) |
| `OMCPA_BASE_PATH` | `/omc` | Sub-path the console is served under |
| `OMCPA_DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Directory of the SQLite database; the Compose files set `/data` |
| `OMCPA_PUBLIC_URL` | unset | The address browsers use; `https://` marks the session cookie `Secure` |
| `OMCPA_USAGE_INGEST_MODE` | `auto` | `off` when another service collects this CPA's usage |
| `TZ` | system zone | Server calendar; keep it equal to CPA's. Containers default to UTC |

The full reference, with deployment constraints and operational notes, is
[`docs/operations.md`](docs/operations.md).

## Architecture

```text
Browser ──▶ Direct listener / existing HTTPS ingress ──▶ Oh My CPA (:8080)
                                                 ├─ Embedded React SPA (/omc/)
                                                 ├─ SQLite WAL (/data)
                                                 └─ Usage collector ──▶ CLIProxyAPI (:8317)
```

- **Single binary**: the React console is embedded in the Go executable.
- **Single replica**: SQLite in WAL mode, one process per data directory.
- **Sub-path native**: served under `/omc` by default (`OMCPA_BASE_PATH`), so it shares a host with CPA.
- **Allowlisted facade**: ordinary console APIs project safe DTOs; trusted plugin pages use the bounded native contract. Arbitrary target URLs remain refused.

[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) has the module map, data flows and invariants.
