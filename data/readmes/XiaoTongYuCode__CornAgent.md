## Why CornAgent?

CornAgent is an open-source, full-stack AI agent. Use it as a self-hosted AI agent application, or embed its React agent sidebar into an existing product. The FastAPI agent runtime manages tool calls, parallel multi-agent subtasks, and persistent execution state.

Building an agent product also requires sessions, streaming events, pausing, recovery, and user interactions. CornAgent brings these capabilities together in one independently installable project, with a shared runtime for the chat page and sidebar.

| Capability | Included behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Live conversations | SSE streaming, reasoning, tool groups, and Markdown, code block, and table rendering |
| Pause and resume | Agents wait for user answers; page refresh recovery and safe checkpoint takeover after service restarts. See [recovery boundaries](#recovery-and-data-persistence) |
| Parallel subtasks | The main agent dispatches subtasks, waits for them, and collects results; cancellation, history recovery, and progress display are supported |
| Optional user system | Disabled by default; invisible visitor identification, email/password, email codes, and passkeys, with per-user data isolation when enabled |
| Sessions and branches | Paginated history, message editing, response regeneration, branch switching, and session deletion |
| Attachments | Images, PDF, TXT, Markdown, CSV, TSV and DOCX; paginated reads, previews and downloads; local or S3-compatible storage |
| Queue and steering | Durable pending messages; queue the next task or steer the current run at its next model boundary |
| Context management | Model-window budgets, usage calibration, rolling summaries and bounded re-compaction |
| Durable materials | Complete tool receipts with branch-scoped search, paginated reads and replay of completed calls |
| On-demand tools | Discover tools and read skills as needed; loaded schemas survive checkpoints and follow the active branch |
| Operation evidence | Committed field changes, drafts, partial failures and uncertain results derived from execution receipts |
| Embedded integration | A standalone chat page and resizable sidebar share the same provider, sessions, and message components |
| Interface preferences | English and Simplified Chinese, light and dark themes, collapsible navigation, and narrow-screen layouts |

## Quick Start

Install **Python 3.12, uv, Node.js 22+, PostgreSQL, and Redis**. You can use existing local PostgreSQL and Redis instances.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/XiaoTongYuCode/CornAgent.git
cd CornAgent
cp -n .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` in the project root to set your model API key and verify the PostgreSQL and Redis connection settings. Then run:

```sh
make setup
make dev
```

Open **[http://127.0.0.1:5173/chat](http://127.0.0.1:5173/chat)**.

`make setup` installs the locked frontend and backend dependencies, creates the `cornagent` database, and applies migrations. By default, PostgreSQL uses the current system user on local port 5432; Redis uses local port 6379.

### Models and Configuration

All configuration options are listed in [.env.example](.env.example) at the project root. Use `.env` for local overrides; system environment variables take precedence. Restart the service after changing configuration.

- **Models:** Connected through LiteLLM. The default configuration uses DeepSeek; OpenAI-compatible chat and tool-calling APIs are also supported. Image input requires a vision-capable model.
- **Persistence:** PostgreSQL stores sessions, messages, and run state; Redis Streams deliver live events.
- **Attachments:** Local filesystem and S3-compatible object storage are supported.
- **Runtime settings:** Listening addresses, ports, concurrency, timeouts, context budgets, and attachment limits are configurable.

Model API keys are used only on the server, and `.env` is excluded from version control. Without a model API key, the service can still start and load history; the interface indicates that the agent is unavailable.

## User System

The user system is **disabled by default**, so the local quick start still uses a shared workspace. Enable it to choose between two authentication modes:

| Mode | Experience | Intended use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `invisible` (default) | No registration or forms; identifies visitors using the client IP and a random browser cookie | Private history within the same browser and IP; changing IP, clearing cookies, or switching browsers selects another workspace |
| `account` | Email-code sign-in or registration, email/password sign-in, and passkeys | Cross-device access and account recovery; requires SMTP, with optional password setup or reset during email verification |

When enabled, sessions, messages, attachments, runs, and SSE are isolated by user. Identity and email delivery adapters are replaceable; the login UI lives in the application layer, and shared Agent components do not depend on the account system. Invisible mode does not collect hardware fingerprints or prove a person's identity. Organizations, administrators, and roles are not included.

For local invisible mode, set these values in the root `.env`:

```dotenv
CORNAGENT_USERS_ENABLED=true
CORNAGENT_AUTH_MODE=invisible
CORNAGENT_AUTH_ORIGIN=http://127.0.0.1:5173
CORNAGENT_AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=false
```

Generate a persistent random secret with `python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))'` and save it as `CORNAGENT_AUTH_SECRET` in `.env`. In production, use the actual HTTPS origin and keep `CORNAGENT_AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=true`. Apply migrations using the upgrade steps below and restart. See the [user system guide](docs/authentication.md) for full configuration, identity switching, and extension interfaces (Simplified Chinese).

The [live site](https://cornagent.xiaotongyu.com/chat) has invisible login enabled; its deployment record is in [ECS deployment](docs/ecs-app.md). This does not change the project defaults. Existing shared history is not assigned to the first visitor, and switching authentication modes does not merge history.

## Embed in Your Application

Within this project, use three components to add an agent to a page:

```tsx
import { AgentLauncher, AgentSidebar, CornAgentProvider } from './agent'
import './styles.css'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <CornAgentProvider>
      <main>
        <h1>My Application</h1>
        <AgentLauncher />
      </main>
      <AgentSidebar />
    </CornAgentProvider>
  )
}
```

The chat page, launcher, and panel share sessions under the same provider. For custom API paths, request adapters, and page layouts, see the **[frontend integration guide](docs/frontend-integration.md)** (Simplified Chinese). Components are provided as source code; there is currently no standalone npm package.

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/chat` | Home and new conversations; a session is created when the first message is sent |
| `/chat/:id` | Conversation details, live progress, user questions and answers, and message branches |
| `/sidebar` | A complete example of opening the agent panel within an application page |
| `/rendering` | Synthetic content demonstrating streaming text, tool titles, and process collapsing |

Usage analytics is available at `/usage`, with optional tool/model event collection. See [usage analytics](docs/usage-analytics.md) for metric definitions and the pluggable collector.

## Tools and Subtasks

Built-in tools include `ask_user`, `read_file`, `web_search`, `read_url`, and five subtask orchestration tools. The main agent can continue working, then wait for and collect subtask results as needed. Subtasks have their own durable state and cancellation mechanism.

Use `search_tools` and `read_skill` to load capabilities as needed. `list_materials`, `search_materials`, `read_material`, and `read_tool_result` retrieve saved results within the current conversation branch. Completed tool calls are replayed from immutable receipts; calls interrupted before a receipt commits remain uncertain and are not blindly repeated. See [runtime](docs/runtime.md), [materials](docs/storage.md), and [operation evidence](docs/operation-evidence.md).

`web_search` uses Tavily Search; `read_url` uses Tavily Extract. Both require `tavily_api_key` in `.env`. Both are available to the main agent and subagents. See [web tools](docs/web-tools.md).

The optional `mock_web_search` is disabled by default and returns fixed, fictional material for demonstrating search and task orchestration. Both the interface and model prompts identify it as simulated. Reasoning by the main agent and subagents still uses your configured model API.

For tool registration, parameter contracts, subtask lifecycles, and demo prompts, see **[subtasks and tool extensions](docs/subagents.md)** (Simplified Chinese).

## Architecture

```text
React Chat Page / Agent Sidebar
            │ JSON · File Uploads · SSE
            ▼
       FastAPI / Agent Runtime
            ├── LiteLLM → Models and tool calls
            ├── PostgreSQL → Sessions, message trees, checkpoints, and task state
            ├── Redis Streams → Live events and bounded replay
            └── Local Filesystem / S3 → Private attachments
```

PostgreSQL is the source of truth for durable state; Redis handles live event delivery. Recovery after page refreshes and service restarts is described below.

For detailed boundaries, see [architecture](docs/architecture.md), [runtime](docs/runtime.md), and [file storage](docs/storage.md) (Simplified Chinese).

## Recovery and Data Persistence

Sessions, message branches, run checkpoints, pending questions, and subtask state are stored in PostgreSQL. After an application process crashes and restarts, a background reconciler checks expired leases and takes over recoverable runs from safe checkpoints. Leases and monotonically increasing fencing tokens prevent stale executors from continuing to write run state.

| Interruption | Recovery behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Page refresh, SSE disconnect, or lost Redis events | Reconnection reads a database snapshot first, then resumes incremental events; committed session data is retained |
| Crash during model response generation | Retries the interrupted model turn from a safe checkpoint; unfinished drafts may be replaced, with no guarantee of word-for-word continuation |
| Restart while waiting for a user answer | Preserves the question and waiting state; the same run continues after the user answers |
| Restart while waiting for subtasks | Restores task state and resumes coordination; completed results are reused, and read-only subtasks with expired leases may rerun within their original deadlines |
| Crash during an ordinary tool batch | If the outcome of external operations is uncertain, marks the current run as failed and retains session history; does not automatically replay the batch, avoiding duplicate side effects |

**Retaining session data and automatically continuing the current run are separate guarantees.** Before retrying an interrupted ordinary tool, verify the outcome of its external operation. A failed run does not mean the external operation never happened.

Recovery requires intact PostgreSQL and attachment storage, with the restarted service connecting to the same persisted data. Continued execution also requires dependencies such as Redis and the model API to become available again. Use persistent storage for the database and attachments; multiple instances must share an attachment volume or S3-compatible bucket. Backups must cover both the database and attachments. Do not rely on an ephemeral container filesystem.

These mechanisms cover application process failures. Disasters such as database or disk corruption and host loss require deployment-specific backups, highly available storage, and recovery drills. The project does not guarantee zero data loss or a fixed recovery time under arbitrary failures.

See [agent runtime](docs/runtime.md) for checkpoint, lease, and tool failure semantics; [file storage](docs/storage.md) for persistence requirements; and [testing and verification](docs/verification.md) for documented recovery test coverage (Simplified Chinese).

## Development and Builds

```sh
make check   # Backend lint and tests; frontend lint and tests
make build   # TypeScript checks and frontend production build
```

After building, FastAPI can serve the frontend from the same origin:

```sh
cd server
CORNAGENT_SERVER_RELOAD=false uv run python -m app.serve
```

When upgrading an existing installation, stop the service before applying database migrations:

```sh
cd server
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

Regression tests against real PostgreSQL and Redis create and clean up their own random schema without clearing existing databases or Redis data:

```sh
cd server
CORNAGENT_TEST_POSTGRES_URL=postgresql+psycopg://localhost:5432/cornagent \
CORNAGENT_TEST_REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0 uv run pytest -q
```

By default, the project listens locally with the user system disabled, and all browsers share one workspace. For external deployments, enable the user system above or integrate a host identity adapter. See [ECS deployment](docs/ecs-app.md); [Vercel deployment](docs/vercel.md) remains an optional alternative.
