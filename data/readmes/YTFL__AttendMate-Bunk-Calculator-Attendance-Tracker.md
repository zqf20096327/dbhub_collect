## 📱 Overview

AttendMate gives you a clear picture of where you stand in every subject — how many classes you can still bunk, how many you need to attend to recover, and how future leaves will impact your target. All data stays on your device with no accounts required.

## 🏁 Signing Off — The Final Chapter

AttendMate started as my very first Flutter project, born out of personal frustration with clunky, ad-ridden attendance trackers. Five and a half months later, **AttendMate 2.0.0** represents the exact vision I set out to build—a feature-complete, ad-free, local-first, and automated attendance ecosystem.

With the launch of **v2.0.0**, core feature development for AttendMate has officially reached its final milestone. Every planned capability—from background geofencing and predictive bunk calculations to automated calendar sync and rolling backups—is now fully built, tested, and shipped.

### 💚 What Happens Next & Community Contributions
- **100% Free & Ad-Free Forever:** The app will remain completely free, ad-free, and fully functional for all current and future semesters.
- **Open Source & Contributions Welcome:** The codebase remains 100% open-source on GitHub under AGPL-3.0. Anyone is welcome to contribute, open Pull Requests, report issues, or request new features—I will always be happy to review PRs, look into issues, and push future release updates!
- **Stable & Self-Contained Utility:** The project stands as a complete, stable, and reliable tool for students everywhere.

Thank you to everyone who tested early builds, reported bugs, gave feedback, and supported this journey from v1.0 to v2.0! The app is yours now—use it to safeguard your attendance and stress less about bunks! 🎓🚀
