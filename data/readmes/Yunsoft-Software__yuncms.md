## Installation options

YunCMS is available as the [`yunsoftofficial/yuncms`](https://hub.docker.com/r/yunsoftofficial/yuncms) Docker image and as the `@yunsoft/yuncms` npm package. Both distribution paths run the same CLI, API and Studio.

| Option | Best for | Requirements | Start here |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Docker Compose | Fastest complete self-hosted stack | Docker with Compose | [Docker guide](docs/docker.md) |
| `npx` | Evaluation without a persistent package install | Node.js 24, npm 11+, MySQL | Commands below |
| Persistent npm install | Long-lived Node deployments with managed updates | Node.js 24, npm 11+, MySQL | [Setup and CLI](docs/setup-cli.md) |
| Source checkout | Contributors and local core development | Git, Node.js 24, npm 11+, MySQL | [Installation Options](docs/installation.md#source-checkout) |

### Docker Compose

Docker users only need Docker Engine with the Compose plugin (or Docker Desktop); the maintained stack includes MySQL 8.4 and the required Node.js runtime.

```bash
mkdir my-yuncms
cd my-yuncms
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yunsoft-Software/yuncms/main/compose.yaml
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yunsoft-Software/yuncms/main/docker.env.example -o .env
```

Replace both example passwords in `.env`, then initialize and start the stack:

```bash
docker compose up -d mysql
docker compose run --rm yuncms init
docker compose up -d yuncms
```

During `init`, use `mysql` as the database host, `yuncms` as the database and user, and the password from `.env`; then create the first Administrator. Open `http://localhost:3008` after `docker compose ps` reports YunCMS healthy.

The complete volume, configuration, backup and image-update workflow is in **[Docker](docs/docker.md)**.

### npm and source requirements

```text
Node.js 24 LTS
npm 11+
MySQL 8-compatible server
```

### Quick evaluation with `npx`

Create an empty directory and run the published npm package directly with `npx`:

```bash
mkdir my-yuncms
cd my-yuncms
npx --yes @yunsoft/yuncms init
npx --yes @yunsoft/yuncms start
```

`init` interactively asks for the MySQL connection and first Administrator account, creates the project `.env`, verifies the database and applies the required migrations. The current directory becomes the YunCMS project directory, so `.env`, local Files and local extensions live there rather than inside the npm cache.

Default local URL:

```text
http://localhost:3008
```

The same listener serves Studio and the API.

### Persistent npm installation

The direct `npx` flow above is enough to initialize and run YunCMS without cloning this repository. For a long-lived installation that should record YunCMS in its own `package.json` and use the managed `yuncms update` flow, install the package once in that project directory:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install --save-exact @yunsoft/yuncms
npx yuncms init
npx yuncms start
```

After a local install, `npx yuncms ...` uses the project dependency instead of downloading a temporary copy.

### Source checkout

Contributors can run the workspace directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yunsoft-Software/yuncms.git
cd yuncms
npm ci
npm run init
npm start
```

Source installs are intended for development. Production operators should prefer a pinned Docker image or a versioned npm dependency. See **[Installation Options](docs/installation.md)** for the comparison, state layout and update path for each method.

Useful commands:

```bash
npx yuncms init
npx yuncms bootstrap
npx yuncms start
npx yuncms backup
npx yuncms restore /path/to/backup --yes
npx yuncms update --dry-run
npx yuncms update --to <version>
npx yuncms help
```

If the package is not installed locally, use the full remote form instead, for example:

```bash
npx --yes @yunsoft/yuncms init
npx --yes @yunsoft/yuncms start
```

For initialization, backup/restore and updates, read **[Setup and CLI](docs/setup-cli.md)**.

For a complete first project—from installation through a collection, restricted role and API request—use **[Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md)**.

# First steps in Studio

After starting YunCMS, open `http://localhost:3008` and sign in with the Administrator created during initialization.

A normal first setup is:

1. open **Settings → Data Model**;
2. create a collection;
3. add fields and relations;
4. open **Roles & Permissions** and decide who may read/write it;
5. open the collection under **Content** and add records;
6. use **Files** for images/documents that collection records should reference.

The detailed interface walkthrough is in **[Using YunCMS Studio](docs/studio.md)**.

# Build a collection

You can use Studio or the Schema REST API.

Create a collection:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3008/schema/collections' \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name":"Customer Requests",
    "collection":"customer_requests",
    "systemFields":[
      "created_at",
      "updated_at",
      "created_by",
      "updated_by"
    ]
  }'
```

Add a field:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3008/schema/collections/customer_requests/fields' \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name":"Title",
    "field":"title",
    "type":"string",
    "length":255,
    "required":true
  }'
```

Create data:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3008/items/customer_requests' \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"title":"New quote request"}'
```

Human-readable labels and stable API/database keys are separate. Changing the label later does not silently rename the REST collection/field key.

Read **[Data Model Guide](docs/data-model.md)** for field types, defaults, system fields, singletons and all relation types.

# Query the Items API

Every project collection has the normal CRUD surface:

```text
GET    /items/:collection
GET    /items/:collection/:id
POST   /items/:collection
PATCH  /items/:collection/:id
DELETE /items/:collection/:id
```

## Select fields and relations

Specific fields:

```text
GET /items/articles?fields=id,title,status
```

All readable scalar fields:

```text
GET /items/articles?fields=*
```

A relation field:

```text
GET /items/articles?fields=id,title,author_id.name
```

All readable fields inside a relation:

```text
GET /items/articles?fields=id,title,author_id.*
```

All readable root fields and readable first-level relations:

```text
GET /items/articles?fields=*.*
```

Nested relation paths are supported within documented depth/cost limits:

```text
GET /items/articles?fields=id,author_id.company_id.country_id.name
```

## Filter

```bash
curl --get 'http://localhost:3008/items/orders' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  --data-urlencode 'filter={"status":{"_in":["paid","processing"]},"total":{"_gte":1000}}'
```

Supported comparison/text/null operators include:

```text
_eq  _neq  _lt  _lte  _gt  _gte
_in  _nin  _null  _nnull
_contains  _starts_with  _ends_with
```

Nested boolean logic uses `_and` and `_or`.

## Search, sort and paginate

```bash
curl --get 'http://localhost:3008/items/customers' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  --data-urlencode 'search=acme' \
  --data-urlencode 'sort=-created_at,name' \
  --data-urlencode 'limit=25' \
  --data-urlencode 'offset=0'
```

## Aggregate and group

```bash
curl --get 'http://localhost:3008/items/orders' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  --data-urlencode 'aggregate={"count":"*","sum":"total","avg":"total"}' \
  --data-urlencode 'groupBy=status'
```

Supported aggregate functions are `count`, `countDistinct`, `sum`, `avg`, `min` and `max`.

The complete grammar, exact limits, relation behavior and error cases are documented in **[Items API Query Language](docs/api-query-language.md)**.

# Roles, permissions and Public access

Access is deny-by-default. Project collection permissions can control:

- `read`, `create`, `update`, `delete`;
- readable/writable field allowlists;
- server-side row filters;
- prospective create/update validation.

A caller's filter is combined with the permission row filter using `AND`; query parameters do not replace RBAC.

The Public role follows the same explicit grant model. You can intentionally expose a collection or a filtered subset of Files without making unrelated resources public.

Read **[Roles and Permissions](docs/permissions.md)**.

# Files

YunCMS Files supports:

- gallery/list browsing in Studio;
- local storage;
- S3-compatible storage;
- raw binary upload;
- metadata edit;
- permission-aware download;
- image/media previews in Studio;
- File/Image collection fields;
- administrative storage reconciliation.

Example upload:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3008/files?storage=local' \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/octet-stream' \
  -H 'X-Filename: product-photo.png' \
  -H 'X-Mimetype: image/png' \
  --data-binary '@./product-photo.png'
```

Read **[Files and Storage](docs/files.md)**.

# Authentication

YunCMS supports:

- email/password sessions;
- rotating refresh credentials;
- static API tokens;
- logout / logout-all;
- password reset;
- email verification;
- optional public self-registration with a server-controlled role;
- OIDC;
- OAuth2;
- LDAP;
- SAML.

Read **[Authentication](docs/auth.md)**, **[Public Registration](docs/public-registration.md)** and **[Configuration](docs/configuration.md)**.

# Extensions

Trusted JavaScript extensions can add:

- `/extensions/:id` HTTP endpoints;
- pre-mutation filters;
- post-mutation actions;
- startup lifecycle handlers;
- five-field cron scheduled jobs.

Scheduled jobs can run per process or in `singleton` mode using a MySQL advisory lock so only one replica performs the job.

Read **[Extensions](docs/extensions.md)**.

# AI assistant and MCP

The optional Studio AI assistant operates through the current user's normal YunCMS accountability. Data-changing tools require both Administrator-level feature enablement and the user's selected access mode; neither grants permissions the role does not already have.

Read **[AI Assistant](docs/ai-assistant.md)**.

The optional MCP endpoint exposes bounded schema/data tools through the same service/RBAC layer. It is disabled and read-only by default; Administrators configure it under **Settings → MCP Connection** without editing `.env` or restarting YunCMS.

Read **[MCP](docs/mcp.md)**.

# Configuration and Redis

Single-process installations can keep permission-cache and rate-limit state in memory. Multi-replica installations can select Redis independently for:

- permission cache;
- global API rate limits;
- authentication rate limits.

Example:

```env
CACHE_STORE=redis
API_RATE_LIMIT_STORE=redis
AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_STORE=redis
REDIS_URL=redis://redis.internal:6379
REDIS_PREFIX=yuncms:production:
REDIS_REQUIRED=true
```

The full environment-variable reference is **[Configuration](docs/configuration.md)**.

# Production notes

For a production installation:

1. use HTTPS behind a correctly configured reverse proxy;
2. set `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS` to the exact trusted proxy depth;
3. keep database, SMTP, S3, Redis and external-auth secrets outside source control;
4. back up MySQL and local Files storage, or configure provider-level S3 backup/versioning;
5. preserve `.yuncms/ai-settings.key` when AI provider credentials are configured;
6. use Redis shared state where multiple API replicas require coherent cache/rate-limit behavior;
7. start MCP read-only and AI writes disabled until permissions have been verified with representative accounts;
8. use the managed backup/update flow for npm installations or pinned-image replacement flow for Docker installations.

See **[Deployment](docs/deployment.md)** and **[Production Readiness](docs/production-readiness.md)**.
