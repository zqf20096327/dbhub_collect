ServerBee watches all your servers from one place. A central **server** receives metrics from lightweight **agents** over WebSocket, stores them in embedded SQLite, and serves a real-time React dashboard — no external database, no heavy runtime.

- 🪶 **Tiny footprint** — agents use ~4.3 MB at cold start and ~27 MB in steady state, and the server stays lightweight as your fleet grows.
- ⚡ **Real-time** — live WebSocket dashboard for CPU, memory, disk, network, load, temperature, disk I/O, and optional NVIDIA GPU metrics from a self-built Agent (`--features gpu`; prebuilt binaries exclude GPU support).
- 📦 **Single binary** — server + embedded web UI in one file. Deploy with Docker, a one-line script, or Railway.
- 🔋 **Batteries included** — alerts, notifications, web terminal, file manager, Docker, firewall, status pages, and more.
- 🔒 **Secure by default** — OAuth + 2FA, RBAC, audit logs, one-time agent enrollment, agent-owned capability gates.
- ✅ **Battle-tested** — 3,800+ automated tests and over 91% measured Rust region coverage, including integration suites that drive the real router over HTTP + WebSocket via a mock-agent harness; green on every CI run.

> [!NOTE]
> ServerBee is in active development (`v1.0.0-alpha.12`). Expect rapid iteration.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the server

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZingerLittleBee/ServerBee/main/deploy/install.sh | sudo sh -s -- server --method docker
```

Open `http://your-server:9527`. The admin password is auto-generated and printed to the startup log — change it on first login.

> The install script supports both **Docker** and **native binary** installs via `--method docker|binary`. **Docker is recommended for the server**; omit the flag to choose interactively. Prefer the cloud? Use the [Railway one-click deploy](#railway-one-click) below.

### 2. Enroll an agent

Sign in as admin, choose **Add Server**, and copy the generated install command. Its Server-bound enrollment offer is single-use and expires in about 10 minutes. Then run it on that node:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZingerLittleBee/ServerBee/main/deploy/install.sh | sudo sh -s -- agent --method binary \
  --server-url http://YOUR_SERVER:9527 --enrollment-code YOUR_ONE_TIME_CODE
```

> A **native binary is recommended for agents** — smallest footprint and full host-level metrics. Pass `--method docker` to run the agent in a container instead.

The Agent generates and persists its run token before claiming the offer, then reconnects automatically afterwards. The code is only needed once. That's it. 🎉

## Configuration

Configure via TOML files or `SERVERBEE_`-prefixed environment variables (`__` is the nested separator, e.g. `SERVERBEE_AUTH__MAX_SERVERS`). The minimum to get going:

```toml
# /etc/serverbee/server.toml
[server]
listen = "0.0.0.0:9527"
data_dir = "/var/lib/serverbee"

[admin]
password = ""   # leave empty to auto-generate
```

```toml
# /etc/serverbee/agent.toml
server_url = "http://your-server:9527"
enrollment_code = ""   # one-time code from Add Server; only used for first claim

[collector]
interval = 3           # seconds between reports
```

## Deployment

### Railway (one-click)

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/serverbee-server)

Add a volume mounted at `/data` to persist data. The server auto-creates an admin account on first start — check the deploy logs for the credentials banner.

### Management CLI

The installer drops a `serverbee` CLI at `/usr/local/bin/serverbee`:

```bash
sudo serverbee status         # status of all components
sudo serverbee upgrade -y     # upgrade to latest
sudo serverbee upgrade --channel beta -y  # upgrade to the latest beta
sudo serverbee restart        # restart services
sudo serverbee config         # view / set config
sudo serverbee uninstall agent -y
```

### Reverse proxy

Behind Nginx/Caddy, proxy `/` to `127.0.0.1:9527` and make sure the WebSocket routes `/api/ws/` and `/api/agent/ws` forward the `Upgrade`/`Connection` headers with a long read timeout. See the [deployment docs](https://docs.serverbee.app/en/docs/deployment) for a ready-to-use Nginx config.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZingerLittleBee/ServerBee.git
cd ServerBee

make dev-full         # server (:9527) + Vite dev server (:5173) — login admin / admin123
make cargo-test       # Rust tests
make test             # frontend tests
make cargo-clippy     # Rust lint
```

> `make dev-full` runs Vite with HMR at `http://localhost:5173`, proxies `/api/*` to the Rust server at `:9527`, creates a development Server, and prints its one-time Agent enrollment command.

**Stack:** Rust (Axum 0.8 · sea-orm · SQLite WAL) · React 19 (Vite 7 · TanStack Router/Query · Bklit · shadcn/ui · Tailwind CSS v4) · Rust agents (sysinfo · tokio-tungstenite).

### Testing & quality

ServerBee ships with **3,800+ automated tests** — 3,200+ Rust (unit + 42 integration suites that drive the real Axum router over HTTP/WebSocket with a mock-agent harness) and 600+ frontend Vitest tests. Coverage is measured with `cargo-llvm-cov` (over 91% region overall; common ~98%, agent ~90%, server ~92%). Every push runs zero-warning Clippy, the full Rust suite, and frontend type/lint checks in CI. See the [Testing & Quality](https://docs.serverbee.app/en/docs/testing) guide.
