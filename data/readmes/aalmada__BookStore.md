Full-stack .NET online book store application with event-sourced backend API and Blazor frontend, orchestrated by Aspire.

## Overview

This project is a demonstration and exploration of modern .NET technologies, designed to be as complete as possible while strictly following architectural best practices, and keeping performance and scalability as core priorities.

I am sure a lot may be improved. Opening this code to the public is an opportunity to get feedback and learn from others' contributions.

A complete book store management system featuring:
- **Backend API**: Event-sourced ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs with Marten and PostgreSQL
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Enterprise-grade data isolation with tenant-aware routing and blob storage
- **Frontend**: Blazor web application for browsing and managing books
- **Orchestration**: Aspire for local development, deployment, and observability
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with event store and read model projections
- **Modern Stack**: .NET 10 with C# 14 (latest language features)
- **AI-Ready**: Built for AI agents with context-aware guidance and automated skills (see- [**Agents & Skills**](docs/guides/agent-guide.md))

## 🏗️ Architectural Philosophy

> *"A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system."*
>
> — **John Gall**

This project deliberately moves away from the "microservices-first" dogma, instead embracing a **Modular Monolith** approach.

There is a growing industry consensus that starting with microservices introduces accidental complexity—distributed transactions, network latency, and infrastructure overhead—before domain boundaries are strictly defined. This solution provides a concrete example of how to build a scalable, robust system without the premature complexity of a distributed mesh.

The architecture emphasizes:

- **Modularity**: Loose coupling is enforced using **Event Sourcing** and **CQRS**. Features communicate via messages (Wolverine), ensuring that future decomposition into services is a seamless refactoring rather than a rewrite.

- **Pragmatism & Performance**: We prioritize clean, maintainable code over academic purity. By avoiding excessive abstraction layers (like generic repositories and passthrough services), we eliminate "architectural tax," ensuring the code remains easy to refactor and runs with maximum performance.

- **Completeness**: Unlike typical "Hello World" demos, this project implements production-grade requirements: resiliency, distributed tracing, structured logging, correct HTTP semantics, optimistic concurrency, hybrid caching, configuration validation, content localization, scalable real-time updates, passwordless authentication, comprehensive testing, and trigram‑based search for fast, flexible text matching.

- **Simplicity**: By keeping the deployment unit single but the code modular, we gain the benefits of microservices (isolation, maintainability) without the operational drawbacks.

This serves as a foundational blueprint that scales *with* your needs, allowing you to evolve from a simple, working system into a complex one naturally.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Prerequisites: .NET 10 SDK, Aspire CLI, Docker Desktop

# Install Aspire CLI: Follow instructions at https://aspire.dev/get-started/install-cli/

## Architecture Enforcement

The project includes a custom **Roslyn Analyzer** (`BookStore.ApiService.Analyzers`) that enforces Event Sourcing, CQRS, and DDD patterns:

- ✅ Events must be immutable record types
- ✅ Commands follow CQRS conventions
- ✅ Aggregates use proper Marten Apply methods
- ✅ Handlers follow Wolverine conventions
- ✅ Consistent namespace organization

See [Analyzers](docs/guides/analyzer-rules.md) | Custom Roslyn analyzers to enforce architectural rules and prevent common mistakes. |Scalar UI
- **Structured Logging** with correlation IDs

### Infrastructure (Aspire)
- **Service Orchestration** for local development

    "translations": {
      "en": {"name": "Software Architecture"},
      "pt": {"name": "Arquitetura de Software"}
    }
  }'
```

## 🔄 Event Sourcing Example

```bash
# All operations create events in the event store

# Create a book
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/books \
  -H "X-Correlation-ID: workflow-123" \
  -d '{"title": "Clean Code", ...}'
# → BookAdded event stored

# Update the book
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/admin/books/{id} \
  -H "X-Correlation-ID: workflow-123" \
  -H "If-Match: \"1\"" \
  -d '{"title": "Clean Code (Updated)", ...}'
# → BookUpdated event stored

# View all events for this workflow
SELECT * FROM mt_events
WHERE correlation_id = 'workflow-123';
```

## 🛡️ Optimistic Concurrency with ETags

```bash
# Get book (receives ETag)
curl -i http://localhost:5000/api/books/{id}
# ETag: "5"

# Update with concurrency check
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/admin/books/{id} \
  -H "If-Match: \"5\"" \
  -d '{"title": "Updated Title", ...}'
# Success → ETag: "6"

# Concurrent update fails
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/admin/books/{id} \
  -H "If-Match: \"5\"" \
  -d '{"title": "Another Update", ...}'
# Error: 412 Precondition Failed
```

## 🔍 Monitoring

- **Health Checks**: `/health`
- **Aspire Dashboard**: `https://localhost:17161`
- **Scalar API Docs**: `/api-reference`
- **OpenAPI Spec**: `/openapi/v1.json`

## 🧪 Testing

The project uses **TUnit**, a modern testing framework with built-in code coverage and parallel execution.

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run tests for specific project
dotnet test --project tests/ApiService/BookStore.ApiService.UnitTests/BookStore.ApiService.UnitTests.csproj

# Alternative: Run tests directly
dotnet run --project tests/ApiService/BookStore.ApiService.UnitTests/BookStore.ApiService.UnitTests.csproj
```

> [!NOTE]
> TUnit uses Microsoft.Testing.Platform on .NET 10+. The `global.json` file configures the test runner automatically.
