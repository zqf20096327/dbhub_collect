A semantic knowledge graph that extracts concepts from documents, tracks how well-supported they are, and remembers where sources disagree.

**[κ(G)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory))** — vertex connectivity of a graph. The minimum number of connections you'd need to cut before the graph falls apart. A measure of how robust the structure is.

Also **kg** — the unit of mass. Because knowledge here has weight. Grounding scores measure how heavy an idea is: well-evidenced claims carry more than thin ones. Contested concepts weigh differently than unchallenged ones.

## Quick Start

### Install Client Tools

The `kg` CLI, MCP server (for AI assistants), and optional FUSE filesystem:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaronsb/knowledge-graph-system/main/client-manager.sh | bash
```

Or just the CLI: `npm install -g @aaronsb/kg-cli`

### Deploy the Platform

Run your own knowledge graph backend:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaronsb/knowledge-graph-system/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaronsb/knowledge-graph-system.git
cd knowledge-graph-system
./operator.sh init    # Interactive setup
./operator.sh start   # Start containers
```

See [Quick Start Guide](docs/operating/quick-start.md) for details.

## What You Can Do

**Ingest documents** — PDFs, markdown, images, text. The system extracts concepts, relationships, and evidence automatically.

**Search by meaning** — "economic downturn" finds content about recessions, crashes, and crises even if those exact words aren't used.

**Explore connections** — Find paths between concepts. See how ideas relate across documents.

**Check confidence** — Every result includes grounding scores. Know what's well-supported vs. contested.

**Trace sources** — Every concept links back to the original text or image that generated it.

**Query via AI** — MCP server integration lets Claude and other assistants use the graph as persistent memory.

**Navigate via filesystem** — Mount the graph as a FUSE filesystem. Use `ls`, `grep`, `find` on semantic space.

## Use Cases

*Obsidian's graph view rendering knowledge graph relationships via the FUSE filesystem — no plugin needed*

**Research synthesis** — Ingest papers, find connections across them, see where authors disagree. Grounding scores tell you which claims have broad support.

**Technical documentation** — Extract architecture concepts from diagrams, meeting notes, design docs. Query how components relate.

**Agent memory** — Give AI assistants persistent, grounded memory. They can check confidence before making claims.

**Spatial understanding** — Ingest place photos. The graph learns physical relationships without coordinates.

**Compliance/audit** — Full provenance chain. Every concept traces to source evidence.

## Background

Most systems that store knowledge for retrieval — vector databases, RAG pipelines, knowledge graphs — optimize for finding relevant content. They can tell you *what* matches your query. They can't tell you how well-supported it is, whether sources disagree about it, or where the evidence actually came from.

kg adds an epistemic layer on top of the graph. Every concept carries a **grounding score** computed from supporting vs. contradicting evidence — not a label, but a measurement. A concept backed by 47 sources with 12 contradictions scores differently than one with a single unchallenged mention. When sources disagree, the system preserves both sides rather than picking a winner.

**Semantic diversity** provides a second signal. Well-established knowledge tends to connect across independent domains. Narrow claims that only reference each other score lower. In testing, Apollo 11 mission data showed 37.7% diversity across 33 concepts; moon landing conspiracy content showed 23.2% across 3.

The system also handles images. Feed it street view photos and the extracted relationships ("next to", "across from", "visible from") naturally encode spatial topology — no coordinates needed.

### How It Compares

| Capability | kg | GraphRAG | Zep/Graphiti | Cognee | Vector DBs |
|------------|-------------|----------|--------------|--------|------------|
| Contradiction detection | Native (mathematical) | LLM-dependent | Limited | No | No |
| Grounding scores | Continuous -1 to +1 | Source citations only | No | No | Similarity only |
| Semantic diversity | Yes (authenticity signal) | No | No | No | No |
| Epistemic status | Per-relationship | No | No | No | No |
| Temporal tracking | Ingestion epoch | No | Bi-temporal | No | No |
| Emergent ontologies | Continuous annealing | One-shot communities | Temporal facts | Partial (event-driven) | N/A |
| Multimodal ingest | Prose-bridge (own vector space) | Text-centric | Text-centric | Images/audio | Embeddings only |
| FUSE filesystem | Yes | No | No | No | No |
| Air-gapped operation | Yes (Ollama) | Cloud required | Cloud required | Local-capable | Some local |

Each neighbor leads on a different axis: Zep/Graphiti on **bi-temporal** fact tracking, GraphRAG on adoption (its Leiden communities are the closest analog to annealing, but computed once at index time), and Cognee — the nearest architectural neighbor — on self-improving memory (event-driven, no epistemic layer). kg's temporal axis is deliberately narrower: it records *when evidence arrived* (ingestion epoch), not *when a fact was true* — because it holds **no truth values, only computed evidence**, and preserves contradictions rather than expiring them. That's a stance, not a gap — see [Computed Evidence over Asserted Truth](docs/concepts/computed-evidence-over-asserted-truth.md). What we haven't found a shipped peer for is the *combination*: continuous ontology annealing, a semantic FUSE surface, and an epistemic layer that measures confidence rather than just retrieving content.

## Why Try It

If you need:
- **Epistemic reliability** — knowing *how sure* you should be, not just *what* the answer is
- **Contradiction awareness** — preserving disagreement rather than hiding it
- **Full provenance** — tracing every claim to source evidence
- **Local operation** — running without cloud API dependencies
- **Unix integration** — using standard tools on semantic data

kg was built for those requirements. Most alternatives optimize for retrieval accuracy or comprehensiveness. kg optimizes for *knowing what you know and how well you know it*.
