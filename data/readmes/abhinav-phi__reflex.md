## Live Deployment

A live instance of the exact code in this repo is running end-to-end (all data `[SIMULATED]`, Razorpay TEST MODE):

| App | URL | Platform |
|---|---|---|
| Command center (React) | **https://reflex-recover.vercel.app** | Vercel (static build, SPA) |
| API (FastAPI + PostgreSQL) | https://reflex-api-production.up.railway.app | Railway (Docker, always-on) |

Seeded logins (password `reflex-demo`): `admin@reflex.dev` · `approver@reflex.dev` · `operator@reflex.dev` · `viewer@reflex.dev`. The API runs embedded worker threads in a single container backed by **PostgreSQL** (Aiven Free, Amsterdam — same region as the API, 1 GB disk, automated backups) and **Redis** (Railway private network — real pubsub/streams for live SSE events); every ledger/approval/episode row persists in Postgres. Deploy wiring: Vercel build env `VITE_REFLEX_API` (build fails without it), Railway `DATABASE_URL` (→ Aiven, `sslmode=require`) + `REDIS_URL`, random production `JWT_SECRET`, scoped CORS allow-list, and CSP headers on the static app — see [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

> ⚠️ The production frontend build **refuses to compile without `VITE_REFLEX_API`** (`apps/web/vite.config.ts` guard) — the same-origin 405 regression can't happen again. GitHub Actions skips the guard (its bundle is never deployed).

## The Problem: Why Subscriptions Leak Revenue

Indian subscription/D2C merchants lose recurring revenue every month to failed UPI AutoPay debits, card declines, and e-mandate/NACH failures — and today they respond with either **silence** (revenue quietly leaks) or **dumb blast SMS** (revenue leaks *plus* annoyed customers). Recovery is manual, root-cause-blind, unmeasured, and often customer-hostile — even though recovered revenue is **~100% margin**, the cheapest money a merchant can acquire.

## How Reflex Solves It (AI vs. Deterministic)

The governing principle: ***AI proposes, deterministic code disposes.***

**Where AI (LLM) is used — judgment only, on the ambiguous tail (~25–30%):**
- **Diagnosing messy bank decline strings** that a lookup table can't cover (the same root cause surfaces as different issuer strings across banks).
- **Hinglish message phrasing** around slot skeletons (empathy + genuine vernacular at scale).
- **Reply classification** (PROMISE / REFUSE / COMPLAINT / OPTOUT) on free-text replies.

**Where deterministic code rules — always:**
- EV arithmetic (`p_recover × amount − channel_cost − annoyance_penalty`), caps, budgets, quiet hours, scheduling math.
- The **Shield**: a separate guardrail module the policy can only *propose* to — never bypass.
- Idempotent dispatch, ledger writes, compliance filtering.
- **The LLM never authors an amount, link, deadline, or UPI handle.** Numbers are DB-injected after generation; a validator rejects any digit/URL/₹ span in LLM text (100% rejection corpus, CI-enforced).

Six subsystems, one deployable: **Pulse** ingests and diagnoses · **Brain** scores interventions by expected value · **Shield** deterministically permits or blocks · **Hands** execute via Razorpay test-mode APIs and simulated channels · **Ledger** hash-chains every decision · **Proof** runs the pre-registered evaluation.

## Key Features

- **Root-Cause Diagnosis** — Rules-first (unit gate ≥70%; rules coverage 89.6% on the 500-case degraded holdout — `eval/results/dx_holdout/report.json`), LLM tail for messy issuer strings, confidence-gated with safe defaults.
- **Expected Value (EV) Policy** — Every intervention scored: `EV = p_recover × amount − cost − annoyance`; all four terms persisted per candidate; negative EV ⇒ STOP shown with the math.
- **Shield Guardrails** — Deterministic, fail-closed, non-overridable: 4 actions/episode · 2 contacts/customer/day · ₹5,000/day budget · quiet hours 21:00–09:00 IST · suppression/DND list · value > ₹50,000 ⇒ human approval · kill switch (**drain measured: 25 ms for 500 scheduled actions**).
- **Simulation Honesty Architecture** — Pre-registered protocol (git-tagged before any results), tuned (never strawman) baseline, a published losing cohort, and structural anti-cheat: the agent DB role **physically cannot read simulator ground truth** (ADR-004, verified by SQLSTATE-42501 tests).
- **Degraded Mode** — Two consecutive LLM failures flip a global degraded flag: rules-only diagnosis + frozen policy, zero dropped episodes, every action stamped `DEGRADED`. The system is LLM-absent-safe by design.
- **Hash-Chained Audit Ledger** — Append-only `sha256(seq ‖ prev_hash ‖ canonical(event))` chain with tamper-detection endpoint; no UPDATE/DELETE grants to the app role.
- **Complaint Safety** — Keyword rule-gate runs first regardless of model health; COMPLAINT ⇒ instant global suppression + human handoff. Gates: COMPLAIN precision ≥95% **and recall ≥90%** (both green offline).

## Getting Started (5-Minute Setup)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/abhinav-phi/reflex.git
cd reflex

# 2. Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# (Add optional LLM_API_KEY here; system runs LLM-absent-safe without it)

# 3. Boot infrastructure, apply migrations, and seed data
make up        # docker compose: postgres+redis+api+workers+web, then migrations
make seed      # idempotent: 4 users, merchant "SipDaily", policy v1, corpora

# 4. Start the demo slice (214 episodes / ₹2,41,000 failed value, seed demo-7, ×100)
make demo
```

> **Endpoints:**
> - Full-Docker route: UI on **http://localhost:8080**, API on **http://localhost:8000** (`make demo` targets `:8899` by default — set `REFLEX_API=http://localhost:8000` when using the full Docker stack).
> - Local dev route: Vite on **http://localhost:5173**, API on **:8899** (`8000` is OS-reserved on some Windows hosts). Full walkthrough: [MANUAL_STEPS.md](MANUAL_STEPS.md).
>
> Postgres is published on host port **15432** by default (Windows reserves port ranges that cover 5432 — see [Troubleshooting](#what-broke--how-we-fixed-it-hackathon-post-mortem) and [MANUAL_STEPS.md §10](MANUAL_STEPS.md#10-troubleshooting-engine)).

## Running the Demo & Failure Injections

The demo replays a deterministic slice — **214 episodes / ₹2,41,000 failed value** (seed `demo-7`, ×100 speed) including one ₹48,000 corporate order and one pre-seeded complaint trajectory. Honesty note: ₹48,000 is UNDER the default ₹50,000 strict-greater approval threshold, so the invoice does not enter `/approvals` on its own — the human-approval path is demonstrated via a control-inject/manual API scenario. The naive-baseline twin runs on the same batch so counters compare arms live.

Three failures are injected through the **real system path** — never scripted fakery:

| Injection | Where | What you see |
|---|---|---|
| `llm_outage` | `/ops` → Inject LLM Outage | Amber DEGRADED banner; stream continues; actions stamped `DEGRADED`; zero drops |
| `webhook_storm` | `/ops` → Inject Webhook Storm | 1,000 events ingested → **214 episodes** (786 duplicates collapsed), dedup counters |
| `complaint` | `/ops` → Inject Complaint | Instant suppression + human-handoff approval item + episode STOPPED_CUSTOMER |

Kill switch: one click from the dashboard control bar (or `POST /api/control/mode {"mode":"halted"}`). Measured drain: ≤1 s budget, 25 ms actual.

## Evaluation & Pre-Registered Metrics

The protocol was committed and git-tagged **`eval-preregistered-v1` before any results existed** — provable from history. One command reproduces everything: `./eval/reproduce.sh`.

**Design targets** (pre-registered — actuals only ever come from runs):

| Arm | Recovery rate | Cost / ₹100 recovered | Complaint rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| B0 — do nothing | ~7% | ₹0 | ~0% |
| B1 — tuned naive (retry×3 + blast SMS×2) | ~24% | ~₹6.9 | ~1.9% |
| **Reflex** | **~42%** | **~₹3.0** | **<0.5%** |

Plus ablations A1–A4 (which AI component buys which points), bootstrap 95% CIs, and one honestly-reported losing cohort (<₹150 ephemeral failures where contact cost > EV — Reflex correctly declines). The table above stays as the *aspiration*; actuals are below and they came in under it — reported honestly.

> ### ✅ Official Run — EXECUTED (all values [SIMULATED])
> The pre-registered official evaluation **executed on 2026-08-30** under tag `eval-preregistered-v1` — seed 42, N=3000 episodes × 8 arms — with artifacts committed at **[`eval/results/20260830T105923Z/`](eval/results/20260830T105923Z/results.json)** (`results.json` + `tables.md`). Headline actuals [SIMULATED]: **Reflex 33.83%** recovery CI[29.36, 38.75] · cost ₹0.24/₹100 recovered · complaints 0.2% — vs tuned-naive B1 **25.06%** CI[20.92, 29.43] · ₹0.12 · 0.533% and do-nothing B0 **4.11%** CI[2.72, 5.82]. **Incremental vs B1: +8.77 pp** CI[+4.49, +13.28].
>
> Honesty first, as always: the pre-registered **G1 gate (incremental ≥ +15 pp) was NOT met** (+8.77 < +15 — Reflex beats tuned-naive decisively, the CI excludes 0, but by less than the aspirational target); G2 cost and G3 complaint gates pass. This official run **executed WITH a working LLM key** (temperature 0): the LLM tail measured **zero** recovery delta — the model honestly classified every synthetic ambiguous-tail string as UNKNOWN_AMBIGUOUS, identical to the conservative fallback (safety proven under real provider conditions; differentiation requires real-world decline strings), and ablation A2 (EV off) scored *higher* than full mode — committed verbatim, never tuned away. Full gate scorecard and caveats: [docs/limitations.md](docs/limitations.md). That's the brand: it never lies about what it did.

## What Broke & How We Fixed It (Hackathon Post-Mortem)

Real answers to "what broke, and how did you get out":

1. **Docker Desktop crashed during parallel eval runs.** Root-caused in two layers: Postgres connection exhaustion during parallel arms (fixed: `-c max_connections=300`, right-sized pools) and cross-arm suppression-write deadlocks (fixed: one global advisory lock + savepoint isolation). Later we found the deeper host issue — see #5.
2. **Async webhook body parsing bug.** FastAPI consumed the body before HMAC verification could read raw bytes (fixed: read raw body first, stash on scope, verify signature *before* parse).
3. **Worker `_mode` NameError crashed the loop post-smoke.** Fixed; caught because sim-time clocks differ between Proof and runtime paths.
4. **Latent `ctx` NameError on the live dispatch path** — eval arms pass context explicitly, so tests stayed green while the live worker path would have crashed. Found by lint during a documentation audit sync; fixed and covered by a halted-flag regression test. *"It compiles" ≠ "it works."*
5. **The eval-blocking "host Docker instability," fully diagnosed:** Windows excluded-port ranges (`netsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange protocol=tcp`) reserved ports 5276–5875 — which covers **5432**, so Postgres could never bind. Workaround documented in the runbook; environmental, not product code.
6. **Kill-switch "≤1 s drain" was a claim without a number.** We wrote a measurement harness against the real DB path: **25 ms for 500 scheduled actions**. Now it's evidence, not marketing.
7. **The hash chain "broke" without any tampering.** Hashes were computed over the in-memory event dict, but Postgres jsonb normalizes values on storage — verification re-derived a different byte string for some rows (false TAMPER at seq 3562), and concurrent demo writers could fork the chain head. Fixed at the root: the hash is now computed **server-side inside a single atomic INSERT** over the stored `event::text` (pgcrypto), so append and verify agree by construction. Chain stayed valid through every subsequent live demo.
8. **Our own frontend throttled itself.** A 5-second poll + aggressive SSE reconnect loop tripped the hosting edge's IP rate limit, showing intermittent "Failed to fetch". Fixed: 15–60 s polling with SSE-driven invalidation, exponential reconnect backoff, no retries on 4xx, readable error banners.
9. **A silent production misconfiguration class.** A frontend build without the API origin produced a same-origin bundle — every API call hit the static server. Now the build **fails loudly** without `VITE_REFLEX_API` (CI skips it — its bundle is never deployed).
10. **The production database filled its disk and crash-looped.** The Railway free-plan Postgres volume (500 MB, not growable) reached 98% during eval bulk-load + WAL churn; crash recovery needed ~16 MB to write WAL and had ~6 MB — a permanent boot loop (`pg_wal/xlogtemp` ENOSPC) where "just restart it" is a no-op. Rescued the data live from a boot window (relocated WAL off the volume), migrated to **Aiven Free PostgreSQL** (1 GB, Amsterdam — same city as the API), proven bit-exact (all table counts + a 9-value ledger fingerprint), and capped the API's pools for Aiven's 20-connection budget. Full incident + runbook: [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).
11. **Per-episode ledger trails 409'd on replay data.** The trail verifier seeded its subset walk from genesis, but the replay driver interleaves episodes' rows in the global chain — so valid trails failed. Fixed: each row is now verified against its **own** global predecessor (LATERAL lookup) plus self-consistency; replay-era trails verify, genuinely broken chains still 409. Covered by unit + CI integration tests on a real interleaved chain.
