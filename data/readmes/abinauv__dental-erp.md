## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20 or later
- **npm** 10 or later
- **Docker** with Compose v2 — recommended, but [optional](#alternative-setup-without-docker)

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abinauv/dental-erp.git
cd dental-erp
npm install
cp .env.example .env

# Start MySQL, Redis, MinIO and Mailpit
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Set DATABASE_URL in .env to match the container:
#   DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:dental@localhost:3306/dental_erp"

npx prisma migrate deploy   # create the schema
npx prisma db seed          # sample data (optional)
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You still need to fill in `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `CRON_SECRET`
in `.env` — the app will not start without them. Each one has a
`node -e "..."` command beside it in `.env.example` that prints a valid value.

**The app runs on your machine, not in Docker.** Compose brings up the backing
services only. Bind-mounting `node_modules` into a container is slow enough on
Windows and macOS to spoil the edit-reload loop, and native hot reload is
better. `docker-compose.dev.yml` is a convenience for contributors and is
**never** suitable for production — every credential in it is weak and public.

### What Compose gives you

| Service | Port       | What it is for                                                    |
| ------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MySQL   | 3306       | The application database                                          |
| Redis   | 6379       | Reserved for caching and queues; nothing uses it yet              |
| MinIO   | 9000, 9001 | S3-compatible storage; reserved for Phase 3. Console on 9001      |
| Mailpit | 1025, 8025 | Captures every outbound email. Read them at http://localhost:8025 |

Mailpit is the useful one right away. Point the `SMTP_*` variables at it (the
values are commented into `.env.example`) and you can exercise password resets,
invitations and reminders with no credentials and no risk of emailing a real
person.

`createbuckets` runs once, creates the MinIO bucket and exits. Seeing it as
`Exited (0)` in `docker compose ps` is success, not a failure.

Useful commands:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f      # tail the services
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down         # stop, keep the data
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down -v      # stop and wipe the data
```

**Port 3306 already in use?** You have MySQL installed locally. Either stop it,
or change the host port in `docker-compose.dev.yml` to `'3307:3306'` and update
`DATABASE_URL` to match.

> **If you were running this stack before August 2026**, its compose project was
> renamed from `dental-erp` to `dental-erp-dev`, so that a production stack on
> the same machine cannot end up sharing volumes with it. Your old containers
> and volumes are still there under the previous name; clean them up once with:
>
> ```bash
> docker compose -p dental-erp -f docker-compose.dev.yml down -v
> ```

### Alternative setup: without Docker

<details>
<summary>Install MySQL 8 yourself</summary>

Docker is not a requirement. With MySQL 8.0+ installed locally:

```bash
# Verify MySQL is accessible
mysql -u root -p -e "SELECT 1"

# Create the database
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS dental_erp"
```

Then set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` to your own credentials and continue from
`npx prisma migrate deploy` above.

</details>

### About the database setup

`prisma migrate deploy` is the recommended path — it is repeatable and safe to
re-run when you upgrade. `npx prisma db push` also works and is handy while
developing, but it applies the schema without recording it in
`prisma/_prisma_migrations`, so later `migrate deploy` runs will fail against
that database.

<details>
<summary>Upgrading a database that was created with <code>prisma db push</code></summary>

Tell Prisma the existing migrations are already reflected in your schema, then
deploy as normal from that point on:

```bash
npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20260127152236_multi_tenancy
npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20260728120000_sync_schema_with_models
npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20260801150000_inventory_lab_prisma_models
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

</details>

### Default Credentials (after seeding)

| Role        | Email                   | Password    |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| Super Admin | `admin@demo-dental.com` | `Admin@123` |

> **Warning**: Change the default password immediately in production.

## Testing

The project has comprehensive test coverage:

- **Unit tests** — Business logic, utilities, AI skills
- **Integration tests** — API route handlers with mocked Prisma
- **Component tests** — React components with Testing Library
- **E2E tests** — Full user flows with Playwright
- **Accessibility tests** — WCAG 2.1 compliance with axe-core

```bash
# Run all unit/integration tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run E2E tests (requires running server)
npm run test:e2e
```

## Deployment

**[SELF_HOSTING.md](SELF_HOSTING.md) is the full guide** — the short version is
that you do not need a checkout, Node.js, or a build step:

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/dental-erp && cd /opt/dental-erp
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abinauv/dental-erp/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -fsSL  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abinauv/dental-erp/main/.env.production.example -o .env
# fill in .env, then
docker compose up -d
```

That pulls a published multi-architecture image (`linux/amd64` and
`linux/arm64`) from `ghcr.io/abinauv/dental-erp`, waits for MySQL, runs the
database migrations as a one-shot container, and starts the app. Add
`-f docker-compose.caddy.yml` for HTTPS with automatic certificates.

SELF_HOSTING.md also covers backups and restores, upgrading, and what to do
when something is wrong.

### Running the image directly

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env -v dental-uploads:/app/uploads   ghcr.io/abinauv/dental-erp:latest
```

> **Mount a volume at `/app/uploads`.** On the default `STORAGE_DRIVER=local`,
> uploaded files — patient documents, scans, signed consent forms — are written
> to the container filesystem. Without a volume they are destroyed the moment
> the container is replaced, which is every single redeploy. The `-v` flag above
> is not optional in any deployment you care about.
>
> **Already running without one?** Copy your files out before you next redeploy:
>
> ```bash
> docker cp <container>:/app/uploads ./uploads-backup
> ```
>
> then recreate the container with the volume mounted and copy them back.
> Setting `STORAGE_DRIVER=s3` removes this whole class of problem by getting
> uploads off the container filesystem — see [docs/STORAGE.md](docs/STORAGE.md).

Running the image this way does not migrate the database. The image carries the
Prisma CLI so it can do that itself:

```bash
docker run --rm --env-file .env ghcr.io/abinauv/dental-erp:latest   node node_modules/prisma/build/index.js migrate deploy
```

### Health checks

Two endpoints, and the distinction between them matters:

| Endpoint      | Purpose   | Checks the database | Use for                             |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `/api/health` | Liveness  | No                  | "Is this process alive?"            |
| `/api/ready`  | Readiness | Yes                 | "Should this instance get traffic?" |

Point liveness probes at `/api/health` and readiness probes at `/api/ready`.
Pointing a liveness probe at `/api/ready` means a brief database outage will
make your orchestrator kill and restart otherwise-healthy containers, turning a
short blip into a restart loop. `/api/ready` returns `503` when the database is
unreachable — it never throws.

The image carries a `HEALTHCHECK` against `/api/health`, so `docker ps` reports
container health with no extra configuration.

### Manual

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Environment Requirements

Deploying from the published image, all you need is Docker Engine 24+ with the
Compose plugin. Building or developing from source needs:

- Node.js 20+
- MySQL 8.0+ (with a dedicated database)
- Reverse proxy (nginx/Caddy) for HTTPS in production —
  [`docker-compose.caddy.yml`](docker-compose.caddy.yml) is a working example
- A persistent volume mounted at `/app/uploads`
