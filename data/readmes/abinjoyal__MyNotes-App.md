## 🏗️ Project Architecture

This project follows a feature-driven, clean architecture approach to maintain scalability and readability. The primary directories under `lib/` are:

* **`app/`**: Contains core application setup, including routing, themes, and global layout structures (e.g., sidebar and desktop layouts).
* **`core/`**: Houses shared resources used across the app, such as database services, extensions, utilities, exceptions, and common UI widgets.
* **`features/`**: The main business logic is split into standalone features:
  * `folders/`: Directory management for notes.
  * `notes/`: Note creation and displaying logic.
  * `tasks/`: Task management.
  * `pin/`: Pinning logic for quick access.
  * `search/`: Searching capabilities.
  * `trash/`: Soft-delete mechanism.
  * `settings/`: App preferences.
  * `splash/`: Splash screen logic.
