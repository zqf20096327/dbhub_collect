On [LoCoMo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17753), the public long-context memory benchmark, Hivemind is **25% cheaper, 1.7× fewer tokens, and 31% fewer turns** than running without shared memory. ([See the numbers below.](#benchmarks))

</p>

**Beyond memory.** Hivemind doesn't just remember. It mines your team's traces for repeated patterns and codifies them into reusable skills that propagate back into every agent on the team. The agent your junior engineer used this morning is sharper because of what your senior engineer's agent figured out last week.

- 📥 **Captures** every session's prompts, tool calls, and responses as structured traces in Deeplake
- 🧠 **Codifies** patterns into reusable `SKILL.md` files, available to every agent on your team
- 🔍 **Searches** traces and skills with hybrid lexical + semantic retrieval (ILIKE lexical fallback when embeddings off)
- 🔗 **Propagates** capability across sessions, agents, teammates, and machines in real time
- 📁 **Intercepts** file operations on `~/.deeplake/memory/` through a virtual filesystem backed by SQL
- 📝 **Summarizes** sessions into AI-generated wiki pages via a background worker at session end
- ☁️ **BYOC**: keep data in your own GCS, Azure, S3, or on-prem bucket. [See Security & storage](#security--storage)

## Benchmarks

On the [LoCoMo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17753) long-context memory benchmark (100 QA pairs, Claude Haiku via `claude -p`, hybrid lexical + semantic retrieval), Hivemind cuts cost, tokens, and turns versus a no-memory baseline:

| Metric            | Baseline | Hivemind | Improvement      |
|-------------------|----------|----------|------------------|
| Cost / 100 QA     | $8.94    | $6.65    | **25% cheaper**  |
| Tokens / question | 1,700    | 1,008    | **1.7× fewer**   |
| Turns / question  | 8.9      | 6.2      | **31% fewer**    |

The agent reaches the answer in fewer turns with less context, because the prior work is already in scope at recall time, not re-derived per session.

## Quick start

One command, all your agents.

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deeplake.ai/hivemind.sh | sh
```

**Windows** — in PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://deeplake.ai/hivemind.ps1 | iex
```

**Any platform, via npm** — for CI and Dockerfiles, or where policy blocks
piping a downloaded script to a shell. Skips the checks the installers do, so
Node 22+ and a writable npm prefix are on you:

```bash
npm i -g @deeplake/hivemind && hivemind install
```

The installer detects every supported assistant on your machine (table below), wires up the hooks, and shows a one-line consent prompt before opening a browser for sign-in. Restart your assistants after install.

**Headless / CI installs:** pass an API token instead of using the browser flow:

```bash
HIVEMIND_TOKEN=<your-token> hivemind install
# or
hivemind install --token <your-token>
```

Get a token from your account settings on https://deeplake.ai. With no token in a non-interactive shell, the install completes with hooks but skips sign-in; run `hivemind login` later to enable shared memory.

**Install for a specific assistant only:**

```bash
hivemind install --only claude
hivemind claude install    # equivalent
hivemind codex install
hivemind claw install
hivemind cursor install
hivemind hermes install
hivemind pi install
hivemind claude_cowork install   # Alpha
```

**Check what's wired up:**

```bash
hivemind status
```

**Supported assistants:**

| Platform         | Integration                                      | Auto-capture | Auto-recall |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Claude Code**  | Marketplace plugin                               | ✅           | ✅          |
| **OpenClaw**     | Native extension                                 | ✅           | ✅          |
| **Codex**        | Hooks (`hooks.json`)                             | ✅           | ✅          |
| **Cursor**       | Hooks (`hooks.json` 1.7+)                        | ✅           | ✅          |
| **Hermes Agent** | Shell hooks (`config.yaml`) + skill + MCP server | ✅           | ✅          |
| **pi**           | Extension API (`pi.on(...)`) + skill + AGENTS.md | ✅           | ✅          |
| **Claude Cowork** 🅰️ | MCP server (Claude Desktop)                  | 🅰️ Alpha¹    | ✅          |

🅰️ **Claude Cowork is Alpha.** Auto-recall (the `hivemind_search` / `read` / `index` tools) is solid. ¹Auto-capture covers **Local Agent Mode** sessions only — those write a transcript we can tail; plain desktop-chat turns leave no readable local trace and aren't captured ([why](#claude-cowork-alpha)).

### Alternative install paths

<details>
  <summary><b>Claude Code plugin marketplace</b></summary>

If you prefer Claude Code's native plugin marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add activeloopai/hivemind
/plugin install hivemind
/reload-plugins
/hivemind:login
```

Auto-updates on each session start. Manual update: `/hivemind:update`.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>OpenClaw ClawHub</b></summary>

```
openclaw plugins install clawhub:hivemind
```

Then type `/hivemind_login` in chat, click the auth link, and sign in.

#### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/hivemind_login` | Sign in via device flow |
| `/hivemind_capture` | Toggle capture on/off |
| `/hivemind_whoami` | Show current org and workspace |
| `/hivemind_orgs` | List organizations |
| `/hivemind_switch_org <name>` | Switch organization |
| `/hivemind_workspaces` | List workspaces |
| `/hivemind_switch_workspace <id>` | Switch workspace |
| `/hivemind_update` | Check for plugin updates |

Auto-recall and auto-capture are enabled by default. Data is stored in the same `sessions` table as Claude Code and Codex.

#### Coexistence with `memory-core`

Hivemind runs **alongside** OpenClaw's built-in `memory-core` plugin. It does **not** claim the memory slot, so `memory-core`'s dreaming cron (`"0 3 * * *"`) and other memory-slot-dependent jobs keep working. Hivemind captures session activity and exposes its own commands; `memory-core` keeps owning recall/promotion/dreaming.

#### Troubleshooting

- **Hivemind seems slow or unresponsive.** Check the agent model in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `agents.defaults.model`. Hivemind makes many small tool calls per turn; a large reasoning model like Opus will feel sluggish. Recommended default: `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`.
- **`openclaw model <id>` says "plugins.allow excludes model".** The `model` plugin CLI is disabled by default. Edit `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` directly (key `agents.defaults.model`) and restart the gateway: `systemctl --user restart openclaw-gateway.service`.
- **Model switch rejected as "not allowed".** Use the exact dated provider-prefixed ID (`anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`). Legacy IDs like `claude-3-5-haiku-latest` and unprefixed bare IDs are not on OpenClaw's allowlist.
- **Self-update via Telegram fails with "elevated is not available".** `tools.elevated.allowFrom` must include `telegram` before elevated commands work from that channel. Safer alternative: run the upgrade in a local shell with `openclaw plugins update hivemind`.
- **`npm error EACCES` during self-update.** OpenClaw was installed under a root-owned npm prefix (e.g. `/usr/lib/node_modules/openclaw`). Reinstall under a user-writable prefix, or run the update with appropriate privileges locally, not via a channel.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Codex (manual)</b></summary>

Tell Codex to fetch and follow the install instructions:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/activeloopai/hivemind/main/harnesses/codex/INSTALL.md
```

Or run the installer script directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/activeloopai/hivemind.git ~/.codex/hivemind
~/.codex/hivemind/harnesses/codex/install.sh
```

Restart Codex to activate.

**First launch — trust the hooks.** Codex shows a **"Hooks need review"** prompt before it will run hivemind's hooks:

```text
Hooks need review
2 hooks are new or changed.
Hooks can run outside the sandbox after you trust them.

   1. Review hooks
 › 2. Trust all and continue
   3. Continue without trusting (hooks won't run)
```

Choose **`2. Trust all and continue`** — otherwise the hooks won't run and hivemind stays inactive.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Cursor (1.7+)</b></summary>

The unified installer wires six lifecycle events in `~/.cursor/hooks.json`: sessionStart, beforeSubmitPrompt, postToolUse, afterAgentResponse, stop, sessionEnd. Hooks fork a Node bundle at `~/.cursor/hivemind/bundle/` per event. Restart Cursor after install to load.

```bash
hivemind cursor install
```

Auto-capture is enabled the same way as Claude Code / Codex / OpenClaw.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Hermes Agent</b></summary>

Wires shell hooks into `~/.hermes/config.yaml` (`pre_llm_call` / `post_tool_call` / `post_llm_call` / `on_session_end`) for auto-capture, drops the bundle at `~/.hermes/hivemind/bundle/`, registers the shared MCP server (`~/.hivemind/mcp/server.js`) under `mcp_servers.hivemind`, and installs `agentskills.io`-compatible skills at `~/.hermes/skills/hivemind-memory/` (recall), `hivemind-goals/` and `hivemind-graph/`. Re-running install (or `hivemind update`) syncs these directories: files a previous version wrote that the current one no longer ships are removed; anything else under `~/.hermes/skills/` is left untouched.

```bash
hivemind hermes install
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>pi (badlogic/pi-mono coding-agent)</b></summary>

Upserts an idempotent BEGIN/END marker block into `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` (auto-loaded every turn) and drops a TypeScript extension at `~/.pi/agent/extensions/hivemind.ts`. The extension subscribes to pi's lifecycle events (`session_start` / `input` / `tool_result` / `message_end`) for auto-capture and registers `hivemind_search`, `hivemind_read`, `hivemind_index` as first-class pi tools.

```bash
hivemind pi install
```

Note: no per-agent SKILL.md is dropped under `~/.pi/agent/skills/`; pi reads skills from both that directory AND the shared `~/.agents/skills/` location. If the codex installer has run on the same machine, pi picks up the hivemind skill from the shared `~/.agents/skills/hivemind-memory` symlink automatically. The AGENTS.md block plus the registered tools cover the action surface in either case.
</details>

### Claude Cowork (Alpha)

[Claude Cowork](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11503834) is Anthropic's agentic assistant inside the Claude Desktop app. It has **no hook lifecycle** like the other agents — it only talks to Hivemind through MCP — so the integration works differently and ships as **Alpha**.

```bash
hivemind claude_cowork install
```

This registers the shared MCP server (`~/.hivemind/mcp/server.js`) under `mcpServers.hivemind` in Claude Desktop's `claude_desktop_config.json`. **Fully quit and reopen Claude Desktop** to load it.

**Recall (stable).** Cowork gains `hivemind_search`, `hivemind_read`, and `hivemind_index` — the same shared memory every other agent reads. On the first tool use per host, a one-time data-collection notice is prepended to the result.

**Auto-capture (Alpha) — how it works.** With no SessionStart/Stop hooks to capture from, the MCP server runs a background ingester that **tails Cowork's Local Agent Mode transcripts** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/**/.claude/projects/<enc>/<sessionId>.jsonl`). For each new line it writes a row to the `sessions` table with `agent="claude_cowork"` (user prompts, assistant messages, tool calls + results), de-duplicated by a per-transcript line watermark. When a transcript has been idle for 5 minutes it is treated as finished, and the same wiki-worker / skillify workers every other agent uses run for it (summary tagged `claude_cowork` → it shows up in `hivemind_index`).

**Known limitation.** <a id="claude-cowork-alpha"></a>Only **Local Agent Mode** sessions (where Cowork opens its sandbox/agent and *works*) write a transcript we can read. Plain **desktop-chat** turns are not captured: by MCP design a server never sees the conversation (only the tool calls the model makes), and the chat itself lives in Anthropic's cloud + a compressed claude.ai IndexedDB cache with no supported read surface. Capturing those would need an official Anthropic export/hook.

### Uninstall

```bash
hivemind uninstall              # remove from every detected assistant
hivemind codex uninstall        # remove from one
```

## How it works

**Capture → Codify → Propagate → Compound.** Every coding-agent interaction (prompt, tool call, response) is captured as a structured trace in Deeplake. A background worker mines traces for repeated patterns and codifies them into `SKILL.md` files, scoped to your workspace. Codified skills propagate into every Hivemind-connected agent's context at inference time. The agent your junior engineer used this morning is sharper because of what your senior engineer's agent figured out last week.

## Features

### 🔍 Natural search

Just ask your agent naturally:

```
"What was Emanuele working on?"
"Search traces for authentication bugs we've solved"
"What did we decide about the API design?"
"Show me skills my team has codified for handling migrations"
```

### 🔒 Privacy controls

Disable capture entirely:

```bash
HIVEMIND_CAPTURE=false claude
```

Disable capture for a specific directory tree (persistent, travels with the repo) by dropping a `.hivemind` file with `{ "collect": false }`. See [Per-directory config](#per-directory-config-hivemind).

Enable debug logging:

```bash
HIVEMIND_DEBUG=1 claude
```

## ⚠️ Data collection notice

This plugin captures session activity and stores it in your Deeplake workspace:

| Data                  | What's captured                    |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| User prompts          | Every message you send             |
| Tool calls            | Tool name + full input             |
| Tool responses        | Full tool output                   |
| Assistant responses   | The agent's final response         |
| Subagent activity     | Subagent tool calls and responses  |
| Codified skills       | Patterns extracted from traces     |

**All users in your Deeplake workspace can read this data.** That's the design. Shared capability requires shared substrate. A DATA NOTICE is displayed at the start of every session. Workspace-level isolation prevents data leakage between orgs.

## Configuration

| Variable                  | Default                   | Description                                |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `HIVEMIND_TOKEN`          | _(none)_                  | API token (auto-set by login)              |
| `HIVEMIND_ORG_ID`         | _(none)_                  | Organization ID (auto-set by login)        |
| `HIVEMIND_WORKSPACE_ID`   | `default`                 | Workspace name or id (`hivemind workspaces`) |
| `HIVEMIND_API_URL`        | `https://api.deeplake.ai` | API endpoint                               |
| `HIVEMIND_TABLE`          | `memory`                  | SQL table for summaries and virtual FS     |
| `HIVEMIND_SESSIONS_TABLE` | `sessions`                | SQL table for per-event session capture    |
| `HIVEMIND_MEMORY_PATH`    | `~/.deeplake/memory`      | Path that triggers interception            |
| `HIVEMIND_CAPTURE`        | `true`                    | Set to `false` to disable capture          |
| `HIVEMIND_CAPTURE_ONLY_CLI` | _(none)_                | Set to `true` to capture only interactive CLI sessions. Sessions spawned by the Claude Agent SDK (Python/TypeScript) are skipped; their `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` is `sdk-py` / `sdk-ts`, so they fail the substring check for `cli`. |
| `HIVEMIND_SKILLIFY_EVERY_N_TURNS` | `20`              | Assistant turns between auto skill-mining attempts. Lower = more frequent mining (cheaper sessions, noisier output); higher = fewer attempts on longer histories. |
| `HIVEMIND_SUMMARY_EVERY_N_MSGS` | `50`                | Captured events between periodic session summaries. The first summary of a session runs at 10 events regardless. Raise it to cut background summary runs. |
| `HIVEMIND_SUMMARY_EVERY_HOURS` | `2`                  | Time-based summary cadence, used when at least one new event has arrived since the last summary. |
| `HIVEMIND_WIKI_WORKER`    | _(none)_                  | Set to `1` to disable the background session-summary worker entirely (no `claude -p` summary runs). Also set automatically inside the worker as a recursion guard. Capture and recall keep working. |
| `HIVEMIND_GRAPH_ON_STOP`  | _(none)_                  | Set to `0` to disable the code-graph rebuild that runs on `Stop` / `SessionEnd`. |
| `HIVEMIND_EMBEDDINGS`     | _(none)_                  | Read once, when `~/.deeplake/config.json` has no `embeddings.enabled` yet: unset or `false` seeds it off, any other value (`true`, `1`, ...) seeds it on. Afterwards only `hivemind embeddings install`/`enable` (persist on) and `disable`/`uninstall` (persist off) change it. |
| `HIVEMIND_DEBUG`          | _(none)_                  | Set to `1` for verbose hook debug logs     |

## Per-directory config (`.hivemind`)

The variables above set **one global identity** for the whole machine. A `.hivemind` file lets a specific directory tree override that: either **route** it to a different org/workspace, or **opt out** of capture entirely.

Routing is symmetric — a routed directory both writes its traces to that workspace **and reads memory from it**. Sessions started under it search, recall, and browse `~/.deeplake/memory` in the routed workspace, and `hivemind whoami` reports it.

Drop a `.hivemind` JSON file at the root of the tree you want to configure:

```json
{
  "orgId": "acme-corp",
  "workspaceId": "client-work",
  "collect": true
}
```

| Field         | Effect                                                                        |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `orgId`       | Route this tree to this org — captured traces **and** memory reads.           |
| `workspaceId` | Route to this workspace.                                                       |
| `collect`     | `false` → **never** capture traces from this tree. Reads still route.          |

Any field may be omitted; omitted fields fall back to your global identity.

`orgId` / `workspaceId` are **identity** (they apply to reads and writes alike); `collect` is a **capture switch** (writes only). The two are independent, which is what makes the read-only recipe below work.

**Three common recipes:**

```jsonc
// route this repo to a client org/workspace — reads and writes both land there
{ "orgId": "acme-corp", "workspaceId": "client-work" }

// never collect traces from this folder (e.g. a personal or sensitive repo)
{ "collect": false }

// read a shared workspace's memory, but never write to it
{ "workspaceId": "client-work", "collect": false }
```

Routing never carries a token — auth stays in `~/.deeplake/credentials.json`, so a `.hivemind` only ever takes effect against orgs your existing login already authorizes. An `HIVEMIND_ORG_ID` / `HIVEMIND_WORKSPACE_ID` set in your environment **wins over** a `.hivemind` for that field; `hivemind whoami` discloses which one is in effect.

### Committed vs local

Two filenames are recognized, mirroring the `.env` / `.env.local` convention every dev already knows:

| File | Commit it? | For |
|------|-----------|-----|
| `.hivemind` | **Yes** (like `.editorconfig`) | The repo declaring where *its* traces belong (or that it's off-limits). Teammates who clone inherit it. |
| `.hivemind.local` | **No** (gitignore it) | *Your personal* override or opt-out, not imposed on teammates. Wins over `.hivemind` in the same directory. |

There's nothing to hide: a `.hivemind` can't carry a token (see below), so committing one is safe. It just declares intent. Use `.hivemind.local` only when a choice is yours alone (add it to your repo's `.gitignore`, like `.env.local`).

A copy-ready template lives at [`.hivemind.example`](.hivemind.example). Run `cp .hivemind.example .hivemind` and edit. (The `.example` file is inert; Hivemind only reads `.hivemind` and `.hivemind.local`.)

### How it resolves

When a session starts, Hivemind walks **up** from the working directory (`cwd`, its parent, its grandparent, and so on) and uses the **first** file it finds (a `.hivemind.local` beats a `.hivemind` in the same directory). Nearest wins; ancestors above it are ignored. This is the `.git`/`.gitconfig` model, **not** `.gitignore`-style merging. There is no inheritance: a leaf file that wants both its parent's org and its own workspace must state both.

```
~/work/.hivemind           { "orgId": "acme-corp" }
~/work/client/.hivemind    { "workspaceId": "sensitive", "collect": false }

session in ~/work/client/svc/  →  uses client/.hivemind ONLY
                                  (collect:false wins; the org above is NOT inherited)
session in ~/work/other/       →  no .hivemind found → global identity
```

**Precedence** is the conventional `env > file > login`: an explicitly-set `HIVEMIND_ORG_ID` / `HIVEMIND_WORKSPACE_ID` overrides a `.hivemind` routing value (that field is left untouched), which in turn overrides your logged-in default. `collect: false` is a fail-safe opt-out and is always honored.

### Safety: routing is disclosed, not hidden

Because a `.hivemind` travels with a repo, cloning someone's repo could in principle point *your* traces at a different org. Two things keep that safe, with no approval step or ceremony:

- **`.hivemind` never contains a token.** Auth stays in `~/.deeplake/credentials.json`, so a routing override can only ever target orgs your existing login **already** authorizes; the API rejects anything else. It can't leak your traces to a stranger's org. At worst it misfiles them into another of *your own* orgs.
- **Every session tells you where its traces go.** The session-start banner prints the **effective** org/workspace after any `.hivemind` overlay, e.g. `org: acme-corp (workspace: client-work) · routed by ./.hivemind`, or `capture is disabled for this directory` when you've opted out. So a redirect is never silent; if it's not what you want, delete the file or add `.hivemind.local`.

### Interaction with `org switch` / `workspace switch`

`hivemind org switch` and `hivemind workspace switch` change your **global default** (they write `~/.deeplake/credentials.json`). A `.hivemind` is a **pin on top of that default**:

| Location                     | Where traces go                                            |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dir with a routing `.hivemind` | The pinned org/workspace, **unaffected** by `org switch`. |
| Dir with **no** `.hivemind`  | Follows your current global default (i.e. `org switch`).   |
| Dir with `collect: false`    | Nothing captured, regardless of the global default.        |

So `org switch` moves everything that *isn't* explicitly pinned; a pin stays put by design (that's the point of routing a client repo to a fixed org). The session-start banner always shows the **effective** identity for your current directory, so a pinned tree never silently surprises you.

## Semantic search (optional)

Hivemind ships with a local embedding daemon (nomic-embed-text-v1.5) for hybrid semantic + lexical search over `~/.deeplake/memory/`. **Off by default** because the dependency footprint is ~600 MB. Enable with `hivemind embeddings install` (or `hivemind install --with-embeddings`). Without it, search degrades silently to ILIKE lexical-only.

Full guide: **[docs/EMBEDDINGS.md](docs/EMBEDDINGS.md)**.

## Summaries

After each session, a background worker generates an AI-written wiki summary and stores it in the `memory` table alongside its 768-dim embedding. Long sessions checkpoint mid-session every 50 messages or 2 hours (configurable). The wiki worker shells out to the host agent's own CLI (`claude -p`, `codex exec`, `pi --print`, …) so no separate API key is needed. Browse summaries at `~/.deeplake/memory/summaries/`.

Triggers, generation flow, and env-var reference: **[docs/SUMMARIES.md](docs/SUMMARIES.md)**.

## Skills (skillify)

Hivemind **codifies recurring patterns from your team's recent sessions into reusable skills** that propagate to every agent on your team, automatically. An async background worker fires on Stop / SessionEnd, mines recent sessions in scope, asks Haiku whether the activity contains something worth keeping, and writes a `SKILL.md` to `<project>/.claude/skills/<name>/`.

```bash
hivemind skillify                            # show current scope, team, install, per-project state
hivemind skillify scope <me|team>            # who counts as "in scope" for mining
hivemind skillify pull                       # install teammates' skills locally
hivemind skillify unpull                     # remove pulled skills
```

Triggers, generation flow, full `pull` / `unpull` semantics, gate-CLI table per agent, env vars, logs: **[docs/SKILLIFY.md](docs/SKILLIFY.md)**.

## Codebase graph

Hivemind builds a live graph of your codebase from the same traces it captures: files, symbols, imports, and the edges your agents actually traverse during real sessions. Search and recall walk this graph, not just plain text, so "where do we handle auth?" lands on the actual files the team's agents have touched, not just every file that mentions "auth".

</p>

Above: the Hivemind codebase rendered through its own graph feature.

## Code docs (wiki)

From that graph, Hivemind can generate natural-language documentation for a repo — one page per file, plus narrative wiki pages per subsystem — and keep it fresh on every commit. Agents read it (`~/.deeplake/memory/docs/`) to orient before touching code.

```bash
hivemind docs sync              # generate/refresh docs for this repo (asks first)
hivemind docs list              # status: enabled? pages? in sync with HEAD?
hivemind docs auto on|off       # keep docs fresh automatically on each commit
hivemind docs agent [name]      # which host CLI writes the docs (claude|codex|pi|cursor)
```

Generation shells out to a host agent's own CLI (`claude -p`, `codex exec`, …) — no separate API key — and runs **in the background**, so it never blocks. `hivemind install` inside a git repo offers to set this up for you. The agent is resolved as `HIVEMIND_DOCS_LLM_AGENT` (env) > `docs.llmAgent` (config) > auto-detect; per-file docs use a cheap model, wiki pages a stronger one.

## Rules (cross-agent team principles)

Hivemind **shares team rules across every agent in the org**, injected at SessionStart so every claude-code / cursor / hermes session starts knowing them. For personal or team work items with progress tracking, use [Goals](#goals) (VFS-backed) instead.

```bash
hivemind rules add "no DROP TABLE on prod creds"
hivemind rules list                          # latest 10 active
hivemind rules edit <rule-id> "<new text>"   # bumps version
hivemind rules done <rule-id>                # mark closed

# Cross-agent diagnostic / harnesses/pi/openclaw fallback
hivemind context                             # print the injection block on demand
```

**What's injected at SessionStart** (claude-code, cursor, hermes. Codex is
deliberately excluded to keep its user-visible TUI clean; harnesses/pi/openclaw
fall back to `hivemind context`):

```text
=== HIVEMIND RULES (N active) ===
- <rule_id>: <text>
(X more, run 'hivemind rules list' to see all)

=== HIVEMIND HOW-TO ===
- Rules above are team principles. Treat any action that would violate one as a critical error and surface it to the user before proceeding.
- Run 'hivemind rules list' for the full inventory beyond what's shown here.
```

**Env vars:**
- `HIVEMIND_RULES_TABLE`: table name (default `hivemind_rules`).
- `HIVEMIND_CAPTURE=false`: full read-only mode. Skips placeholder + ensure DDL; renderer still injects.

## Goals

Personal / team objectives live in the Deeplake virtual filesystem under `~/.deeplake/memory/goal/<owner>/<status>/<uuid>.md`. Path encodes structure (owner, status, goal_id); the file body holds the human-readable description.

```bash
# CLI fallback for runtimes that can't route VFS writes (cursor/hermes/pi)
hivemind goal add "ship the search bar"
hivemind goal list [--all|--mine]
hivemind goal done <goal_id>
hivemind goal progress <goal_id> opened|in_progress|closed
```

For VFS-capable runtimes (claude-code/codex) the `hivemind-goals` skill creates and edits goals directly via Bash heredoc against the VFS path. `mv` between `opened/`, `in_progress/`, and `closed/` is the canonical status transition.

## Architecture

Per-agent integration mechanisms (marketplace plugin, hooks, skills, native extension) and monorepo structure: **[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

What each trace row records — model, reasoning effort, stop reason, token usage (incl. cache tokens and cost) and per-harness extras, with the capture matrix per agent: **[harnesses/TRACE_MODEL_USAGE.md](harnesses/TRACE_MODEL_USAGE.md)**.

## Roadmap

- **Trajectory export for fine-tuning.** Because traces are stored in Deeplake's tensor format, they're export-ready as PyTorch datasets. Teams running their own open-source models can fine-tune on their org's accumulated trajectories. A handful of advanced customers are already doing this against the trajectories their Claude Code and Codex agents generated.
- **GPU-accelerated dense retrieval at scale.** Local CPU embeddings already ship via the optional nomic-embed daemon (see [Semantic search](#semantic-search-optional)). Next: GPU-accelerated vector search over the full trace store, on by default.
- **Skill versioning and review.** Pre-release human review for codified skills before they propagate org-wide, for teams that want a curation step.
- **More agents.** If your team uses an agent that isn't on the supported-assistants list above, open an issue.

## Security & storage

### Tenant isolation & encryption

- TLS between every agent and Deep Lake. AES-256 on the bytes once they land. Your cloud credentials live in Deep Lake's vault, and Hivemind never sees the raw keys.
- Org and workspace boundaries enforced at the storage layer, not just the API. Sessions never share a row, a partition, or an index with another workspace.
- Disable capture per session with `HIVEMIND_CAPTURE=false`. Delete a workspace and the underlying objects go with it.

### Code-level controls

- SQL values escaped with `sqlStr()`, `sqlLike()`, `sqlIdent()`
- ~70 allowlisted builtins run in the virtual FS; unrecognized commands are denied
- Credentials stored with mode `0600`, config dir with mode `0700`
- Device flow login: no tokens in environment or code

### Bring your own cloud (BYOC)

Hivemind Cloud is the default. When that isn't enough, point Hivemind at storage in your own cloud. We handle the orchestration, data never leaves your perimeter.

## Who builds Hivemind

Hivemind is built and maintained by [Activeloop](https://activeloop.ai), the open-source team behind [Deeplake](https://github.com/activeloopai/deeplake), backed by Y Combinator.

We run Hivemind ourselves, all day, across Claude Code, OpenClaw, Codex, and Cursor. Every benchmark number above came from our own internal eval against the LoCoMo public benchmark. If you're running coding agents at a team or org and want to talk through your setup, drop us a line: [hello@activeloop.ai](mailto:hello@activeloop.ai).
