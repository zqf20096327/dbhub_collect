# dj-lite 💡

>Use SQLite in production with Django

## Overview

Simplify deploying and maintaining production Django websites by using SQLite in production. `dj-lite` helps enable the best performance for SQLite for small to medium-sized projects.

`dj-lite` requires Django 5.1+ because it utilizes the `init_command` and `transaction_mode` [configuration options](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/releases/5.1/#database-backends).

I wrote a [definitive guide to using Django SQLite in production](https://alldjango.com/articles/definitive-guide-to-using-django-sqlite-in-production) which has more details about the actual server setup and operations. It covers [Litestream](https://litestream.io/), deployments, Docker settings, and more.

Also read through the [official Django SQLite notes](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/databases/#sqlite-notes) for additional low-level information.

## Installation

1. Install `dj-lite` with `pip`, `uv`, `poetry`, etc.

```bash
pip install dj-lite

OR

uv add dj-lite
```

2. In `settings.py` add the following.

```python
# settings.py

from dj_lite import sqlite_config

DATABASES = {
  "default": sqlite_config(BASE_DIR),
}
```

3. That's it! You're all set to go with the default configuration.

## Default configuration

```python
{
    "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
    "NAME": base_dir / Path("db.sqlite3"),
    "OPTIONS": {
        "transaction_mode": "IMMEDIATE",
        "timeout": 5,
        "init_command": """PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;
PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL;
PRAGMA temp_store=MEMORY;
PRAGMA mmap_size=134217728;
PRAGMA journal_size_limit=27103364;
PRAGMA cache_size=2000;""",
    },
}
```

## Args and Kwargs

The `sqlite_config` method takes in many arguments to tweak the database settings.

### base_dir: `Path`

The directory where the database file will be stored. Required.

### file_name: `str`

Name of the SQLite database file. Defaults to `"db.sqlite3"`.

### engine: `str`

Django database backend to use. Defaults to `"django.db.backends.sqlite3"`.

### transaction_mode: `TransactionMode`

The transaction locking behavior. Defaults to `TransactionMode.IMMEDIATE`.

### timeout: `int`

Time in seconds to wait for a database lock before raising an error. Defaults to `5`.

### init_command: `str` | None

Custom SQL command to execute when the database connection is created. If `None`, will be generated from other parameters.

### journal_mode: `JournalMode`

The journal mode for the database. Defaults to `JournalMode.WAL`.

### synchronous: `Synchronous`

How aggressively SQLite syncs data to disk. Defaults to `Synchronous.NORMAL`.

### temp_store: `TempStore`

How to store temporary objects. Defaults to `TempStore.MEMORY`.

### mmap_size: `int`

Maximum number of bytes to use for memory-mapped I/O. Defaults to `134217728`.

### journal_size_limit: `int`

Maximum size of the journal in bytes. Defaults to `27103364`.

### cache_size: `int`

Maximum number of database disk pages to hold in memory. Defaults to `2000`.

### pragmas: `dict` | `None`

Additional PRAGMA statements to include in the init command. These will override any conflicting settings from other parameters.

## What is even happening here?

The Django defaults for SQLite are fine for local dev or running tests, but they are not great for production use -- specifically when there are concurrent reads/writes to the database. `dj-lite` tunes SQLite so it can be safely used in production.

### Pragmas

When SQLite opens a database connection, settings (called [`pragmas`](https://sqlite.org/pragma.html)) can be passed in to tune the performance. `dj-lite` comes with highly tuned defaults for these `pragmas`.

```
PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;
PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL;
PRAGMA temp_store=MEMORY;
PRAGMA mmap_size=134217728;
PRAGMA journal_size_limit=27103364;
PRAGMA cache_size=2000;
```

#### What about the foreign_keys pragma?

You might notice that the SQLite `foreign_keys` `pragma` is not included above. That is because it is the one `pragma` that is [always passed in when Django creates a connection to SQLite](https://github.com/django/django/blob/7a80e29feaa675a27bf525164502ebc8ecbdce1a/django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py#L209).

### Transaction Mode

According to the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/databases/#transactions-behavior), SQLite supports three transaction modes: `DEFERRED`, `IMMEDIATE`, and `EXCLUSIVE` -- the default is `DEFERRED`. However, "[to] make sure your transactions wait until timeout before raising “Database is Locked”, change the transaction mode to `IMMEDIATE`."

In my experience, using `IMMEDIATE` has been ok as long as database queries are short.
