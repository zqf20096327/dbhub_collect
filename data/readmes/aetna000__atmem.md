# AtMem

[![Version 2.3.7](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-2.3.7-blue)](./docs/releases/v2.3.7.md)
[![CI](https://github.com/aetna000/atmem/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aetna000/atmem/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**AtMem is a host-neutral Agent Black Box and reversible memory control plane.**

> **AtMem 2.3.7:** Product-owned continuity helps connected workflows reuse completed results, reconcile supported destinations, and stop uncertain work safely. AtFlows 0.1.3 adds attempt visibility and grouped event charts. See the [release note](./docs/releases/v2.3.7.md), [setup guide](./docs/continuity.md), and [recorded evidence](./benchmarks/agent_continuity/reports/product-continuity-20260925.md). Previous benchmarks retain their tested-version provenance.
> It records exact host-observed text and supported multimodal boundaries by default,
> while keeping every claim limited to what the connected agent actually supplied.

Install AtMem once and give OpenClaw, Pydantic AI, LangChain/LangGraph, or a
custom agent governed long-term memory. **AtBot is installed automatically** as
AtMem's private intelligence companion: AtBot proposes and ranks; AtMem alone
authorizes, stores, scopes, injects, corrects, and deletes memory.

## Start here

### 1. Install AtMem and choose memory intelligence

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade atmem==2.3.6
atmem atbot setup
atmem atbot doctor
atmem init
atmem dashboard
```

That one Python installation includes the pinned `atmem-atbot` package and an
always-present local vector index. Do **not** install AtBot separately. During
`atmem atbot setup`, choose local Ollama, a local OpenAI-compatible model, a
hosted provider, or the safe deterministic fallback. API keys stay in
environment variables; AtMem does not save them.

In 2.3.7, `pip install atmem` installs the Python packages only; pip does not
run a post-install downloader. On the first `atmem init`, if compatible Bun is not
already installed, AtMem clearly announces and downloads its pinned official
Bun runtime for AtFlows, verifies the archive against a release-pinned SHA-256,
and stores it under `~/.atmem/runtime/bun`. It does not require administrator
rights or change the global `PATH`. A compatible system Bun is reused instead.
AtFlows may then use network access once to prepare its separately packaged
web runtime. Ordinary AtMem memory operations do not require Bun or AtFlows.

### 2. Connect your agent

#### OpenClaw — fully managed

```bash
atmem openclaw install
atmem control verify
```

AtMem installs the matching npm bridge, discovers OpenClaw agents and
workspaces, starts in safe shadow mode, restarts the gateway, and verifies the
connection. It also offers to download the default local embedding model and
build, verify, and activate its vector epoch. For unattended setup, make that
approval explicit with `atmem openclaw install --allow-model-download`; choose
another Ollama model with `--embedding-model MODEL`. Do not install the npm
package yourself.

Already using AtMem 2.1 with OpenClaw? Upgrade in place:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade atmem==2.3.6
atmem openclaw upgrade
atmem control verify
```

The upgrade command is idempotent. It replaces a running dashboard with the
new Python runtime before refreshing and testing the OpenClaw bridge, so the UI
cannot continue serving the pre-upgrade package version.

For Pydantic AI, LangGraph, or another non-OpenClaw integration, finish an
upgrade by restarting a background dashboard directly:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade atmem
atmem dashboard daemon restart
```

Using `python -m pip` is important: it upgrades the same Python environment
selected by `python`, rather than an unrelated `pip` executable on `PATH`.

#### Pydantic AI — native capability

```bash
python -m pip install 'atmem[pydantic-ai]==2.3.6'
atmem control shadow --host generic --memory-db ~/.atmem/memories.db
```

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from atmem.adapters import AtMemAdapterIdentity
from atmem.adapters.pydantic_ai import PydanticAIAtMemAdapter
from atmem.control import ControlPlaneManager

manager = ControlPlaneManager()
scope = manager.agent_topology()["agents"][0]
identity = AtMemAdapterIdentity(
    agent_id=scope["agent_id"],
    workspace_id=scope["workspace_id"],
    subject_id=scope["subject_id"],
    user_id="authenticated-application-user",  # required only for delegation
)
memory = PydanticAIAtMemAdapter(manager, identity).capability()
agent = Agent("openai:gpt-5-mini", capabilities=[memory])
```

#### LangChain/LangGraph — native middleware

```bash
python -m pip install 'atmem[langgraph]==2.3.6'
atmem control shadow --host generic --memory-db ~/.atmem/memories.db
```

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from atmem.adapters import AtMemAdapterIdentity
from atmem.adapters.langgraph import create_langgraph_middleware
from atmem.control import ControlPlaneManager

manager = ControlPlaneManager()
scope = manager.agent_topology()["agents"][0]
identity = AtMemAdapterIdentity(
    agent_id=scope["agent_id"],
    workspace_id=scope["workspace_id"],
    subject_id=scope["subject_id"],
    user_id="authenticated-application-user",  # required only for delegation
)
memory = create_langgraph_middleware(manager, identity)
agent = create_agent(model="openai:gpt-5-mini", tools=[], middleware=[memory])
```

The framework hooks automate authenticated capture, governed retrieval,
context injection, exposure proof, and turn/tool evidence. When an enabled
delegated-provider registration matches the complete scope, they instead carry
the exact HMAC-authenticated provider workflow through the Pydantic AI or
LangChain/LangGraph model boundary, without also using native AtMem context.
This delegated host path is packaged in 2.2.6. The adapters do not replace
your agent's model, tools, conversation history, or LangGraph checkpoints. See
the [complete framework adapter guide](docs/framework-adapters.md) for async,
multi-agent, and low-level `StateGraph` integration.

### Spec 007 milestone: govern work in progress

AtMem 2.2.6 includes Governed Task State: a separate, revisioned authority
plane for what an agent is doing now, what remains, what is blocked, and
whether completion is allowed. It is **disabled by default** and never turns
temporary task progress into long-term personal memory.

Start one exact scope and inspect it from either the CLI or the dashboard:

```bash
atmem task enable ~/.atmem/memories.db \
  --subject user-1 --agent agent-1 --workspace workspace-1
atmem task start ~/.atmem/memories.db --task-id release-007 \
  --goal "Ship the governed task-state milestone" --actor you@example.com \
  --required-item verify="Run release verification" \
  --subject user-1 --agent agent-1 --workspace workspace-1
atmem task show ~/.atmem/memories.db release-007 \
  --subject user-1 --agent agent-1 --workspace workspace-1
atmem dashboard
```

The dashboard's **Governed tasks** card shows progress, blockers, recent task
decisions, context delivery, the current revision, and guarded lifecycle
actions. Model delivery requires an exact task identity. Pydantic AI may supply
`atmem_task_id` in run dependencies; LangGraph may supply it through
`configurable`; construction-time `identity.for_task("release-007")` remains a
backward-compatible fallback. OpenClaw resolves the owner-authorized current
conversation binding. AtMem never guesses from prompt text or chooses among
open tasks. AtBot may propose a change, but AtMem revalidates and commits it.

See the [Governed Task State guide](docs/governed-task-state.md) for lifecycle,
correction, provenance, expiry, benchmark, and automation examples, and read
the [2.3.6 release notes](docs/releases/v2.3.6.md) before upgrading.

### Prove memory quality locally

```bash
atmem benchmark run --output benchmark.json
```

This offline release gate runs 24 isolated extraction, contradiction, recall,
withholding, injection, privacy, poisoning and fallback cases. Safety must be
perfect; other quality metrics cannot fall below checked-in baselines. Optional
local/hosted profiles, LongMemEval import and fair Mem0 OSS comparison are also
available without adding Mem0 or model SDKs to the base install. See the
[memory benchmark guide](docs/benchmarks.md) for commands and honest limits.
The retrieval and archive improvements from [2.3.3](docs/releases/v2.3.3.md)
remain in [2.3.6](docs/releases/v2.3.6.md), which also strengthens canonical
memory-integrity boundaries while preserving streamlined local startup
and shared-login navigation. Developer opt-in
fusion, scoped graph nomination and matrix reuse are available for evaluation;
broader performance targets remain research, not release claims.

### 3. Review, then activate

Every integration starts in **shadow mode**: AtMem learns and shows what it
would retrieve, but cannot change model context. Review it in the dashboard,
then explicitly enable governed injection:

```bash
atmem dashboard
atmem control status
atmem control activate
atmem control verify
```

If AtBot or its selected model is unavailable, AtMem continues with safe local
capture and hybrid ranking. Memory authority and agent operation do not depend
on a hosted model.

> **Companion boundary:** AtBot is a separately packaged, headless component
> installed and managed by AtMem. It is not an independent agent or a second
> memory authority.

### Optional: delegate context authority

Delegated HTTP transport requires per-instance HMAC request credentials for context and
health. See the
[shared profile and beta migration](docs/contracts/delegated-request-auth-v1.md)
before enabling an older delegated registration.

AtMem uses its own governed retrieval by default. Introduced in 2.2.6, its
explicit, provider-neutral delegated mode supports deployments where another
compatible provider must make the context decision while AtMem owns
host integration and flight evidence.

```bash
atmem delegated register --help
atmem delegated status
atmem delegated enable context-provider:local
atmem delegated doctor
```

Registration is disabled by default and is bound to exact user, agent, and
workspace scopes. On matching turns, AtMem verifies the signed result, injects
the provider's exact bytes once, and separately proves delivery. It does not
run native retrieval after an accepted delegated decision. Provider failure
withholds context unless the operator explicitly registered native fallback.
See the [delegated context-provider guide](docs/delegated-context-provider.md).

AtMem also ships provider-side adapters, each as an independent optional extra:

```bash
# Mem0 chooses context; AtMem verifies and records delivery
python -m pip install 'atmem[mem0]'
atmem provider init mem0-local --kind mem0 --mode oss --port 8788

# Or use an application-owned LangGraph / Pydantic AI factory
python -m pip install 'atmem[langgraph-provider]'
atmem provider init graph-context --kind langgraph \
  --factory myapp.memory_graph:build_graph --port 8789

python -m pip install 'atmem[pydantic-provider]'
atmem provider init ai-context --kind pydantic-ai \
  --factory myapp.memory_agent:build_agent --port 8790
```

`atmem provider init` creates private signing material and prints the exact
registration command; it does not enable delegated authority. See the
[context-provider adapter quick starts](docs/context-provider-adapters.md).

It gives agent runtimes one governed memory source and one tamper-evident record
of what the host observed: memory considered and injected, model boundaries,
tool requests and completions, turn termination, and linked external outcome
receipts. OpenClaw is the first fully automated adapter. Other runtimes connect
through the generic control MCP contract.

AtMem starts in **shadow mode**. It records memory candidates and flight
evidence but never authorizes memory injection. An operator can review the
evidence, activate AtMem explicitly, and return to shadow at any time. The
OpenClaw adapter additionally copies native memory, freezes it during takeover,
and restores it exactly.

## Installation details

```bash
python -m pip install atmem==2.3.6
atmem --version
```

AtMem requires Python 3.10 or newer. It always creates a dependency-free local
vector sidecar. `atmem openclaw install` can automatically prepare an Ollama
embedding model, while the semantic extra adds local sentence-transformer
choices:

```bash
python -m pip install 'atmem[semantic]==2.3.6'
```

For repository development, install both workspace packages:

```bash
python -m pip install -e './packages/atbot[dev]' -e '.[dev]'
atmem atbot setup
```

The authority modules remain model-agnostic and do not import AtBot. The AtMem
distribution requires the separately packaged, exactly pinned AtBot companion,
whose built-in Ollama and OpenAI-compatible client uses only the Python standard
library. Framework SDKs enter the environment only through explicit extras.

## Integration boundaries

| Runtime | Start command | What AtMem supplies | What the runtime supplies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Any custom agent, CLI, or SaaS worker | `atmem control shadow --host generic` | memory governance, shadow/active policy, flight store, verification, audit, CLI, MCP, dashboard | authenticated identity and truthful model/tool/context hooks |
| OpenClaw | `atmem openclaw install` | all generic capabilities plus automated native-memory copy, hook installation, gateway checks, activation, and restore | the OpenClaw runtime |
| Memory engine only | `atmem mcp` or Python `Memory` | canonical memory, recall, provenance, lifecycle, deletion, and audit | all agent-flight and prompt-boundary integration |

The dashboard is a view over the same local state used by CLI and MCP. It is
not a separate source of truth.

## Connect any agent runtime

Start a generic control plane against the same canonical database used by the
memory MCP server:

```bash
atmem control shadow --host generic --memory-db ~/.atmem/memories.db
atmem control mcp
```

The host MCP is deliberately non-administrative. It exposes capture, prepare,
context-exposure confirmation, flight-event recording, adapter sync/status,
and cannot approve memory, acknowledge findings, or activate AtMem.
Approving a generic shadow candidate writes the reviewed fact into the bound
canonical database, so `atmem mcp`, CLI, operator MCP, and dashboard see the
same active record and record ID.

For every turn, the runtime must:

1. assign stable agent, workspace, session, run, and turn identifiers;
2. capture authenticated user memory candidates;
3. call `control_prepare` before the model request;
4. inject the returned context only when `inject` is exactly `true`;
5. confirm the exact exposure after constructing the model request;
6. record model input/output, each tool request/completion, and turn end;
7. bind an outcome receipt when an independent system proves a real-world result.

See the [generic adapter contract](docs/generic-adapter.md) for tool names,
multi-agent scopes, event requirements, and trust boundaries.

## Operate AtMem

The operator CLI, operator MCP, and loopback dashboard call the same manager
operations:

```bash
# Read state and verify integrity.
atmem control status
atmem control verify
atmem control memory-sync
atmem control memory-status

# Inspect and decide memory.
atmem control memory-reviews
atmem control memory-search "preferred editor"
atmem control memory-record RECORD_ID
atmem control memory-review RECORD_ID approve
atmem control memory-audit --since 2026-08-15T00:00:00Z
atmem control memory-audit --format ndjson --output audit.ndjson

# Inspect, export, and acknowledge agent flights.
atmem blackbox runs --limit 50
atmem blackbox story RUN_ID
atmem blackbox verify RUN_ID
atmem blackbox export RUN_ID --format json --output flight.json
atmem blackbox ack RUN_ID ATTENTION_CODE

# Initialize local sign-in and manage encrypted evidence privileges.
atmem init
atmem users create audit.viewer viewer
atmem users create incident.team investigator
atmem users create evidence.team evidence_collector
atmem evidence status

# Explicit influence control.
atmem control activate
atmem control restore
```

To expose those same administrative operations to a trusted local operator
client, run:

```bash
atmem control operator-mcp
```

Do not expose the operator MCP to an agent or untrusted network. It can approve
or reject memory, acknowledge findings, configure generic agent scopes, export
evidence, activate AtMem, and return it to shadow.

## Dashboard

```bash
atmem dashboard daemon start   # http://127.0.0.1:8766/
atmem dashboard daemon open
atmem dashboard daemon status
atmem dashboard daemon restart
atmem dashboard daemon stop
atmem dashboard daemon remove  # service metadata only; memory remains
```

The dashboard shows a concise action timeline first. A flight node is green
when no active finding remains, amber when it needs review, and red when the
observed run failed or its evidence is incomplete. Selecting a node reveals
the request/reply when a protected local adapter reader can supply them,
memory used, tools and websites, model/provider, tokens, latency, risks,
blocking reason, outcome evidence, hashes, and the full timeline. Findings can
be acknowledged without deleting or rewriting evidence.

The governed-memory chat remains the primary dashboard surface. AtBot provider,
model, endpoint, lifecycle, and fallback controls are kept in a collapsed
**Memory intelligence** settings row. The browser renews an expired local CSRF
session once and retries the mutation; persistent failure asks the user to
refresh rather than exposing a raw security error.

Memory search, review, record history, audit filters, downloads, agent topology,
verification, activation, and return-to-shadow use the same operations as the
CLI. The canonical dashboard API is `/api/memory/*`; legacy `/api/mirror/*`
paths remain aliases for older local clients.

The dashboard binds only to loopback and requires a local AtMem account. It uses
HttpOnly sessions, checks origin and CSRF on mutations, and should not be placed
behind a public reverse proxy.

## Multiple agents and workspaces

Generic runtimes register persistent agents explicitly:

```json
[
  {"agent_id":"main","name":"Main","workspace":"shared","is_default":true},
  {"agent_id":"research","name":"Research","workspace":"shared"},
  {"agent_id":"private","workspace":"private","parent_workspace":"shared"}
]
```

```bash
atmem control configure-agents agents.json
atmem control agents
```

Agents in the same workspace share one memory subject. Different workspaces
are isolated. A parent relationship records nesting but does not merge memory.
Every capture, prepare, and flight event can carry agent, workspace, and subject
identity. OpenClaw topology is discovered from OpenClaw configuration and bound
to the verified memory mirror; generic topology is explicit and local.
Temporary child runs may reuse a registered workspace and subject. They do not
create a new durable scope implicitly; register them when they need persistent
identity or isolated memory.

## Install and migrate OpenClaw

Do not install the npm bridge separately. The Python installer owns the version
pair and validates the result:

```bash
atmem openclaw install
atmem control status
atmem control verify
atmem dashboard daemon start

# Activate only after review.
atmem control activate

# Test restoration without changing live state, then restore when required.
atmem control restore --drill
atmem control restore
```

Existing 2.1 installations upgrade without starting a new migration:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade atmem==2.3.6
atmem openclaw upgrade
atmem control verify
```

The upgrade retains the current shadow or active mode, refreshes the pinned
bridge, restarts the gateway, records a self-test flight, and restores the
previous bridge if verification fails.

`atmem openclaw install` installs the pinned npm bridge, binds the exact Python
executable, copies `MEMORY.md` and `memory/*.md` across detected persistent
agent workspaces, starts shadow synchronization, restarts the gateway, and
verifies the loaded integration. Rerunning it refreshes an existing shadow
migration without replacing the original restore snapshot.

See [OpenClaw setup](docs/openclaw-setup.md), the
[OpenClaw control-plane guarantees](docs/control-plane.md), and the
[OpenClaw bridge package](integrations/openclaw/README.md).

## Encrypted Agent Black Box evidence

When the recorder is configured, new capture defaults to encrypted full fidelity:
exact text, context, model exchange, tool arguments/results and ordered file,
image, audio and video parts are sealed in the protected evidence vault. The
legacy evidence table retains compatible digests and bounded operational
projections; it never receives the exact reserved payload. New and migrated control
stores are application-encrypted as a whole, so those projections and their metadata
are not readable by opening the file as SQLite. Other historical or external
plaintext sources must still pass the inventory and verified-cleanup gate before an
installation claims complete metadata-at-rest protection.

The Settings page presents this as one compact **Evidence protection** row.
Turning **Data** off retains encrypted metadata and labels new runs not
reconstructable. Turning the **Recorder** off stores no new evidence. Neither
control creates plaintext storage.

Evidence privileges are deliberately separate from agent/API admin headers:

- **Viewer** sees content-free metadata, hashes, integrity and coverage only.
- **Investigator** can decrypt, view, play and reconstruct exact evidence inside AtMem.
- **Evidence Collector** can additionally export plaintext after exact
  confirmation and manage evidence settings. Viewer and Investigator plaintext
  export always fails.
- **Administrator** has ultimate local evidence access and manages local users,
  roles and password resets.

`atmem init` prints the first Administrator's temporary password once. The
dashboard uses username/password sign-in and forces that password to change.
`create-test-accounts` remains a compatibility command for automated tests;
its bearer tokens are not the normal dashboard experience.

### Portable AtMem Home

All new durable state resolves from one AtMem Home (`ATMEM_HOME`, otherwise
`~/.atmem`). New installations use `config/`, `identity/`, `memory/`, `evidence/`,
`artifacts/`, `migrations/` and disposable `runtime/`/`indexes/` directories under
that root. Exact media is retained twice inside AtMem's encrypted boundary: in the
protected evidence document as the disaster-recovery authority and in the
content-addressed artifact vault for verification and deduplication.

```bash
atmem home status
atmem home verify
atmem restore /path/to/copied-atmem-home
```

On another computer, `atmem restore` opens the copied home against a disposable
runtime binding. Sign in with an Administrator account contained in that copy; the
source agent, OpenClaw media directory and host logs are not required. Restore/open
does not silently migrate evidence. Existing 2.3 prerelease layouts use an explicit,
copy-first conversion:

```bash
atmem home migrate --home ~/.atmem /path/to/new-portable-home
atmem home verify --home /path/to/new-portable-home
atmem home migrate --home ~/.atmem /path/to/new-portable-home --commit
atmem home adopt --home /path/to/new-portable-home
```

Stop AtMem and connected agent writers before copying or migrating. Migration
streams an inventory, copies and verifies each known durable store, journals its
phase and never deletes the source. Adoption requires the copied Administrator,
rotates sessions and changes only machine-local bindings; historical evidence IDs,
hashes and artifact bytes are not rewritten.

### Legacy evidence projection

The table below describes the compatible content-minimizing projection. By
itself it is not sufficient to replay or reconstruct a run after the originating
agent/logs are lost; authorized reconstruction reads the encrypted vault.

The runtime can record these content-minimizing event types:

| Boundary | Retained evidence |
| --- | --- |
| turn input | digest, size, counts, correlation IDs |
| context disposition | injected, empty, withheld, failed, or not applicable; receipt and record IDs |
| model input/output | provider, model, digests, latency, tokens, bounded usage metadata |
| tool request/completion | tool name, argument/result digests, safe key names, duration, error category |
| turn end | success, failure, cancellation, or incomplete state |
| external outcome | opaque receipt ID, digest, status, and safe metadata supplied by a verifier |

A verified flight proves retained chain integrity and closure of the boundaries
the runtime reported. It does not prove that a hook was truthful, semantically
validate an answer, or prove email delivery, payment settlement, or a database
change without independent system-of-record evidence.

Raw prompts, replies, tool parameters and tool results are not stored in this
legacy projection. SHA-256 digests are fingerprints, not encryption or
anonymization. Exact values are available only through authorized AtMem evidence
operations when the protected full-fidelity boundary captured them.
See the [Agent Black Box guide](docs/agent-blackbox.md).

## Use the memory engine directly

```python
from atmem import Memory

memory = Memory("memories.db")
memory.remember("user-1", "My preferred editor is Vim.", session_id="s1")
records = memory.recall("user-1", "preferred editor", limit=5)
verification = memory.verify("user-1")
memory.close()
```

Or run the model-agnostic memory MCP server:

```bash
atmem mcp --db ~/.atmem/memories.db --subject user-1
```

MCP tools: `memory_remember`, `memory_observe`, `memory_recall`,
`memory_recall_decision`,
`memory_get_record`, `memory_get_source`, `memory_recall_block`,
`memory_persona`, `memory_context_pack`, `memory_capture`, `memory_list`,
`memory_forget`, `memory_forget_artifact`, `memory_promote`, `memory_audit`,
`memory_verify`, `memory_graph_status`, `memory_graph_merges`,
`memory_graph_history`, and `memory_log_action`.

See the [integration guide](docs/integration-guide.md),
[audit search](docs/audit-search.md), [semantic search](docs/semantic-search.md),
and [multimodal observations](docs/multimodal-observations.md).

## Data, privacy, and recovery

- Canonical memory, provenance, lifecycle state, and audit evidence use SQLite.
- Every persistent 2.2 memory database has a rebuildable local vector sidecar.
  Its active epoch participates in governed candidate nomination, but every
  vector match is checked against canonical scope, status, digest, exclusions,
  sensitivity, and generation before use. Higher-quality embedding libraries
  and model downloads remain optional.
- In full capture mode, available external media bytes are copied into encrypted
  AtMem evidence and its content-addressed artifact vault before capture is claimed;
  the host reference is provenance, not a recovery dependency. Metadata/off modes
  are visibly non-reconstructable.
- External observations remain quarantined until an operator approves them.
- Rejected, superseded, or tombstoned memory is excluded from ordinary search and recall.
- Forget cascades through canonical, graph, media, and vector-derived state and returns a receipt.
- Generic return-to-shadow stops future context injection but does not undo past model outputs or tool actions.
- OpenClaw restore verifies and reinstates the preserved native configuration and files; it also cannot undo past outputs or external actions.

## Development verification

Material features use the repository's GitHub Spec Kit Lean workflow. See
[Spec-driven development](docs/spec-kit.md) for feature directories, Codex
skills, and the constitution-backed delivery sequence.

AtMem and its separately packaged AtBot companion share this repository. They
remain separate processes and communicate only through the loopback companion
protocol; neither package imports the other's runtime code.

In 2.2, AtMem declares the exactly pinned AtBot
companion as a required distribution dependency. A clean package installation
will install it automatically after both 2.2 distributions are published;
repository development uses the editable command above. Model setup remains an
explicit user decision:

```bash
atmem atbot setup       # interactive local, hosted API, custom, or skip choice
atmem atbot providers   # list profiles, defaults, and API-key environment names
atmem atbot doctor      # verify runtime, provider, protocol, and safe fallback
```

The dashboard exposes the same provider, model, endpoint, start, stop, and safe
fallback controls in a collapsed settings row below governed-memory chat. It
also shows the equivalent CLI command, so a user can switch between the UI and
terminal without reading a separate setup guide. Local choices include Ollama and any loopback
OpenAI-compatible server. Hosted profiles include OpenRouter, OpenAI, DeepSeek,
xAI Grok, Anthropic Claude, Hugging Face, and a custom HTTPS OpenAI-compatible
endpoint. Configuration stores only the environment-variable name containing a
key; it never stores the key itself. Choosing **Use safe fallback** is remembered
and leaves AtMem's deterministic local ranking active.

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]' -e './packages/atbot[dev]'
python -m pytest -q
python -m pytest -q packages/atbot/tests

cd integrations/openclaw
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run smoke
```

The latest stable release is **2.3.6** with matching OpenClaw bridge source
**2.3.6**. Release validation requires exact Python/bridge alignment; AtBot
retains its independent stable compatible version **0.1.0** and AtFlows remains
**0.1.3**.
