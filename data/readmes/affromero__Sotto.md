# Sotto

### Practice a language before the pressure of speaking.

Open source language-learning infrastructure you run yourself, with a full **[CEFR](https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages/level-descriptions) course** built around _your_ work, interests, and the situations you want to rehearse.<br/>Your progress, your data, your models, on a stack **you** control.

## Quick Start

Install and start Docker with Compose v2, then run this in a terminal on Linux or macOS. On Windows, use a WSL2 terminal with Docker Desktop integration enabled:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://sotto.fm/install.sh | bash
```

The installer pulls the pre-built images, asks how to connect your AI (an API key, your local **Claude Code or Codex CLI** with no key, or your Claude agent on a VPS over SSH), writes config to `~/.sotto`, and starts everything. Local CLI login refreshes travel through a networkless credential-sync sidecar that copies only the CLI auth JSON into the app containers.

The installer checks image availability before changing configuration and pins a matching web and worker release. It asks for the first Admin profile and shared password locally before the web app opens. OpenAI can supply generation and speech with one key. Other agents need a separately configured speech provider for listening and speaking.

**Desktop controls:** Unsigned preview launchers for macOS `.dmg`, Windows `.exe`, and Linux `.AppImage` are available from **[sotto.fm/download](https://sotto.fm/download)**. Install the stack with the terminal command above first. Sotto Host starts and stops that installation. Your OS may require an explicit security override. On Windows, the launcher must be pointed at the installation inside WSL; using the browser from WSL is the simpler path.

1. Open the local URL and enter the shared password set during installation. You can save a passkey when prompted or skip it, then choose the Admin profile.
2. Configure languages and providers.
3. Take the placement test and start your first class.

Manage it from `~/.sotto`: `docker compose logs -f`, `docker compose down`.

Update with `sotto-host update`. See the [installation and troubleshooting guide](docs/03-self-host-deployment.md#install-on-your-computer) if Docker, image downloads, or startup fail.

For the full self-hosted journey, see [User Flows](docs/06-user-flows.md): start the stack, create a course, take a class, use the iPad workbook, connect devices, and maintain the deployment.

## Why Sotto?

Every serious language app is closed, hosted, and subscription-funded. Your progress, your vocabulary, and the model that teaches you all live on someone else's servers.

The social side is its own barrier. Private tutoring, classroom speaking, and conversation exchange can be valuable, but they also put learners on the spot with a stranger or a room waiting. Sotto gives them a private rehearsal loop first.

There is also learning-tool fatigue. Sotto should not feel like another AI language chatbot with an empty prompt box. It wraps the models you already run in a structured course, practice, memory, and teacher follow-up loop.

**Sotto inverts that.** You run the application, database, and files, connect your own Claude or Codex, and choose the context it can use. Content sent to configured cloud AI, speech, search, or storage providers is processed under those providers' terms; local providers can keep processing on infrastructure you control.

> **The differentiators**
>
> - **Taught in your own context:** connect your agent and grant the context you choose: notes, goals, and what you're working on. Lessons, readings, and listening are drawn from _that_, not generic content.
> - **Low-pressure rehearsal:** repeat speaking, writing, and listening practice privately before you try it with a teacher, tutor, classmate, or stranger.
> - **Not another AI chatbot:** learners get classes, prompts, recordings, rubrics, review queues, and memory practice instead of another blank chat window.
> - **You own the learning stack:** run it with your keys, your database, and your files. No Sotto account holds your progress hostage.
> - **Pedagogy over gamification:** mastery gates use [retrieval practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect); adaptive listening uses [comprehensible input](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis) (Krashen's _i+1_); the memory graph uses [SM-2](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm) [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition). Progress is measured by demonstrated mastery, not streaks.
> - **Bring your own stack:** LLM, TTS, STT via explicit provider selection, BYOK, or a keyless local agent. You pay your providers directly; nothing is billed through the build you run.

## What You Get

A complete CEFR course across **five graded skills**, on a stack you control:

|               |                                                                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Grammar**   | Multiple-choice drills with elaborative feedback from your connected LLM                    |
| **Reading**   | Graded passages with comprehension checks + vocabulary extraction                           |
| **Listening** | An adaptive audio episode generated + narrated by your TTS, seeded with your due vocabulary |
| **Speaking**  | Record when ready → STT → pronunciation scoring with a rubric                               |
| **Writing**   | Free-text tasks graded synchronously with inline AI corrections (old → new + why)           |

The rest of the loop:

- **Classes gated by mastery:** you cannot advance until you pass; failed sections regenerate in a similar form without copying the old one.
- **Ungated practice:** drill any single skill on your own time, driven by spaced repetition and separate from the graded classes. Use it as private rehearsal before live interaction, not as a human replacement.
- **Personal memory graph:** a per course, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) style vocabulary and grammar graph with [SM-2](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm) spaced repetition that drives review, seeds the listening episode, and renders as an interactive [Cytoscape](https://js.cytoscape.org/) visualization.
- **Sourced classes:** build a class from a real article, paper, or YouTube link, or from a topic in your interests. Sotto extracts it, levels it to your CEFR, and teaches from it with verified `[N]` citations.
- **Live conversation:** when you are ready, speak and hear real time translation in either direction through the [Gemini Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live). New words you hit feed straight into your memory graph. Runs on your own Google key in Settings, and stays hidden until you add one.
- **Practice exams:** full, multi section mock exams modeled on each language's flagship ([Goethe-Zertifikat](https://www.goethe.de/en/spr/kup/prf.html), [DELE](https://examenes.cervantes.es/), [Cambridge English](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/), or a generic CEFR mock), with a mock band and feedback by section. Practice only, never an official score, and never changes your level.
- **Notes that shape the course:** tell Sotto your goals and background once; it threads through placement, classes, and practice.
- **Flexible language pairs:** English to German, English to Spanish, and Spanish to English ship as hand authored reference curricula that set the quality bar; other selected native to target pairs are composed by your configured model or agent on demand and cached per pair.
- **iPad workbooks:** a PDF workbook for any class, with cover, class map, reading and writing space, speaking prep, QR links back to the web class, and a server rendered PDF built for GoodNotes style annotation.

## The Learning Loop

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    P([Placement]) --> C
    C["Mastery-gated class<br/><sub>grammar · reading · listening · speaking · writing</sub>"]
    C -->|pass| N([Next class adapts])
    C -->|fail| R[Regenerate a fresh form] --> C
    N --> C
    PR[Ungated practice] --> G
    C --> G[("Memory graph<br/>SM-2 spaced repetition")]
    G -. seeds due vocab .-> C
    G -. due reviews .-> PR
```

Everything a learner does, classes and practice alike, feeds one course scoped memory graph. Due and weak items resurface in the next class's adaptive content and in practice.

## How Sotto Compares

The closest peer is genuinely good: [**OpenLingo**](https://github.com/pretzelai/openlingo) is also open source ([MIT](https://github.com/pretzelai/openlingo/blob/main/LICENSE)), can run on your own stack, and supports BYO LLM, with [SM-2](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm) spaced repetition, [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) speaking exercises, and a similar stack ([Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 16 / [React](https://react.dev/) 19 / [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) 16). Credit where due. **Where Sotto goes further:** a structured CEFR course [gated by mastery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning) across five _graded_ skills, including writing with inline corrections and pronunciation scoring by rubric; a **[keyless local agent](#bring-your-own-claude--codex)** path through Claude Code or Codex; a **[fully offline path](#run-it-100-offline)** with local LLM, STT, and TTS; an interactive memory graph; adaptive listening seeded by your due vocabulary; a first party terminal client; and iPad workbooks.

## Concepts

A quick map of the nouns you'll meet in the app and the code:

| Term             | What it is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Course**       | Your enrollment in one language pair at a CEFR level (say, German-from-English at B1). You can hold several at once; everything below is scoped to a course.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Class**        | A unit of study gated by mastery, roughly an hour's work, built from the five skill **sections**. You cannot advance until you pass, and a failed section regenerates in a similar form without copying the old one.                                                                                                    |
| **Section**      | One skill inside a class: grammar, reading, listening, speaking, or writing. The listening section plays an Episode; the rest are drills, passages, recordings, or writing tasks.                                                                                                                                       |
| **Episode**      | The generated, narrated **audio** a listening section plays: a short script written for your level, seeded with your due vocabulary, and voiced by your TTS. It is the audio unit (the same engine powers any audio Sotto makes), private to you.                                                                       |
| **Lesson**       | A node in the fixed CEFR **curriculum** that sets what a class is about: grammar points, vocabulary themes, and the can do goal. Hand authored references currently cover English to German, English to Spanish, and Spanish to English; other selected pairs are composed by your configured model or agent on demand. |
| **Practice**     | Ungated, single-skill drilling on your own time, driven by spaced repetition. Separate from the graded classes, and it never gates progress.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Exam**         | A full, multi-section **mock exam** modeled on a flagship's format (Goethe / DELE / Cambridge, or a generic CEFR mock). Practice only: a mock band plus feedback, never an official score, and it never changes your level.                                                                                             |
| **Memory graph** | Your per-course vocabulary and grammar with SM-2 spaced repetition. It decides what's due, seeds the next listening Episode, and renders as an interactive graph.                                                                                                                                                       |

> The audio entity is called **Episode** rather than Lesson or Class because those two words were already taken: `Lesson` is the curriculum node and `Class` is the gated unit. Episode keeps the model unambiguous.

## Architecture

```
apps/web          Next.js 16 App Router: web UI, API routes, Prisma schema, Vitest tests
apps/desktop      Tauri launcher: runs the whole stack on your machine, no terminal
tui               sotto: a headless terminal client (Rust): learn from your terminal, tmux friendly
packages/shared   Shared types, Zod schemas, brand copy
packages/mcp      MCP server: exposes Sotto tools to Claude Code / Codex locally
packages/groundcheck       Submodule: domain-aware reference verification
packages/learning-model    Submodule: Bayesian mastery and practice priority
```

> **Prefer the terminal?** `sotto` ([`tui/`](tui/README.md)) is a keyboard driven TUI client for vocab SRS, listening, speaking, classes, exams, and native audio in a single pane. `cargo install sotto-tui` (the installed command is `sotto`), then `sotto login` with a token from the web app's `/settings/devices`.

### Evidence and learning packages

Two small public submodules encode Sotto's evidence models. Recursive clones
and CI checkouts build and test both real implementations.

| Submodule                                                                    | Why it exists                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`affromero/groundcheck`](https://github.com/affromero/groundcheck#readme)   | Domain-aware reference verification. A Nature paper, a Reuters article, and a government report should not be judged by the same citation formula, so `groundcheck` classifies the source domain and combines verification evidence with domain-specific weights/Bayesian scoring. |
| [`SottoFM/learning-model`](https://github.com/SottoFM/learning-model#readme) | Learner mastery and practice recommendation. It models mastery from practice evidence and ranks weak, uncertain, due, or repeatedly missed targets so catch-up practice stays focused on learning value rather than easy repetition.                                               |

The split matters: source verification asks whether a reference is credible; learner
modeling asks whether a person has mastered a skill. Both are probabilistic, but they
use different evidence and should evolve independently.

<details>
<summary><b>Runtime stack</b></summary>

<br>

- **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) 16 + [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) 7:** user data, vocabulary graph, progress via a node postgres driver adapter.
- **[Redis](https://redis.io/) 7 + [BullMQ](https://docs.bullmq.io/):** heavy async work such as generation, scoring, and audio stitching.
- **Explicit provider resolution:** `resolveLearningAi`, `resolveTtsProvider`, and `resolveSttProvider` pick the configured provider, never by key availability.
- **Keyless local agent:** select Claude Code or Codex to route generation through your local CLI with no outbound API key.
- **[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server** (`packages/mcp`): your local agent calls `ingest_agent_output` and other Sotto tools directly.
- **Web + PWA:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [React](https://react.dev/), installable from any browser; a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) desktop launcher runs the stack locally with no terminal.

</details>

## Self-host

### One command (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://sotto.fm/install.sh | bash
```

During install you choose how Sotto reaches your AI:

- **An API key** (OpenAI or Anthropic): simplest.
- **Your local Claude Code or Codex CLI:** bring your own agent; a networkless sidecar snapshots only its auth JSON into the container, no API key.
- **Your agent on a VPS, over SSH:** Sotto runs `ssh you@vps claude ...` for every LLM call (`CLAUDE_CODE_SSH_HOST`), so your data can stay on your machine.

### Keeping it up to date

The installer puts a `sotto-host` command on your PATH:

```bash
sotto-host update              # move to the newest published build
sotto-host update --check      # say what would change, change nothing
sotto-host update --to v0.3.1  # pin a released version
sotto-host update --to 2ce63555 # or an exact commit
sotto-host status              # pinned tag, running version, health
sotto-host rollback            # back to the tag the last update replaced
```

An update dumps the database, refreshes the compose file, pulls the images, runs
migrations, and waits for the health endpoint before calling it done. If the
stack does not come up, the dump and `sotto-host rollback` are both there.
Migrations are forward-only, so a rollback returns the images, not the schema.
The Sidedoor cutover copies installed provider, model, storage, learner, and
encrypted credential state in one transaction while the active release keeps
running. Source tables are removed only after the candidate passes its health
check. A conversion error rolls back the transaction and stops the update.

Installed before this command existed? Fetch it once:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && curl -fsSL https://sotto.fm/sotto-host -o ~/.local/bin/sotto-host && chmod +x ~/.local/bin/sotto-host
```

### From source (contributors)

Prerequisites: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22+, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/affromero/Sotto.git
cd Sotto
npm run setup     # deps, .env.local (BYOK_ENCRYPTION_KEY), Postgres + Redis, schema, seed
npm run dev
```

Then open **[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.

### Run it 100% offline

No cloud key for _any_ layer. The LLM, speech recognition, and speech generation all run on your own hardware. One opt in profile brings up [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (LLM), [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) (STT), and the bundled [Kokoro](https://github.com/hexgrad/kokoro) TTS sidecar:

```bash
docker compose --profile local up -d        # ollama + whisper + kokoro
docker exec sotto-ollama ollama pull qwen3   # any multilingual model: qwen3 / gemma3 / llama3.3
```

Open Sotto's welcome flow or Admin settings and save these connections:

| Capability         | Provider | Base URL                    | Model                                       |
| ------------------ | -------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| AI                 | Local    | `http://localhost:11434/v1` | `qwen3`                                     |
| Speech recognition | Local    | `http://localhost:8001/v1`  | `deepdml/faster-whisper-large-v3-turbo-ct2` |
| Speech generation  | Kokoro   | `http://localhost:8000`     | optional                                    |

Sotto stores provider selection, endpoints, models, voice IDs, and encrypted credentials through Sidedoor. It does not read provider configuration from the process environment. Multilingual support includes **Qwen3 / Gemma 3** for generation, **Whisper large-v3-turbo** for pronunciation, and **Kokoro** for narration. A GPU helps the LLM but is not required. Whisper and Kokoro run comfortably on CPU. A custom local TTS sidecar only needs `GET /health`, `GET /voices`, and `POST /tts`. See [docs/05-provider-extension-guide.md](docs/05-provider-extension-guide.md).

<details>
<summary><b>Bring your own agent or provider credentials</b></summary>

<br>

Choose Claude Code or Codex in the welcome flow when running from source. Optional SSH agent settings remain deployment environment variables because they describe the runtime connection:

```dotenv
# CLAUDE_CODE_SSH_HOST=you@vps
# CODEX_SSH_HOST=you@vps
# SOTTO_AGENT_SSH_KEY_PATH=/home/sotto/.ssh/id_ed25519
# SOTTO_AGENT_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS_PATH=/home/sotto/.ssh/known_hosts
```

You can also select OpenAI for AI, speech generation, and speech recognition, then save one OpenAI credential in the welcome flow. Sidedoor encrypts it and shares it across those capabilities.

`.env.oss.example` defaults to local PostgreSQL, local Redis, local file storage under `.sotto/storage`, and payments disabled.

Dedicated storage ownership connections require `DATABASE_URL` to reach PostgreSQL directly or through session pooling. Transaction pooling cannot preserve their session advisory locks. The standard Compose database connection meets this requirement.

## Your devices and household

The product runs on your own stack: you run it, then reach it from anywhere.

- **Desktop.** _Sotto Host_ (a tiny [Tauri](https://tauri.app) launcher in `apps/desktop/`, from **[sotto.fm/download](https://sotto.fm/download)**) runs the whole stack on your computer with no terminal. Open it, click **Start**, and it brings up the containers and opens the app.
- **Web and PWA.** Installable from any browser. Add to home screen on a phone, tablet, or laptop for full screen access against _your_ server.
- **Terminal.** `sotto` is a headless Rust + ratatui client. Learn from a tmux pane while you code, with native audio playback and mic recording. See [Terminal client](#terminal-client-sotto) below.
- **Reach it from anywhere.** The installer can open a secure public URL with one command (`cloudflared` quick tunnel, no account), or point a domain at the server and let Caddy handle TLS.

**One password, local profiles.** Local setup creates the first Admin profile and shared password before web access. Learners choose a profile after entering that password. Each profile keeps its own courses, progress, vocabulary graph, and keys.

The entry screen shows only Password and Continue. After password entry, Sotto offers to save a passkey with Apple Passwords or another WebAuthn manager. This step is optional. A saved passkey opens the profile picker on later visits. Anyone admitted can select Admin and change settings. Selecting another profile removes Admin access. Admin can revoke passkeys in App access.

If you lose the shared password, run `sotto-host access reset` on the server. The command asks for a new password without echoing it. Reset signs out existing sessions and revokes passkeys.

**Teacher-run mode is the natural classroom shape.** The current profile model already points there: a teacher self-hosts Sotto, creates one profile per student, and keeps practice data on school-controlled infrastructure. The next product layer should add teacher-authored homework, class-prep scenarios, per-student follow-up queues, and reviewable AI feedback so Sotto prepares students between lessons without replacing the teacher.

## Learning surfaces

Sotto is one learning system with deliberately different surfaces. The web app is the interactive, graded class. The iPad workbook is the premium Pencil surface for slow study, annotation, and handwriting. The TUI is the headless terminal surface for learners who want the full loop from a tmux pane.

| Surface                       | Best for                                                             | Interaction model                                             | What feels distinct                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Web / PWA class**           | Guided class work, grading, audio, recording, settings, and progress | Touch, mouse, keyboard, mic, browser audio                    | Live forms, instant feedback, generated listening, speaking submission, writing grading, and advancement gates                                                               |
| **iPad workbook PDF**         | GoodNotes-style study, handwriting, review, and class handoff        | Apple Pencil or stylus on a paginated PDF                     | Paper-like cover and class map, full-page passages, ruled answer space, writing prompts, speaking prep lines, QR cards, and deep links back into the exact web class section |
| **Terminal client (`sotto`)** | Keyboard-first study while coding or working in a shell              | Rust + ratatui, shortcuts, native audio playback, mic capture | Dense single-pane flow, tmux-friendly navigation, local profile switching, and the same `/api/v1` class/practice/exam loop without a browser                                 |

The workbook is intentionally not a web page in disguise. It is generated from the same class contract, but the layout optimizes for Pencil space, page rhythm, and offline annotation. The native iPad app targets iPadOS 18+ so Sotto can use the modern PencilKit toolbar APIs; generated workbook PDFs can still be exported to GoodNotes or another annotation app. The web class remains the source of truth for audio, recording, grading, regeneration, and progress.

## Terminal client (`sotto`)

A premium headless client in `tui/`: the whole platform from a terminal, so you can learn from a tmux split while you code. Pure Rust ([ratatui](https://ratatui.rs)), it talks only to your server's `/api/v1` over HTTP and ships no business logic of its own.

```bash
cargo install --path tui      # builds the `sotto` binary
sotto login                   # redeem a pairing code from Settings -> Devices
sotto                         # launch the TUI against your server
```

- **Everything the web app does:** courses, classes gated by mastery across all five skills, ungated practice, the vocabulary spaced repetition loop, mock exams, and adaptive listening.
- **Audio in the terminal:** segment playback (rodio) and microphone capture for speaking attempts (cpal -> WAV), uploaded for the same async grading the web app uses.
- **Contextual Q&A:** pause a listening segment and ask a question; the answer streams back inline.
- **Accounts:** `sotto accounts`, `sotto switch`, `sotto logout`, and `sotto whoami` manage multiple servers/profiles (stored in `~/.config/sotto`), plus an in TUI switcher.

The typed client is generated from the same Zod schemas the web app uses (`packages/shared` -> OpenAPI -> [progenitor](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/progenitor)), so the contract never drifts. See [`tui/AGENTS.md`](tui/AGENTS.md) and [§9 of the architecture diagrams](docs/07-architecture-diagrams.md).

## Bring your own Claude / Codex

Sotto is built around BYOK from the start, surfaced three ways:

1. **Keyless local agent:** select [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) in Sotto, with no API key. Sotto checks CLI version and login separately, discovers Codex models live, and refreshes local Docker credentials through a networkless sidecar.
2. **[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server:** add `packages/mcp` to your Claude Code or Codex config and call `ingest_agent_output` to push content from any agent workflow straight into Sotto.
3. **BYOK in Settings:** store encrypted per account API keys (LLM, TTS, STT), encrypted at rest with `BYOK_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. You pay your providers; Sotto is the infrastructure layer.

## Status

The full learning loop ships today and runs on your own stack:

- **Clean OSS core:** AGPL-3.0; `.env.oss.example`, `npm run setup`, local storage default.
- **BYOK / own agent:** keyless `claude-code`/`codex`, encrypted per account keys, MCP ingestion.
- **Placement to any language course:** CEFR placement assigns a level and creates a directed course for any native to target pair.
- **Classes gated by mastery** across all five skills, with similar regeneration on failure.
- **Ungated practice + learner notes:** skill practice driven by spaced repetition; notes shape placement, classes, and practice.
- **Vocabulary memory graph:** per course SM-2 graph, Cytoscape visualization, drives review + adaptive listening.
- **Sourced classes:** build a class from a real article, paper, or YouTube link, or from a topic in your interests, leveled to your CEFR with verified `[N]` citations and a sources panel.
- **Practice exams:** full multi section mock exams modeled on each language's flagship (Goethe / DELE / Cambridge) at your level, with a mock band and feedback by section. Clearly unaffiliated practice, never an official score.
- **Live conversation:** live spoken translation (Gemini Live) on your own Google key; new vocabulary feeds the memory graph.
- **Runs 100% offline:** keyless local LLM, STT, and TTS (Ollama / faster-whisper / Kokoro) via `docker compose --profile local`.
- **Households + your devices:** first profile becomes owner, add isolated learner profiles and share the deployment password only with your household; desktop launcher (Sotto Host), installable PWA on any device, one command secure tunnel.
- **Terminal client:** `sotto`, a Rust + ratatui headless client with in terminal audio playback and recording; the full learning loop over `/api/v1`.
- **iPad workbooks:** PDF workbooks for any class; generated by the web app, ready for GoodNotes style annotation, and linked back into the exact web class sections.

**Planned teacher mode:** a teacher-run self-hosted deployment where profiles are students, homework is assigned as private rehearsal, and follow-up summaries make it easy to prepare the next class for each student. This should be teacher-controlled by design: teachers set the goals, sources, rubrics, and review path; Sotto handles repetition and evidence capture.

**Planned optional managed offering:** hosted infrastructure for non technical learners, including workers, storage, scheduled generation, and provider routing as a convenience layer. The learning stack itself stays open and can still run on your stack.
