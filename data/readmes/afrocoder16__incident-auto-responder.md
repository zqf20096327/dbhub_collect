# IT Incident Auto-Responder

*A TiDB Serverless + AI Hackathon Project*

## Overview

The **IT Incident Auto-Responder** is an AI-powered assistant that automatically triages incidents, retrieves similar past cases, generates an action plan, and posts results to Slack, all backed by **TiDB Serverless with vector search**.

It is designed to save engineers time during outages by turning noisy tickets or screenshots into step-by-step resolutions with confidence scoring, external notifications, and full audit trails.

---

## Features

* **Ingestion Pipeline**

  * Loads synthetic tickets (`tickets.jsonl`) and manuals (PDFs) into TiDB.
  * Splits documents into chunks, embeds them with `text-embedding-3-small` (1536-dim), and stores vectors.

* **Hybrid Vector + Metadata Search**

  * Queries embeddings with KNN cosine similarity.
  * Supports structured filters: `service`, `error_code`, `env`, `keyword`.
  * Provides previews of similar past cases (context window).

* **Agentic LLM Planning**

  * Runs incidents through `retrieve_and_plan` and generates JSON with:

    * Action steps
    * Potential risks
    * Confidence score (0–1)
    * Source references (retrieved chunk IDs)
  * Categorizes severity and adds enrichment (system status check).

* **Slack Integration**

  * Posts formatted plan summaries directly to a Slack channel.
  * Confidence thresholds control behavior:

    * `auto_fix`
    * `needs_human`
    * `discard`

* **Audit Trail (TiDB)**

  * Every run is persisted in the `runs` table.
  * Includes retrieved IDs, plan JSON, confidence, and action status.
  * Provides full replay capability with `/runs/{id}/replay`.

* **Minimal Web UI (HTML + Tailwind + JS)**

  * Paste an incident and receive a structured plan with Slack notification.
  * Filter by service, error code, environment, or keyword.
  * View run history (in progress: previews are logged but not always rendering).

## Architecture

1. **Input**: Text incident or OCR-extracted image.
2. **Retrieve**: Hybrid vector and metadata search on TiDB.
3. **Plan**: LLM (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini) generates structured JSON plan.
4. **Notify**: Slack message posted with steps, risks, and confidence.
5. **Persist**: Run saved into TiDB for audit trail and replay.

## Run Instructions

### 1. Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:

```
TIDB_HOST=...
TIDB_PORT=4000
TIDB_USER=...
TIDB_PASSWORD=...
TIDB_DB=incident_ai

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=C...

CONFIDENCE_MIN=0.65
CONFIDENCE_AUTO=0.80
```

### 2. Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Ingest Sample Data

```bash
python app/ingest.py --tickets data/tickets.jsonl --pdf data/manuals
```

### 4. Run the Server

```bash
python -m uvicorn app.server:app --reload
```

### 5. Try It Out

* **Swagger UI** → [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
* **Run an incident**:

```json
POST /run
{
  "text": "AUTH-500 after login on prod",
  "top_k": 5,
  "filters": { "service": "auth", "error_code": "AUTH-500" },
  "post_to_slack": true
}
```

* Check Slack for the triage summary.

## Notes and Known Issues

* Context previews (retrieved chunks) sometimes appear empty in the UI due to vector parameter casting issues, but retrieval works internally as shown in `/run` responses and Slack messages.
* The core pipeline (Ingest → Retrieve → Plan → Slack → Persist) is fully operational.
* Replay, OCR, and Jira integrations are included but are not the primary focus of the demo.

## Why This Project

Incident response is stressful and time-critical. This system:

* Reduces mean time to resolution by surfacing similar cases instantly.
* Produces step-by-step playbooks for engineers under pressure.
* Ensures auditability with every run logged in TiDB.
* Extends easily to other domains such as customer support, supply chain, or study assistance.

This is an agentic workflow that chains:

* Vector search (TiDB Serverless)
* LLM reasoning (GPT-4o)
* External action (Slack bot)

Exactly what the hackathon calls for.
