## Why Erwin's Answers?

![Erwin Brandstetter's Stack Overflow Profile](.github/assets/erwin-profile.png)

Erwin Brandstetter is a PostgreSQL consultant with ~670k reputation and ~7k answers on Stack Overflow.

I’ve lost count of how often a PostgreSQL search has brought me to an Erwin Brandstetter response on Stack Overflow. His answers are reliably thorough and exceptionally clear, and studying them has played a meaningful role in my development as an engineer.

When answering questions, he typically:

- Links to and quotes the PostgreSQL manual, showing you exactly where features are documented
- Notes which features work in which Postgres versions, and updates old answers when new versions add capabilities
- Addresses edge cases you wouldn't think of, like NULL handling, concurrency, race conditions
- Benchmarks multiple approaches with actual timing results

## Why This App?

ErwinDB lets you browse Erwin Brandstetter's answers offline and search them quickly from a TUI. It includes semantic search, syntax highlighting, one-key opening of links in your external browser, and an "Erwin mode" that prominently highlights his posts.
