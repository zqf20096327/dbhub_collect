# AWCMS — Online-First ERP & Business Solutions Template (AWCMS-family superset)

> **AWCMS is the AWCMS-family ERP/back-office template — used DIRECTLY**, developed from the awcms-mini technical base. Its operating mode is **hybrid online + offline with an online-first priority** (online is the primary path; offline/LAN is the resilience mode), and it is **ERP-ready and built for integrated SaaS**. It is the family's **superset** template ([ADR-0035](docs/adr/0035-awcms-online-first-erp-saas-superset-repositioning.md), refining [ADR-0034](docs/adr/0034-awcms-family-direct-use-templates-and-derived-pathway-removal.md)). **The family today is two repos:** this one, and [`ahliweb/awcms-astro`](https://github.com/ahliweb/awcms-astro), which carries **public pages + a USER admin surface** ([ADR-0070](docs/adr/0070-peran-keluarga-awcms-astro-memikul-publik-dan-admin-user.md)); `awcms-mini` and `awcms-micro` are **ARCHIVES, discontinued** ([ADR-0055](docs/adr/0055-development-confined-to-awcms-and-awcms-astro.md)). The base provides **reusable foundation modules + neutral ERP-readiness contracts** ([ADR-0020](docs/adr/0020-erp-extension-readiness-contracts.md)); domain modules — ERP and website/content alike — are added **directly in `src/modules/`**, not a separate derived repo. Absorption map (now a **historical note** — the port path was closed by ADR-0055): [`docs/awcms/absorb-awcms-micro-roadmap.md`](docs/awcms/absorb-awcms-micro-roadmap.md). See also [`docs/awcms/erp-extension-contracts.md`](docs/awcms/erp-extension-contracts.md).

> **Status: foundation actively developed.** Legacy code files in this repo have already been removed (see commit `chore(foundation): remove legacy repository files`) and this repo has been **rebuilt from scratch** on a modular-monolith technical standard (Bun + Astro 7 + PostgreSQL/RLS). Twenty-one modules are already live (the authoritative list is the registry in [`src/modules/index.ts`](src/modules/index.ts); see [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the current code state) — ten foundation modules, ten website/content modules (`theming`, `media-library`, `blog-content`, `tenant-domain`, `visitor-analytics`, `data-lifecycle`, `seo-distribution`, `form-drafts`, `site-search`, `comments`), plus `idn-admin-regions` (Indonesian administrative-region master data, [ADR-0046](docs/adr/0046-idn-admin-regions-module-admission.md)) — as a **foundation** for ERP, SaaS, and website/e-commerce development — not just a generic CMS/base, and not a finished ERP either.

## Why this repo was rebuilt

In short: the old repo ran on Node.js + Vite/React + Supabase, and every
component was moved in stages to a new runtime and architecture (ADR-013…023)
before the legacy files were removed — not to retire the repo, but to clear the
ground.

The full account, including the migration commit list and the before/after
technology-base table, is in
[`docs/awcms/sejarah-repo.md`](docs/awcms/sejarah-repo.md). It moved there
because a README should answer "what is this, now" — and history piling up at
the front slowly buries that answer.

## Direction: awcms-mini technology base, ERP-foundation scope

This repo **adopts the stack and technical standard from [awcms-mini](https://github.com/ahliweb/awcms-mini)** — AhliWeb's _modular monolith standard_ — as its technology base, then **develops** it toward ERP scope; awcms-micro's website/e-commerce cluster **has been absorbed as far as it landed**, and the rest is built here under its own admission ADR ([ADR-0055](docs/adr/0055-development-confined-to-awcms-and-awcms-astro.md) §1). **The family under development today is two repos, and only two** ([ADR-0055](docs/adr/0055-development-confined-to-awcms-and-awcms-astro.md)): this repo as the **system of record**, and [`ahliweb/awcms-astro`](https://github.com/ahliweb/awcms-astro) as **public pages + a USER admin surface** ([ADR-0070](docs/adr/0070-peran-keluarga-awcms-astro-memikul-publik-dan-admin-user.md)) — the pair that replaces all three of the old templates at once. `awcms-mini` and `awcms-micro` are **archives**; the "three sibling templates" position ([ADR-0034](docs/adr/0034-awcms-family-direct-use-templates-and-derived-pathway-removal.md)) no longer holds, and what remains of it is the removal of the derived-repo pathway; `awcms` is the ERP/back-office lineage template, now positioned as **online-first hybrid, ERP + integrated-SaaS ready, and the family superset** ([ADR-0035](docs/adr/0035-awcms-online-first-erp-saas-superset-repositioning.md)). This repo's focus is providing the **foundation + ERP-readiness contracts + a complete website/e-commerce capability set** (partly originating in awcms-micro as provenance; [`docs/awcms/absorb-awcms-micro-roadmap.md`](docs/awcms/absorb-awcms-micro-roadmap.md) reads as a list of needs, not a port queue), and ERP domain modules are added **directly in `src/modules/`** when the template is used:

- **Reusable foundation modules** — tenant, identity/access (RBAC/ABAC/RLS), central profile, sync/outbox, workflow, reporting, observability, etc. — used as-is by the domain modules built on top of them.
- **Neutral ERP-readiness contracts** — passive data shapes, capability ports, and event payload schemas (business transaction, posting, period-lock, item/currency/UoM, inventory movement, reporting projection — [ADR-0020](docs/adr/0020-erp-extension-readiness-contracts.md)) that are **implemented/consumed by ERP modules added directly in `src/modules/`** (or by other family templates), not given their logic by the base itself.
- **Business-integration framework** — the same offline-first-safe outbox/queue pattern + provider adapters (e.g. payment gateways, marketplaces, tax/Coretax, logistics) as the mounting point for domain connectors built on top of this template.
- **Multi-tenant/multi-entity scale** — RBAC/ABAC/RLS + tenant/legal-entity/organization-unit boundaries ([ADR-0013](docs/adr/0013-extension-layers-and-boundary-model.md)) reused across domain modules.

Actual ERP domain modules (finance/GL, inventory/warehouse, procurement, manufacturing, HR/payroll) and business verticals (POS, school portal, etc.) are **added directly in this template's `src/modules/`** when it is used ([ADR-0034](docs/adr/0034-awcms-family-direct-use-templates-and-derived-pathway-removal.md)) — not in a separate derived repo. (The former [`docs/awcms/derived-application-guide.md`](docs/awcms/derived-application-guide.md) guide is now **DEPRECATED**.)

Reusable base modules (Tenant, Identity, Profile, Access/RBAC-ABAC, Sync, Workflow, Reporting) from awcms-mini are used as-is as the foundation; ERP domain modules and business integrations are developed **directly on top of that foundation, in this template's `src/modules/`** — not in a separate derived repo ([ADR-0034](docs/adr/0034-awcms-family-direct-use-templates-and-derived-pathway-removal.md), superseding ADR-0022).

  end

  ADM --> API
  APP --> API
  API --> MW --> MOD
  MOD --> PG
  MOD --> EVT
  MOD -. outbox/queue .-> PROV
  EVT -. consumes contract .-> ERP
```

These foundation modules do not implement ERP logic — they only provide neutral contracts (events, posting request/result, period-lock, etc.) that are **consumed** by ERP modules added directly in `src/modules/`. External business providers connect via **outbox/queue**, not a direct transaction path, so critical flows keep running when an external connection has issues (ADR-0006).

## Hybrid online-first principle

`awcms`'s operating mode is **hybrid online + offline with an online-first priority**: online connectivity is the primary path and deployment default (synced multi-branch, public portals, provider integrations). Offline/LAN capabilities (HMAC outbox/sync, [ADR-0006](docs/adr/0006-offline-first-sync-outbox.md)) remain present and supported as a **resilience mode** when connectivity drops — not the primary assumption like `awcms-mini`, which is offline-first. Data flow stays idempotent and safe to reconcile when back online:

```mermaid

```

## Stack

- Runtime: **Bun** ([ADR-0002](docs/adr/0002-bun-only-runtime.md) — Bun-only; Node.js only via a written, maintainer-approved exception)
- Web framework: **Astro 7** (SSR on Bun, `@astrojs/node` as adapter)
- Database: **PostgreSQL** with **RLS FORCE** ([ADR-0003](docs/adr/0003-postgresql-rls-multi-tenant.md))
- Architecture: **Modular monolith, microservice-ready** ([ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-rebuild-on-awcms-foundation-erp-scope.md))
- Operating mode: **Hybrid online-first** — online is the primary path; offline/LAN is the resilience mode, optional sync outbox ([ADR-0006](docs/adr/0006-offline-first-sync-outbox.md))
- Security baseline: **RBAC + ABAC default-deny + PostgreSQL RLS + Audit Log** ([ADR-0004](docs/adr/0004-rbac-abac-default-deny.md))
- Contracts: **OpenAPI** + **AsyncAPI**, versioned independently from the package release ([ADR-0007](docs/adr/0007-openapi-asyncapi-contracts.md), [ADR-0008](docs/adr/0008-independent-contract-and-module-versioning.md))
- Family model: **two repos** — `awcms` (system of record, every SYSTEM admin screen) + `awcms-astro` (public pages + USER admin when declared) ([ADR-0055](docs/adr/0055-development-confined-to-awcms-and-awcms-astro.md), [ADR-0070](docs/adr/0070-peran-keluarga-awcms-astro-memikul-publik-dan-admin-user.md)); **direct-use templates, domain modules in `src/modules/`** ([ADR-0034](docs/adr/0034-awcms-family-direct-use-templates-and-derived-pathway-removal.md), superseding the derived pathway of ADR-0013/0022); `awcms` = **online-first hybrid & superset** ([ADR-0035](docs/adr/0035-awcms-online-first-erp-saas-superset-repositioning.md)); tenant/entity boundaries & service-extraction criteria remain from [ADR-0013](docs/adr/0013-extension-layers-and-boundary-model.md)

## Core principles

1. Foundation modules are **reusable as-is** by every domain module built on top — not rewritten per use.
2. ERP-readiness contracts are **passive and neutral** (data shapes, capability ports, event schemas) — actual ERP business logic does **not** live in this base ([ADR-0020](docs/adr/0020-erp-extension-readiness-contracts.md)).
3. Multi-tenancy requires `tenant_id`, **RLS FORCE**, tenant context, and default-deny ABAC on every tenant-scoped table/endpoint.
4. External business providers (tax, payment, logistics, etc.) must not become a critical-path dependency and must never be called inside a DB transaction — always via outbox/queue.
5. Sensitive data (passwords, session tokens, personal/business identifiers) must be hashed/masked/redacted — never stored/logged raw.
6. Deletable master/config data uses **soft delete**; default lists hide `deleted_at`, restore requires permission and is audited ([ADR-0005](docs/adr/0005-soft-delete-and-immutability.md)).
7. Documentation, migrations, API/event contracts, tests, and agent skills follow the real implementation — not the other way around.
8. Backend is **Bun-only**; Node.js exceptions only with maintainer approval + documented note.

## Document package

The master document package lives in [`docs/awcms/`](docs/awcms/README.md) — adapted from the `docs/awcms-mini/` package in the [awcms-mini](https://github.com/ahliweb/awcms-mini) repo, tailored to a broader ERP-foundation scope:

- **01–13** planning → contract → execution; **14–18** technical design; **19** glossary; **20** threat model & security architecture; **21** module admission governance.
- **Important note:** many documents in this package use ERP/retail domain examples as **illustration** — the pattern is reusable, the entities/endpoints/screens are examples that domain modules in `src/modules/` swap or extend for their own domain needs. See [`docs/awcms/README.md`](docs/awcms/README.md) for translation status and other important notes.
- **Architectural decisions** are recorded in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/README.md) (`0000`–`0070` currently; `0000` is the template).
- **Current code state** (not a plan): [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## For contributors

1. Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — technical work contract, mandatory rules, security guardrails.
2. Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) — contribution flow, setup, commit conventions, Definition of Done.
3. Use the **project skills** in [`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills/) so standards are applied consistently (one skill per topic: migration, endpoint, ABAC guard, audit log, testing, etc.).
4. Work **atomically** per issue; add a migration when the schema changes, OpenAPI when the API changes, AsyncAPI when an event changes.
5. Validate (`bun run check` — the main CI gate; the full sub-check chain and its order are documented in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md#validasi-sebelum-pr) and `package.json`'s `check` script — not duplicated here to avoid drift) before opening a PR. For non-trivial UI changes, add/run a real browser E2E separately — `bun run test:e2e` (Playwright + Bun), needs a live app + `DATABASE_URL`.

## Implementation status

Twenty-one modules are live in code — the authoritative list is the registry in [`src/modules/index.ts`](src/modules/index.ts), with per-module detail in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and each module's own README at `src/modules/*/README.md`. Foundation: `logging` (audit trail), `tenant-admin`, `profile-identity`, `identity-access` (login, sessions, RBAC/ABAC, MFA/OIDC/SSO, business-scope, SoD, admin write CRUD — Issue #166/#171), `module-management` (per-tenant enable/disable, enforced on every request), `domain-event-runtime` (cross-module event publisher), `sync-storage` (HMAC-signed outbox/inbox, conflict resolution, R2 object queue), `workflow-approval`, `email` (dispatch + templates), `reporting` (projections + export). Website/content: `theming`, `media-library`, `blog-content` (absorbed `news-portal` — [ADR-0044](docs/adr/0044-merge-news-portal-into-blog-content.md)), `tenant-domain`, `visitor-analytics`, `data-lifecycle`, `seo-distribution`, `form-drafts`, `site-search`, `comments`. System: `idn-admin-regions` (versioned Indonesian administrative-region master data — [ADR-0046](docs/adr/0046-idn-admin-regions-module-admission.md)). The admin SSR shell (`/admin/*`) provides read + write (create/edit/soft-delete/restore) screens across all of the above. Website/e-commerce capabilities that do not exist yet are **built here under their own admission ADR**, not ported from an archive repo ([ADR-0055](docs/adr/0055-development-confined-to-awcms-and-awcms-astro.md)); [`docs/awcms/absorb-awcms-micro-roadmap.md`](docs/awcms/absorb-awcms-micro-roadmap.md) now reads as a list of needs, not a port queue.

Full change history is in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md); current issue/PR status is on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ahliweb/awcms/issues) (work is tracked directly as GitHub issues, not a static backlog).

## Security

- Vulnerability reporting policy: [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) (use private vulnerability reporting — **not** a public issue).
- Threat model & security architecture: [`docs/awcms/20_threat_model_security_architecture.md`](docs/awcms/20_threat_model_security_architecture.md).
- Automation: Dependabot, CodeQL, GitHub secret scanning + push protection, GitGuardian, CI hygiene (Bun-only + no-secret).

## Versioning

**Semantic Versioning** + **[Changesets](.changeset/README.md)**; full history in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). Every PR that changes behavior must include a changeset (enforced by `bun run changesets:policy:check` in CI). Current release version is `6.4.0`.

**Version numbering policy (important, read before comparing versions):**

- The package release version (`package.json`, this README) uses a deliberate legacy major-number line — jumping directly from `0.2.0` to `5.0.0` per maintainer decision, NOT a tool-computed SemVer increment, so version comparisons across the rebuild never look like a downgrade from the last legacy tag (`v4.6.0`). **`5.0.0` and above are NOT backward-compatible with any legacy `v2.x`–`v4.x` release** — the entire codebase was rewritten from scratch on a new foundation. See [ADR-0024](docs/adr/0024-semver-numbering-continues-legacy-major-line.md).
- **Contract** version (`info.version` in OpenAPI/AsyncAPI) and **module descriptor** version/status (`src/modules/*/module.ts`) follow their own independent SemVer policy, not mechanically tied to the package release version. See [ADR-0008](docs/adr/0008-independent-contract-and-module-versioning.md).
