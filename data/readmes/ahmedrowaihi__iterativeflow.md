Durable, backend-agnostic workflows for TypeScript.

Write a flow as an ordinary async function; it survives process crashes, retries failed steps, sleeps
for days, and resumes deterministically by replaying memoized steps. The same engine runs behind a
four-port `Backend` interface — **Postgres, SQLite, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, DynamoDB, Cloudflare
Durable Objects, or in-memory** — resident or serverless. Published under the `@iterativeflow/*` scope.

```ts
import { createEngine, defineFlow } from "@iterativeflow/core";
import { createPgBackend, pgPool } from "@iterativeflow/postgres";
import { Pool } from "pg";
import { z } from "zod";

const Survey = z.object({ score: z.number() });

const onboard = defineFlow({
  name: "onboard",
  version: 1,
  signals: { survey: Survey }, // any Standard Schema: typed and validated
  run: async (ctx, input: { userId: string }): Promise<{ score: number }> => {
    await ctx.step("create-account", () => createAccount(input.userId));
    await ctx.sleep(3 * 24 * 60 * 60_000); // 3 days, durable
    const survey = await ctx.signal("survey"); // typed { score: number }
    return { score: survey.score };
  },
});

const engine = createEngine(createPgBackend(pgPool(new Pool())), [onboard]);
const stop = engine.run(); // resident worker loop; returns a stop fn

const handle = await engine.submit(onboard, { userId: "u_1" });
// 3 days later, from a webhook:
await engine.signal(handle, "survey", { score: 9 });
const { output } = await engine.result(handle, { timeoutMs: 30_000, output: Survey }); // { score: 9 }
await stop();
```

That run lives in your backend for three days. Workers can crash, deploys can roll, the process can be
killed and restarted — when the timer fires, the flow resumes from where it left off, replaying the
memoized `create-account` step instead of re-running it.

- **Steps** memoized by `(runId, cursor)` — `ctx.step(label, fn)`, the unit of at-least-once execution
- **Sleeps** and external **signals** lasting days — `ctx.sleep(ms)` / `ctx.signal(name)`
- **`ctx.invoke(child, input)`** for child flows, and `ctx.invoke([…])` for parallel fan-out + join
- **Typed contracts** — signal payloads and outputs are typed by Standard Schemas that also validate
  them, and `engine.signal` checks signal names and payloads at compile time
- **At-least-once** via a transactional outbox committed with each step; a reconciler re-drives
  anything stranded by a crash
- **Serverless or resident** — `engine.run()` for a worker loop, or `serverlessTick` for one bounded
  cycle per Lambda/Vercel/Cron invocation
- **Structured concurrency** — a run that terminates without success cancels its descendants

## How it works

One engine, four ports, one datastore. The engine runs your flow, and each step commits its result and
its side effects — child spawns, enqueues, timers — in a single transaction (the outbox), so a crash
never leaves state and its follow-up out of sync. On restart the engine replays the flow from the
start; memoized steps short-circuit, so only un-run work executes again.

    wakeup["Wakeup<br/>completion nudge"]
  end
  backend --> db[("one datastore:<br/>Postgres · SQLite · MySQL · Mongo · Redis · DynamoDB · DO")]
```

Every backend implements those four ports and passes the same conformance suites — the executable
definition of a correct backend — so swapping one for another changes only the `create*Backend(...)`
call.

### Which backend?

- **`memory`** — tests, examples, a single-process app.
- **`postgres`** — the default: strong consistency, push completion via `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, works on
  serverless/pooled Postgres.
- **`sqlite`** — embedded or edge, one file or Turso/libsql; zero server.
- **`durable-objects`** — the edge, strongly consistent per object, no external database.
- **`redis`** — low-latency, single-node (Valkey/Dragonfly work too).
- **`mysql` / `mongodb` / `dynamodb`** — when that store is already your stack.

See [patterns/backends](patterns/backends) for each backend's setup, tuning, and gotchas.

## Install & quick start

```bash
npm install @iterativeflow/core @iterativeflow/memory
```

```ts
import { createEngine, defineFlow } from "@iterativeflow/core";
import { createMemoryBackend } from "@iterativeflow/memory";

const double = defineFlow<{ x: number }, number>({
  name: "double",
  version: 1,
  run: async (ctx, input) => ctx.step("d", () => input.x * 2),
});

const engine = createEngine(createMemoryBackend(), [double]);
const stop = engine.run();
const handle = await engine.submit(double, { x: 21 });
const res = await engine.result(handle, { timeoutMs: 5_000 });
await stop();
// res.output === 42
```

Swap `createMemoryBackend()` for `createPgBackend(...)`, `createSqliteBackend(...)`, etc. — nothing
else changes. Each backend's guide covers its connection setup and `applySchema`.

## The flow context

Inside `run`, `ctx` is the durable surface; every call is a checkpoint:

- `ctx.step(label, fn)` — run `fn` once; memoize its result and replay it on every later attempt.
- `ctx.sleep(ms)` — suspend and resume after a durable timer.
- `ctx.signal(name)` — park until an external `engine.signal(runId, name, payload)` (or
  [`@iterativeflow/webhooks`](packages/webhooks)) delivers a typed payload.
- `ctx.invoke(flow, input)` — run a child flow and await its output; pass an array to fan out in
  parallel and join outputs in order.

Replay assumes the body is stable: each step memo records a shape fingerprint, and a redeploy that
reorders the body triggers the flow's `driftPolicy` (park or fail) instead of running the wrong step.
Keep step order and labels stable across deploys; bump `version` when the body changes meaningfully.

### Builder (fluent, typed)

Prefer a chain? `builder` compiles to the same `ctx.step` — each `.step` result is added to a typed
accumulator (`acc.account`, `acc.survey`) that later steps and the output projection can read. Sleeps,
signals, and invokes happen through `ctx` inside a step (there are no separate chain nodes for them):

```ts
import { builder } from "@iterativeflow/core";

const onboard = builder<{ userId: string }>("onboard", 1)
  .step("account", (acc) => createAccount(acc.input.userId))
  .step("survey", async (_acc, ctx) => {
    await ctx.sleep(3 * 24 * 60 * 60_000); // 3 days
    return (await ctx.signal("survey")) as { score: number };
  })
  .output((acc) => ({ score: acc.survey.score }));
```

## Testing a flow that sleeps for days

`@iterativeflow/core/testing` runs the real engine on a virtual clock, so the three-day sleep above
resolves in a millisecond. Time moves only when you move it, and every jump lands exactly on the next
durable deadline — no polling, no fake timers, no guessing how far to advance.

```ts
import { createTestHarness } from "@iterativeflow/core/testing";
import { createMemoryBackend } from "@iterativeflow/memory";

const t = createTestHarness(createMemoryBackend(), [onboard]);

const handle = await t.engine.submit(onboard, { userId: "u_1" });
await t.advanceToNextWake(); // runs up to the sleep, then jumps the 3 days
await t.engine.signal(handle, "survey", { score: 9 });

expect(await t.settle(handle)).toMatchObject({ status: "done", output: { score: 9 } });
```

`settle` drives a run to its terminal outcome, jumping every sleep and retry backoff on the way; if
the run parks on something nothing will deliver, it throws naming what it waited on rather than
hanging. The harness takes any `Backend`, so the same test can run against a real database.
