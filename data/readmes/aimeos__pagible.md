## Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **PHP 8.2+** | Backend language |
| **Laravel 11.x / 12.x / 13.x** | Web framework |
| **Vue.js 3** | Admin panel frontend |

| **Prism / Prisma PHP** | AI/LLM integration |
| **Vite** | Frontend build tool |

## Architecture

PagibleAI CMS is a modular monorepo split into focused sub-packages. Each package
handles a specific concern and can be used independently:

* **Core** provides the data models (Page, Element, File, Version), multi-tenancy, permissions, and migrations
* **Admin** delivers the Vue.js-based admin panel with drag & drop page management
* **GraphQL** exposes the admin API via Lighthouse for content editing
* **JSON:API** provides a read-only frontend API for content delivery
* **AI** integrates LLM providers through Prism/Prisma PHP for content generation, image manipulation, and translation
* **Search** implements a custom Laravel Scout engine supporting FTS5 (SQLite), MATCH/AGAINST (MySQL), tsvector (PostgreSQL), and CONTAINSTABLE (SQL Server)
* **MCP** offers 30+ tools for LLM-driven content management
* **Backup** provides per-tenant backup and restore with media files, integrity verification, and cross-tenant support
* **Import** provides importers from external CMS platforms (WordPress, etc.)
* **Cashier** sells frontend page access through subscriptions or one-time payments using Stripe, Paddle, or Mollie
* **Theme** handles frontend rendering with Blade templates
* **Themes** contains high-quality frontend themes

Pages are organized as a nested set tree (using `_lft`/`_rgt` columns). All content changes are tracked as immutable version snapshots — editors see the latest draft while the public sees the published version. Caching is per-page with configurable duration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* PHP 8.2 or higher
* Composer
* Node.js & npm (for admin panel development)
* A working Laravel 11.x, 12.x, or 13.x installation

### Installation

If you don't have an existing Laravel application, create one first:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel pagible
cd pagible
```

Then install PagibleAI CMS:

```bash
composer req aimeos/pagible
php artisan cms:install
php artisan migrate
```

Fresh Laravel applications contain a static `public/robots.txt` file. Web servers
serve that file before Laravel receives the request. If it contains custom rules,
first copy them into the `robots.txt` configuration element on the root page and
publish the change. Then remove the static file to enable Pagible's dynamic route:

```bash
rm public/robots.txt
```

The dynamic route serves the published rules together with the generated sitemap
and news sitemap URLs. Alternatively, configure the web server to pass
`/robots.txt` to Laravel even when the static file exists.

Now, adapt the `.env` file of your application and change the `APP_URL` setting to your domain. If you are using `php artisan serve` for testing, add the port of the internal web server (`APP_URL=http://localhost:8000`). Otherwise, the uploading files will fail because they wouldn't be loaded!

Add a line in the "post-update-cmd" section of your `composer.json` file to update the admin backend files after each update:

```json
"post-update-cmd": [
    "@php artisan vendor:publish --force --tag=cms-admin --tag=cms-graphql",
    "@php artisan vendor:publish --tag=cms-theme",
    "@php artisan migrate",
    ...
],
```

### Authorization

To allow users to edit CMS content or to create a new users if they don't exist yet, you can use the `cms:user` command (replace the e-mail address by the users one):

```bash
php artisan cms:user -e editor@example.com
```

This adds admin privileges for the specified user. For more information regarding authorization and permissions, please have a look into the [authorization and permission](https://pagible.com/authorization-and-permissions) page.

The CMS admin backend is available at (replace "mydomain.tld" with your own one):

```
http://mydomain.tld/cmsadmin
```

## Selling access to restricted pages

Install exactly one Pagible Cashier provider in the Laravel application that
already contains Pagible CMS:

```bash
composer require aimeos/pagible-cashier-stripe
# or: aimeos/pagible-cashier-paddle
# or: aimeos/pagible-cashier-mollie

php artisan cms:install:cashier
```

For Stripe, an interactive installer offers to create the webhook when
`APP_URL`, `STRIPE_KEY`, and `STRIPE_SECRET` are ready. Automated installations
must opt in with `--webhook`.

Add Pagible's `CashierAccess` trait and the selected provider's `Billable` trait
to the application user model. Then configure the provider credentials and
verified webhooks, define a frontend access value such as `premium-members`, and
run the local readiness check:

```bash
php artisan cms:cashier:check
```

Use that same access value in both places in the CMS admin:

1. Add a `pricing` element to a public sales page and select `premium-members` as
   the package's frontend access role. Add a subscription price, a one-time
   price, or both, then publish the pricing content.
2. Open the page being sold, choose **Access**, select **Restricted**, add
   `premium-members`, and apply the change.

Verified payment webhooks grant and revoke the role automatically. A successful
one-time payment grants permanent access unless it is fully refunded or charged
back. A subscription grants access through its provider-confirmed paid period.
See the [Pagible Cashier guide](cashier/README.md) for the user-model example,
access-catalog setup, provider-specific price fields, webhook configuration,
private files, cancellations, and an end-to-end checklist.

## Configuration

File uploads use the Laravel disk configured by `CMS_DISK` and are public by default. Set
`CMS_PRIVATE_DISK` to a different, non-public Laravel disk to enable the translated
“Protect with page access” option in file fields. Temporary URLs generated by remote private
disks expire after `CMS_PRIVATE_TTL` seconds (300 by default); local private files are streamed
through the access-controlled CMS route.

To generate texts/images from prompts, analyze image/video/audio content, or execute actions based
on your prompts, you have to configure one or more of the AI service providers supported by the
[Prism](https://github.com/prism-php/prism/blob/main/config/prism.php) and
[Prisma](https://php-prisma.org/#supported-providers) packages.

**Note:** You only need to configure API keys for the AI service providers you are using, not for all!

All service providers require to sign-up and create an account first. They will provide
an API key which you need to add to your `.env` file or as environment variable, e.g.:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
CLIPDROP_API_KEY="..."
DEEPL_API_KEY="..."

# Text translation
CMS_AI_TRANSLATE_API_KEY="${DEEPL_API_KEY}"
# For DeepL Pro accounts
# CMS_AI_TRANSLATE_URL="https://api.deepl.com/"

# Analyze content and generate text/images
CMS_AI_REFINE_API_KEY="${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
CMS_AI_WRITE_API_KEY="${GEMINI_API_KEY}"
CMS_AI_DESCRIBE_API_KEY="${GEMINI_API_KEY}"
CMS_AI_IMAGINE_API_KEY="${GEMINI_API_KEY}"
CMS_AI_INPAINT_API_KEY="${GEMINI_API_KEY}"
CMS_AI_REPAINT_API_KEY="${GEMINI_API_KEY}"

# Image manipulation
CMS_AI_ERASE_API_KEY="${CLIPDROP_API_KEY}"
CMS_AI_ISOLATE_API_KEY="${CLIPDROP_API_KEY}"
CMS_AI_UNCROP_API_KEY="${CLIPDROP_API_KEY}"
CMS_AI_UPSCALE_API_KEY="${CLIPDROP_API_KEY}"

# Audio transcription
CMS_AI_TRANSCRIBE_API_KEY="${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
```

For best results and all features, you need Google, OpenAI, Clipdrop, and DeepL at the moment and they are also configured by default. If you want to use a different provider or model, you can to configure them in your `.env` file too. Please have a look into the [./config/cms/ai.php](https://github.com/aimeos/pagible/blob/master/config/cms.php) for the used environment variables.

**Note:** You can also configure the base URLs for each provider using the `url` key in each provider configuration, e.g.:

```php
    'transcribe' => [ // Transcribe audio
        'provider' => env( 'CMS_AI_TRANSCRIBE', 'openai' ),
        'model' => env( 'CMS_AI_TRANSCRIBE_MODEL', 'whisper-1' ),
        'api_key' => env( 'CMS_AI_TRANSCRIBE_API_KEY' ),
        'url' => 'https://openai-api.compatible-provider.com'
    ],
```

**Note:** To protect forms like the contact form against misuse and spam, you can configure [HCaptcha](https://pagible.com/configure-hcaptcha).

## Maintenance

For scheduled publishing, you need to add this line to the `routes/console.php` class:

```php
\Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schedule::command('cms:publish')->daily();
```

To clean up soft-deleted pages, elements and files regularly, add these lines to the `routes/console.php` class:

```php
\Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schedule::command('model:prune', [
    '--model' => [
        \Aimeos\Cms\Models\Page::class,
        \Aimeos\Cms\Models\Element::class,
        \Aimeos\Cms\Models\File::class
    ],
])->daily();
```

## Multi-domain

Using multiple page trees with different domains is possible by adding `CMS_MULTIDOMAIN=true` to your `.env` file.

## Multi-tenancy

PagibleAI CMS supports single database multi-tenancy using existing Laravel tenancy packages or code implemented by your own.

The [Tenancy for Laravel](https://tenancyforlaravel.com/) package is most often used. How to set up the package is described in the [Multi-tenancy SaaS Setup](/multi-tenancy-saas-setup) article.

## MCP API

PagibleAI CMS offers tools within the Laravel MCP API that LLMs can use to interact with the CMS. Please have a look at the [PagibleAI MCP documentation](https://pagible.com/configure-mcp) page for details how to set up the MCP API and Passport for authentication.
