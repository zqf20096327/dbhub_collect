## What It Is

AIPermission is a local, single-user developer gateway. You register connector
targets, keep their credential profiles inside an encrypted local database, and
grant each AI token only the target/profile/action combinations it may use.

| You keep control of | The AI gets |
| --- | --- |
| connector credentials | scoped MCP connector actions |
| project and token visibility | only visible target/profile references |
| Disabled, Prompt, or Always rules | execution after the effective rule is checked |
| local approval decisions | bounded action results and status |
| encrypted history and audit | no raw credential values |

All built-in connectors use the same project, target, credential profile,
permission, approval, history, and audit pipeline. They are connector types
rather than separate product modes. The generated
[connector catalog](docs/connectors.md) is the canonical current list and owns
their capability summaries.

History and audit are encrypted, local, retention-controlled records for the
active database. They are not an immutable external audit archive: configured
retention can delete them, and deleting or replacing the local database removes
its records.

> **Local-only security boundary:** run AIPermission on your own machine and
> keep its published Docker port bound to `127.0.0.1`. It is not a remote
> multi-user service, LAN gateway, hosted control plane, or team RBAC system.
> Do not change the Compose bind to `0.0.0.0`; browser session, Host, CORS,
> and CSRF checks are defense in depth, not remote authentication.

AIPermission is pre-1.0 developer software. Read the
[project principles](docs/project-principles.md), [threat model](docs/security/threat-model.md),
and [credential boundary](docs/security/credential-boundary.md) before using it
with important systems.

## Why

Without a gateway, AI-assisted operations often alternate between generated
commands and pasted terminal output, or expose broad credentials directly to an
agent. AIPermission provides a third path:

1. The developer stores credentials in the local encrypted gateway.
2. An MCP token receives explicit project and connector action permissions.
3. The AI requests a connector action with a reason.
4. The gateway blocks it, asks the developer, or runs it according to the
   current effective rule.
5. Results appear in structured History and Audit; supported runtime connectors
   also expose live local console surfaces.

Connector credentials are used only inside the gateway. They are not returned
through MCP or the normal REST API.

## Quick Start

Requirements:

- Docker with Docker Compose
- Node.js 20+ with npm/npx when using the MCP bridge or developing its package

Start from a full Git checkout so version pinning and repository verification
metadata remain available:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aipermission/aipermission.git
cd aipermission
```

Start from published images:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.release.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.release.yml up -d
docker compose -f docker-compose.release.yml ps
curl --fail http://localhost:3210/health
```

Or build the current source tree:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps
curl --fail http://localhost:3210/health
```

Open:

```txt
http://localhost:3210
```

Both Compose files publish only to `127.0.0.1`. The backend is not exposed as
a separate host port. To use another local UI port:

```bash
AIPERMISSION_FRONTEND_PORT=3211 docker compose up -d --build
```

The release Compose file defaults to the version shipped in the checkout, so
these commands work unchanged in POSIX shells, PowerShell, and Command Prompt.
To run a different release, set `AIPERMISSION_VERSION` in your shell first.
Avoid opting into mutable `latest` when you need reproducible upgrades or
rollback.

```bash
export AIPERMISSION_VERSION=VERSION
docker compose -f docker-compose.release.yml up -d
```

Containers use the `unless-stopped` restart policy. See
[Docker Runtime](docs/setup/docker-runtime.md) for Windows line endings, host
services, logs, and recovery guidance.

Published container images are currently built and validated for Linux AMD64.
ARM64 hosts may use platform emulation or build from source, but native ARM64
images are not yet part of the supported release matrix. If startup or health
verification fails, inspect the first bounded log sample before changing the
gateway bind or deleting local data:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.release.yml logs --tail=100
```

### First Setup

1. Create and unlock an encrypted local database.
2. Create or select a Project.
3. Add a credential profile.
4. Add a connector target and bind its profile.
5. Test the connector.
6. Create an MCP token.
7. Enable the projects that token may discover.
8. Grant target/profile/action rules.
9. Configure the token in the AI client.
10. Start MCP from the sidebar.

Projects organize one developer's local workspace; they are not team tenancy.
See [Projects](docs/projects.md). Project Vault is a separate project-scoped
secret inventory and exact-session application flow; see
[Project Vault](docs/project-vault.md).

## MCP Setup

Install the official MCP bridge into a supported client:

```bash
npx -y @aipermission/mcp@VERSION setup \
  --provider codex \
  --scope user \
  --name aipermission
```

The setup command asks for the API token with a hidden prompt, writes a config
pinned to the package version that created it, and installs the native operator
skill. Restart the AI client after installation.

Validate both paths without printing the token:

```bash
npx -y @aipermission/mcp@VERSION doctor --client codex --scope user
```

Supported client presets and source-development setup are documented in
[MCP Client Setup](docs/setup/mcp-client-setup.md). The MCP tool contract is
documented in [MCP Tools](docs/api/mcp-tools.md).

Replace `VERSION` with the exact published version you intend to pin.
When reading a development branch, use the matching local package build instead
of copying a placeholder command.

## Execution Rules

Each token/target/profile/action permission resolves to one backend rule:

- `blocked`: execution is denied
- `approval_required`: a pending request appears in the local UI
- `always_run`: execution starts after current token, project, target,
  credential, and action checks pass

The UI presents these as Disabled, Prompt, and Always where appropriate. Use
Prompt for real systems until the workflow is trusted. Temporary permissions
can expire automatically. The global MCP Started/Stopped switch is an
additional runtime boundary; saved Always rules do not bypass a stopped MCP
gateway.

Pending approvals carry a context snapshot. Relevant token, permission,
connector, target, credential, dependency, or action changes make the request
stale and require a fresh approval. See
[MCP Permission Flow](docs/architecture/mcp-permission-flow.md).

## Security Model

Important boundaries:

- Runtime data is stored in a SQLCipher-encrypted local SQLite database.
- Connector-profile credentials stay gateway-owned and are not exposed as
  credential data to the AI client. Permitted target output remains untrusted;
  see the [credential boundary](docs/security/credential-boundary.md) for the
  exact class-specific response and redaction contract.
- MCP clients authenticate with scoped API tokens, not connector credentials.
- Web mutations require the unlocked local browser session and CSRF checks.
- Connector outputs, command text, mail content, paths, and notes are untrusted
  data and may contain secrets.
- Gateway-held credentials and correctly declared sensitive fields use a
  mandatory boundary; pattern matching for arbitrary output remains
  best-effort. See the
  [redaction guarantee matrix](docs/security/credential-boundary.md#redaction-guarantee-matrix),
  and do not intentionally print credentials into action output or console
  transcripts.
- Always is for intentional trusted automation, not a substitute for least
  privilege.
- Downloaded encrypted database backups remain sensitive and require a strong
  database password.
- The unlocked backend process and trusted browser profile are part of the
  local security boundary.

Canonical detail:

- [Security Policy](SECURITY.md)
- [Threat Model](docs/security/threat-model.md)
- [Credential Boundary](docs/security/credential-boundary.md)
- [Storage Encryption](docs/security/storage-encryption.md)
- [Backup And Restore](docs/security/backup-restore.md)
- [Native Dependencies](docs/security/native-dependencies.md)

## Backup And Migration

The UI can download and import encrypted `.aipdb` database files. The optional
self-hosted AIPermission Backup provider stores versioned encrypted database
streams without receiving the database password or encryption key. See
[AIPermission Backup](docs/providers/aipermission-backup.md).
Recovery-grade database and transfer downloads require a browser with a native
streaming Save dialog so the UI never buffers an unknown-size encrypted
artifact in memory. Other bounded downloads can use the response-stream
fallback, which buffers at most 64 MiB. Browsers without response streaming
cannot safely download through this UI.

Version 0.2.0 established the connector-native database baseline. Important
0.1.x preview data can be imported with the local one-time migration helper;
the normal gateway intentionally carries no pre-0.2 compatibility shim. See
[Database Migration](docs/setup/database-migration.md).

## Development

Install the independently locked repository verification, frontend, and MCP
packages, then run the standard gates:

```bash
npm ci --prefix scripts --workspaces=false
npm ci --prefix frontend --workspaces=false
npm ci --prefix packages/mcp --workspaces=false
make -f Makefile test
make -f Makefile build
make -f Makefile audit
```

The package-local lockfiles are canonical. Do not run `npm install` at the
repository root or create a root `package-lock.json`.

Full release validation:

```bash
make -f Makefile release-check
```

Useful package checks:

```bash
npm --prefix frontend run lint
npm --prefix frontend run format:check
npm --prefix frontend run test:coverage
npm --prefix frontend run test:e2e
npm --prefix packages/mcp run build
```

Read [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) and
[Development Testing](docs/development/testing.md) before opening a pull
request. Releases use [RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md).

## Developing Connectors

A normal connector adds:

- `backend/internal/connectors/<kind>/`
- `frontend/src/connectors/templates/<kind>/`
- connector metadata, docs, and tests

It must use the generic connector pipeline rather than adding its own
permission, approval, history, audit, or MCP tool family. Runtime-backed
capabilities require reviewed shared adapter contracts.

The complete contract, isolation rules, required frontend slots, credential
schema requirements, and test checklist live in
[Add A Connector](docs/development/add-a-connector.md).

## Documentation

S3 operations preserve exact object keys; see the [S3 transfer identity and
mapping limits](docs/setup/s3.md#object-browser-and-transfers).

[docs/index.md](docs/index.md) is the canonical navigation and ownership index.
Use it for architecture, setup, security, API, connector, operator, and
maintainer documentation.

## Project Status

AIPermission is pre-1.0, local-only developer software. Breaking changes may be
made when they remove technical debt or strengthen the security model, and are
documented in release notes. Only the latest tagged stable release receives
security fixes.

The public roadmap is in [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).

For a reproducible bug, open a [bug report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml).
For a security-sensitive finding, use the private reporting instructions in
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not a public issue. Design proposals can start in
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/aipermission/aipermission/discussions).
