[Try the live app](https://chat-84bee5accbbd.trytofu.app/) — sign in with Google and start a conversation.

Tofu Chat runs on [Tofu](https://trytofu.ai/), which brings hosting, a managed database and Google sign-in together for apps built with a coding agent. Have an app ready to share? [Take it online with Tofu](https://trytofu.ai/).

_These captures use synthetic local data. The interactive preview does not send messages to other accounts._

## Start a conversation

Choose **New chat**, add a friend's Google email, and share the conversation's invitation link. They join by signing in with that verified email. Use spaces for a team or topic, and threads to keep replies together.

You can send images, files and voice messages; edit or delete your messages; add reactions; and find conversations through search, mentions and stars. Drafts stay on your device when enabled. Files can be up to 5 MiB each, with three attachments per message; voice recordings can be up to two minutes.

On iPhone, open the app in Safari, tap **Share → Add to Home Screen**, and enable **Open as Web App** if offered. You can also use the app in an ordinary browser.

Tofu Chat is an independent messenger. Google sign-in does not connect it to Google Chat or import existing conversations. Video and voice calls, background push notifications and automatic offline sending are not included.

## Deploy your own with Tofu

Fork the repository, follow [Tofu's agent setup](https://trytofu.ai/agent), and ask your coding agent:

> Deploy this app on Tofu with a database and Google sign-in.

Tofu connects the hosting and services; your agent builds and checks the app. This is a server app with a database, so it needs Tofu's Pro hosting. See [current plans](https://trytofu.ai/pricing) before deploying.

## Run locally

Use Node.js 22.13 or newer:

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> and choose **Explore demo** to try synthetic conversations without an account. The demo is enabled by default in development; its data stays in that browser. Production disables it unless explicitly enabled for testing.

A connected workspace needs PostgreSQL and Supabase identity settings. Tofu supplies these for the hosted app; [.env.example](.env.example) lists the settings for your own deployment. Self-hosted Google sign-in also needs an authorized Tofu OAuth broker setup; environment values alone do not configure it. Keep populated environment files and credentials out of Git. See [runtime and data handling](docs/runtime.md) for authorization, limits and retry behavior.

## Development

Built with Next.js, React and TypeScript, with PostgreSQL for conversations and Supabase for identity.

```sh
npm run format:check
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:unit
npm run build
```

The test suite includes unit tests, embedded SQL checks, native PostgreSQL and API integration, browser flows, failure injection and screenshot regressions. See [the testing guide](docs/testing.md) for coverage, CI, browser setup and source-bound integration checks. Screenshots detect changes in this app; they do not establish that it matches another product pixel for pixel.
