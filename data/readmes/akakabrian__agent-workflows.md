# Open Agent Workflows

A zero-dependency, stdlib-only Python runtime for **provider-agnostic dynamic
agent workflows** — durable, resumable, and composable from a single script
file.

## Why it exists

Most workflow orchestrators either lock you into a specific model vendor, pull
in heavy SDKs, or mix orchestration logic with HTTP clients.  Open Agent
Workflows does none of that:

- **Provider-agnostic.** The same script runs against the `fake` adapter
  offline, against `claude` (Claude CLI), or against `codex` (Codex CLI)
  with a single `--provider` flag.
- **Zero runtime dependencies.** The core uses only the Python standard
  library — `asyncio`, `sqlite3`, `importlib`, `hashlib`, `json`. No pip
  extras are required to run or develop against it.
- **Durable and resumable.** Every run is recorded in SQLite. On interrupt or
  failure you can `owf resume <run_id>` — read-only calls replay instantly
  from cache; mutating calls re-execute safely.
- **Script-first.** A workflow is a plain `.py` file with an `async def main(args)`.
  No YAML, no DAG builder, no class hierarchy.

## A first workflow

```python
# examples/hello_workflow.py
from workflows import agent, log, meta, phase

meta(name="hello", description="A simple greeting workflow")

async def main(args):
    phase("greet")
    result = await agent(
        "Write a one-sentence welcome message for an AI workflow tool.",
        label="greeting",
    )
    log("done", greeting=result.text)
    return {"greeting": result.text}
```

Run it offline (no model required):

```bash
owf run examples/hello_workflow.py --provider fake --home .workflows
# run_id: 20260528-143201-a3f1
# status: done
# run_dir: .workflows/runs/20260528-143201-a3f1
```

Inspect the result:

```bash
owf status latest
owf output latest
owf calls  latest
owf explain-cache latest
owf report latest --stdout
```

Resume after an interruption:

```bash
owf resume 20260528-143201-a3f1
```

---

## Quickstart in 60 seconds

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akakabrian/agent-workflows.git
cd agent-workflows
pip install -e .

owf new examples/my_first_workflow.py
owf run examples/my_first_workflow.py --provider fake --home .workflows
owf status latest
owf output latest
owf report latest --stdout
```

You just ran a durable, resumable agent workflow without configuring a model provider.

---

## Primitives

Import from `workflows` (short alias) or `agent_workflows` (canonical name).

### `meta()`

Declare workflow name, description, and phases at module level:

```python
meta(name="research", description="Fan-out research workflow", phases=["fetch", "synthesise"])
```

### `await agent(prompt, ...)`

Make a single agent call.  Returns an `AgentResult`.

```python
result = await agent(
    "Summarise the following text: ...",
    label="summarise",         # human-readable name shown in calls/report
    phase="summarise",         # optional phase grouping
    schema={"type": "object",  # JSON Schema — result.value is validated JSON
            "properties": {"summary": {"type": "string"}},
            "required": ["summary"]},
    provider="claude",         # override per-call; default is the run provider
    model="claude-opus-4-8",   # pass through to the provider CLI
    isolation="worktree",      # "none" (default) or "worktree" (fresh git tree)
    cache_policy="auto",       # "auto" | "disabled" | "read_only" | "refresh"
    read_scope=["docs/"],      # declarative, passed to the adapter
    write_scope=["src/"],      # non-empty → mutating; cache bypassed
    timeout_seconds=120,
    cache_namespace="v2",      # isolate cache keys across script versions
)
print(result.ok, result.text, result.cache_status)
# True  "Here is a summary..."  "miss"
```

Key `AgentResult` fields:

| field | type | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `.ok` | `bool` | `True` when the call succeeded and schema (if any) validated |
| `.status` | `str` | `"done"`, `"failed"`, `"schema_failed"`, `"timeout"`, `"provider_failed"` |
| `.text` | `str \| None` | raw text output |
| `.value` | `Any \| None` | validated JSON value when a schema was given |
| `.cache_status` | `str` | `"hit"`, `"miss"`, `"bypassed"`, `"disabled"` |
| `.input_tokens` | `int \| None` | tokens consumed (populated by real providers) |
| `.output_tokens` | `int \| None` | tokens generated |
| `.estimated_cost_usd` | `float \| None` | cost reported by the provider |
| `.worktree_path` | `str \| None` | git worktree path when isolation was used |
| `.changed_files` | `list[str]` | files modified in the worktree |

Helpers: `.require_ok()`, `.value_or_raise()`, `.text_or_raise()`.

Schema validation intentionally supports a small JSON Schema subset rather than
full draft compliance: `type` checks for object, array, string, number,
integer, boolean, and null; object `properties` and `required`; array `items`;
and `enum`.

### `await parallel(thunks, concurrency=None, fail_fast=False)`

Fan out a list of zero-argument async callables and collect results in order:

```python
topics = ["climate", "economy", "health"]
results = await parallel(
    [lambda t=t: agent(f"Summarise recent news on: {t}", label=t) for t in topics],
    concurrency=3,
)
```

With `fail_fast=True`, cancellation is best-effort: the first failed result or
exception stops scheduling new work and cancels still-pending tasks. Calls that
already finished are returned with their normal result; cancelled or unscheduled
calls are returned as `AgentResult(status="cancelled")`.

### `await pipeline(items, fn, stop_on_error=False)`

Process a sequence one item at a time:

```python
results = await pipeline(documents, lambda doc: agent(f"Review: {doc}"))
```

### `phase(name)` and `log(message, **meta)`

Mark the current phase and emit structured log events:

```python
phase("analyse")
log("processing", count=len(items), source="arxiv")
```

### `await workflow(path, args)`

Invoke another workflow script as a nested call, sharing the parent's home
and budget (one level of nesting):

```python
sub = await workflow("steps/fetch.py", args={"url": url})
```

### `budget`

A module-level proxy for the run's token/cost budget:

```python
if budget.can_spend(2000):
    result = await agent("...", label="expensive")

print(budget.spent_tokens, budget.remaining_tokens)
```

## CLI reference

```
owf init                              # initialise the local run store
owf new <path>                        # scaffold a starter script
owf examples                          # list bundled examples

owf prices [--refresh] [--url URL]    # show or refresh the model price table
owf batch {submit|status|fetch|list}  # async batch jobs (~50% off)
owf mcp                               # run an MCP stdio server exposing owf tools
owf doctor                            # local environment diagnostics
owf validate <script>                 # parse + check meta/main
owf dry-run  <script> [OPTIONS]       # preview manifest, no execution
owf run      <script> [OPTIONS]       # execute a workflow
owf resume   <run_id>                 # replay, skipping cached read-only calls
owf runs     [--limit N]              # list recorded runs, newest first
owf status   <run_id|latest>          # run summary
owf output   <run_id|latest>          # print output.json
owf calls    <run_id|latest>          # list call records
owf explain-cache <run_id|latest>     # per-call cache decision explanation
owf report   <run_id|latest> [--html] [--out PATH] [--stdout]
owf artifacts <run_id|latest>         # list stored artifacts
owf cat      <call_id>  [--prompt]    # print a call's output or prompt
```

`run` and `dry-run` accept:

```
--provider {fake,claude,codex,openai,anthropic,gemini,deepseek,openrouter,google}
--model MODEL
--budget-tokens N
--budget-cost-usd N.NN
--cache-policy {auto,disabled,read_only,refresh}
--args-json '{"key": "value"}'
--arg KEY=VALUE            (repeatable)
--json                     (machine-readable output)
--home PATH                (override the .workflows home directory)
--debug                    (print Python tracebacks for errors)
```

`resume` additionally accepts `--provider` and `--model` to override the
original run's provider.

---

## MCP server

`owf mcp` runs a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
server over stdio, so any MCP-capable agent (Claude Code, Codex, and others)
can author, run, and inspect workflows as native tools instead of shelling out
to the CLI. Like the rest of the package, the server is **stdlib-only** — no
`mcp` SDK or other dependency is required.

Register it with Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add owf -- owf mcp
```

Or add it to any MCP client config (`.mcp.json`, Claude Desktop, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "owf": {
      "command": "owf",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `owf_run_workflow` | Execute a workflow script. Args: `path`, `args`, `provider`, `model`, `budget_tokens`, `budget_cost_usd`, `cache_policy`, `home`. |
| `owf_validate_workflow` | Parse a script and return its declared meta without running it. Args: `path`. |
| `owf_dry_run` | Draft a run manifest (provider/model/budget plan) without executing. Args: `path`, `args`, `provider`, `model`, budgets. |
| `owf_status` | Run summary plus call records. Args: `run_id` (or `"latest"`), `home`. |
| `owf_output` | The value returned by `main()` (output.json). Args: `run_id`, `home`. |
| `owf_calls` | List a run's call records (label/phase/status/cache/tokens). Args: `run_id`, `home`. |
| `owf_explain_cache` | Explain each call's cache decision with a reason. Args: `run_id`, `home`. |
| `owf_report` | Render a Markdown or HTML run report. Args: `run_id`, `format`, `home`. |
| `owf_artifacts` | List stored artifacts for a run (kind/call/size/path). Args: `run_id`, `home`. |
| `owf_read_artifact` | Read one artifact file (path-traversal guarded; bounded). Args: `run_id`, `path`, `offset`, `max_bytes`, `home`. Response includes `returned_bytes` + `truncated`. |
| `owf_list_runs` | List recorded runs, newest first. Args: `limit`, `home`. |
| `owf_resume` | Resume a prior run (replays cached read-only calls). Args: `run_id`, `provider`, `model`, `home`. |
| `owf_new_workflow` | Scaffold a starter or example script. Writes confined to `workspace_root` (default cwd) unless `allow_absolute`. Args: `output_path`, `template_name`, `workspace_root`, `allow_absolute`, `force`. |

The "check before running" loop — `owf_validate_workflow` → `owf_dry_run` →
`owf_run_workflow` — lets an agent confirm a script parses and preview its
manifest before spending tokens.

The tools wrap the same runtime functions as the CLI, so they share its
durability, caching, and resume semantics. The default provider is `fake`, so
an agent can exercise the full author → run → inspect loop offline before
wiring up `claude` or `codex`. Each tool accepts an optional `home` to point at
a specific `.workflows` store.

Workflow scripts still run as trusted local Python (see
[Safety](#safety)) — the MCP server adds a tool surface, not a sandbox. Only
register it where you would run `owf` yourself.

---

## Agent skill

[`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) is a ready-to-use agent skill that teaches a model when
to reach for `owf` and how to author, run, inspect, and resume workflows. Drop
it into a skill-aware harness (e.g. as a Claude Code skill) so the agent knows
the script structure, `agent()`/`parallel()`/`pipeline()` primitives, and the
cache-safety rules. The skill pairs naturally with the MCP server above: the
skill supplies the know-how, the MCP tools supply the hands.

---

## Installation

From source (editable install, recommended for development):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akakabrian/agent-workflows.git
cd agent-workflows
pip install -e .
owf --help
```

PyPI package name (once published): `open-agent-workflows`.

Python 3.11 or later is required. No other runtime dependencies.

---

## Providers

Open Agent Workflows ships three kinds of provider, all standard-library only:
an offline fake, local-CLI adapters that reuse a CLI's own auth, and direct HTTP
API adapters that read keys from the environment.

| Provider | Aliases | Kind | Default model | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fake` | `fixture` | Offline, deterministic. Returns schema fixtures or echoes prompts. | — | None |
| `claude` | `claude-cli` | Local `claude` CLI (`claude -p --output-format json`). | CLI default | Reuses the CLI's own auth. |
| `codex` | `codex-cli` | Local `codex exec` CLI with JSONL events. | CLI default | Reuses the CLI's own auth. |
| `openai` | — | HTTP `POST /chat/completions`. | `gpt-5.4-mini` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `deepseek` | — | OpenAI-compatible HTTP API. | `deepseek-v4-flash` | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` |
| `openrouter` | — | OpenAI-compatible HTTP API. | `openai/gpt-5.5` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| `anthropic` | — | Anthropic Messages API (`/v1/messages`). | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `gemini` | `google` | Gemini `generateContent` API. | `gemini-3.5-flash` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) |

> **Naming:** `claude`/`codex` are the **local CLI** adapters (no API key
> needed). `openai`/`anthropic`/`gemini` are the **direct HTTP API** adapters
> (key from the environment). Use `--model` to pick any model the endpoint
> supports; the table lists only the fallback used when no model is given.

The `openai` adapter is a generic OpenAI-compatible client, so the same code
also targets Groq, Together, Fireworks, Mistral, xAI, or a local
vLLM/Ollama/LM Studio server — point it at the base URL and key env var. Keys
are read from the environment at call time and are **never** written to the run
database, manifests, or artifacts. Open Agent Workflows does not manage or store
credentials.

### Structured output, cost, and retries

- **Native structured output.** When a call has a `schema`, the OpenAI-compatible
  adapter uses strict `json_schema` mode when the schema is fully specified (no
  optional fields), else JSON-object mode; Anthropic uses forced tool-use; Gemini
  sets a JSON response MIME type. If the returned JSON still fails validation, the
  adapter re-prompts once with the validation error before giving up.
- **Cost estimation.** API adapters populate `estimated_cost_usd` from a price
  table so `--budget-cost-usd` works. Defaults are approximate; refresh them with
  `owf prices --refresh --url <json>` (writes `~/.workflows/prices.json`), and see
  `owf usage` for token/cost rollups across runs. The `claude` CLI reports its
  own exact cost.
- **Retries.** Transient HTTP failures (429, 5xx, connection errors) are retried
  with linear backoff.
- **Per-provider concurrency.** Fan-out (`parallel()`) is capped per provider so
  large jobs don't trip rate limits. Tune with `OWF_PROVIDER_<NAME>_CONCURRENCY`,
  a provider's `concurrency` field in `providers.json`, or global
  `OWF_MAX_CONCURRENCY` (default 8).

Run `owf providers` to list everything available (built-in + custom) with each
provider's adapter, key env var, and default model.

### Custom providers (no code)

Register any additional endpoint without writing code — point the
OpenAI-compatible adapter (or `anthropic`/`gemini`) at a base URL. Two sources,
merged (env overrides the file per field):

**A JSON file** at `$OWF_PROVIDERS_FILE` (default `~/.workflows/providers.json`):

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "groq":  {"base_url": "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1",
              "api_key_env": "GROQ_API_KEY", "default_model": "llama-3.3-70b"},
    "local": {"kind": "openai", "base_url": "http://localhost:11434/v1",
              "api_key_env": "OLLAMA_KEY", "default_model": "qwen2.5"}
  }
}
```

**Environment variables** `OWF_PROVIDER_<NAME>_{BASE_URL,API_KEY_ENV,MODEL,KIND}`:

```bash
export OWF_PROVIDER_GROQ_BASE_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
export OWF_PROVIDER_GROQ_API_KEY_ENV=GROQ_API_KEY
export OWF_PROVIDER_GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b
owf run my_workflow.py --provider groq
```

`kind` is `openai` (default), `anthropic`, or `gemini`. OpenAI-compatible custom
providers require `base_url`, `api_key_env`, and `default_model`. Built-in
provider names take precedence over custom ones.

---

## Async batch (≈50% off)

For large sets of **independent** prompts, batch APIs run them asynchronously
(up to ~24h) at roughly half the synchronous price. `owf batch` is a standalone
flow — it does not run a workflow script; you hand it a JSONL of prompts:

```bash
# prompts.jsonl — one object per line; "prompt" is required, the rest optional
# {"prompt": "Summarise X", "custom_id": "a", "model": "gpt-5.4-mini", "system": "..."}

owf batch submit prompts.jsonl --provider anthropic        # -> batch_id: msgbatch_01ABC...
owf batch status msgbatch_01ABC                            # in_progress | ended/completed
owf batch fetch  msgbatch_01ABC --out results.jsonl        # writes results when ready
owf batch list                                             # locally-tracked batches
```

Supported providers: `anthropic` (Message Batches) and `openai` (Batches API).
Each result row carries `text`, token counts, and a `cost_usd` already halved by
the batch discount. A small record under `~/.workflows/batches/<id>.json`
remembers the provider/model so `status`/`fetch` need only the id. Keys come
from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` and are never persisted.

---

## Cache and resume semantics

Every read-only `agent()` call is keyed on a hash of the prompt, options,
schema, provider, model, and script content. On a subsequent `owf run` or
`owf resume`, matching calls replay from the SQLite cache instantly and are
reported as `cache_status="hit"`.

**Mutating calls bypass the cache.** Any call with a non-empty `write_scope`
or `isolation="worktree"` is classified as mutating. The runtime never reads
from or writes to the prompt-only cache for mutating calls — the cached output
would not prove the filesystem side effects still hold — and reports
`cache_status="bypassed"`. Mutating calls always re-execute on resume.

`owf explain-cache <run_id>` prints a per-call explanation:

```
miss      greeting: no prior cached result existed for this call key
hit       summarise: reused a prior read-only result (prompt, options, schema, provider, and model matched)
bypassed  patch: mutating call (write scope or worktree isolation); prompt-only cache is unsafe
```

---

## Worktree isolation

Setting `isolation="worktree"` on an agent call creates a fresh git worktree
for that call. The adapter runs inside the worktree; its file edits never
touch your working tree. After the call, `result.worktree_path`,
`result.worktree_branch`, and `result.changed_files` tell you what changed.
Nothing is auto-merged — you review and merge manually.

Worktree isolation fails closed: if the script directory is not inside a git
repository, or if `git worktree add` fails, the provider is not invoked and
the call records `AgentResult(ok=False, status="worktree_failed")`. The runtime
will not silently run a worktree-isolated call in your current working tree.

---

## Artifact layout

```
<script_dir>/.workflows/          # default home (override with --home)
  workflow.sqlite                 # run index, calls, events, cache
  runs/
    <run_id>/
      manifest.json               # run parameters
      summary.md                  # human summary
      output.json                 # return value of main()
      report.md / report.html     # generated by owf report
      calls/
        <call_id>/
          prompt.txt
          output.txt | output.json
```

---

## Safety

Workflow scripts are **trusted local Python**. The runtime loads a script with
`importlib` and executes its `async main(args)` with your user's full
privileges. There is no sandbox, container, or permission boundary.

- Only run scripts you wrote or have reviewed.
- Do not run untrusted scripts from the internet without reading them first.
- API keys are read by adapters from the environment or the CLI's own auth.
  They are never written to the run database, manifests, or artifacts.
- Do not place secrets in prompts, `args`, or `metadata` — those are persisted
  to the run store.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full security model.
