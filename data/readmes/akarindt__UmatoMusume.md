# Disclaimer
- I can't guarantee you that using this tool will not get your account banned.  
- This application interacts with the game through screen capture and OCR, which may violate Cygames' Terms of Service.  
- Use it at your own risk.

# How does it works ?
The application uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to capture text directly from the game screen. Once the text is recognized, it compares the result with its built-in event database.
- When an event appears in the game, the app scans it in real-time.
- The recognized text is then matched against known events using string similarity (to handle OCR mistakes).
- After matching, the app displays the corresponding choices and their effects so players can make the best decision immediately.

## **NEW** Game8 Scraping Method
- This setting is available in **Config** menu called "**Use Game8 Scraping Method**".
- Using [Game8](https://game8.co/games/Umamusume-Pretty-Derby) Scraping method will automatically scrap [Game8](https://game8.co/games/Umamusume-Pretty-Derby/archives/539612) website and match the event name.
- Choosing Uma name is optional but it will give you more accurate result.
- Scrap Data will be cache automatically for faster latency and will be renew every 7 days.
## Download/Crawl new data
- This feature helps you to get the latest data from [gametora](https://gametora.com/umamusume). Basically, it just a web crawler.
- At the main menu, when click the [Download data], a dialog will appear:

![Alt text](md_files/downloader.png)

- Download button: Fetches JSON files directly from GitHub, which is faster than crawling.
- Crawl button: Use this when the repo hasn’t been updated recently. It allows you to fetch the data yourself.

| Button                     | Description                                                                 |

## Choose OCR engine from config
- I gave you two options for OCR engine: PaddleOCR & RapidOCR.
	- PaddleOCR: More accurate than RapidOCR but uses more RAM (=< 600mb). (Default)
	- RapidOCR: Less accurate but uses less RAM (=< 300mb).
- Choose one that fits your PC.
- You should be fine with PaddleOCR if you have 8GB+ RAM.
