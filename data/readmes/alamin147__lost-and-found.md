## 🛠️ Installation & Usage (Local)

> 💡 The database is a **cloud PostgreSQL (Neon)** instance — no local database or Docker is required.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+

### 1. Configure the database

Copy the project's connection string from Neon (or any PostgreSQL host) into `server/.env`:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@ep-xxx.aws.neon.tech/lost_and_found?sslmode=require"
```

Then apply migrations and seed data:

```bash
cd lost-and-found/server
npm run migrate:deploy   # apply database migrations
npm run seed             # seed categories, admin & demo users, sample items
```

### 2. Backend

```bash
cd lost-and-found/server
npm install
npm start                # starts the API on http://localhost:5000
```

### 3. Frontend

```bash
cd lost-and-found/frontend
npm install

# .env:
#   VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000

npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

### 👤 Seeded accounts

| Role  | Username | Password  |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Admin | `admin`  | `admin123` |
| User  | `demo`   | `demo1234` |

> ✅ **AI search:** Powered by Google's new **Interactions API** (`POST /v1beta/interactions` — the old `generateContent` API is retired for new projects). Configured via `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_MODEL` (default `gemini-3.5-flash`) in `server/.env`. If the API is unreachable, rate-limited, or the key is invalid, search automatically falls back to built-in keyword search.

## 🚀 Deployment

The application can be deployed on various platforms:
- **Frontend**: Vercel hosting service
- **Backend**: Vercel hosting service
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Neon

> ⚠️ **Backend deploys:** `server/vercel.json` uses the legacy `builds` config, so Vercel does **not** run the build step itself — it ships your local `dist/` as-is. Always deploy with:
> ```bash
> cd server
> npm run deploy    # = npm run build && vercel --prod
> ```
> The frontend (Vite) builds automatically on Vercel — a plain `vercel --prod` inside `frontend/` is enough.
