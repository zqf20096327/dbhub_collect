## Google Sheets

In addition to the `xlsx` file included in the repository, it is also availbale a
[public Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SxnXVC6o6DGhCMJvmhvgS3FMLhwwAKyoK5o-OQUdcl4/edit?usp=sharing)
with all the ETF database alredy imported.

The sheet is composed of 5 different sheets:

* *basic-info*, *sectors*, *countries*, *holdings* are auto explicative and correspond to the `csv` files with the same name included in the repo
* *examples* is a sheet where some custom named formulas are used to extract data from other sheets.

This sheet will remain public and you can use it to import data on your personal file.
It can be done by defining your own formula (using [Google `IMPORTRANGE`](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093340))
or by using the ones already defined in the sheet:

* `ETF_BASIC_INFO(url, isin, field)`
* `ETF_SECTOR(url, isin, sector)`
* `ETF_COUNTRY(url, isin, country)`

This formulas can be easily defined on your personal sheet by going to *Data > Named functions > Import function* and selecting the
sheet linked above.

If you prefer to not depend on my public sheet you can import the xlsx file on your sheet (*File > Import*)
or simply make a personal copy of the public one (*File > Make a copy*).
