## Quick Start

### Download

Visit [liquidb.app](https://liquidb.app) or [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/liquidb-app/LiquiDB/releases) to download LiquiDB:

- **macOS**: `LiquiDB-<version>-universal.dmg` (Universal - Intel & Apple Silicon)

### macOS Installation Note

Since LiquiDB is currently unsigned, macOS Gatekeeper may show a security warning when you first open the app. To bypass this:

1. **Right-click** (or **Control-click**) on `LiquiDB.app` in Finder
2. Select **"Open"** from the context menu
3. Click **"Open"** in the security dialog that appears

This will add an exception for LiquiDB and allow it to run. You only need to do this once. After that, you can open LiquiDB normally by double-clicking.

**Note**: This is a standard macOS security feature. LiquiDB is safe to use - it's open source and all releases are verified via SHA256 hashes on GitHub.
