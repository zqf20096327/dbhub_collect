## AI OAuth provider selection

[AI Provider settings](https://lms-tms.tertiaryinfotech.com/ai-provider) lets an
Admin or Training Provider connect OpenAI and Claude OAuth, test the connections,
and select the provider used by chat, courseware, assessments, audits, SEO and
supporting-document processing. OpenAI uses the Codex SDK with `gpt-5.6-sol`;
Claude uses the Claude SDK with `claude-opus-5`. Optional Claude fallback retries
failed OpenAI requests. Credentials are encrypted on the server.
See [setup and verification](docs/ai-provider.md).

## Features

### Learner Features
- Course browsing and enrollment
- Courseware access — Learner Guide, Learner Slides, Activities/Lab and SkillsFuture link cards, unlocked from 8:30 AM SGT on the course start date
- Progress tracking through learning units and subtopics
- Assessment submission and grade viewing — the course page re-reads the trainer's publish state every minute while visible and on tab focus, so a Written/Practical exam published mid-class appears without a reload
- AI chatbot for personalized course assistance (external OpenClaw/Hermes agent via WhatsApp/Telegram)
- Certificate download after completion — issued only once the class has ended (from 6:00 PM SGT on the last day, or earlier if the trainer marks the learner Competent) and the minimum attendance is met; admins/trainers can still issue manually
- Job search integration
- **My Calendar** — personal month calendar of the learner's scheduled classes
- **Header quick nav** — My Classes, My Calendar and Ed Tools links in the top header (Billing remains in the sidebar as Billing History)
- **Tools** — the full trainer tools catalogue mirrored in the learner sidebar (Ed Tools, Project Mgt, Six Sigma, Cyber Security, Networking, Finance, HR, Data Analytics, ML, Statistical, DOE, SPC, Sustainability, K8s, Blockchain, Quantum, Design, GenAI, Agentic AI, Virtual Tools), shared via `components/toolsData.ts`; clicking a tools group opens the same tool card page as the trainer role (GenAI Tools stays link-only for learners)

### Trainer Features
- **My Classes** — View assigned classes (upcoming, ongoing, completed). Trainer mode is scoped server-side to classes the trainer is assigned to (`course_run_trainer` or the legacy assigned-trainer columns, matched by user id or any of the trainer's emails) — listing, opening, publishing assessments and grading all return `403` for unassigned classes
- **Trainer + Learner dual role** — trainers who enrol in the provider's own courses sign in and pick **Learner** mode (their enrolled classes, lessons, assessment submissions) or **Trainer** mode (only their assigned classes), switchable from the header's *View As* menu. Gated per tenant by `training_provider.trainer_learner_dual_role` (default off); enabling it backfills the Learner role onto every trainer and a `user_role_map` trigger grants it to every new trainer. A trainer can never grade their own enrolment
- **My Calendar** — personal month calendar of the trainer's assigned classes
- **E-Attendance** — Digital attendance tracking
- **Assessment Grading** — Rubric-based grading with Assessment Summary Record support; each learner row shows per-method submission status (WA Written, PP Practical, CS Case Study, RP Role Play, OQ Oral Questioning) ticked when the learner has submitted, alongside a manually-ticked **TQ (TRAQOM survey)** box — SSG publishes no per-learner survey completion feed, so the trainer confirms it — with per-method and TRAQOM completion counts (e.g. WA 3/7, TRAQOM 5/7) and a refresh button in the roster header, plus Mark All Competent and bulk certificate sending. A learner who holds several enrolment rows in the same run (a manual LMS signup plus the SSG-synced record) appears **once**, listing every email they enrolled under; the SSG row is primary (NRIC, certificate), submissions are unioned across rows, and competency/TRAQOM toggles update every row. Beside TQ sits a **SIGN (assessor signature)** box: the trainer records their assessor block once — name, NRIC, date and a mouse/touch-drawn signature (Trainer Profile → Assessor Signature, or the dialog on the roster) — and ticking SIGN stamps it into the "Assessor Name / NRIC / Date / Signature" block of every PDF, Word (DOCX) or OpenDocument (ODT) file the learner submitted, uploading the stamped copy next to the original in Google Drive; unticking restores the originals. The roster header carries per-method, TRAQOM, Assessor Sign and Competent counts plus a prominent Refresh, a **Watch Demo** link opens a 70-second narrated walkthrough of the sign-off flow (`public/videos/assessor-sign-off-demo.mp4`, learner details and NRIC masked), and each learner's email links to their **Assessment Records** folder in Drive (Course → Assessment Records → Session → Learner; the folder id is stored on upload and back-filled from the file's Drive parent for older submissions)
- **Critical Reminders** — a red-bordered block pinned under the course page's left menu. In Trainer mode (after *Announcements*) it lists the three sign-off duties that gate payout: TRAQOM is mandatory (a learner who misses the survey delays the trainer payout), mark each learner Competent in Assessment Grading once all assessments are in, and digitally sign each learner's assessment there; the grading items jump straight to the Grading section. In Learner mode (after *Certificate*) it lists the learner's own must-dos: TRAQOM is mandatory (learners must complete it to be marked COMPETENT), download the assessment questions as a Word document, and answer every question then submit the assessment online, watching for the green "submitted successfully" notification; each item jumps to the TRAQOM Survey or Assessment section
- **Assessment Summary Record e-signing** — the ASR (Virtual Class) card on the course page is signed inside the LMS instead of printed and scanned. The learner records their name, NRIC and a drawn signature once (Learner Signature dialog, `/api/learner/signature`) and clicks **Sign Assessment Summary Record**; the trainer reuses their assessor block (the same one the grading roster stamps) and signs each learner from a roster of the class — or **Sign All** — with per-learner Learner/Trainer signed dates and a link to the PDF. Every signature regenerates the PDF from the course's ASR template (`assessment_summary_record_url` — PDF, Google Doc or Word) with all blocks signed so far: the Candidate and Assessor **name, NRIC (last 3 digits + letter, as the form asks), signature and date** are drawn into the sign-off table on the last page, whose cells are located from the label text so any course's template works, and the file is placed in the learner's Assessment Records folder in Drive (replaced in place, so the link stays stable). Unsigning removes that party's block and regenerates; a manually signed scan can still be uploaded as a fallback. A **Watch Demo** link on the trainer's card opens a 100-second narrated, captioned walkthrough of the online sign-off (`public/videos/asr-sign-off-demo.mp4` + `.vtt`, NRIC and learner details masked) — the digital sign-off applies to **virtual classes only**; physical classes keep the printed record. Tables: `learner_signature`, `assessment_summary_record` (`database/migrations/add_assessment_summary_signature.sql`)
- **Collapsed course page in Trainer mode** — the Lesson topics (Labs, Topic 1…n), the Assessment Summary Record (Virtual Class) card and the Announcements card all mount collapsed for trainers, so the course page opens as a compact list of headings that expand on click; learner, admin, developer and training-provider views keep them open by default
- **Training Hours** — Trainer training hours tracking
- **Past Attendance** / **Past Assessment** — Historical records
- **Lesson Delivery Guide** / **Assessment Guide**
- **Trainer Payout History** — View past payouts and tier breakdown

### AI-Powered Features
- **AI Chatbot (external agent)** — The operational assistant is **not** built into the platform. The app hands off to an external agent — **OpenClaw** (Kael/Jarvis/Orion) or **Hermes** — reached over WhatsApp or Telegram, which acts on the platform through the authenticated `/api/external/*` HTTPS API. Keeping the agent outside the app means it upgrades independently of a deploy and never needs direct database access. See the chat launcher below for how requests are composed.
- **SEO Metadata Generator** — Claude-powered SEO content generation for WSQ and non-WSQ courses
- **External Agent Chat Launcher** — Floating WhatsApp/Telegram widget that hands off to an external agent such as OpenClaw/Kael or Hermes. Two role-scoped variants, each pointing at its own group:
  - **Ops widget** (green — Admin, Finance, Training Provider, Developer, Payroll): 5 starter suggestions, with search or "Browse all" revealing the full catalogue of **40 fill-in-the-blank templates** across Trainers, Learners, Classes, Sessions, SSG/TPGateway, Finance and Reports
  - **Trainer widget** (blue — Trainer role only): a deliberately narrow set of 4 requests — cannot find my class, assign me to this class, send me the Google Meet link, send me the e-attendance link. Classes are identified by course title + start date, never by a course run ID, and the trainer catalogue is a **separate array** rather than a filter, so no admin action (schedules, run IDs, enrolments, SSG, finance) is reachable from the trainer widget
  - Field names mirror the agent's tools and the `/api/external/*` parameters, so a completed template maps onto a real operation
  - Selecting one opens an editable message bubble; the message is copied to the clipboard and the chat opens. WhatsApp only accepts a pre-filled body on `wa.me` one-to-one links — **group invite links cannot be pre-filled**, so for a group the user pastes the copied message
  - Destinations are set per tenant under Company Settings → Integrations → AI Agent (`whatsapp_chat_url` and `trainer_whatsapp_chat_url`); each widget auto-detects WhatsApp vs Telegram and hides itself when its link is blank
- **GenAI Authoring** — AI content generation for course development
- **Quiz Generator** — AI-generated quizzes based on course content

### Automation Features
- **Task Scheduler** — Schedule and run automated tasks: Auto Create Certificates, Auto Send Course Confirmation, Auto Create Learners, Auto Create Assessment Records, Auto Send Class Evaluation to Trainers (compiles learner feedback for ended classes and emails trainers daily at 6:30 PM SGT), etc.
- **Webhook System** — Configure webhooks with full logging for external integrations
- **Trainer Invitation Workflow** — Weekly cycle for classes without a trainer: Monday sweep invites the next trainer in the course's approved-list order, Thursday sends a reminder (same accept/decline links) to anyone still pending, and the following Monday expires no-response invitations and moves to the next trainer. On accept the class is Confirmed, the trainer is synced to SSG/TPG, added to the Google Calendar event (real invite, Course Run ID stamped in the description, Google Meet auto-generated for Virtual classes), and sent a confirmation email with the class details. Declines auto-cascade immediately; admins can pause per class or reset the cycle back to the first approved trainer
- **Certificate Workflow** — Auto-generate certificates after class completion, upload to Google Drive, and email to learners
- **Auto-Create Learners** — Automatically creates learner accounts for course runs starting today (via n8n)
- **Auto-Assign Trainers** — Bot-driven trainer assignment with fallback logic
- **Course Run Date Sync** — Automatic synchronization of dates with SSG
- **Enrolment Backfill** — Batch sync of enrollment data from SSG
- **Trainer WhatsApp Notifications** — Rate-gated queue consumed by the external WhatsApp Business agent: invitation/reminder nudges (max 5/day, 10:00–13:00 SGT) and upcoming-class reminders composed from the LMS record 3 days ahead (max 7/day, 13:00–17:00 SGT). An accepted trainer RSVP excludes every reminder with the same TGS and class date, and acceptance is checked again immediately before release. The channels use non-overlapping windows, all messages are ≥15 minutes apart, and a read-only `confirmed-classes` feed supplies authoritative class data.
- **Funding Renewal Reminder** — Daily 8:00 AM SGT email listing funded courses whose funding validity has expired or expires within 1 month and are not yet marked renewed on the Course Funding Validity page (recipients via `FUNDING_REMINDER_RECIPIENTS`; nothing pending → no email)
- **Auto-Send Emails** — Configurable auto-send for proforma invoices, confirmation emails, invoices, receipts, certificates, and thank-you emails

## API Documentation

> **All API routes require authentication.** Every endpoint below is guarded except a
> small public allowlist (login/OTP, OAuth callbacks, static asset serving, the
> tokenised webhook route and the public feedback form). See
> [API Authentication](#api-authentication) for how to authenticate.

### External APIs (x-api-key authenticated)

```
POST /api/external/assign-trainer         # Assign trainer to course run
POST /api/external/unassign-trainer       # Remove trainer from course run
GET  /api/external/get-course-run         # Get course run details
GET  /api/external/list-course-runs       # List course runs (with filters)
GET  /api/external/list-trainers          # List trainers (with filters)
POST /api/external/auto-create-learners   # Auto-create learner accounts
POST /api/external/sync-course-run-dates  # Sync dates with SSG
GET  /api/external/backfill-enrollments   # Preview enrollment backfill
POST /api/external/backfill-enrollments   # Execute enrollment backfill
POST /api/external/wsq-submit-runs        # Create specific course runs in SSG (previews unless confirm:true)
GET  /api/external/wsq-schedule-gap       # What course runs are missing, and why
GET  /api/external/wsq-sync-status        # Outcome of the last schedule sync
POST /api/external/create-course-run      # BROKEN (27 Aug 2026) — SSG rejects the payload shape. Use wsq-submit-runs.
```

### Authentication

```
POST /api/auth/login              # Login (password or OTP) → returns a session token
POST /api/auth/send-otp           # Send OTP to email
GET  /api/auth/verify             # Validate the current session token
POST /api/auth/logout             # Revoke the current session token
PUT  /api/auth/update-password    # Update password (own account, or admin for any)
```

### API Authentication

Two ways to authenticate, both required as of the August 2026 lockdown:

**1. User sessions (browser/UI).** `POST /api/auth/login` returns an opaque
`lms_…` session token. Send it as a bearer token on every request:

```
Authorization: Bearer lms_<token>
```

Tokens are server-side records — only a SHA-256 hash is stored, they expire after
30 days, and they are revoked on logout, password change and admin reset. The
browser app does this automatically via the global fetch interceptor in
`lib/clientAuthFetch.ts`, so UI code needs no per-call auth handling.

**2. Service key (machines).** Schedulers, agents and other back-end systems send a
server-side API key instead, valid on any route:

```
x-api-key: $EXTERNAL_API_KEY_FOR_CLAWDBOT
```

Authorization is role-based (Admin, Training Provider, Finance, Payroll, Trainer,
Developer, Learner); a request with a valid session but the wrong role gets `403`.
Unauthenticated requests get `401`.

`scripts/check-api-auth.js` runs as part of `npm run lint` and fails the build if a
new route is added without authentication — new public routes must be added to its
allowlist deliberately.

### Courses & Course Runs

```
GET  /api/courses/list            # List all courses
GET  /api/courses/detail          # Get course details
POST /api/courses/create-course   # Create course (multipart)
POST /api/admin/save-course-run   # Create/update course run
GET  /api/admin/search-course-runs # Search course runs
POST /api/admin/import-course-run # Import from SSG
GET  /api/admin/course-code-history # Every course reference code a course has carried
GET  /api/admin/course-change-log   # Chronological audit of course field changes
PUT  /api/admin/update-course-title # Bulk rename by course_code (title only; supports dryRun)
```

**Course code history.** SSG funding renewal issues a *new* course reference code for what
is still the same course, so a course accumulates codes over time. `course_code_history`
records every one of them, which keeps past records retrievable by the code they were
created under. Use `lib/courseCode.ts` — `resolveCourseIdByCode()` accepts any code, current
or superseded, and returns the single course it belongs to; resolving with a bare
`WHERE course_code = $1` sees only the pre-renewal code and will miss.

**Two code columns on `course`.** `course_code` is the ORIGINAL registration code and never
changes — past enrolments and SSG records were created against it. `new_course_code` is the
code currently in force (kept equal to the original until a renewal issues a new one, so it
is always populated). The course editor edits them as separate fields; a blank submitted
value never clears the stored one. Both codes are shown as separate fields in view mode as
well as edit mode — including when the course was never renewed and the two match — so the
read-only pane and the edit form present the same set of fields.

**Records show the code of their own era.** The SQL function `course_code_at(course_id, at)`
resolves the code in force at any moment. Class and enrolment listings use it with the
record's creation date, so an enrolment submitted under a superseded code keeps displaying
that code while records created after the renewal show the new one — all attached to the
same course throughout.

**Course Change Control.** `course_change_log` is an append-only audit of key course field
changes (title, both codes, type, hours, fee, funding validity, TSC title/code) as
old → new rows with timestamp and author, written inside the course-save transaction
(`lib/courseChangeLog.ts`). The Developer role's Course Change Control page renders it as a
chronological table filterable by course title.

### Enrolments

PUT  /api/enrolment/update        # Update enrolment
POST /api/enrolment/cancel        # Cancel enrolment
POST /api/enrolments/bulk-create  # Bulk create enrolments
```

### Assessments & Grading

POST /api/assessments/ssg-create  # Create SSG assessment
PUT  /api/assessments/ssg-update  # Update SSG assessment
```

| `training_provider_member` | User membership in training provider organizations |
| `course` | Course templates with metadata, materials, funding info, and assessment methods |
| `course_code_history` | Every course reference code a course has carried, with validity windows — funding renewal issues a new code for the same course |
| `course_title_history` | Every title a course has carried — a renamed course stays findable by its former titles |
| `course_change_log` | Append-only audit of key course field changes (old → new, when, by whom) behind the Course Change Control page |
| `course_run` | Scheduled course instances with dates, trainers, and digital attendance |

| `assessment` | Course assessments (Written, Practical, Case Study, Role Play, etc.) |
| `submission` | Learner assessment submissions |
| `learning_unit` | Course chapters/modules |
| `subtopic` | Individual learning topics within units |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 17+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alfredang/AI-LMS-TMS.git
   cd AI-LMS-TMS
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your configuration
   ```

4. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   # Run schema migration
   psql -f database/01-schema.sql

   # Seed initial data (optional)
   psql -f database/02-data-clean-fixed.sql
   ```

5. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

   `npm run dev` disables the startup cron scheduler by setting
   `ENABLE_APP_SCHEDULER=false`. This prevents local development servers from
   automatically executing production-like scheduled jobs when developers are
   connected to shared, production, or production-clone databases.

   To test scheduled jobs locally, run the scheduler-enabled dev script instead:

   ```bash
   npm run dev:scheduler
   ```

   Only one app instance connected to a shared database should run with
   `ENABLE_APP_SCHEDULER=true`. Manual "Run Now" actions in the admin UI and
   direct API-triggered jobs can still run even when the startup scheduler is
   disabled.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```env
# Database Connection
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database

# Application URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Google Gemini AI
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key

# SSG API Integration
SSG_API_BASE_URL=https://api.ssg-wsg.sg

# External / machine API Authentication
# Required for schedulers, agents and back-end systems to call the API.
# Sent as the `x-api-key` header; must be a server-side secret (never NEXT_PUBLIC_*).
EXTERNAL_API_KEY_FOR_CLAWDBOT=your-external-api-key
SCHEDULER_SECRET=your-scheduler-secret
DIRECT_APPLICATION_EMAIL_INGEST_TOKEN=your-direct-application-email-ingest-token

# Funding renewal reminder — comma-separated recipient emails (tenants without it skip the job)
FUNDING_REMINDER_RECIPIENTS=ops@example.com,finance@example.com
```

## Deployment

### Coolify (Multi-Tenant)

The same codebase is deployed across multiple tenants on **Coolify** (self-hosted PaaS — not Vercel, not Nixpacks). Pushes to `main` trigger automatic redeployment for each tenant.

| Tenant | Build Pack | URL |
|--------|------------|-----|
| **Tertiary Infotech Academy** | Dockerfile | https://lms-tms.tertiaryinfotech.com |
| **Chariot / Intellisoft** | Docker Compose | (per-tenant) |

Tenant-specific behavior is gated via DB config, env vars, or feature flags (e.g. `payroll_enabled` in `lib/payroll/featureFlag.ts`) — never by forking shared code.

### Local Docker

A `docker-compose.yml` is provided for local development (Next.js app + Postgres 17, ports 3003 / 6434).

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```
