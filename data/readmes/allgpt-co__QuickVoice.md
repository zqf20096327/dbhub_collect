# QuickVoice

**Open-source AI phone-agent infrastructure you can run, inspect, and extend.**

QuickVoice is the open-source Retell alternative for engineering-led teams that want control over the voice-agent stack instead of only consuming a closed hosted API. It gives teams the full product surface in one repo: a marketing site, customer console, API server, LiveKit-powered AI worker, telephony integrations, knowledge bases, call logs, outbound campaigns, billing paths, MCP/tool connections, privacy controls, and local development tooling.

## 30-Second Tour

- **What it does:** build AI agents that answer inbound calls, place outbound calls, use uploaded knowledge, and record operational outcomes.
- **Why it exists:** keep the voice-agent stack inspectable instead of outsourcing every runtime, data, cost, and telephony decision to a closed platform.
- **What you can run locally:** the web app, console, API, AI service, Postgres, Redis, Prisma migrations, and generated dev env files.
- **What needs real credentials:** real phone calls require LiveKit plus Twilio or Telnyx credentials; billing, OAuth, email, and storage need their provider keys.
- **How it is positioned:** see the [core positioning framework](./docs/positioning/core-positioning-framework.md) for code-backed marketing and sales claims.

## Quick Start

The supported one-command development path is a Linux environment with:

- Bash `>=4`
- Node.js `^20.19 || ^22.13 || >=24` and Corepack
- `pnpm@9.0.0` (activated by the setup task)
- Python 3; Python 3.12 matches CI and the AI runtime image
- Docker with the Compose v2 plugin
- [Go Task](https://taskfile.dev/)

Then run:

```sh
task up:dev
```

`task up` and `task dev` are aliases. Go Task treats spaces as separate task names, so prefer `task up:dev` for the explicit form.

### Choose Your Host

| Host    | Support level                | Guidance                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux   | Supported                    | Install the prerequisites above, run `task doctor`, then run `task up:dev`.                                                                                                                                                  |
| macOS   | Supported with current tools | Install Docker Desktop and a modern Bash (`>=4`). The Bash 3.2 bundled with macOS is not sufficient for every orchestration script. Verify `bash --version`, `docker compose version`, and `task --version` before starting. |
| Windows | Use WSL2                     | Native PowerShell and Command Prompt are not supported by the Bash-based Taskfile scripts. Use WSL2 with Docker Desktop's WSL integration.                                                                                   |

On Debian, Ubuntu, or WSL2, Docker, Python, and the Go toolchain can be installed with:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose-v2 golang-go python3 python3-venv
sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"
go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin"
```

Install Node.js `^20.19 || ^22.13 || >=24` separately with a version manager or the official Node.js packages; a distribution package may be older than QuickVoice requires. Reconnect the shell after changing Docker group membership. With Docker Desktop on WSL2, enable integration for the WSL distribution instead of installing a second Docker daemon.

On macOS, install Docker Desktop, Go Task, Node.js `^20.19 || ^22.13 || >=24`, Python, and Bash `>=4` using your preferred package manager. Ensure the modern Bash appears before `/bin/bash` on `PATH`, because the scripts use `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.

First things to open:

- Console: `http://localhost:3000`
- Marketing site: `http://localhost:3001`
- API health: `http://localhost:5000/api/v1/health`
- API docs: `http://localhost:5000/api/v1/docs`
- AI API health: `http://localhost:5555/health`

The task creates local env files from `*.env.dev.example`, activates `pnpm@9.0.0`, installs Node dependencies with the frozen lockfile, creates the AI Python virtualenv, starts Postgres and Redis through `docker-compose.dev.yml`, runs Prisma migrations, and launches the local services above.

### Setup Boundaries

The Docker Compose database credentials are dev-only placeholders (`quickvoice` / `quickvoice`) and the Postgres and Redis ports are bound to `127.0.0.1`. Edit the generated env files after the first run if you need real Google, Stripe, LiveKit, Twilio, Telnyx, SMTP, or AWS credentials. Generated env files are ignored by git.

The placeholder values are enough to inspect local startup paths; they do not make provider-backed actions work. A successful `task up:dev` does not prove that live calls, OAuth, billing, email delivery, object storage, Pinecone retrieval, or production deployment are configured. Real phone calls require LiveKit plus a configured telephony provider and model-provider credentials. Keep production data and credentials out of local issue reproductions.

To exercise prepaid billing safely, follow the [Stripe wallet test-mode verification guide](./docs/development/stripe-wallet-test-mode.md). It keeps wallet and legacy subscription webhook secrets separate and verifies webhook-authoritative crediting, duplicate delivery, and refunds against a Stripe sandbox.

Optional local email testing is available through a Docker Compose profile:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --env-file .env.dev --profile mail up -d mailpit
```

Useful individual tasks:

```sh
task doctor
task env:dev
task docker:up
task db:migrate
task db:seed -- --email you@example.com
task ci
task server:dev
task console:dev
task web:dev
task ai:api
task ai:worker
```

Common root commands:

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm lint
pnpm check-types
pnpm test
pnpm ci:local
pnpm audit:deps -- --audit-level low
```

## Why QuickVoice

Voice agents are becoming core business infrastructure. Hosted APIs are useful when speed and convenience matter most. QuickVoice is for teams that also need source-level control, self-hosting options, privacy review, cost visibility, and a path to extend the product for their own workflows.

- **Control:** run the console, API, worker, database, and telephony bindings yourself.
- **Self-hosting:** evaluate the local stack with `task up:dev`, then decide how and where to deploy.
- **Privacy:** inspect storage, logs, call metadata, recordings, transcripts, secrets, retention controls, and runtime configuration before production use.
- **Cost visibility:** bring your own LiveKit, Twilio or Telnyx, Postgres, Redis, S3-compatible storage, vector database, and model providers instead of treating every dependency as an opaque bundle.
- **Extensibility:** fork the repo, modify agents, add knowledge sources, attach MCP tools, wire new providers, or adapt permissions, billing, and campaign workflows.

## Code-Backed Differentiators

- **Per-call runtime control:** the LiveKit worker loads agent configuration by phone number or agent ID at call start, then applies outbound metadata overrides for first message, prompt, language, voice, and dynamic variables.
- **Live knowledge and tools:** agents can retrieve Pinecone-backed knowledge context during user turns and call allowlisted MCP tools through the server bridge. Side-effect tools are hidden from live-call instructions unless explicitly safe.
- **Inspectable privacy boundaries:** call-log PII redaction is enabled by default, zero-PII retention can suppress transcripts and recordings, secrets are encrypted or referenced, remote URLs are screened for private-network targets, and retention jobs clean up old transcripts, recordings, failed KB rows, and MCP logs.
- **Direct telephony ownership:** Twilio and Telnyx number purchase flows, provider binding, LiveKit trunk binding, rollback behavior, inbound routing, outbound quick calls, and batch campaigns are implemented in the repo.

## What QuickVoice Is Not

QuickVoice is not a zero-setup hosted phone-agent API from a fresh clone. Local development starts with `task up:dev`, but carrier-connected calls need LiveKit plus Twilio or Telnyx credentials, and production deployments need deliberate choices around auth, secrets, storage, retention, provider agreements, and operations.

The repository makes privacy and compliance-relevant data paths inspectable, but it is not by itself a HIPAA, SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI, GDPR, or CCPA certification claim. Those claims depend on deployment, controls, provider agreements, audits, and legal review.

## What You Can Build

- Inbound AI receptionists and support agents
- Outbound sales, reminders, collections, and follow-up workflows
- Appointment scheduling and qualification calls
- Knowledge-backed agents that answer from uploaded sources
- Campaigns that call many contacts and track outcomes
- Voice automation for healthcare, financial services, logistics, real estate, ecommerce, and operations teams

## What's Inside

- `apps/web` - Next.js website with product pages, use cases, industry pages, blog content, pricing, and legal pages.
- `apps/console` - Next.js customer console for organizations, agents, numbers, calls, knowledge bases, API keys, billing, and settings.
- `apps/server` - Express API server with auth, permissions, agent configuration, phone numbers, call logs, outbound calls, MCP connections, retention jobs, Stripe, Twilio, Telnyx, LiveKit, S3, Redis/BullMQ, and Inngest integrations.
- `apps/ai` - Python AI service and LiveKit worker handlers for runtime configuration, RAG, MCP tool execution, privacy controls, call logging, recording, and voice-agent execution.
- `packages/eslint-config` and `packages/typescript-config` - Shared monorepo linting and TypeScript configuration.
- `scripts`, `Taskfile.yml`, and `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Local orchestration for Node services, Python services, Prisma, Postgres, and Redis.

## Voice Provider Runtime

QuickVoice keeps the LiveKit voice runtime inside `apps/ai`, so a fork can bring its own provider credentials and run the agent stack without a separate voice-platform service. The AI API exposes the voice catalog and session broker behind the existing internal auth header:

- `GET /voice/catalog`
- `POST /voice/config/resolve`
- `POST /voice/sessions`

The default catalog supports Deepgram and Sarvam for STT, AWS Bedrock for LLMs, and ElevenLabs or Sarvam for TTS. Override the built-in catalog with `VOICE_CATALOG_PATH` if your fork needs different providers, model labels, languages, or voices.

Add real values to `apps/ai/.env.dev` before running live voice sessions:

```sh
INTERNAL_API_KEY=change-me
LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-livekit-host
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your-livekit-key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your-livekit-secret
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your-deepgram-key
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-elevenlabs-key
ELEVENLABS_DEFAULT_VOICE_ID=your-voice-id
SARVAM_API_KEY=your-sarvam-key
```

Run the AI API and worker, then create a session through the embedded broker:

```sh
task ai:api
task ai:worker
curl -X POST http://localhost:5555/voice/sessions \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-internal-key: $INTERNAL_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"participant":{"identity":"local-test","name":"Local Test"}}'
```

For an end-to-end LiveKit smoke that joins the room, publishes probe audio, waits for agent audio, and cleans up the dispatch and room:

```sh
cd apps/ai
.venv/bin/python scripts/phase2d_voice_smoke.py --env-file .env.dev
```
