# SQL-PROXY

## About 

A lightweight REST service designed to replace ADODB calls in legacy software systems that support web requests. This service streamlines database interactions while maintaining security and efficiency.

For example, you can remove all Linux-incompatible components, such as the following items (1C:Enterprise example): 
```1C-Enterprise
Connection = New COMObject("ADODB.Connection");
Connection.Open(ConnectionString);
```
and use web requests in a similar manner instead, using a simple library to receive SQL query results in a JSON with variable columns you defined
in SQL select statement:
```1C-Enterprise
Function OpenSQLConnection(ConnectionString) Export
  HTTP = New HTTPConnection;
  Path = "/api/v1/connection";
  ...
```
Refer to the full example for the 1C:Enterprise language in the /docs folder to learn how to use this API.
Note that this service is not limited to 1C and can be utilized in other contexts as well.

## Key features:

* Multi-Database Support : Compatible with PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and MySQL databases. You do not need to
  install the driver packages and setup ODBC sources. Additional standard Golang database drivers can be integrated as needed with a few lines of code;
* Run mode: Can be used as a standalone service or containerized within server environments such as k8s;
* Secure Credential Management : Does not store SQL credentials, ensuring sensitive information remains protected;
* Secure Communication : Supports HTTPS for secure data transmission;
* Efficient Connection Pooling : Utilizes a shared, reusable SQL connection pool with automated maintenance tasks to remove stale or dead connections;
* Connection Limiting : Configurable maximum number of concurrent database connections to prevent resource exhaustion;
* Command Support : Currently supports all SQL commands with no limitation (read below security tips). The SELECT command returns query results as a flexible JSON-formatted recordset;
* Result Limitation : Allows configuration to limit the number of rows returned by SELECT statements;
* Prepared Statements : supported;
* BLOB read/write : supported;
* Flexible Binding : Can bind to localhost or any specified IP address for enhanced security. By default, it is intended to bind to localhost and run alongside legacy software;
* Security : Does not perform SQL query validation and any other security checks (!). It is the responsibility of DBA to configure appropriate database privileges. Keep in mind ADODB is the old-school engineering and this tool is the simple and quick replacement. All security-related work must be completed
first at SQL server — as it always was, long before the era of shiny new toys. Never use admin accounts with this service! Does not expose it to the untrusted network!
Consider to implement ORM model in the future or another secure-driven patterns;
* Monitoring and Metrics : Provides Prometheus metrics for performance monitoring and observability;
