# ALMS — Agent Loop Management System

A self-hosted platform for running teams of LLM agents that collaborate on a project.
One Rust binary provides the HTTP/SSE gateway, the agent runtime, a sandboxed tool layer,
and SQLite persistence.

Multi-agent frameworks mostly give you a tree: a parent spawns a worker, blocks on its
return value, and the worker is gone. ALMS does that too — but its centre of gravity is
peer-to-peer. Agents are addressable by name, and sending one a message *invokes* it
rather than leaving a note in an inbox someone has to remember to poll. The pair share a
persistent DM session that each side reads from its own perspective, and the reply comes
back by invoking the sender in turn — so two agents hold an actual conversation, one that
outlives any single run, instead of exchanging a request and a return value.

**Fully AI-developed.** I set the direction and AI agents wrote the code.
[`docs/multi-agent-development-workflow.md`](docs/multi-agent-development-workflow.md)
documents how it works, and [`docs/engineering-reviews/`](docs/engineering-reviews/)
collects the review threads it produced.

## What it does

- **Agent runtime** — tool loop with a token-budgeted context builder, per-agent workspace
  files (personality, goals, memories), and cross-session episodic memory
- **Peer messaging** — `send_message` addresses another agent by name and invokes it;
  `list_agents` discovers who is reachable; `ignore_message` declines a turn without
  answering. Delivery never blocks the sender's loop, and a conversation ends explicitly,
  with the peer notified either way
- **Multi-agent coordination** — hierarchical subagents via `invoke_agent` alongside the
  DM mesh, with one message bus underneath both
- **Sandboxed tools** — filesystem tools pinned to the project root by path
  canonicalization, a destructive-command classifier and configurable permission rules over
  shell commands, and Landlock confinement of shell children on Linux
- **Multi-provider LLM support** — OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, and Gemini, including
  reasoning/thinking blocks and prompt caching
- **Gateway + web UI** — REST API with SSE streaming, and a browser UI served from the
  same binary
- **Scheduling and approvals** — cron-style jobs, plus a human-in-the-loop approval gate
  for sensitive tool calls

## Quick start

Requires Rust nightly, installed automatically from `rust-toolchain.toml`.

Three commands. Everything else — the provider key, agents, sessions, the first message —
happens in the browser.

```bash
cargo build --release

# Runs in the foreground; leave it running. Defaults to 127.0.0.1:8080
./target/release/alms gateway
```

Then, in a second shell:

```bash
./target/release/alms dashboard
```

`alms dashboard` checks that the gateway is answering before opening a browser, so a daemon
that failed to start says so instead of handing you a connection-refused page. Opening
<http://127.0.0.1:8080> yourself works too.

`./install.sh` runs the same release build and copies the binary into `~/.cargo/bin` —
usually already on your `PATH` if you installed Rust with rustup. Run it and both commands
above become just `alms`. It is a bash script; on Windows run it from Git Bash.

### In the browser

**The first screen sets you up, in two steps.** Step one takes an OpenRouter key.
`openrouter` is the default provider and one key there covers both defaults — the chat
model and the summary model — so it needs no further configuration. It applies to the
running gateway immediately, no restart. The step skips itself when a key is already in
the secrets store, and **Skip for now** covers everything else — a key declared in
`alms.toml` works but is invisible from there. On another provider? Skip, then paste that
key under Settings → **API Keys** and point *Default LLM provider* and *Default LLM model*
at it.

**Step two names your agent.** It creates the agent, opens a session, and drops you into
the chat. Send it anything: a new agent's opening reply is a short interview about who you
are and what it is for, and what it learns becomes workspace files it carries into every
later session.

- **Sidebar** — this agent's sessions; *+ New session* starts another.
- **Agents**, in the header — create more agents and set each one's model, provider, and
  posture.
- **Gear** — server-wide settings: provider keys, default model and provider, and the
  context budget.

New agents inherit the server's default posture, `guarded`, so the first risky tool call
in a run you start raises an approval card in the chat and waits for you. Telegram has no
approval card: in a run started by a message to the agent's bot, that call fails and the
agent sees the error. `full_control` and `autonomous` skip that gate, and so do a
`guarded` agent's runs that no human started (see *Before you run this*);
[`docs/security-model.md` § 2](docs/security-model.md#2-approval-model-human-in-the-loop)
covers what each one checks.

To drive ALMS from a script instead, the same agent → session → run flow over HTTP is in
[`docs/api.md` § 2](docs/api.md#scripted-first-run), and `alms --help` lists the CLI
equivalents.

## Before you run this

ALMS executes LLM-directed tool calls on your machine. These are deliberate design
decisions, and you should know them before deploying:

- **Single-operator trust model.** No multi-user support, no privilege separation between
  agents and the operator. Do not expose the gateway to untrusted users.
- **Agents can read the secrets store.** The sandbox root is the project root, and
  `.alms/` lives inside it — so `.alms/secrets.json` is reachable via `fs_read`. Set
  `ALMS_MASTER_KEY` to encrypt that file at rest (AES-256-GCM); shell children do not
  inherit that variable, so an agent that reads the file gets ciphertext. Where `shell` has
  no filesystem boundary (the next two items), an agent can still read the key with the
  daemon OS user's access: from the daemon's environment, which any process of that OS user
  can read on every platform (on Linux, at `/proc/<pid>/environ`), or from any file you keep
  it in. Without the key, treat any secret an agent can reach as disclosed to your model
  provider.
- **Sandboxing is not equal across platforms, and the gap is in `shell`.** The `fs_*` tools
  enforce the project-root boundary identically everywhere. The `shell` tool does not check
  paths in the command at all. On **Linux 5.13+** Landlock gives each shell child a
  kernel-enforced boundary; on **Windows and macOS there is no filesystem boundary on
  `shell`** — a command can read and write anything the daemon's OS user can. What remains
  there is the `[tools.shell_permissions]` regex list, the destructive-command classifier,
  and a working-directory revert that reports an escape *after* the command has already
  run. On those platforms, run the daemon as a low-privilege OS user with filesystem ACLs.
  On a Linux kernel without Landlock (older than 5.13, with Landlock not built in or not
  enabled at boot, or in a container whose seccomp profile blocks the Landlock syscalls), a
  sandboxed `shell` does not fall back to running unsandboxed: it refuses every command. A
  `shell` that is not sandboxed (`[tools].shell_policy = "unrestricted"`, or an agent in
  `allow_full_os_access`) runs without Landlock on every kernel.
- **`[security].allow_full_os_access` removes the filesystem sandbox for the agents you
  list.** It is a list of agent names, not a boolean: a listed agent's `fs_*` and `shell`
  run against the real root. Shell permissions and the destructive-command classifier still
  apply. Note that a listed name is matched — case-folded — against the name an
  `invoke_agent` call supplies, so any agent can claim it, registered or not.
- **Approval covers the runs you start, not what agents do to each other.** A `guarded`
  agent's runs that no human started — a DM from another agent, a notification, a
  scheduled job, a run as another agent's subagent — run tools without approval (except a
  foreground subagent run of an agent whose record sets `guarded` itself: its first gated
  call is denied), and any agent can DM any other by name. So one agent that reads
  untrusted input can drive every agent in the same gateway: keep such agents in a separate
  gateway from those holding what you would not hand that input. That is a boundary only
  if its tools cannot reach the other gateway — a separate project root, `ALMS_AUTH_TOKEN`
  set on the gateway you protect, and, where `shell` has no filesystem boundary, a
  different OS user. See
  [`docs/security-model.md` § 8.1](docs/security-model.md#guarded-is-not-an-agent-boundary).
- **Prompt injection is not solved.** Tool output enters the model's context; a hostile
  repository or web page can attempt to steer an agent.
