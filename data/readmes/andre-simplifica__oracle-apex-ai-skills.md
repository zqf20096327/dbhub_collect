Here, "vibe coding" does not mean guessing. It means giving the agent enough context, project standards, validation rules, and safety boundaries so it can do useful APEX work without improvising your architecture.

| The usual APEX grind | With these AI skills |
| --- | --- |
| Open Page Designer and copy settings by hand. | Ask the agent to inspect good examples and generate the change plan. |
| Hope you did not miss a Dynamic Action, process condition, or item setting. | Build validation, Session State, PL/SQL, exports, and runtime checks into the workflow. |
| Keep page, breadcrumb, help, menu, and dashboard standards in someone's head. | Version the standards in the project profile so every developer and agent follows them. |
| Treat exports as a last-minute backup. | Use readable exports and project profiles as context for safer AI-assisted APEX work. |

**Bottom line:** stop hand-building every repetitive APEX page. Let an AI agent inspect your app, understand your patterns, generate the boring parts, validate the result, and keep the project standards documented.

## What this is

This is a reusable skill set for AI agents working on supported **Oracle APEX 24.2 and later** projects.

It helps tools like Codex, Claude Code, and other agents understand how to work safely in APEX projects:

- read the existing application before changing it;
- respect Page Designer, SQLcl, Object Browser, PL/SQL packages, exports, and runtime validation;
- avoid inventing tables, columns, packages, business rules, or UI patterns;
- separate reusable APEX guidance from project-specific standards;
- make the agent ask better questions and avoid obvious mistakes.

It is not magic, and it does not replace APEX knowledge. It is a practical playbook for the AI agent helping you.

The repository is a **skill kit**, not an APEX plugin. It contains four focused skills:

| Skill | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `oracle-apex-ai-skills` | Main entry point, installation/update contract, and task router |
| `oracle-apex-dev` | Daily APEX, SQL, PL/SQL, REST, jobs, security, and runtime work |
| `oracle-apex-object-lock` | Cooperative locks for shared DEV database objects |
| `oracle-apex-export` | Inspection exports, first baseline, official snapshots, and release exports |

The base kit works on its own. Branded report/help layouts, browser-rendered PDF, and spreadsheet output live in the separate [Oracle APEX Brand Report Kit](https://github.com/andre-simplifica/oracle-apex-brand-report-kit). Self-contained chart regions live in [Oracle APEX ECharts](https://github.com/andre-simplifica/oracle-apex-echarts). This kit can recommend those optional repositories, but never copies or updates them.

## Supported APEX Versions

| Version | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Below APEX 24.2 | Unsupported by this kit |
| APEX 24.2 through releases before 26.1 | Supported; standard SQL split + readable YAML + monolithic SQL export |
| APEX 26.1 or later | Supported; 26.1 public APIs are version-gated and official application exports remain SQL split + monolithic SQL |

APEXlang is a product capability from APEX/SQLcl 26.1, but it is deliberately disabled here. This kit does not generate, export, parse, edit, validate, compile, or import APEXlang. See [Oracle APEX version compatibility](skills/oracle-apex-dev/references/apex-version-compatibility.md).

The 24.2 boundary is this kit's support baseline. Oracle introduced the native Dynamic Content region returning CLOB in APEX 22.2; the validator records that product fact but still blocks the kit as unsupported below 24.2.

## Who it is for

This is especially useful if you are an Oracle APEX developer who:

- knows APEX, PL/SQL, SQL Developer, and Page Designer;
- does not want to become a terminal-heavy Git wizard just to use AI;
- wants the AI to understand the way your app actually works;
- wants the team to follow the same page, menu, breadcrumb, help, dashboard, and validation patterns;
- wants to stop repeating the same manual APEX work every day.

If you are already comfortable with GitHub, terminal scripts, and AI agent internals, start with the more technical docs: [docs/technical-overview.md](docs/technical-overview.md).

## The recommended project installation

> [!TIP]
> **Rule number one: describe more, click less, type less boilerplate.**
>
> If you are used to opening Page Designer, copying a region, rebuilding a SQL query by hand, and fixing one property at a time, this is the mindset shift: start by explaining the business problem, the existing pattern, the page examples, the constraints, and what "done" means.
>
> Your AI tool should become the place where project knowledge is transferred, refined, and reused. The better you describe the intent, the safer and faster the agent can inspect, generate, validate, and document the change.

Commit the skills into each consuming repository under `.agents/skills/`. Codex discovers repository-scoped skills from that directory, so the whole team uses the same reviewed version.

Open Codex in the project and say:

```text
Install Oracle APEX AI Skills in this project from:
https://github.com/andre-simplifica/oracle-apex-ai-skills

Use the repository-managed installation under .agents/skills.
Inspect the source, run its validation, show me the install dry-run, and explain every file that will be created or updated.
Preserve every existing project-owned file under .oracle-apex-ai/ and every migration.
Do not connect to Oracle, compile objects, import APEX, commit, or push as part of the file installation.
After installation, audit the cooperative object-lock runtime separately and tell me whether it is installed, absent, partial, or incompatible.
```

The GitHub address in that request is the download source; it is not a special `@github-url` syntax. After installation, invoke the installed skill with `@Oracle APEX AI Skills` on desktop or `$oracle-apex-ai-skills` in Codex CLI/IDE.

The deterministic project manager records the upstream repository, requested ref, resolved commit, compatibility, and a SHA-256 checksum for every managed file. It refuses to update locally modified managed files.

The install creates or manages:

```text
.agents/skills/<four-core-skills>/
.oracle-apex-ai/compatibility.json
.oracle-apex-ai/installation-manifest.json
.oracle-apex-ai/upstream-lock.json
Util/scripts/manage_oracle_apex_ai_skills.py
Util/scripts/check_oracle_apex_pending.py
Util/scripts/manage_oracle_apex_export_retention.py
Util/scripts/apex_version.py
Util/scripts/validate_oracle_apex_compatibility.py
Util/scripts/validate_oracle_apex_export.py
Util/scripts/validate_oracle_apex_release_bundle.py
```

It initializes missing project-owned files but never overwrites them:

```text
.oracle-apex-ai/project-profile.md
.oracle-apex-ai/app-patterns.md
.oracle-apex-ai/page-patterns/
.oracle-apex-ai/export-policy.json
db/migrations/pending/pending_ddl.sql
db/migrations/pending/pending_dml.sql
db/migrations/applied/
```

Installing skill files does **not** install database objects. The object-lock runtime has its own read-only audit and separately authorized DEV installer.

For daily work, keep talking to the agent like this:

```text
I need a new operational page for this business flow.
First inspect pages 45 and 46 because they are the current pattern.
Do not copy page 12 because it is legacy.
Use the project profile, identify the owning package, propose the APEX changes, and tell me what must be validated in runtime.
```

The goal is not to become a better command memorizer. The goal is to make the project's standards explicit enough that the AI and the team can reuse them every day.

## You get better results with database access

The skill works even if the agent only sees your files, exports, screenshots, and error messages.

But the result is much better when your AI tool can also access your development environment safely:

- SQLcl already configured;
- VS Code with Oracle/SQL Developer extension;
- SQL Developer connection already working;
- local Oracle XE;
- Oracle VM;
- Autonomous Database on OCI with wallet or SQLNet;
- DEV APEX open in the browser.

When the agent can connect to the database or APEX DEV environment, it can do much more than write instructions. It can help compile packages, check SQL, inspect Session State, validate runtime behavior, and reduce the back-and-forth.

Do not paste secrets into the skill. Use the secure connection setup you already have locally.

## How to use it after installation

In ChatGPT/Codex desktop, select **Oracle APEX AI Skills** with `@`. In Codex CLI or the IDE extension, mention `$oracle-apex-ai-skills`. Natural-language matching also works.

```text
Use Oracle APEX AI Skills to inspect page 120 before changing anything.
```

```text
Create a new APEX page following the pattern of pages 45 and 46.
Do not copy page 12 because it is legacy.
Use Oracle APEX AI Skills and read the project profile first.
```

```text
Review this upload flow.
Check Page Designer, Session State, staging tables, PL/SQL, and runtime behavior before proposing a fix.
```

```text
The adjustments are finished. Use Oracle APEX AI Skills to generate the release:
export the complete APEX application, create the five-file partial database bundle from the explicit base snapshot, and include the configured pending DDL and DML exactly once.
```

The command is not the important part. The important part is giving the agent enough project context and making it follow the same standards your team follows.

### First version versus a normal release

Say **"initialize version 1"** only when complete versioned source does not exist. That mode exports the full APEX application and the full structural DDL of the application schema: tables, constraints, indexes, sequences, types, views, packages, routines, triggers, synonyms, and required explicit grants. It excludes table data, secrets, users, wallets, and unrelated/system schemas.

For normal development, no official export is generated by default. When you explicitly request a release, the APEX side is version-gated and complete: before APEX 26.1 it contains split SQL, readable YAML, and monolithic `f<APP_ID>.sql`; on APEX 26.1 or later it contains split SQL and the monolithic SQL file only. APEXlang remains forbidden. The database side is either `partial` (new/changed objects from one explicit base snapshot) or `full` (all supported objects), but both use the same five deterministic files. Pending remains exactly two configured files: DDL and DML. APEX components and standalone package/view/trigger/routine/type/synonym source are forbidden there.

### Cooperative object locks

The kit ships `DEV_OBJECT_LOCK`, two indexes, two operational views, and `PK_DEV_OBJECT_LOCK`. The runtime is cooperative: compliant developers and agents acquire, assert, renew, and release locks; arbitrary manual DDL outside the workflow can bypass it.

Before editing or compiling a supported object in shared DEV, the agent must:

1. refresh and verify the Git base;
2. inspect active and recent locks;
3. acquire the object lock;
4. assert ownership immediately before every compilation;
5. renew long tasks;
6. release the lock with the final SHA or abandonment reason.

One `PACKAGE` lock covers both specification and body. Runtime 1.1 also includes guarded history cleanup and an uninstaller that refuses to proceed while a non-expired active lock exists. File installation never runs either database script.

## Keep your project standards outside the core

This repository contains the reusable APEX core.

Your application-specific rules live in your own project, usually here:

```text
.oracle-apex-ai/project-profile.md
.oracle-apex-ai/app-patterns.md
.oracle-apex-ai/page-patterns/
```

That is where you document things like:

- how help opens in your app;
- what breadcrumb pattern you use;
- where buttons go;
- when to use Dynamic Content;
- which packages own dashboards, help, and transactional logic;
- which pages are good examples;
- which old pages should not be copied.

When you declare one of these conventions to be a project standard, the agent first inspects the real example and runtime, then records the reusable rule in these project-owned files. Future kit updates preserve them. For branded or highly interactive layouts, the skill actively considers a package-backed Dynamic Content region with filters, drilldowns, grouping, export actions, and targeted refresh; native APEX components remain preferred when they already fit the requirement well.

This is what makes the skill portable. The core can work across APEX projects, while each project keeps its own personality and rules.

## Help improve it

If your AI agent learns a better APEX pattern, a safer validation flow, a better export setup, or a clearer way to document project standards, ask it to open a pull request here.

That is the point: one developer improves the skill, and everyone benefits.

Good contributions:

- generic Oracle APEX guardrails;
- SQLcl and export improvements;
- better validation checklists;
- clearer project profile templates;
- agent-agnostic instructions;
- better English docs and a clearer Portuguese onboarding README.

Project-specific rules should stay in the project profile, not in the shared core.

## Safe contribution checklist

Before opening an issue or pull request:

- remove passwords, tokens, wallets, API keys, connection strings, and OAuth secrets;
- replace private URLs, hostnames, workspace names, schema names, and app aliases with placeholders;
- remove customer names, production data, dumps, payloads, and sensitive screenshots;
- keep application-specific rules in your own `.oracle-apex-ai/project-profile.md`;
- read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Cost

This repository is free and open source under the MIT License.

You pay only for whatever AI tool or infrastructure you choose to use:

- Codex, Claude Code, or another AI tool subscription;
- API/token usage if your AI tool is billed that way;
- your normal Oracle, OCI, database, VM, or local environment costs.

These skills are just versioned content: Markdown, templates, and helper scripts.

## Manual setup

For a repository-managed Codex installation, clone a reviewed tag or commit and run a dry-run first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andre-simplifica/oracle-apex-ai-skills.git /tmp/oracle-apex-ai-skills
git -C /tmp/oracle-apex-ai-skills checkout <tag-or-commit>
python3 /tmp/oracle-apex-ai-skills/scripts/manage_project_installation.py install \
  --project-root /path/to/your/project \
  --source-ref <tag-or-commit> \
  --dry-run
python3 /tmp/oracle-apex-ai-skills/scripts/manage_project_installation.py install \
  --project-root /path/to/your/project \
  --source-ref <tag-or-commit>
```

For a personal/global installation instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andre-simplifica/oracle-apex-ai-skills.git ~/.oracle-apex-ai-skills
bash ~/.oracle-apex-ai-skills/scripts/install_codex.sh
```

The personal installer uses the current user-scoped Codex location, `$HOME/.agents/skills`. If an older copied skill directory exists, review it and use `--replace-existing`; the installer moves it to a timestamped backup before creating the repository symlink. The same option migrates only this kit's four legacy entries out of `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills` to prevent duplicate versions.

- [docs/install-claude-code.md](docs/install-claude-code.md)
- [docs/technical-overview.md](docs/technical-overview.md)
- [docs/adapt-to-your-project.md](docs/adapt-to-your-project.md)

## Keep the skills up to date

Updates are explicit, reviewable project changes. They do not touch project-owned standards or the database.

Ask your AI:

```text
Oracle APEX AI Skills was updated. Update this project from:
https://github.com/andre-simplifica/oracle-apex-ai-skills

Compare the installed commit with the requested upstream tag/commit.
Run status, doctor, check, and update --dry-run first.
Show the exact managed-file diff and stop if a managed file was changed locally.
Preserve .oracle-apex-ai/project-profile.md, app-patterns, page-patterns, export-policy.json, and all migrations.
If this upgrade adds project-owned templates, initialize only files that are missing; never replace customized files.
Do not change Oracle, import APEX, commit, or push automatically.
```

Manual status:

```bash
python3 Util/scripts/manage_oracle_apex_ai_skills.py status --project-root .
```

Use a freshly fetched upstream manager for `check` and `update`. Pass `--initialize-missing-project-files` only after reviewing the dry-run. Follow [docs/update-and-contribute.md](docs/update-and-contribute.md).
