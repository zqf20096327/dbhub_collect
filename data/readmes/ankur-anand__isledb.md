**A key-value database for object storage, written in Go.**

Store durable key-value data on Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob
Storage, or any S3-compatible store such as MinIO; local files and memory work
for development. Add reader services independently and run compaction outside
your application processes.

IsleDB provides:

- point reads, range scans, iterators, snapshots, TTLs, and deletes;
- one fenced writer with any number of independent reader processes;
- configurable local caching for readers;
- optional keys-only or full-value change feeds;
- compaction and storage cleanup that can run in a separate process or
  scheduled job.

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/ankur-anand/isledb
```

IsleDB requires Go 1.25 or newer.

## Quick start

This example uses an Amazon S3 bucket; credentials come from the standard AWS
environment (`AWS_PROFILE`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, an instance role, and so on).
`Put` buffers the mutation and `Flush` makes it durable and visible to readers
that refresh.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"path/filepath"

	"github.com/ankur-anand/isledb"
)

func main() {
	if err := run(context.Background()); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

func run(ctx context.Context) error {
	db, err := isledb.Open(ctx, "s3://my-bucket?region=us-east-1", isledb.DBOptions{
		Prefix: "example",
	})
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer func() { _ = db.Close() }()

	writerOptions := isledb.DefaultWriterOptions()
	// Commit only on Flush, for this example; by default the writer also
	// commits every second.
	writerOptions.Flush.Interval = 0

	writer, err := db.OpenWriter(ctx, writerOptions)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	if _, err := writer.Put(ctx, []byte("hello"), []byte("world")); err != nil {
		return err
	}
	if err := writer.Flush(ctx); err != nil {
		return err
	}
	if err := writer.Close(ctx); err != nil {
		return err
	}

	cacheDir, err := filepath.Abs("./isledb-cache")
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	reader, err := db.OpenReader(
		ctx,
		isledb.DefaultReaderOpenOptions(cacheDir),
	)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer func() { _ = reader.Close() }()

	value, found, err := reader.Get(ctx, []byte("hello"))
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	if found {
		fmt.Printf("hello = %s\n", value)
	}
	return nil
}
```

The same API works with cloud bucket URLs:

| Provider | Example bucket URL |
| --- | --- |
| Amazon S3 | `s3://my-bucket?region=us-east-1` |
| Google Cloud Storage | `gs://my-bucket` |
| Azure Blob Storage | `azblob://my-container` |

Credentials and provider-specific options come from the corresponding
[Go Cloud bucket driver](https://gocloud.dev/howto/blob/). Use a unique prefix
for each database.

> **Local stores are for development only.** `file://` and `mem://` buckets
> behave correctly within one process, which is enough for local experiments
> and tests. Across processes, their conditional writes are not atomic, so
> never point two processes at the same `file://` directory, and do not use
> them in production. Use S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, or an
> S3-compatible store.

## Behavior to know

- `Put`, `PutWithTTL`, and `Delete` buffer mutations in memory and return
  each mutation's sequence. `WaitCommitted(ctx, seq)` returns once that write
  is in object storage; use it before acting on a write you cannot lose.
- If storage is down, writes wait in memory and are retried; once
  `MaxPendingMemtables` memtables are waiting, `Put` returns `ErrBackpressure`.
- A successful `Flush`, background flush, or `Writer.Close` is the durability
  and visibility boundary. `Flush` can be retried; `Close` makes one attempt
  and finishes the writer either way, reporting any writes not known to be
  committed. To stop gracefully, call `Drain`, then `Close` with a deadline,
  then `DB.Close`; see [Shutting down](#shutting-down).
- One writer owns a database prefix at a time. Writer ownership is fenced across
  processes.
- A reader uses a consistent loaded view. It refreshes according to its view
  policy; call `Refresh` when a newly committed write must be discovered
  immediately.
- `Writer.State` reports whether the writer is open, stopped, closed or
  fenced, and how much is not yet committed, for readiness probes and
  dashboards.
- Reader services scale independently by opening the same bucket and prefix with
  their own local cache directories.
- Run maintenance in production so compaction, checkpoints, configured
  retention, and physical cleanup continue to make progress.

### Shutting down

`Drain` stops intake and commits everything accepted, retrying until its
context ends; `Close` is the final step:

```go
if err := writer.Drain(ctx); err != nil { // Put and Delete now return ErrWritesStopped
    log.Printf("drain: %v", err)
}
closeCtx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 2*time.Minute)
defer cancel()
if err := writer.Close(closeCtx); err != nil {
    log.Printf("writer closed with unconfirmed writes: %v", err) // the error names them
}
_ = db.Close()
```

`DB.Close` alone closes an open writer with a fixed 30-second deadline and no
retry; it is cleanup, not the durability step. Set `Flush.Interval` so a
crash loses at most one interval of writes.

See the [Go API guide](api.md) for scans, iterators, snapshots, prefetching,
configuration, metrics, and error handling.

## Optional change feed

Enable the change feed when another service needs committed mutations in writer
order:

```go
db, err := isledb.Open(ctx, bucketURL, isledb.DBOptions{
	Prefix: "prod/accounts",
	ChangeFeed: &isledb.ChangeFeedOptions{
		Payload: isledb.ChangeFeedFullValues,
	},
})
```

Use `ChangeFeedKeysOnly` for invalidation or downstream re-fetching. Use
`ChangeFeedFullValues` when consumers need the committed PUT values. The mode
is persisted when the feed is enabled and cannot later be changed for that
database prefix.

Consumers use `OpenChangeReader` with an opaque, persistent cursor. See
[Change feed](api.md#change-feed)
for the complete example and retention behavior.

## Run maintenance separately

Maintenance can run continuously in its own service or periodically as a job.
It opens the same database prefix as the writer and readers.

```go
func runMaintenance(ctx context.Context, bucketURL string) error {
	db, err := isledb.Open(ctx, bucketURL, isledb.DBOptions{
		Prefix: "prod/accounts",
	})
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer func() { _ = db.Close() }()

	maintenance, err := db.OpenMaintenance(ctx, isledb.DefaultMaintenanceOptions())
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer func() { _ = maintenance.Close(context.Background()) }()

	return maintenance.Run(ctx) // until ctx ends or another process takes over maintenance
}
```

The active writer publishes maintenance results, while cleanup proceeds at its
own bounded pace. Use `RunOnce` instead of `Run` for a scheduled job.

## When IsleDB fits

IsleDB is a good fit when:

- object storage is the durability and capacity layer;
- writes can be buffered and published in batches;
- readers should scale without maintaining database replicas;
- second-scale freshness is acceptable;
- compaction should run away from application servers.

Choose a different database when you need:

- consistent sub-10-millisecond read-after-write latency;
- multi-key transactions or compare-and-swap updates;
- secondary indexes, joins, or a query language;
- high-frequency updates to a small, hot dataset.
