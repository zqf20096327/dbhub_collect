# Polymarket Collector

This repository collects Polymarket's public market WebSocket feed across active binary markets, discovers short-lived contracts such as 5-minute BTC up/down markets, preserves collector order for deterministic orderbook reconstruction, and exports each UTC receive-time hour as compact event-specific Parquet files.


## How is this collector different?

Compared with [PMXT's original collector](https://github.com/pmxt-dev/polymarket-orderbook-collector), which the [PMXT archive](https://archive.pmxt.dev/) and its successor [AG6 archive](https://polymarket-archive.ag6.ai/) are based on, this implementation focuses on producing a more complete and reliably reconstructible dataset. This is not a simple in-place replacement, but rather a substantial rewrite with different output formats, improved stability and performance.

The main differences are:

- **Actually reconstructible orderbooks:** one collector-wide `sequence` number preserves the accepted order across WebSocket frames and event types. When the collector has to reconnect, price changes are withheld until a fresh book snapshot provides a valid reconstruction point.
- **All supported event types:** the archiver includes not only `book`, `price_change`, `last_trade_price` and `tick_size_change` events, but also `best_bid_ask`, `new_market`, and `market_resolved` events.
- **Faster market discovery:** dedicated lifecycle connections normally discover and subscribe to new markets as they are announced, with Gamma polling as a fallback. This reduces discovery lag for short-lived markets such as 5-minute BTC contracts instead of waiting for the next periodic Gamma poll.
- **Cleaner file structure:** each event type has its own typed Parquet file with exact decimal values. Files can be queried independently or merged by `sequence` to recover the complete accepted event order.
- **Rust only:** the collector, writer, and exporter are now written purely in Rust, replacing the previous mixed Rust/Python application code. That means fewer runtimes to babysit and, naturally, being *BlAZinG fAsT with seAmLEsS CoNcuRReNcy and zerO COsT aBstrActIOnS* 🚀🦀✨ or something.


## Where to find the data

There is no known archive running this version yet.

To generate this dataset yourself, follow [Local development and execution](#local-development-and-execution), or [Run in production](#run-in-production) for a long-running R2 deployment.


## The archive structure TLDR

Every completed UTC receive-time hour is a self-contained directory:

```text
YYYY-MM-DD/HH/
├── best_bid_ask.parquet
├── book.parquet
├── last_trade_price.parquet
├── market_resolved.parquet
├── new_market.parquet
├── price_change.parquet
├── tick_size_change.parquet
└── manifest.json
```

| File                       | What one row represents                                                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `book.parquet`             | A complete aggregated bid/ask snapshot for one outcome asset.                    |
| `price_change.parquet`     | The new absolute size at one `(side, price)` level; zero removes it.             |
| `last_trade_price.parquet` | One trade observation with price, size, side, fee, and Polygon transaction hash. |
| `tick_size_change.parquet` | A market's old and new tick size.                                                |
| `best_bid_ask.parquet`     | An independently observed best bid, best ask, and spread.                        |
| `new_market.parquet`       | A newly observed binary market, its two assets, outcomes, and metadata.          |
| `market_resolved.parquet`  | A resolved market and its winning asset/outcome when supplied.                   |
| `manifest.json`            | The completion marker and integrity index for the entire hour.                   |

Full format specification can be found in [`docs/PARQUET_EXPORT.md`](docs/PARQUET_EXPORT.md).

Key format rules:

- **Common columns:** `timestamp_received`, `sequence`, source `timestamp`, and `market`; token files add `asset_id`.
- **Exact values:** prices and sizes are decimals, and book sides are typed lists of `(price, size)` structs.
- **Physical order:** `(market, asset_id, sequence)` for token events and `(market, sequence)` for lifecycle events.
- **Replay order:** always merge on `sequence`, including across different files.
- **Completion:** trust an hour only when `manifest.json` exists.

### Collector — discovery, collection, and order

[polymarket-collector](services/polymarket/collector)

- Owns market state, authoritative WebSocket subscriptions, receive timestamps, and collector sequencing.
- Listens for `new_market` on three lifecycle sockets and subscribes its assets immediately—important for short-lived markets.
- Restores known markets from a validated Redis cache after restart.
- Reconciles through one rate-limited Gamma client: new markets every 10 seconds, resolutions every 30 seconds, and a full scan every 30 minutes.
- Replaces the restart cache only after full, new-market, and resolved-market reconciliation establish a conservative coverage watermark.

### Redis Stream — the durable handoff

- Separates live WebSocket collection from ClickHouse restarts and write latency.
- Uses a renewable lease and fencing generation so exactly one collector can append to `polymarket:events:v3`.
- Carries exactly `timestamp_received`, `sequence`, and normalized JSON `data` for each record.
- Keeps records pending until ClickHouse commits; Redis AOF is enabled.
- Absorbs short storage interruptions. It is not sized as a multi-hour RAM backlog.

### Writer and ClickHouse — a compact raw window

[polymarket-clickhouse-writer](services/polymarket/clickhouse-writer)

- Batches Redis records into `polymarket_orderbook_v3`.
- Uses one bounded actor for Redis reads, ClickHouse commits, and Redis acknowledgements; there are no in-process handoff queues.
- Stores only receive time, collector sequence, and normalized JSON in hourly partitions.
- Collapses delivery retries by `sequence`; it never deduplicates by payload.
- Keeps ClickHouse as a short queryable export window. Validated archived partitions expire after three hours by default, while the newest is retained for sequence recovery.

### Exporter — typed, immutable hours

The [polymarket-archive-exporter](services/polymarket/archive-exporter):

- Streams Arrow batches into event-specific Parquet without buffering an hour.
- Writes ZSTD level 9 files and publishes `manifest.json` last.
- Supports atomic local output and bounded multipart uploads to an existing R2 bucket.
- Safely retries interrupted hours; an incomplete directory has no manifest.



### Correctness model

- `sequence` is the authoritative order. Source and receive timestamps may tie and are never used to invent exchange order.
- After a connection or subscription begins, `price_change` rows are withheld until a fresh `book` snapshot makes that asset reconstructible again.
- A retry of one collector record keeps its sequence and is idempotent. A separate source observation gets a new sequence and is retained even when its public fields are identical.
- `transaction_hash` is not a fill ID: one Polygon transaction can settle multiple fills, so trade payload fields are never used for deduplication.
- Polymarket exposes no replay cursor or source sequence. The archive faithfully records what this collector accepted, but it is not an exchange audit log and cannot recreate an event missed during an outage.

The complete collection, restart, timestamp, reconnection, and replay contract is in [docs/DATA_MODEL.md](docs/DATA_MODEL.md).

## Development and operations

### Local development and execution

Requires Linux plus Docker Compose or Podman Compose:

```sh
./run_local.sh
```

This creates `.env` when needed, starts the complete stack, builds the Rust services, and exports to `.data/parquet` without R2 credentials.

Use a specific container runtime when both are installed:

```sh
CONTAINER_RUNTIME=podman ./run_local.sh
CONTAINER_RUNTIME=docker ./run_local.sh
```

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `./run_local.sh` | Build and start the stack without recreating unchanged services. |
| `./run_local.sh redeploy` | Rebuild and recreate every application service. |
| `./run_local.sh logs` | Follow collector, writer, and exporter logs. |
| `./run_local.sh status` | Show infrastructure and application containers. |
| `./run_local.sh down` | Stop everything while retaining collected data. |

After changing source code, use `./run_local.sh redeploy`, especially with Podman Compose, which may build a new image without replacing an existing container.

Redis, ClickHouse, and Parquet data remain under `.data`. Completed files appear in `.data/parquet/YYYY-MM-DD/HH/`. An hour becomes exportable only after it is complete and the following receive-time hour has reached ClickHouse, so the first archive can take a little over one hour to appear.

Redis and ClickHouse are reachable only inside the private `obdata` container network:

| Service           | Internal address         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Redis             | `obdata-redis:6379`      |
| ClickHouse HTTP   | `obdata-clickhouse:8123` |
| ClickHouse native | `obdata-clickhouse:9000` |

Use `docker exec` or `podman exec` for local inspection rather than exposing a database port.

### Run in production

Production uses an existing R2 bucket. Prepare the environment:

1. Create the R2 bucket.
2. Set a strong `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD`.
3. Set `R2_ENDPOINT`, `R2_BUCKET`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY`, and `R2_SECRET_KEY`.
4. Restrict access to `.env`.
5. Confirm the host can provide a high open-file limit.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
chmod 600 .env
nano .env
```

Start infrastructure and applications with Docker Compose:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.infra.yml up -d --remove-orphans
docker compose -f docker-compose.polymarket.yml up -d --build --remove-orphans
```

Start infrastructure first: it creates the private `obdata` bridge that the application Compose project joins.

Production notes:

- Redis, ClickHouse, and all Rust services share the private `obdata` bridge. Redis and ClickHouse publish no host ports.
- Keep `RLIMIT_NOFILE` high. The supplied configuration requests 262,144 open files through `CONTAINER_NOFILE_LIMIT`; 65,536 is a practical minimum for the full market universe. Rootless Podman cannot request more than `ulimit -Hn`, so lower the setting to that host limit when necessary.
- ClickHouse retains internal metrics at 10-second resolution and writes `system.metric_log` as Compact parts to avoid descriptor-heavy merges. When these table settings first take effect after a restart, ClickHouse preserves the previous table as a read-only `system.metric_log_N`.
- Container stdout and stderr are capped at 100 MB per service by default; change `CONTAINER_LOG_MAX_SIZE` if the host has a different log-retention policy.
- Use a host firewall with default-deny inbound rules and allow only required management traffic—normally SSH or a VPN. Docker manages its own iptables/nftables rules, so verify the effective exposure after deployment instead of relying only on a firewall frontend.
- Services use `restart: unless-stopped`.
- `CLICKHOUSE_RETENTION_HOURS=0` retains every raw partition.
- Do not use `run_local.sh` for R2: its local overlay switches the exporter to `.data/parquet`.



### Monitor the pipeline

Start with container health and structured logs:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.infra.yml ps
docker compose -f docker-compose.polymarket.yml ps
docker compose -f docker-compose.polymarket.yml logs -f --tail=200
```

The most useful signals are:

| Area       | Healthy pattern                                                                                                 | Investigate when                                                                                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Collector  | `[QUEUE-STATS]` reports low queue depths, route health, recovery latency, and current Gamma/cache ages.          | Queue high-water repeatedly approaches capacity, Gamma ages keep growing, or `assets_down` remains elevated. |
| Reconnects | `[CONNECTION-DATA-GAP]` and `[CONN-GAP]` are followed by asset recoveries in `[QUEUE-STATS]`.                    | Recovery latency grows, connections stay down, or gaps cluster continuously.                                 |
| Writer     | `[CLICKHOUSE-WRITER-STATS]` shows a bounded batch, zero parse failures, and advancing read, commit, and acknowledgement counts. | Redis lag grows from minute to minute or ClickHouse retries persist.                                         |
| Redis      | Stream consumer lag and `used_memory` remain bounded.                                                           | The writer is unavailable and the stream grows; current traffic can consume many GiB per hour.               |
| Exporter   | One `completed receive-time hour` per hour, followed by safe partition cleanup.                                 | Export retries continue, no new manifest appears, or cleanup repeatedly retains a supposedly complete hour.  |

Useful Redis checks:

```sh
docker exec obdata-redis redis-cli XINFO GROUPS polymarket:events:v3
docker exec obdata-redis redis-cli INFO memory
```

For an archive-level check, verify that each expected hour has a readable `manifest.json`, that its seven listed objects exist, and that consumers verify the recorded SHA-256 digests before trusting the hour.

> **Reference workload:** measured with approximately 156,000 binary markets, 312,000 assets, 1,250 WebSocket connections, and about 100 million normalized events per hour (roughly 28,000/s). Polymarket traffic varies.


| Resource         | Measured reference                                                           | Explanation                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CPU             | Roughly one aggregate core in steady state.                                   | ClickHouse merges, cold subscription, and hourly export are bursty; 4 vCPUs can be tight, 8 leaves nice headroom. |
| RAM             | About 4–5 GiB of container RSS; the collector uses roughly 1.0–1.2 GiB.        | 16 GiB supports the full pipeline; 32 GiB leaves safer page-cache, merge, export, and backlog headroom.            |
| Open files      | The collector holds roughly 1,250 WebSockets and ClickHouse uses many files.   | A high limit avoids failures during reconnect waves, merges, and export.                                          |
| ClickHouse disk | About 3.4–3.8 GiB per raw hour; the rolling window normally uses 15–20 GiB.   | Any reasonable SSD should be fine, we need storage for the DB and exports.                                        |
| Parquet archive | About 0.8–0.9 GB/hour, or 20–22 GB/day.                                       | The data take around 0.65 TB per 30 days in local storage or R2.                                                  |
| Network in      | Roughly 60–75 Mbit/s sustained, with snapshot and reconnect bursts.           | 100 Mbit/s is a minimum. More bandwidth shortens full-universe and reconnect recovery.                            |
| Network out     | Control traffic stays below 1 Mbit/s; burst uploads send roughly 1 GB hourly. | Faster outbound completes R2 uploads well before the next hour becomes eligible.                                  |

RAM sizing assumes the ClickHouse writer is healthy. A writer outage leaves the durable Redis Stream growing at approximately the uncompressed event rate of about 30 GiB an hour before Redis overhead. Monitor lag and memory closely and consider Redis as a short term back-off rather than treating Redis as a multi-hour backlog store.

## Thanks

This project builds on the shoulders of giants from [PMXT](https://www.pmxt.dev/) and their original collector codebase. The schema of the data is an iterative improvement on their V2 schema, which is why you might see V3 references in the code. Public datasets like theirs and others make independent personal research of prediction markets possible.
