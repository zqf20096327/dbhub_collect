## 🧠 AI and Data Processing

AuraTrips implements a ****RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model** to leverage data from a local CSV file containing information about the best travel destinations. This approach allows us to provide more accurate and up-to-date recommendations by combining the power of large language models with real-world data.

The **open-source LLaMA 3 model** is used for curating and generating personalized itineraries. By utilizing this advanced language model, we can create more natural and context-aware travel plans that truly reflect the user's preferences and interests.

The **RAG** implementation involves the following steps:

1. **Data Ingestion**: We process a CSV file containing verified travel destination data sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saketk511/travel-dataset-guide-to-indias-must-see-places). This dataset has information about 300+ destinations, and user ratings, providing a rich source of information for generating personalized itineraries.
2. **Retrieval**: When a user inputs their preferences, we use this data to retrieve relevant information about potential destinations and activities.
3. **Generation**: The LLaMA 3 model then uses this retrieved information, along with the user's preferences, to generate a tailored itinerary.

## 🎨 Design Choices

1. **FastAPI for Backend**: Chosen for its high performance, easy-to-use async capabilities, and built-in support for OpenAPI documentation.
2. **React with Vite for Frontend**: React provides a robust ecosystem for building interactive UIs, while Vite offers lightning-fast build times and hot module replacement.
3. **Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui**: Allow for rapid UI development with a consistent design language.
4. ****RAG** Implementation**: Ensures AI-generated itineraries are grounded in real-world data and up-to-date information.
5. **LLaMA 3 via Groq API**: Offers more control over the AI's outputs and potential for future fine-tuning.
6. **CSV Data Integration**: Maintains a curated, high-quality dataset that can be easily updated and expanded.

## 🚧 Challenges and Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Integrating **RAG** with LLaMA 3 for accurate travel recommendations.
   **Solution**: Developed a custom pipeline that retrieves relevant information from our CSV dataset based on user preferences, then uses this context to guide the LLaMA 3 model in generating personalized itineraries.

2. **Challenge**: Unable to share with friends and family.
   **Solution**: Added a feature to share the itinerary by downloading it as a PDF file or printing it. Additionally, the unique link can be shared via email.

3. **Challenge**: Expensive to keep using LLaMA 3 model.
   **Solution**: Implemented caching of responses from the LLM to reduce the cost of using the model. Subsequent requests for the same itinerary are essentially free as they are hashed to get a unique id and stored in the database.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

1. Implement user feedback loops to continuously improve AI recommendations.
2. Integrate real-time pricing and availability data from travel APIs.
3. Develop a mobile app for on-the-go itinerary access and updates.
4. Enable sharing of entire itinerary PDF with friends and family via email.
