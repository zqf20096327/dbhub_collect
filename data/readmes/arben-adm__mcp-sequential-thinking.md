# Sequential Thinking MCP Server

[![MCP Toplist](https://mcptoplist.com/badge/glama%2Farben-adm%2Fmcp-sequential-thinking.svg)](https://mcptoplist.com/server/glama%2Farben-adm%2Fmcp-sequential-thinking)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server providing a structured thinking journal: schema-validated thoughts, an append-only audit trail, structural analysis, and session export/import. It records and organizes a thinking process through defined stages — it does not evaluate, generate, or improve the reasoning itself; that stays with whatever model is calling it.

## Features

- **Structured Thinking Framework**: Organizes thoughts through standard cognitive stages (Problem Definition, Research, Analysis, Synthesis, Conclusion), with warnings (or, in `--strict-stages` mode, rejection) when a thought skips or backtracks a stage
- **Revisions & Branching**: Revise earlier thoughts or fork alternative lines of reasoning, with revision- and branch-aware analysis and summaries
- **Thought Tracking**: Records and manages sequential thoughts with metadata as a structured, typed audit trail (`structured_content` on every tool response)
- **Related Thought Analysis**: Finds thoughts that are lexically similar to the current one, independent of stage, plus a separate same-tag/same-stage grouping — a categorical signal, not a claim of semantic relevance
- **Progress Monitoring**: Explicit mainline position, total recorded thoughts, branch count, and revision count — not a single ambiguous percentage
- **Summary Generation**: Extracts the actual recorded thinking (per-stage excerpts, aggregated challenged assumptions, open branches, revision chains) alongside structural statistics — a deterministic extraction, not new reasoning
- **Persistent Storage**: Append-only JSONL session log with thread-safety and automatic crash recovery
- **Data Import/Export**: Share and reuse thinking sessions
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily customize and extend functionality
- **Robust Error Handling**: Protocol/validation errors (bad stage, duplicate thought number, path traversal) fail the call outright; execution errors the caller can adapt to come back as a normal tool result
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type annotations (`mypy --strict` clean) and Pydantic validation, including declared output schemas for every tool

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- UV package manager ([Install Guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv))

## Key Technologies

- **Pydantic**: For data validation, serialization, and structured tool output schemas
- **Portalocker**: For thread-safe file access
- **MCP Python SDK 2.x** (`mcp.server.mcpserver.MCPServer`): For Model Context Protocol integration

```

## Quick Start

The package is published on PyPI as [`mcp-sequential-thinking`](https://pypi.org/project/mcp-sequential-thinking/). The easiest way to run it is via `uvx` — no install step needed:

```bash
uvx mcp-sequential-thinking
```

Or install it permanently:

```bash
pip install mcp-sequential-thinking
mcp-sequential-thinking
```

### Development Setup

To work on the code, clone the repository and set it up from source:

1. **Set Up Project**
   ```bash
   # Create and activate virtual environment
   uv venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Unix

   # Install package and dependencies
   uv pip install -e .

   # For development with testing tools
   uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

   # For all optional dependencies
   uv pip install -e ".[all]"
   ```

2. **Run the Server**
   ```bash
   # Run directly
   uv run -m mcp_sequential_thinking.server

   # Or use the installed script
   mcp-sequential-thinking
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   pytest

   # Run with coverage report
   pytest --cov=mcp_sequential_thinking
   ```

## Claude Desktop Integration

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

### Option 1: Using uvx with the PyPI package (recommended)

No clone, no venv, no manual updates — uvx fetches the package from PyPI and runs it:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-sequential-thinking"]
    }
  }
}
```

To test unreleased changes, point uvx at the repository instead:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/arben-adm/mcp-sequential-thinking",
        "mcp-sequential-thinking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Using the installed entry point

If you've installed the package with `pip install mcp-sequential-thinking` (or `pip install -e .` from a clone):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "mcp-sequential-thinking"
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Using a local clone's virtual environment (development)

If you have set up the project with `uv venv && uv pip install -e .`, point directly to the venv Python interpreter. This avoids dependency resolution issues (e.g., on systems with Python 3.14+):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "/path/to/mcp-sequential-thinking/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "-m",
        "mcp_sequential_thinking.server"
      ],
      "cwd": "/path/to/mcp-sequential-thinking"
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 4: Using uv run on a local clone (development)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/mcp-sequential-thinking",
        "-m",
        "mcp_sequential_thinking.server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Editor & IDE Integration

### Cursor

Add to your Cursor MCP configuration at `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root (or globally at `~/.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-sequential-thinking"]
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code (Copilot MCP)

VS Code supports MCP servers since version 1.99+. Add to `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace or to your user `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-sequential-thinking"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Enable MCP support in VS Code via `"chat.mcp.enabled": true` in your settings.

### Zed

Add to your Zed settings (`~/.config/zed/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": {
        "path": "uvx",
        "args": ["mcp-sequential-thinking"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code (CLI)

Add the server using the CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add sequential-thinking -- uvx mcp-sequential-thinking
```

Or manually create/edit `.mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-sequential-thinking"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Windsurf

Add to your Windsurf MCP configuration at `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-sequential-thinking"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Gemini CLI

Add to your Gemini CLI settings at `~/.gemini/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-sequential-thinking"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

> **Tip:** All editor configurations above run the published PyPI package via `uvx`. To run from a local clone instead (e.g. for development), use `uv run --directory /path/to/mcp-sequential-thinking -m mcp_sequential_thinking.server` or point directly to the venv Python interpreter (see [Claude Desktop Options 3 and 4](#option-3-using-a-local-clones-virtual-environment-development)).

# How It Works

The server maintains a history of thoughts and processes them through a structured workflow. Each thought is validated using Pydantic models, categorized into thinking stages, and stored with relevant metadata in a thread-safe storage system. The server automatically handles data persistence, backup creation, and provides tools for analyzing relationships between thoughts.

Sessions are persisted as an append-only JSONL log at `~/.mcp_sequential_thinking/current_session.jsonl` (override the directory with the `MCP_STORAGE_DIR` environment variable). Each `process_thought` call appends a single fsynced line, so the file doubles as an audit trail and a truncated final line from an interrupted write is recovered automatically. Sessions from v0.5.x (`current_session.json`) are migrated losslessly on first start; the original file is kept as `current_session.json.migrated-to-v2`.

## Usage Guide

The Sequential Thinking server exposes five main tools:

### 1. `process_thought`

Records and analyzes a new thought in your sequential thinking process.

**Parameters:**

- `thought` (string): The content of your thought
- `thought_number` (integer): Position in your sequence (e.g., 1 for first thought)
- `total_thoughts` (integer): Expected total thoughts in the sequence
- `next_thought_needed` (boolean): Whether more thoughts are needed after this one
- `stage` (string): The thinking stage - must be one of:
  - "Problem Definition"
  - "Research"
  - "Analysis"
  - "Synthesis"
  - "Conclusion"
- `tags` (list of strings, optional): Keywords or categories for your thought
- `axioms_used` (list of strings, optional): Principles or axioms applied in your thought
- `assumptions_challenged` (list of strings, optional): Assumptions your thought questions or challenges
- `is_revision` (boolean, optional): Whether this thought revises an earlier one
- `revises_thought_number` (integer, optional): The number of the earlier thought being revised (required together with `is_revision`)
- `branch_from_thought` (integer, optional): The thought number to fork from when exploring an alternative path
- `branch_id` (string, optional): Identifier for the branch (letters, digits, `-`, `_`; max 64 characters; requires `branch_from_thought`)

**Example:**

```python
# First thought in a 5-thought sequence
process_thought(
    thought="The problem of climate change requires analysis of multiple factors including emissions, policy, and technology adoption.",
    thought_number=1,
    total_thoughts=5,
    next_thought_needed=True,
    stage="Problem Definition",
    tags=["climate", "global policy", "systems thinking"],
    axioms_used=["Complex problems require multifaceted solutions"],
    assumptions_challenged=["Technology alone can solve climate change"],
)

# Revise an earlier thought
process_thought(
    thought="Framing the problem purely around emissions was too narrow; adaptation matters equally.",
    thought_number=6,
    total_thoughts=6,
    next_thought_needed=True,
    stage="Problem Definition",
    is_revision=True,
    revises_thought_number=1,
)

# Fork an alternative line of reasoning
process_thought(
    thought="What if we approach this from a market-incentive angle instead?",
    thought_number=7,
    total_thoughts=7,
    next_thought_needed=True,
    stage="Analysis",
    branch_from_thought=3,
    branch_id="market-incentives",
)
```

### 2. `generate_summary`

Generates a summary of your entire thinking process.

**Example output:**

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "totalThoughts": 5,
    "stages": {
      "Problem Definition": 1,
      "Research": 1,
      "Analysis": 1,
      "Synthesis": 1,
      "Conclusion": 1
    },
    "timeline": [
      {"number": 1, "stage": "Problem Definition"},
      {"number": 2, "stage": "Research"},
      {"number": 3, "stage": "Analysis"},
      {"number": 4, "stage": "Synthesis"},
      {"number": 5, "stage": "Conclusion"},
      {"number": 6, "stage": "Problem Definition", "isRevision": true},
      {"number": 7, "stage": "Analysis", "branchId": "market-incentives"}
    ],
    "branches": {
      "market-incentives": {"fromThought": 3, "thoughtCount": 1}
    },
    "revisionCount": 1
  }
}
```

### 3. `clear_history`

Resets the thinking process by clearing all recorded thoughts.

### 4. `export_session`

Exports the current thinking session to a JSON file for sharing or backup.

**Parameters:**

- `file_path` (string): Path to the output JSON file. Since v0.6.0, exports are confined to the `exports/` subdirectory of the storage directory; relative paths resolve to `~/.mcp_sequential_thinking/exports/` and parent directories are created automatically.

**Example:**

```python
export_session(file_path="my-analysis.json")
# -> written to ~/.mcp_sequential_thinking/exports/my-analysis.json
```

### 5. `import_session`

Imports a previously exported thinking session from a JSON file. Exports created with v0.5.x remain importable.

**Parameters:**

- `file_path` (string): Path to the JSON file to import. Like exports, resolved inside the `exports/` subdirectory of the storage directory.

## Comparison to the official sequential-thinking server

The [official MCP sequential-thinking server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/sequentialthinking) provides the core paradigm: numbered thoughts with revisions and branching, held in memory for the duration of the process. This server implements the same paradigm and adds:

- **Persistence**: sessions survive restarts (append-only JSONL log with crash recovery and automatic migration), and can be exported, shared and re-imported as JSON.
- **Thinking stages**: thoughts are categorized into cognitive stages (Problem Definition, Research, Analysis, Synthesis, Conclusion), enabling stage-based filtering and completeness checks.
- **Analysis**: related-thought detection via stages and tags, per-thought progress, and rich summaries including branch and revision statistics.

If you only need ephemeral chain-of-thought scaffolding, the official server is a lighter choice; if you want durable, analyzable thinking sessions, this one is built for that.

## Practical Applications

- **Decision Making**: Work through important decisions methodically
- **Problem Solving**: Break complex problems into manageable components
- **Research Planning**: Structure your research approach with clear stages
- **Writing Organization**: Develop ideas progressively before writing
- **Project Analysis**: Evaluate projects through defined analytical stages


## Getting Started

With the proper MCP setup, simply use the `process_thought` tool to begin working through your thoughts in sequence. As you progress, you can get an overview with `generate_summary` and reset when needed with `clear_history`.
