**Branch, time-travel, merge and undo your MongoDB. Any driver, real mongod,
versioned history underneath. Built for AI agents.**

Three ideas, thirty seconds:

1. **A branch is a pointer, not a copy** — created with a metadata write. Checkout separately materializes the data.
2. **`checkout` turns a branch into a real MongoDB database** — pymongo,
   mongoose, mongosh, indexes, aggregation, transactions: all real, and
   supported document writes become history while capture is healthy.
3. **Review and recover changes** — diff, merge, undo and pin states within
   the configured retention and capture guarantees.

## Install

```bash
brew install argon-lab/tap/argonctl      # macOS
npm install -g argonctl                  # cross-platform

# MongoDB must run as a replica set (one-node is fine):
docker run -d --name argon-mongo -p 127.0.0.1:27017:27017 mongo:7 --replSet rs0
docker exec argon-mongo mongosh --quiet --eval 'rs.initiate({_id:"rs0",members:[{_id:0,host:"localhost:27017"}]})'
argon doctor
```

Use a current supported MongoDB patch release in production. Source builds use
Go 1.26.6 or newer, as declared in `go.mod`.

## The flow

```
main ──branch──▶ experiment ──checkout──▶ mongodb://…  ← any driver
                                              │
                     ┌── argon diff ──────────┤  document history
                     ▼                        ▼
        merge (a data PR)          or   undo / discard / rewind
```

```bash
# 0 · Stop source writers and DDL for the import — or: argon projects create myapp
argon import database --uri mongodb://localhost:27017 --database myapp --project myapp --source-quiesced

# 1 · Branch — instant, no copy
argon branches create experiment -p myapp

# 2 · In terminal A, capture writes with a branch actor label
argon checkout -p myapp -b experiment      # prints a connection string
argon watch    -p myapp -b experiment --actor agent:experiment

# In terminal B, write through the printed URI. Then:

# 3 · Review and merge back — a data pull request
argon diff          -p myapp -b experiment
argon merge preview -p myapp -b experiment
argon merge apply <plan-id>

# …or rewind instead of merging
argon restore reset -p myapp -b main --time 2026-07-07T09:00:00Z --backup pre-incident
```

Prefer clicking? `argon console` serves a local web console (UI + REST API),
supervises capture, reaps expired sandboxes every minute, and opens your browser.
The console's MIT-licensed source is in [web/](web/README.md); see the
[rebuild instructions](CONTRIBUTING.md#console-source-and-reproducible-assets).
For a complete managed workflow, run [the two-agent pinned dataset example](examples/pinned_agents.py).

## What you get

| | Command | In one line |
|---|---|---|
| **Branching** | `argon branches create` | a metadata write — instant, zero copy |
| **Real databases** | `argon checkout` / `argon proxy` | any driver, real mongod; proxy serves stable `mongodb://host/<project>~<branch>` URIs |
| **Write capture** | `argon watch` | exact change-stream images → history, one actor label per branch |
| **Time travel** | `argon time-travel query` | query captured document states at retained LSNs; restore/pin also accept timestamps |
| **Undo** | `argon undo --actor <a>` | revert a range or actor label; append-only, conflict-aware |
| **Restore** | `argon restore preview/reset/branch` | rewind a released branch or fork retained history |
| **Data PRs** | `argon merge preview/apply` | three-way merges as reviewable plans; conflicts never silent |
| **Sandboxes** | `argon sandbox create --ttl 1h` | fork + checkout + TTL in one step — disposable agent workspaces |
| **Dataset pins** | `argon pin create` / `pin sandbox` | named captured states protected from GC and resets while the pin exists |
| **Web console** | `argon console` | local UI + REST API in one command |

Data history covers document inserts, updates, replacements and deletes. Collection
drop/rename produces degraded capture; indexes and collection options are not
versioned. Native writes are asynchronous; control operations drain capture.
Stop writers before release. Existing pins protect their referenced states, while GC can expire audit
and undo history. See [operations](docs/OPERATIONS.md) for recovery and credentials.

Storage retention uses snapshots + retention-window GC to keep state plus a
window of history, not every write forever. Details and the consistency
model, stated honestly: [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## For AI agents

```bash
claude mcp add argon -- argon mcp        # 13 tools: sandbox, diff, merge, undo, pins
# Install the published Python SDK and LangGraph adapter.
python3 -m pip install 'argon-agents[langgraph]==0.2.0'
```

Start `argon console --no-browser` in another terminal, then:

```python
from argon_agents import ArgonClient, ArgonCheckpointSaver

argon = ArgonClient("http://127.0.0.1:1818")
argon.get_or_create_project("myapp")
saver = ArgonCheckpointSaver.from_sandbox(argon, "myapp")
# Compile and run your LangGraph graph with checkpointer=saver, then review:
plan = argon.merge_preview("myapp", saver.sandbox.branch)
print(plan)
# After reviewing this exact plan, apply it explicitly:
# argon.merge_apply(plan["id"])
# Or reject the run: saver.discard()

argon.create_pin("myapp", "eval-v1")                        # pin the dataset once
run = argon.sandbox_from_pin("myapp", "eval-v1")            # identical state, every eval run
```

`saver.merge()` is a convenience call that previews and applies immediately;
use the separate calls above when approval is required. Pins protect captured
document state while they exist; keep independent backups.
