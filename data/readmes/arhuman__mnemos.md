### Give your AI agent a memory it can cite.

> **Local memory for AI agents. Source citations included.**

Claude Code is powerful, but it forgets your project context:

- it forgets why you rejected an architecture,
- it misses your ADRs,
- it invents answers instead of reading your docs,
- it can't reliably cite where a claim came from.

**mnemos** fixes that by giving it a local, cited memory of:

- your ADRs and design docs
- your notes and runbooks
- your source code
- your OKF knowledge base

No vector database. No Ollama. No Python or Node service. Just one cgo-free Go binary
that indexes your files — any plain-Markdown folder works as-is — and serves them over
[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), so Claude can **search, read, and cite your own
knowledge** instead of guessing, with every answer landing on the exact `file#section`
and line range.

## Try it in 60 seconds

```bash
# 1. install — one cgo-free binary into $GOBIN (requires Go 1.25+)
git clone https://github.com/arhuman/mnemos.git && cd mnemos
make install

# 2. index a project
cd ~/work/myproject
mnemos init                              # creates ./.mnemos/ (mnemos.toml, kb, db, models)
mnemos add docs --collection myproject   # copy a directory into the kb and index it
mnemos search "why did we choose this architecture"
```

> Prefer `make build` (→ `./bin/mnemos`) to keep it off your `$PATH`. The default build
> is pure Go / cgo-free (`CGO_ENABLED=0`).

`search` prints citations you can open:

```text
1. security/scim.md#Provisioning
   lines 42-88
   score 12.7
```

Then wire it into Claude Code (note the **absolute** `--config` path):

```bash
claude mcp add mnemos -- mnemos serve --config /abs/path/to/myproject/.mnemos/mnemos.toml
```

Now Claude answers from your project instead of guessing, and shows its source:

> **You:** How do I recover lost commits?
>
> **Claude:** Per `recovery/reflog.md`, the reflog records where `HEAD` and each branch
> tip has pointed — even after a hard reset — so you can check out the lost commit's
> hash. *(recovery/reflog.md — "Reflog: recover lost commits")*

That's the whole loop — **index → ask → cited answer.** Everything below is depth:
[why it's built this way](#why-mnemos), [how it works](#how-it-works), and the full
[capabilities](#capabilities).

<details>
<summary>⚠️ One gotcha: <code>add</code> copies your files into the kb; it does not track them</summary>

mnemos is a managed store. Addressable content lives under `.mnemos/kb/`, and a
document's URI is its path relative to that kb root. `mnemos add docs` **snapshots**
`docs/` into `kb/docs/`, so later edits to your original `docs/` are not picked up
until you run `mnemos add` again. (`mnemos ingest <kb-subpath>` re-indexes content
already inside the kb; it refuses a path outside it.)

Two sources landing at the same kb subpath collide, and the later one wins. Use
`--into` to give each a distinct home:

```bash
mnemos add ~/work/api/docs   --into api
mnemos add ~/work/infra/docs --into infra
```

Details in [docs/paths-and-indexing.md](docs/paths-and-indexing.md).
</details>

## Why mnemos

- **Truly local-first**: runs entirely on your machine. No network, no telemetry, no data leaves your project.
- **Zero dependencies**: one self-contained, cgo-free Go binary. No Python, Docker, Qdrant, or Ollama.
- **Any MCP client**: built for Claude Code, works with anything that speaks MCP.
- **Cited answers**: every result links back to the exact `file#section` and line range, so claims are verifiable.
- **Fast search by default**: SQLite FTS5 / bm25 out of the box; optional local semantic + hybrid search behind a build tag.
- **Read-write memory**: the agent can capture durable notes (`remember`); you can manage the tree (`forget`, `move`, `list`).
- **Safe by default**: read-only unless you opt in; writes are path-confined, and content is secret-scanned on the way into the index (both capture and ingest, gated by `exclude_secrets`).

## How it works

```text
your files  →  mnemos index (SQLite/FTS5)  →  Claude Code memory  →  cited answers
```

Once wired in, Claude can answer from your project instead of hand-waving, and
point back to the source:

- *"Why did we choose this architecture?"*
- *"Where is the ADR about the rule engine?"*
- *"Summarize what we know about SCIM provisioning."*
- *"What changed in this project's memory recently?"*

Under the hood, the binary embeds an MCP server, an indexing pipeline, a SQLite
store, full-text search, an incremental file watcher, and an admin CLI. See
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Does it actually retrieve?

**A cited hit, out of the box** (default lexical build, on a shipped example bundle):

```text
$ mnemos add examples/git-recipes/bundle --into . --collection git
$ mnemos search "recover lost commits" --limit 1
1. recovery/reflog.md#Gotcha
   lines 24-28
   score 7.8
```

Every result is a real `file#section` and line range you can open — that is the whole
point.

**Retrieval quality, measured.** `mnemos eval` auto-derives held-out query→source pairs
from an OKF bundle (it strips each example block from its own document, then checks
whether retrieval still finds the right document) and reports doc-level metrics. On the
shipped `examples/git-recipes` bundle (6 recipes, keyword-style queries):

| Retriever | Hit@1 | Recall@12 | MRR@12 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Lexical, default (FTS5 / bm25) | 0.83 | 0.83 | 0.83 |
| Semantic + hybrid (`--semantic`) | **1.00** | **1.00** | **1.00** |

All three are **fractions in `[0,1]`** (×100 for a percentage); higher is better. The
`@K` is the retrieval depth — top‑1 for Hit, top‑12 for the rest:

- **Hit@1** — share of queries whose **#1** result is the correct document (`0.83` = 5/6).
- **Recall@12** — share where the correct document appears **anywhere in the top 12**.
- **MRR@12** — mean reciprocal rank: average of `1/(rank of the first correct doc)` over the top 12 (`1.0` = always ranked first).

The default lexical build already nails keyword retrieval. The optional embed build (see
[Semantic search](#semantic-search-optional)) earns its keep on harder,
natural-language-over-structured-data queries: on the `examples/onpage-seo` bundle, whose
held-out answers are JSON-LD / sitemap-XML blocks that share *no* keywords with their
prose, lexical scores `0.00` while `--semantic` recovers Hit@1 `0.57` / Recall@12 `0.86`.
Reproduce (N is 6 and 7 respectively — smoke signals, not benchmarks):

```bash
mnemos eval examples/git-recipes/bundle              # lexical → 0.83
make build-embed && mnemos models install all-MiniLM-L6-v2
mnemos eval examples/git-recipes/bundle --semantic   # hybrid  → 1.00
mnemos eval examples/onpage-seo/bundle --semantic    # the hard case → 0.57
```

## Connect Claude Code

The 60-second path above used `claude mcp add` with an **absolute `--config`** path:

```bash
claude mcp add mnemos -- mnemos serve --config /abs/path/to/project/.mnemos/mnemos.toml
```

To share it with the repo, commit it via `.mcp.json` instead:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "mnemos": { "command": "mnemos", "args": ["serve", "--config", "/abs/path/to/project/.mnemos/mnemos.toml"] } } }
```

Verify with `claude mcp list` (should show `mnemos ✓ connected`) and `/mcp` inside
a session. Claude then calls the tools automatically; see [Capabilities](#capabilities).

<details>
<summary>Why the <code>--config</code> path must be absolute</summary>

Claude Code does not guarantee the working directory it spawns the server in, so
anchoring to the config file is what makes retrieval reliable. Passing `--config
<file>` makes that file's directory the **MNEMOS_DIR**, and every location is a
fixed subpath of it, so an absolute `--config` is all you need: the knowledge base
(`kb/`), the database (`state/index.db`), and the models directory all anchor next
to that file regardless of where Claude Code launches the server. A bare `mnemos
serve` falls back to discovery (the nearest project `.mnemos`, else `~/.mnemos`),
which only finds your data when the server's working directory happens to be
inside the project, and Claude Code does not promise that. See
[docs/paths-and-indexing.md](docs/paths-and-indexing.md) for the full resolution
order.

> This clip uses the **optional semantic build** (`make install-embed` + `mnemos models install all-MiniLM-L6-v2` + `use_vectors = true`; see [Semantic search](#semantic-search-optional)). The **default `make install`** binary is lexical-only, so it won't answer a keyword-free question like this — search by keyword instead (e.g. `mnemos search "recover lost commits"`, which hits the same doc).

### Make Claude use memory automatically (optional skill)

MCP tools are *passive*: they're available, but Claude still has to decide to call
`mnemos.search` before answering or `mnemos.remember` when you say something worth
keeping, and models often don't. The bundled **`mnemos-okf` skill** closes that
gap by encoding *when* to reach for memory: recall before answering from
assumption, capture durable facts, and drive the OKF tools.

It's optional and Claude Code-specific: the server works with any MCP client
without it. Install it user-wide (all projects):

```bash
make install-skill        # copies skills/mnemos-okf -> ~/.claude/skills/ and merges its hooks
```

Or place it manually, e.g. project-level for this repo only:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills && cp -r skills/mnemos-okf .claude/skills/mnemos-okf
```

Capture is deliberately conservative (durable facts only, secret-scanned) and stays
gated behind `allow_write`/`allow_delete`: the skill never grants access the config
hasn't opted into. See [`skills/mnemos-okf/SKILL.md`](skills/mnemos-okf/SKILL.md).

### The memory loop

mnemos is local project memory for coding agents: cited recall, durable project state, knowledge consolidation.

```text
prompt
  -> recall (search first, cite)
  -> act
  -> capture durable facts to the inbox
  -> update project/task state
  -> consolidate raw captures into canonical docs
  -> cite everything
```

The bundled [`mnemos-okf` skill](skills/mnemos-okf/SKILL.md) encodes this as six modes: RECALL, CAPTURE, OKF, RESTORE, TASK, and CONSOLIDATE. Tasks are `Task` documents grouped by `mnemos task list`. Consolidation never overwrites silently: conflicts are surfaced and passes are journaled.

The reference layout is in [`examples/project-memory/bundle/`](examples/project-memory/bundle/), a fictional project with status, constraints, decisions, tasks (state/history split), and a consolidation journal. Ingest it to see `mnemos task list` in action:

```
mnemos add examples/project-memory/bundle --into aurora --collection aurora
mnemos task list
```

```
in_progress (1)
  aurora/tasks/rate-limit-ingest.md  Rate-limit the ingest endpoint
todo (1)
  aurora/tasks/csv-export.md  Add CSV export
done (1)
  aurora/tasks/fix-auth-timeout.md  Fix auth token timeout
```

### Automation with hooks

The skill is advisory: the model decides when to fire each mode. Claude Code hooks make the memory loop deterministic. `make install-skill` (or `make install-hooks` on its own) merges [`skills/mnemos-okf/hooks/settings.example.json`](skills/mnemos-okf/hooks/settings.example.json) into your `~/.claude/settings.json` idempotently, keeping a `.bak`; pass `SKIP_HOOKS=1` to opt out, or merge the file by hand for a project-level `.claude/settings.json`. Two hooks are activated:

| Hook | Matcher | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `SessionStart` | `startup\|resume\|compact` | Injects the working set at session start: `mnemos task list` plus recent decisions (`mnemos ls decisions`). The `compact` matcher re-injects it after context compaction. |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | recall cue phrases | When the prompt matches "as we decided", "what was", "remember when", and similar cues, injects the top 3 `mnemos search` hits. Requires `jq`. Silent no-op when no cue matches. |

PreCompact and Stop persistence (session summaries, capture flush) stays in the skill because those hook events cannot inject context into the model.

## Capabilities

Claude reaches your memory through MCP tools (and you through the matching CLI
commands). Note the spelling: `mnemos.search` is the **MCP tool** Claude calls;
`mnemos search` is the **CLI command** you run.

### Query (read-only, no gate)

- **`mnemos.search`**: ranked, filtered retrieval with citations.
- **`mnemos.read`**: read a precise chunk (by `chunk_id`) or a whole document (by `uri`). Pass `follow_links: true` to also attach the document's 1-hop link neighbors.
- **`mnemos.context`**: top-k results as LLM-ready context blocks (`uri:start-end` → content). Pass `follow_links: true` to attach each block document's 1-hop link neighbors.
- **`mnemos.related`**: the link-graph neighbors of a document, its outbound links and inbound backlinks (1 hop, document-level). Dangling outbound targets are returned with `resolved: false`. Filter with `direction` (outbound/inbound/both) and `limit`.
- **`mnemos.list`**: walk the OKF tree on disk and annotate each file with index metadata (title, type, tags, collection) plus an `indexed` flag, so both stored and not-yet-indexed files are visible. Filter by `path`, `collection`, `type`, or indexed state.

### Write (requires `allow_write = true`)

- **`mnemos.remember`**: write a note into memory. Pass an optional `path` (e.g. `"adr/0003-rule-engine.md"`) to place it at an explicit location in the OKF tree instead of auto-naming under `kb/capture/`. Content is **secret-scanned** before it is written and indexed.
- **`mnemos.okfy`**: convert an existing `.txt`/`.md` file in the tree into an OKF document (frontmatter + body) at `out` (defaults to the source path with a `.md` extension) and index it, leaving the source intact. The source body is **secret-scanned** first.

`mnemos edit <uri>` is the human counterpart: a terminal editor for one document, gated by the same `allow_write` flag, with no MCP tool of its own. See [Edit documents interactively](#edit-documents-interactively).

### Manage (requires `allow_delete = true`)

- **`mnemos.forget`**: remove a file from the OKF tree and de-index it; idempotent.
- **`mnemos.move`**: move a file **or directory** within the tree and re-index it under the new path. A directory moves its whole subtree, preserving each document's collection. Inbound markdown links to the old paths are not rewritten in V0 (logged as a warning).

## Keep memory fresh

Run a watcher to reindex on change (incremental; removes deleted files):

```bash
mnemos watch . --collection myproject
```

Enable write-back in `.mnemos/mnemos.toml` so Claude can capture and manage notes:

```toml
[mcp]
allow_write = true     # gates mnemos.remember and mnemos.okfy
allow_delete = true    # gates mnemos.forget and mnemos.move
```

If a watcher is running over the tree, `forget`/`move` operations are also seen by
the watcher (redundant but idempotent); the tools update the index directly and
work without a watcher. Set `[capture] defer_to_watcher = true` when a watcher
covers `kb/capture/` to avoid double indexation of remembered notes.

## Edit documents interactively

`mnemos edit <uri>` opens a terminal editor over one OKF document at a time,
split into three panes:

- **NAV**: the document's outbound links, inbound backlinks, and (once an
  embed build has computed embeddings for the corpus) semantically similar
  documents; otherwise that section shows an unavailable hint instead of
  results.
- **METADATA**: frontmatter fields, typed per the document's OKF `type`. A
  known enum (a task's `status` or `priority`) cycles with the arrow keys,
  `tags` is retyped as a whole list, unknown fields fall back to free text,
  and index-owned fields like `type` are read-only.
- **CONTENT**: the body, handed to `$EDITOR` for editing and reloaded on exit.

```bash
mnemos edit tasks/ship.md
```

Keys: `tab` focus, `↑↓` move, `enter` open/edit, `←→` cycle an enum, `e`
`$EDITOR`, `m` move/rename, `s` save, `b`/backspace back, `q` quit. Saving
writes the file first and then reindexes just that document, so an edit is
never lost even if reindexing fails; frontmatter writes preserve the rest of
the file (comments, key order, unrelated fields) instead of rewriting it.
Navigating to another document while the current one is unsaved saves it first.

`m` moves or renames the open document. It prompts with the current uri:
edit it freely, or press `tab` for a fuzzy-filtered picker of the directories
that already hold documents (`enter` relocates the filename under the picked
one, `esc` returns to the prompt). Committing renames the file on disk,
reindexes it under the new uri, and reopens the editor there; inbound links
still pointing at the old path are reported, not rewritten. Like `mnemos mv`,
it needs `[mcp].allow_delete = true` since the old index entries are deleted.

It requires a uri: bare `mnemos edit` errors, there is no tree-browsing picker
yet. It is gated the same way as `mnemos.remember`/`mnemos.okfy`:

```toml
[mcp]
allow_write = true   # also gates mnemos edit
```

There is no matching MCP tool: `mnemos edit` is CLI-only, for a human at the
keyboard.

## Semantic search (optional)

The default binary is **lexical only** (FTS5 / bm25) and stays small and cgo-free.
Local semantic + hybrid retrieval is fully implemented but compiled behind the
`embed` build tag, so the ONNX/tokenizer dependencies never enter the default
binary. To enable it:

```bash
make build-embed                       # or: make install-embed  (still cgo-free, CGO_ENABLED=0)
mnemos models install all-MiniLM-L6-v2 # downloads the embedding model into ~/.mnemos/models
mnemos reindex --embeddings            # compute vectors for already-indexed chunks
mnemos search "why did we choose this architecture" --semantic
```

`--semantic` fuses bm25 with vector similarity, so natural-language queries that the
lexical index misses still resolve. Without the embed build (or an installed model)
the flag is rejected with a clear message; plain `mnemos search` always works.

How it works under the hood (model, pure-Go ONNX inference, RRF fusion):
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#semantic-search-the-embed-build).

## OKF support

mnemos natively understands [OKF](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/tree/main/okf)
(Open Knowledge Format) bundles, and any Markdown vault with YAML frontmatter and
cross-links, with no special mode:

- frontmatter `tags`/`type` become fuzzy ranking signals in FTS,
- markdown links are captured as edges and traversed: `mnemos related` (and the
  `mnemos.related` tool) walks a document's outbound links and inbound backlinks,
  `follow_links` attaches them to a read or context call, and
  `[search] graph_expansion = true` fills empty result slots with the top hits'
  1-hop neighbors,
- `index.md` files are treated as structure only (kept out of FTS and the link graph).

OKF bundles double as the corpus for `mnemos eval`, which auto-derives held-out
query→source pairs and reports Hit@1 / Recall@12 / MRR@12 against a committed
baseline. See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#retrieval-evaluation).

## Security

- No network, no telemetry; the MCP server is stdio-only.
- Shipped binaries carry SBOMs (generated with syft) and are signed with cosign (keyless OIDC).
- Read-only by default. Write-back is opt-in (`allow_write = true`). Destructive operations (forget, move) require a separate opt-in (`allow_delete = true`).
- All caller-supplied paths are validated by a confinement guard before any disk operation: `..` traversal, absolute paths outside the tree root, symlink escapes, access to `.mnemos/`, and `[security].exclude` globs are all rejected.
- Content is secret-scanned before it is indexed, on both the capture path
  (`remember`, `okfy`, which reject) and the ingest path (`ingest`, `add`,
  `watch`, `reindex`, which skip the file with a warning naming the matched rules
  and continue the run). Set `[security] exclude_secrets = false` to disable.
- Path/secret exclusion patterns keep `.env`, keys, and secret dirs out of the index.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full policy.
