<h1 align="center">HyPHP</h1>

<p align="center">PHP development environment for Windows.<br>Multiple PHP versions side by side, each project declares its own. No Docker.</p>

<p align="center"><b>English</b> | <a href="README.pt-BR.md">Português</a></p>

A PHP development environment with its own orchestrator: several PHP versions serving
different domains **at the same time**, local HTTPS, supervised workers and a reproducible
environment per project.

Download the installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/arismarioneves/hyphp/releases/latest)
page (Windows 10/11 x64). It is not digitally signed yet: if Windows warns you, choose
**More info → Run anyway**.

## Why it exists

| Tool | Limitation |
|---|---|
| **XAMPP** | `mod_php`: one PHP version per installation. No local domains, no local HTTPS, orphan processes after a crash. |
| **Laragon** | Sound architecture, but closed, with no published source. The PHP version is switched from a menu or a *Profile*, applies to the whole installation, and is not declared in the project. |
| **WampServer** | PHP per VirtualHost through FCGI since 3.2.8 (official changelog), but Apache only, and the configuration lives in the installation's menus and files, not in the project. |
| **DDEV / Devilbox / Lando** | Solid and open source, but they require Docker — 2–4 GB of RAM before the first request. |

HyPHP brings together on Windows, without Docker, what the others deliver separately:
**several PHP versions serving at the same time**, the version **declared in the project
itself** (`hyphp.yaml`, committable), Apache or nginx, and supervised workers.

## What it does differently

- **Real simultaneous multi-version** — `php-cgi` in external FastCGI mode, one pool per
  version, a single Apache (or nginx) in front. Version declared per project.
- **Worker pool** — on Windows, `php-cgi` serves one request at a time; without a pool, one
  slow request locks up the site. Measured: 2 requests of 3 s took 6.2 s with 1 worker and
  3 s with 2.
- **Zero orphan processes** — guaranteed by the kernel, through a Job Object with
  kill-on-close.
- **Real status** — every service has a readiness probe; the UI shows `degraded` when the
  process is alive but not responding.
- **Reproducible environment** — `hyphp.yaml` committed to the project's repository.
- **Config is output, not input** — `etc/` is generated and validated (`httpd -t` /
  `nginx -t`) before being applied; an invalid config never takes the environment down.
- **MySQL or MariaDB** — one active at a time on the same port, each with its own data
  directory. Switching is immediate and rolls back if the new one does not come up.
- **php.ini per version** — directives such as `max_input_vars` are edited in the app for
  each PHP version, showing the effective value and where it comes from.
- **CLI for the terminal and AI agents** — `hyphp status`, `hyphp start all`,
  `hyphp logs mysql -f`, `hyphp ini 8.3 max_input_vars 5000`… Every command runs in the
  open app, with `--json` output and meaningful exit codes. See [CLI](#cli).
- **English or Portuguese**, dark or light theme (or the same as Windows).

## Platforms

The target is **Windows 10/11 x64** — deliberately the hardest case, since `php-fpm` does
not exist on this platform. The architecture isolates OS-specific code in files with build
tags; porting to macOS and Linux is simpler, because `php-fpm` exists there and removes the
most complex piece of the design.

## `hyphp.yaml`

```yaml
name: acme
domain: acme.test          # default: <name>.test
wildcard: false            # true enables *.acme.test through the local DNS resolver
php: "8.1"                 # missing = global default version
docroot: public            # default: public if it exists, otherwise the root
extensions: [pdo_mysql, intl, zip, gd]
database: acme_dev         # created if missing
processes:
  queue: php artisan queue:work --tries=3
  scheduler: php artisan schedule:work
```

## CLI

`hyphp` talks to the open app through a named pipe that only your Windows user can reach, and
the app runs the command with the same services as the window: what the CLI does shows up in
the UI right away, and the **CLI** tab lists the recent calls and who made them. Put it on your
PATH from that tab (it lives in `<installation>\cli\hyphp.exe`).

```text
hyphp status                          version, web server, database, services, warnings
hyphp services                        services and their states
hyphp start [service|all]             starts and waits until ready (no argument: everything)
hyphp stop [service|all]              stops (no argument: everything)
hyphp restart <service>               restarts and waits until ready
hyphp logs <service> [-n 50] [-f]     last log lines; -f follows
hyphp projects                        projects, domain, PHP and folder
hyphp php | php default <series> | php use <project> <series>
hyphp ini <series> [<directive> <value> | <directive> --reset]
hyphp db | db create <name> | db drop <name> --yes | db engine <mysql|mariadb>
hyphp web <apache|nginx>              switches the web server
hyphp warnings                        stack warnings
hyphp app                             shows the window (opens the app if it is closed)
```

For scripts and AI agents: every command accepts `--json` (errors too), and the exit code is
`0` ok, `1` app error, `2` wrong usage, `3` app not running.

HyPHP does not redistribute these binaries: it downloads them on demand, verifies the
SHA-256 and extracts them into `bin/`. Any compatible build placed manually in `bin/` is
recognized as well.

## Development

Requires Go 1.26+, Node/npm and the Wails v3 CLI:

```bash
go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/cmd/wails3@v3.0.0-beta.23
wails3 doctor     # checks the environment
wails3 dev        # development with hot reload
wails3 build      # binary in bin/
```

Building the installer requires [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/) on `PATH`
(`winget install NSIS.NSIS` installs it into `C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS`, which the
installer does not add to `PATH` automatically):

```powershell
$env:PATH = 'C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS;' + $env:PATH
wails3 task windows:package   # bin/hyphp-amd64-installer.exe
```

The installer ships `hyphp.exe` and `hyphp-helper.exe`. The helper is the binary with a
`requireAdministrator` manifest that performs the elevated network actions (writing to
`hosts`, installing the local root certificate, the wildcard DNS rule); without it next to
the main executable, those actions fail. The fourth and last action that asks for UAC is
installing an update.

### Installation

The installer supports both NSIS scopes:

```powershell
wails3 task windows:package                      # machine (Program Files, asks for UAC)
wails3 task windows:package INSTALL_SCOPE=user   # user (no UAC)
hyphp-amd64-installer.exe /S /D=C:\path          # silent, directory of your choice
```

The data root (`bin/`, `etc/`, `var/`, `log/`) lives **next to the executable if that
directory is writable**, otherwise in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HyPHP`. That is what allows installing
into Program Files without the app needing privileges to work. `HYPHP_ROOT` overrides the
rule.

Uninstalling removes the installation directory, but does **not** undo what the user
applied to the system: the `hosts` block, the `.test` DNS rule and the autostart entry are
removed through the interface itself (the **Permissões** card in **Configurações**, the
Settings screen, and the autostart toggle), before uninstalling.

### Updates

The app checks for the newest release at
`https://github.com/arismarioneves/hyphp/releases/latest/download/latest.json`
one minute after it opens and every 6 hours (can be turned off in **Configurações ›
Atualizações**), and downloads the new installer in the background. The manifest is signed
with ed25519 (public key in `internal/update/key.go`) and carries the installer's SHA-256;
the app rejects a manifest or an installer that does not match. Installation only happens
when you click **Atualizar e reiniciar** (update and restart): the services stop, Windows
asks for permission once, and the app comes back on its own in the new version. Development
builds (without `-tags production`) do not take part.

### Publishing a version

The version lives in five places, which `hyphp-release` checks before publishing:
`internal/version/version.go`, `info.version` in `build/config.yml`,
`build/windows/info.json`, `INFO_PRODUCTVERSION` in
`build/windows/nsis/wails_tools.nsh` and `CFBundleShortVersionString`/`CFBundleVersion` in
`build/darwin/Info.plist` (bump `build/darwin/Info.dev.plist` too; it is not checked).
The darwin plists are edited by hand: don't run `wails3 task common:update:build-assets`.
With the `v<version>` tag already on GitHub:

```powershell
wails3 task windows:package
go run ./cmd/hyphp-release -note "What changed" -nota "O que mudou" -note "Another change" -nota "Outra mudança"
```

The command signs `latest.json` with the release key and creates the release with the
installer, the manifest and the signature (via `gh`). Notes go in both languages: each
`-note` (English) needs its `-nota` (Portuguese), in the same order, and the site shows the
ones for the selected language. The release is immutable: the notes must be right before
publishing.
