# Maya CBS

## Clean Architecture with Spring Boot 4

# Maya Core Banking System

**Maya-CBS** is an enterprise-grade **Core Banking System (CBS)** designed to model the foundations
of a modern commercial bank.

The project focuses on **clean architecture**, with the goal of building a realistic banking
platform.

This codebase is designed for Java backend developers interested in a **Microservices** application
following on **Clean Architecture** and **SOLID** principles, DDD, built with **Spring Boot 4**,
**Java 25**, and **Spring Framework 7**.

## Project Highlights

* **Commercial Banking** — accounts, customers, products, payments, lending, and other core banking
  capabilities.
* **Double-Entry Ledger** — financially consistent and auditable accounting at the heart of the
  system.
* **Clean Architecture** — domain logic isolated from frameworks, databases, messaging, and
  infrastructure.
* **Microservices** — indep`endently deployable services with clear business boundaries.
* **Enterprise-Grade Design** — SOLID principles, DDD, idempotency, auditability, and consistency.
* **Event-Driven Integration** — asynchronous communication for workflows that benefit from
  decoupling.
* **Security & Compliance** — designed with authentication, authorization, audit trails, and
  financial controls in mind.

## Clean Architecture Implementation Layers

Services in this app implement strict architectural boundaries enforced by ArchUnit rules that cause
failing unit tests when violated. In each service, there are 3 layers:

### Domain

- contains only business logic, entities, command/queries.
- Persistence (JDBC, JPA, NoSQL) or Spring code is not allowed in this layer.
- This is the innermost layer; it shouldn't know anything about the other layers.
- Any access or references to classes in the other 2 layers will cause unit test failure.

### Infrastructure

- Contains only classes related to infrastructure concerns such as data persistence, JPA, JDBC,
  Messaging, external communications that belong to this layer.
- Only calls to infrastructure classes are allowed.
- Spring configs and web classes don't belong here.
- This is the second inner layer; it can access the Domain layer.
- Any access or references to classes in the Application layer will cause unit test failure.

### Application

- Spring beans, web classes live here.
- It can access both previous layers since this is the most outward layer.
- Controllers, beans, spring config and other web related classes belong here

## Notable Features

### Automatic API Audit Logs

Use Spring **AOP** to capture and log API call details whenever any API in any of the services is
called.

### Clean Restful API in all services

The API follows the modern best practices in RESTful services recommendations, like using
**ResponseEntity** and returning **ProblemDetail**.

### CQRS

Command and Query Separation Principle to implement Business logic.

### Rate Limiting

Implemented in **API Gateway** using **Redis Rate Limiter**.

### ArchUnit

Validate architectural boundaries and verify adherence to best coding standards.

### PMD and Pitest

Use PMD to verify the coding style and Pitest for mutation testing.

### RestControllerAdvice

Handle specific exceptions and return a unified and standard error response instead of an exception
stack trace using Spring **ProblemDetail**. Example of API response for every error.

```
{
    "type": "https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/25/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/RuntimeException.html",
    "title": "Requested Ledger Not Found",
    "status": 404,
    "detail": "Studio by the requested id not found",
    "instance": "/ledger/protected/v1/studios/33bff7c7-77ee-4c51-9ee0-c870b437f82e",
    "category": "Resource Not Found",
    "timestamp": "2025-04-22T18:45:43.927431130Z"
}
```

### OpenAPI and Swagger Docs

Provides detailed documentation for all endpoints.

### Entity and DTO separation

Decouples core business logic from presentation using request and response POJO.

### Domain Entity and JPA separation

Domain entities have no association with JPA and are never annotated with @Entity.

## Sample audit event captured from API calls

```
        // Create Account Endpoint
        {
            "id": "6797e0215829937787277607",
            "serviceName": "account-service",
            "location": "/users/protected/v1/accounts",
            "action": "Create",
            "data": "CreateAccountRequest(name=john-doe)",
            "creationDate": "2025-01-27T14:36:01.528",
            "duration": "50ms",
            "response": "CreateAccountResponse(id=9622e5ef-5ab7-4faf-89db-7dd970ea8ef0)"
        }
```
