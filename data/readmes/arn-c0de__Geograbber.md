> **Project Status Notice**
>
> This is a very early stage of the program. While it is already functional, it is based on an older project that has recently been resumed. Extensive refactoring and further development are still required. Expect ongoing changes and improvements as work continues.

---

**Python Integration Notice**

- On Linux, databases can currently be loaded and visualized.
- Passphrase unlocking is buggy: correct passphrases may be rejected.
- On Windows, SQLCipher and passphrase issues persist.

> Additional development is required to implement full SQLCipher support and reliable key handling.

## Overview

WiFi & Bluetooth GeoGrabber is a powerful geolocation tool for Android, designed as a modern **Wardriving App**. It scans for nearby WiFi networks and Bluetooth devices, records their signal strength and location, and visualizes the collected data on an interactive map.

**Detected networks and devices are shown live on the map within the app.** All scan results are saved in a local SQLite database (`.db`), which can be exported and loaded both on Android and on your PC for further analysis.

On Android, you can view, filter, and manage the data directly in the app. For advanced analysis and visualization, simply transfer the `.db` file to your PC and use the included Python tools to merge, plot, and explore your scan data interactively.

GeoGrabber is ideal for network analysis, signal mapping, and understanding wireless device distribution in different areas—whether on your mobile device or desktop.

> **Note:** This app is intended for legal, ethical wardriving, educational purposes, and authorized network analysis only. Please respect privacy laws and only scan networks in areas where you have permission.

## Features

### Network Scanning

- **WiFi Network Scanning** – Continuous or on-demand WiFi network detection
- **Bluetooth Device Scanning** – Detect nearby Bluetooth devices (Classic and BLE)
- **Background Scanning** – Service-based scanning that runs in the background
- **Signal Strength Tracking** – Records RSSI (signal strength) for each device

### Location & Mapping

- **GPS Integration** – Records precise GPS coordinates for each scan
- **Interactive Map** – Visualize collected data on a Leaflet-based web map
- **Dark Mode Toggle** – Switch between light and dark map styles (OSM/CartoDB)
- **Persistent Map Style** – User map style choice is saved and restored
- **Location Filtering** – View devices within specific geographic boundaries
- **Live Location** – Center map on your current GPS position (auto-tracking, keeps user zoom)
- **Live Location Auto-Off** – Live location tracking disables when jumping to search result
- **Custom Location Marker** – Your position is shown as a red dot
- **Filter Popup UX** – Filter popup can be closed by clicking on the map
- **Improved Search Bar** – Search bar text is now black for better readability

### Data Management

## Installation

> **Note (October 2025):**
>
> There are currently issues with automatic dependency installation via the setup scripts (`setup.bat` / `setup.sh`) due to network or PyPI problems. This will be fixed soon. In the meantime, you can manually install the required Python packages in your virtual environment:
>
> **Manual Installation:**
> 1. Activate your virtual environment:
>    - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate.bat` or `venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
>    - Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
> 2. Download the required wheel files for each package (e.g., from [PyPI](https://pypi.org)).
> 3. Install them manually:
>    ```
>    pip install path/to/folium-*.whl
>    pip install path/to/branca-*.whl
>    pip install geopy
>    ```
> 4. If you encounter further dependency errors, download and install those packages in the same way.
>
> The setup scripts will be updated soon for improved reliability.

## Known Limitations

### Android Platform Restrictions

| Limitation | Description | Workaround |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| **Scan Throttling (Android 9+)** | Background WiFi scans limited to ~4 per 2 minutes | Use foreground service |
| **Bluetooth Permissions (Android 12+)** | Requires BLUETOOTH_SCAN and BLUETOOTH_CONNECT | Request at runtime |
| **Location Requirement** | WiFi scanning requires location permission | Mandatory on Android 6+ |
| **Hidden Networks** | SSIDs may not be available for hidden networks | Shows as empty SSID |
| **Battery Optimization** | Background scanning may be restricted | Request battery optimization exemption |

### Device-Specific Issues

- GPS accuracy varies by device and environment (indoor/outdoor)
- Some Bluetooth devices may not broadcast their names
- WiFi Direct devices may not appear in scans
- Certain manufacturers may have additional restrictions

### Technical Constraints

- SQLite database size grows with scan data (monitor storage)
- Map performance degrades with 10,000+ markers
- Background scanning may stop on low battery
- Network density affects scan speed
