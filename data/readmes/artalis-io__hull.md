# Hull

Hardened, capability-secure runtime infrastructure for AI-native systems. Lua, JavaScript, and WASM execute under declared, kernel-enforced capability boundaries. SQLite storage. Single static binary.

**Code became disposable. Trust is not.** AI generates code endlessly. Hull constrains what that code can actually do, at a kernel-enforced boundary the script cannot cross.

The app declares its capabilities (files, environment variables, outbound hosts, database resources) in a manifest. The runtime enforces those bounds. `hull build` produces a single static executable (under 10 MB) that runs on Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD. Code, schema, static assets, tests, and signatures all packaged together. The resulting binary is the product.

## Why

AI made code abundant. Trusted execution did not get cheaper. The runtime is now the scarce layer. The only place where you can still say *what code is allowed to do* and have it stick.

Hull is that layer. Applications are distributed as a single file with no infrastructure required. Each app declares its capabilities in a manifest enforced by the runtime, so users can verify exactly what it can access.

In a world where AI writes code, the runtime becomes the trust boundary. Hull is that boundary.

## Name

Hull. Hardened Userspace Lockdown Layer.

- **Hardened**. Capability-secure, sandboxed execution  
- **Userspace**. Single binary, no kernel modules, no cloud  
- **Lockdown**. The app declares what it can access, the runtime enforces it  
- **Layer** (sits on top of Keel (Kernel Event Engine) Lightweight), mirroring the nautical metaphor

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
# Download the latest signed release binary:
curl -fsSL https://gethull.dev/install.sh | sh
```

The installer detects your OS/arch, downloads a native binary (or the universal Cosmopolitan APE fallback), verifies the SHA-256 checksum against the release manifest, and installs to `~/.local/bin/hull` (no sudo). Override with `HULL_PREFIX=/usr/local/bin sh install.sh`.

Environment knobs: `HULL_VERSION=v0.1.0` (specific tag), `HULL_FLAVOR=cosmo` (force universal APE), `HULL_FORCE=1` (overwrite existing), `HULL_DRY_RUN=1` (preview only).

On **Windows** (PowerShell, no admin or Developer Mode needed):

```powershell
irm https://gethull.dev/install.ps1 | iex
```

This installs `hull.com` to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Hull`, adds it to your user `PATH`, **and updates the PATH of the session you ran it in** - so with the `irm | iex` form above, `hull` works immediately, without opening a new terminal. Then:

```powershell
hull doctor          # what is ready, what is missing
hull doctor --fix    # installs the missing Hull-managed toolchain (cosmocc)
hull new hello; cd hello
hull build           # produces .\app.com  (Windows needs an executable extension)
.\app.com
```

See [Installing Hull on Windows](docs/windows_install.md) for the full five-minute path, options (`-Version` / `-Prefix` / `-Force` / `-DryRun` / `-NoPath` / `-Uninstall`), verification, and the one-time v0.13.0 -> v0.14.0 manual upgrade.

> **Scripting `hull` on Windows:** a failing `hull` reads as SUCCESS in MSYS2 / Git Bash / Cygwin - `&&` chains and `set -e` do not catch it. Every Cosmopolitan APE on Windows reports its exit status shifted left by 8 ([jart/cosmopolitan#1521](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/issues/1521)), and a POSIX shell keeps only the low byte. PowerShell (`$LASTEXITCODE -ne 0`) and cmd (`if errorlevel 1`) detect failure correctly; from bash, assert the built artifact instead. See [Exit codes on Windows](docs/windows_install.md#exit-codes-on-windows-read-this-before-scripting-hull).

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/artalis-io/hull
cd hull
make
make test
```

On **Windows**, building Hull *itself* from source additionally requires MSYS2 -
a native Win32 make cannot pass the Makefile's escaped-quote version defines
through to the compiler. See [Building Hull itself from
source](docs/windows_install.md#building-hull-itself-from-source-needs-msys2).
Installing Hull and building *apps* with the released `hull.com` need no MSYS2.

### Develop

```bash
# Create a new project (single-file default. Best for small services and demos)
hull new myapp
cd myapp

# Or scaffold a modular layout for larger apps:
#   --type rest   modular REST API (routes/ models/ middleware/ lib/)
#   --type cli    modular CLI tool (commands/ + lib/)
#   --type tui    modular TUI app  (views/ + lib/, Lua-only)
hull new --type rest myapp

# Run in development mode (hot reload)
hull dev app.lua

# Build a standalone binary
hull build -o myapp .

# Run it
./myapp -p 8080 -d app.db
```

Default stays flat; modular layouts opt in via `--type`. See
[App Layout Conventions](#app-layout-conventions) below and the canonical
examples: [`examples/rest_api_modular/`](examples/rest_api_modular/),
[`examples/cli_modular/`](examples/cli_modular/),
[`examples/tui_modular/`](examples/tui_modular/).

For server-rendered HTMX apps, scaffold a hypermedia project in place:

```bash
hull init --profile htmx
```

This wires up HTMX 2 + Pico CSS, CSRF + per-request CSP nonce, session-backed
flash messages, pagination, and an idempotency-aware POST cache. See
[`examples/hypermedia_photos/`](examples/hypermedia_photos/) for the reference
app and [docs/htmx.md](docs/htmx.md) for the integration guide.

### Shell completions

Tab-completion for bash, zsh, and fish is shipped in [`completions/`](completions/). See [completions/README.md](completions/README.md) for install instructions.

## Hull Tools

Hull ships 30+ subcommands for the full development lifecycle:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| <code>hull new &lt;name&gt;</code> | Scaffold a new project in a new directory |
| `hull init [dir] [--profile htmx]` | Initialize a hull project in-place (idempotent, like `git init`). `--profile htmx` scaffolds a full HTMX + Pico app (CSP nonce, CSRF, session, flash, pagination, search, inline edit) |
| <code>hull dev &lt;app&gt; [--tui]</code> | Development server with hot reload. [`--tui`](#terminal-ui) streams the child's log into an alt-screen pane with substring filtering, file-watch auto-reload, and `r` for manual reload |
| <code>hull build -o &lt;out&gt; &lt;dir&gt;</code> | Compile app into a standalone binary |
| <code>hull build [--compiler=system\|&lt;path&gt;]</code> | Compiler-free by default (emits `app_registry.o` directly and links, no C compiler needed). `--compiler=system` (or an explicit path) opts into a system `cc`; `--with=` features and cosmo/APE targets fall back to a system compiler automatically |
| <code>hull build [--linker=lld\|zig\|lld-static\|&lt;path&gt;]</code> | Select the linker (default: system `cc`/`ld`). `--linker=zig` uses the self-contained `hull tools install zig` bundle (also cross-compiles via `--target=&lt;triple&gt;`); `--linker=lld-static` links fully static against the musl floors |
| <code>hull test &lt;dir&gt;</code> | In-process test runner (no TCP, memory SQLite) |
| <code>hull deploy &lt;target&gt; [app_dir]</code> | [Generate deployment configs](#deployment). Dockerfile, systemd, fly.toml |

| `hull version [--json]` | Print version string (`--json` for machine-readable output) |
| `hull doctor [--json\|--tui]` | Check environment: compiler, platform embed, module subsystems (DB/WASM/GPU), build readiness. [`--tui`](#terminal-ui) opens a live, color-coded interactive readiness pane with `r` to reprobe and `c` to copy JSON to the clipboard |
| `hull update [--check] [--force] [--channel=beta]` | Self-update from GitHub releases (verifies SHA-256, atomic replace) |
| `hull tools install <name>` / `list` / `uninstall <name>` | Side-load optional companion tools (`wamrc`, the `zig` linker bundle, the `libc-musl-<arch>` static floors, the `cosmocc` bundle) routed through the signed `blob_store` from the same release as the running hull |
| `hull cache list \| prune \| clear \| verify` | Runtime cache management (Lua/JS bytecode, Lua/JS template, compute AOT, tools store). Per-app isolation via `HULL_CACHE_DIR` |

### Build Pipeline

```
Source files (Lua/JS/HTML/CSS/static assets)
        ↓
hull build: collect → generate sorted registry (hl_app_entries[]) → compile → link → sign
        ↓
Single binary + package.sig (Ed25519 signed)
```

The build links against `libhull_platform.a`, the **SLIM base** static archive. The distributed base drops every reducible subsystem (both interpreters, the HTTP core + web bindings, the Keel event loop + server, mbedTLS + TLS transport, SQLite, WASM/WAMR, image codecs) and `hull build` composes back exactly what the app uses via signed feature archives whole-archived in at link time. A stock build of a compute-only `app.main` links zero Keel / mbedTLS / SQLite / WAMR (~2.1 MB); a full web app composes them all back. See [The composable base](#the-composable-base-features-flavors-and-tools) below. The platform library (and every composed feature archive) is signed with the gethull.dev key.

### Compiler-free and toolchain-free builds

**`hull build` is compiler-free by default.** It emits the app registry (`app_registry.o`) directly through Hull's own object emitter and links, needing **no C compiler at all**. You opt into a system compiler only when you need one:

| Backend | When it's used |
|---------|----------------|
| (none - object emitter) | The default. `hull build -o myapp .` links the emitted `app_registry.o` against the platform lib. No `cc` on the box required. |
| `--compiler=system` / `--compiler=<path>` | Opt into a system `cc`/`gcc`/`clang`. Auto-selected for `--with=` features (a C++ feature like duckdb needs a C++ driver) and for cosmo/APE targets, which can't go through the emit path. |

**`hull build` needs only a *linker* by default**, and the linker is itself pluggable via `hull tools install`:

```bash
hull build -o myapp .                       # compiler-free: emit + link with system cc/ld
hull build -o myapp . --linker=lld          # link with a system/PATH lld
hull tools install zig                      # self-contained zig bundle (driver + libc + lld)
hull build -o myapp . --linker=zig          # toolchain-free link - runs on a bare box
hull build -o myapp . --linker=zig --target=x86_64-linux-musl   # cross-compile
hull tools install libc-musl-x86_64         # static musl floor for lld-static
hull build -o myapp . --linker=lld-static   # fully static link against the musl floor
hull build -o myapp . --compiler=system     # opt into a system cc (e.g. for a C++ feature)
hull build -o myapp . --compiler=/path/to/cc  # explicit compiler path
```

Net: a stock box with **no toolchain installed** can `hull build` end to end (emit the object, link with the `zig` or `lld` bundle). Note: a standalone `lld` bundle is **not** shipped (a binary `lld` is dynamically linked against libLLVM, so it can't be bundled flat); `--linker=lld` still works against a system/PATH `lld`. **tcc is fully retired** - Hull no longer vendors, bundles, or installs it (a user's own `tcc` on `$PATH` still works as a plain system compiler via `--compiler=tcc`). `hull doctor` reports which system compilers and linkers are resolvable. Full design: [docs/compiler_free_build.md](docs/compiler_free_build.md) · [docs/toolchain_free_build.md](docs/toolchain_free_build.md).

### Cross-platform builds

Hull supports these compiler/target combinations:

| Compiler | Target | Binary Type | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| (none - object emitter) | Native | ELF / Mach-O | The default compiler-free path; links with `cc`/`ld` or a `--linker=` bundle |
| `gcc` / `clang` | Linux / macOS | ELF / Mach-O | `--compiler=system` or an explicit path |
| `cosmocc` | Any x86_64/aarch64 | APE (Actually Portable Executable) | Multi-arch fat binary. `hull tools install cosmocc` makes a cosmo `hull` self-contained on stock Windows |

Cosmopolitan APE binaries run on Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD from a single file. Hull builds multi-architecture platform archives (`make platform-cosmo`) so the resulting APE binary is a true fat binary for both x86_64 and aarch64. As of v0.10.0, a cosmo `hull` plus the `hull tools install cosmocc` bundle can run a self-contained `hull build` on a stock Windows box.

### The composable base: features, flavors, and tools

The distributed `hull` ships a **fully-composable SLIM base**. Its app-build base drops **every** reducible subsystem - both interpreters (Lua VM + QuickJS), the HTTP core + per-runtime web bindings, the Keel event loop + server, mbedTLS + the TLS transport, SQLite, WASM/WAMR, and the image codecs - and `hull build` composes back exactly what the app uses. Composition is **static** (each subsystem is whole-archived in at *build* time; there is no `dlopen`, no runtime plugin, so the manifest stays enforceable and builds stay reproducible), **auto-inferred** (from the entry extension + the resolved manifest - you never install or flag these), and **embedded** (the pieces live inside the distributed `hull`). A stock `hull build` of a compute-only `app.main` links **zero** Keel / mbedTLS / SQLite / WAMR (~2.1 MB); a full web app composes them all back. (The Cosmopolitan APE base is exempt - a fat APE can't force-load native archives, so it keeps everything compiled in.)

On top of that mandatory axis, capability reaches an app through exactly one of **five shipping units** (full taxonomy in [docs/features_and_flavors.md](docs/features_and_flavors.md)):

| Unit | What it is | Ships as | Reached via |
|------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **stdlib** | pure Lua/JS over caps the base already has (no new C, no new authority) | in the base VFS | `require`/`import` + `manifest.modules` |
| **base cap module** | a small always-in-base C capability (a codec / sniffer / store), no `HL_ENABLE_*` gate, no `--with` | compiled into the base | `require`/`import` + `manifest.modules` |
| **feature** (additive) | a large optional C subsystem, off by default (a vendored engine, a wire backend, a new authority) | a signed `libhull_feature-<name>-<arch>.a` | `hull build --with=<name>` (installed via `hull feature install`) |
| **flavor** (subtractive) | a build.lua **preset** validating an app against a slimmer cap set - since Phase 4.3 there are **no** pre-built per-flavor libs | a preset on the default base | `hull build --flavor=<name>` |
| **tool** | a separate companion **program** Hull spawns (never linked in) | a `hull-<name>-<platform>` binary or `.tar` bundle | `hl_tool_spawn` at build time; `hull tools install` |

**Features** are the additive axis. Five ship today, all **native-only (no cosmo)**, published for `linux-x86_64` / `linux-aarch64` / `darwin-arm64`:

| Feature | What | Reached via |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `duckdb` | embedded DuckDB OLAP backend (~58 MB, C++) | a `duckdb://` DSN on `hull/db` |
| `postgres` | pure-C PostgreSQL wire backend (no libpq) | a `postgres://` / `postgresql://` DSN on `hull/db` |
| `mysql` | pure-C MySQL / MariaDB wire backend (no libmysql) | a `mysql://` / `mariadb://` DSN on `hull/db` |
| `gpu` | wgpu-native GPU compute | `gpu.*` |
| `tui` | terminal UI subsystem (`hull.tui`) | the `hull/tui` module (auto-inferred + force-loaded) |

```bash
hull feature install duckdb               # fetch + verify + cache to ~/.hull/feature/
hull feature list                         # not installed / installed, per feature
hull build --with=duckdb -o myapp .        # compose the feature into the app binary
hull build --with=gpu --compiler=system .  # gpu links -lvulkan / Metal frameworks
```

`hull feature install` shares the same Ed25519 `hull.sha256` trust chain as `hull update` / `hull tools install`; `hull build --with=<name>` re-verifies a cached lib before linking and generates a small registry that fills the base's weak backend hook with the composed backend (`duckdb`/`postgres`/`mysql` all fill the same `HlDbBackend` hook, so they compose together). Build from source with `make feature-duckdb` / `make feature-gpu` / `make feature-postgres` / `make feature-mysql` / `make feature-tui`.

**Flavors** are the subtractive axis - and since Phase 4.3 they are **build.lua presets, not pre-built libs**. The base already composes, so a compute app is *already* minimal without a flavor:

| Flavor | What it does | Use case |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| `full` | the embedded default base - the only "real" base | Web apps that serve requests and call out to APIs (default) |
| `pure-compute` | a **preset**: validates the app declares no HTTP/TLS (rejects e.g. `hull/http-server` at build time). The size win comes from the composable base, not the flavor. | Offline compute / signing binary |
| `auto` | infers the minimal flavor from the app's declared modules | - |

```bash
hull build --flavor=pure-compute -o mytool .   # validate: no HTTP/TLS
hull build --flavor=auto -o myapp .            # infer the minimal flavor
```

`hull flavor install pure-compute` reports "preset flavor, nothing to install"; `hull flavor list` shows `full` as `embedded` and `pure-compute` as `preset (default base)`. (The fetch/verify machinery still exists for any *future* non-preset flavor but has no user today.) Each subject still gets a signed SBOM via `hull sbom` for compliance pipelines. Full design: [docs/build_flavors.md](docs/build_flavors.md) · [docs/features_and_flavors.md](docs/features_and_flavors.md).

### libhull: embed the hardened core (no runtime)

`make libhull` produces `libhull.a`, Hull's runtime-free core as a static archive a native program (C / Rust / Zig) links directly. There is no Lua/QuickJS runtime and no `app.main` lifecycle: the host owns `main()` and drives the two-phase kernel sandbox, the capability-mediated I/O layer, the WASM/GPU compute isolation, and the signed-artifact/SBOM machinery itself, through one stable header, [`<hull/embed.h>`](include/hull/embed.h).

Reach for it when you have an **existing native codebase** that needs one of Hull's guarantees but shouldn't adopt a scripting runtime to get it:

- **Run untrusted compute inside a native service** - WAMR gas-metered, no-I/O WASM isolation for user-supplied transforms/scoring/UDFs, without embedding a script engine.
- **Put a capability boundary on a native tool's own I/O** - a portable (Linux / macOS / cosmo) pledge/unveil + a declared fs / host / env allowlist, so a bug or malicious input can't reach outside what the program declared.
- **Defense-in-depth for a Rust/Zig service** - add the kernel sandbox (seatbelt / landlock / pledge) + W^X enforcement + a filesystem/network allowlist that the language runtime alone does not give you.
- **Signed-artifact / SBOM tooling** - link the Ed25519 verify + SBOM + release-verification machinery instead of reimplementing it.

Writing a **new** app from scratch? Use Hull's Lua/JS instead - same hardening, far less glue. libhull is for the case where the host must stay native and is trusted to sequence the lifecycle. `libhull.a` is release-signed per arch (native + dual-arch cosmo) with its own scoped SBOM (`hull sbom --subject=libhull`). Reference hosts in C, Rust, and Zig live under `examples/embed_{c,rust,zig}`; the trust boundary and seal lifecycle are in [docs/libhull_flavor.md](docs/libhull_flavor.md).

```

Each layer only talks to the one directly below it. Application code cannot bypass the capability layer.

### App Lifecycle

Hull apps execute in one of two modes, chosen by what the app registers:

**Server mode**. App registers route handlers (`app.get/post/use/ws/sse/every/daily`):

```
process start → init runtime → sandbox phase 1 → load app code
  → manifest extracted → modules resolved → sandbox phase 2
  → migrations (HL_ENABLE_DB + migrations/) → start Keel
  → event loop: dispatch requests until SIGINT/SIGTERM
  → graceful shutdown → exit
```

**CLI mode** (see [docs/cli_mode.md](docs/cli_mode.md)). App registers a single entry point with `app.main(fn)`:

```
process start → init runtime → sandbox phase 1 → load app code
  → manifest extracted → modules resolved → sandbox phase 2
  → migrations (same gate as server mode)
  → call app.main(ctx) where ctx = { args, env, stdin, stdout, stderr }
  → main returns (sync or via coroutine/Promise)
  → cleanup → exit with main's return value
```

Both modes share the same manifest, sandbox, module resolver, signature
system, and capability layer. Only the dispatch surface differs.
`app.main` and route registration are **no longer mutually exclusive**:
register them in any order. `app.main` runs once as a startup hook (run
migrations, warm caches); a non-zero return short-circuits the serve
loop, matching shell exit-code conventions, while a zero/nil return with
handlers registered enters the serve loop. A compute-only `app.main` app
built on the composable base already drops Keel + mbedTLS + SQLite
automatically (no flavor needed); `--flavor=pure-compute` just adds the
"reject any HTTP/TLS module" validation.

### App Layout Conventions

Hull's runtime supports both single-file apps and modular trees. Pick
the layout that matches the app's scope; `hull new` scaffolds either:

**Flat** (default, `hull new myapp`). One `app.lua` (or `app.js`)
holds the manifest, requires, and all routes / commands. Best for
small services, demos, single-resource APIs, one-shot CLI tools.

**Modular REST** (`hull new --type rest myapp`). Bootstrap +
per-resource files, models separate from routes:

```
myapp/
  app.lua         . Manifest + bootstrap (mounts each route group)
  routes/         . One file per resource; exports register(app)
    users.lua     . Verb registration only
  models/         . DB access per resource (no SQL in routes)
    user.lua      . { create, find_by_id, list, delete_by_id }
  middleware/     . App-specific wrappers around stdlib middleware
  lib/            . Shared schemas, formatters, helpers
  migrations/, tests/, static/, templates/, locales/
```

Routes import models via relative requires (`require("./../models/user")`);
Hull's path normalizer (`src/hull/path_normalize.c`, shared by both
runtimes) collapses `./`/`../` safely and fails closed on escape past
the app root.

**Modular CLI** (`hull new --type cli mytool`). `app.main` is a
dispatcher; subcommands live as files:

```
mytool/
  app.lua           . Ctx.args[1] picks the command; the rest forward as args
  commands/
    greet.lua       . Exports M.run(ctx); returns exit code
    count.lua
  lib/fmt.lua       . Shared output helpers
```

**Modular TUI** (`hull new --type tui mydash`, Lua-only). Single
`state` table threaded through views; immediate-mode loop in `app.lua`:

```
mydash/
  app.lua           . Tui.run({ draw, on_event }); dispatches via state.view
  views/
    menu.lua        . Render(ctx, state) + handle_event(state, ev)
    detail.lua
  lib/state.lua     . Initial state + helpers
  tests/views/test_menu.lua  . Pure-function unit tests
```

Both runtimes coexist in the same modular tree (`app.lua` + `app.js`
side by side, parallel `routes/`, `models/`, `lib/` etc.). `hull build`
walks subdirectories automatically. No build-config change needed.
`hull deploy` is layout-agnostic.

Canonical examples: [`examples/rest_api_modular/`](examples/rest_api_modular/),
[`examples/cli_modular/`](examples/cli_modular/),
[`examples/tui_modular/`](examples/tui_modular/).

### Module Declaration

Apps declare which first-party stdlib modules they import via the manifest's `modules` array; runtime gates refuse imports of anything not declared. Three principles:

1. **Every external capability is declared.** Language intrinsics (Lua: `string/table/math`; JS: `Object/Array/JSON`) and Hull's intrinsic core are always available; every other first-party module must appear in `manifest.modules` or the import fails. The intrinsic core is just `hull/app` (the registration API: `app.manifest`, `app.get/post/use`, `app.router`, `app.ws/sse`, `app.every/daily`, `app.main`). `hull/app` stays intrinsic because the manifest itself is expressed via `app.manifest(...)` and must exist before parsing. Everything else, including `hull/log` and `hull/json`, must be declared. Apps that call `log.X` or `json.X` directly need `"hull/log@1"` / `"hull/json@1"` in `manifest.modules`.
2. **Import-only exposure.** Declared modules are reached via `require("hull.X")` (Lua) / `import "hull:X"` (JS). They are NOT exposed as globals.
3. **Capability + module are separate gates.** Declaring `hull/http-client@1` doesn't open the network. The app still needs a non-empty `hosts` allowlist. The resolver pairs them.

```lua
app.manifest({
    modules = {
        "hull/crypto@1",
        "hull/db@1",
        "hull/time@1",
        "hull/web/middleware/auth@1",
        "hull/web/middleware/session@1",   -- the resolver enforces that its
                                       -- deps (db, crypto, time) are
                                       -- also declared
    },
    hosts = {"api.stripe.com"},        -- required if http is declared
    fs    = { read = {"data/"} },      -- required if fs is declared
})

-- require/import are standard Lua/JS. Choose any local binding name:
local crypto = require("hull.crypto")
local cookie = require("hull.web.cookie")
```

Each entry is a canonical spec `"<vendor>/<name>@<major>"`. The manifest declares *what's in scope*; the `require()` / `import` call site picks *what to call it locally*. First-party modules use `hull/`; future third-party packages would use the same form (`"acme/widgets@2"`).

**Optional modules (`?` suffix).** A trailing `?` (`"hull/gpu@1?"`) marks a module optional: on a build that lacks its capability (a compiled-out subsystem with no matching `--with=` feature), the resolver skips it instead of failing app load, and `require` returns `nil` (Lua) / `import` binds `null` (JS) so the app can fall back. A present optional module is gated normally; a non-optional spec for an absent capability stays a hard error.

```lua
local gpu = require("hull.gpu")           -- nil on a base binary
if gpu and gpu.available() then use_gpu() else use_cpu() end
```

**Failure modes** (all surface with the canonical spec + dep list + a pointer to `hull modules available`):

| Error | Cause |
|-------|-------|
| `module 'hull.X' is not declared in app.manifest` | App imports a known module not in `modules` |
| `module 'hull/X' transitively requires 'hull/gpu', which needs HL_ENABLE_GPU but it is disabled in this hull build` | An auto-admitted dep needs a compile-time subsystem this binary doesn't have |
| `http.fetch: host 'api.x.com' not in manifest hosts allowlist` | Module loaded fine; per-call cap layer rejected the URL. Add to `hosts` |
| `module 'hull/gpu@1' requires HL_ENABLE_GPU (build-time)` | Build wasn't compiled with the subsystem |
| `unknown module 'X' in app.manifest.modules` | Typo or non-existent module |

The resolved set is recorded in `package.sig` as `modules_resolved` and covered by the existing Ed25519 signature. `hull verify` ensures the module surface hasn't been tampered with since `hull build --sign`.

**CLI / agent tooling:** `hull modules available | list | explain | analyze`, `hull check` (analyzer-integrated), `hull agent modules` (JSON), `hull doctor` (build-subsystem readiness). See [docs/security.md §5b](docs/security.md) for the full design.

### Standard Library

Hull ships a full set of middleware and utility modules for building secure backends:

**Authentication & authorization** (v0.3.0; 13 audit rounds, converged in round 13):

| `search` | `hull.search` | `hull:search` | Full-text search (SQLite FTS5) |
| `json` | `hull.json` | (built-in) | JSON encode/decode |

All middleware modules follow the same factory pattern: `module.middleware(opts)` returns a function `(req, res) -> 0|1` where `0` = continue, `1` = short-circuit.

#### Background Timers

`app.every(ms, fn)` and `app.daily("HH:MM", fn)` register repeating background callbacks. Timer callbacks run on the event loop thread with full async support. `hull.sleep()`, `http.fetch()`, and `db.*` all work inside timers.

```lua
-- Flush outbox every 30 seconds
app.every(30000, function()
    outbox.flush()
end)

-- Clean up expired sessions daily at 2am UTC
app.daily("02:00", function()
    session.cleanup()
end)

-- Return false to self-cancel
app.every(1000, function()
    local pending = outbox.flush()
    if pending == 0 then return false end
end)
```

Minimum interval: 100ms. Errors are logged but don't stop the timer. One invocation at a time. If a callback is still running (async yield), the next tick is deferred.

#### Database & Migrations

Hull apps use SQLite with WAL mode, parameterized queries, and a prepared statement cache. Schema changes are managed through numbered SQL migration scripts.

**Convention:** Place migration files in `migrations/` in your app directory, numbered sequentially:

```
myapp/
  app.lua
  migrations/
    001_init.sql        ← creates initial tables
    002_add_index.sql   ← adds an index
    003_new_feature.sql ← adds a new table
```

Migrations run automatically on startup (opt out with `--no-migrate`). Each migration runs in a transaction, and the `_hull_migrations` table tracks which migrations have been applied.

```bash
hull migrate new add_tags        # creates migrations/002_add_tags.sql
hull migrate                     # run pending migrations
hull migrate status              # show applied/pending migrations
```

In built binaries (`hull build`), migration files are embedded alongside Lua/template/static assets. `hull test` runs migrations against an in-memory database.

#### Static File Serving

Place files in `static/` in your app directory. They're served at `/static/*` automatically.

```
myapp/
  app.lua
  static/
    style.css       → GET /static/style.css
    js/app.js       → GET /static/js/app.js
    images/logo.png → GET /static/images/logo.png
```

In dev mode, files are read from disk with zero-copy sendfile and `Cache-Control: no-cache`. In built binaries (`hull build`), static files are embedded in the unified `hl_app_entries[]` array and looked up via the VFS module (O(log n) binary search). `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400`. ETag and 304 Not Modified are supported in both modes.

#### Backend Best Practices

Recommended middleware stack for a typical API backend:

```lua
local cors = require("hull.web.middleware.cors")
local ratelimit = require("hull.web.middleware.ratelimit")
local auth = require("hull.web.middleware.auth")
local session = require("hull.web.middleware.session")

session.init()

-- Order matters: rate limit → CORS → auth → routes
app.use("*", "/api/*", ratelimit.middleware({ limit = 100, window = 60 }))
app.use("*", "/api/*", cors.middleware({ origins = {"https://myapp.com"} }))
app.use("*", "/api/*", auth.session_middleware({}))

app.get("/api/me", function(req, res)
    res:json({ user = req.ctx.session })
end)
```

Key principles: rate limit before auth (reject early), CORS before auth (preflight must not require credentials), scope middleware to paths (`"/api/*"` not `"/*"`). For simple CORS needs, use `cors` in `app.manifest()`. It registers Keel-level CORS middleware automatically. Use the stdlib `hull.web.middleware.cors` for per-route or conditional CORS logic. See [examples/middleware/](examples/middleware/) and [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for full API reference.

## Security Model

Hull apps declare a manifest of exactly what they can access. Files, hosts, environment variables. The kernel enforces it.

```lua
app.manifest({
    fs = { read = {"data/"}, write = {"data/uploads/"} },
    env = {"PORT", "DATABASE_URL"},
    hosts = {"api.stripe.com"},
    cors = {
        origins = {"https://myapp.com"},
        methods = "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE",
        credentials = true,
    },
})
```

**Three verification points:**

| When | Tool | Checks |
|------|------|--------|
| Before download | [verify.gethull.dev](https://verify.gethull.dev) (offline browser tool) | Platform sig, app sig, canary, manifest |
| Before install | `hull verify --developer-key dev.pub` | Both signatures + file hashes |
| At startup | `./myapp --verify-sig dev.pub` | Signatures verified before accepting connections |

**Defense depth by platform:**

| Platform | Kernel Sandbox | Violation | Static Binary |
|----------|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| Linux (gcc/clang) | seccomp-bpf + Landlock | SIGKILL | No |
| Cosmopolitan APE | Native pledge/unveil | SIGKILL | Yes (no LD_PRELOAD) |
| macOS | Seatbelt (sandbox_init, deny-default SBPL) | EPERM | No |

See [docs/security.md](docs/security.md) for the full attack model and [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for implementation details.

### Audit Logging

Hull can log every capability call (database queries, file I/O, HTTP requests, env access) as structured JSON to stderr. Off by default for zero overhead.

```bash
# Enable via CLI flag
hull app.lua --audit

# Or via environment variable
HULL_AUDIT=1 hull app.lua
```

Each line is a self-contained JSON object with a UTC timestamp and the capability name:

```
{"ts":"2026-03-06T14:23:01Z","cap":"db.query","sql":"SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE id = ?","nparams":1,"result":0}
{"ts":"2026-03-06T14:23:01Z","cap":"fs.read","path":"uploads/file.txt","bytes":4096}
{"ts":"2026-03-06T14:23:02Z","cap":"http.request","method":"POST","url":"https://api.example.com","status":200,"result":0}
{"ts":"2026-03-06T14:23:02Z","cap":"env.get","name":"DATABASE_URL","result":"ok"}
```

When disabled (default), the audit check is a single branch on a global flag. Zero escaping, formatting, or I/O.

## Performance

77,000–86,000 requests/sec on a single core. ~15% overhead vs raw C (Keel baseline: 101,000 req/s). SQLite write-heavy routes sustain 19,000 req/s.

| Route | Lua 5.4 | QuickJS |
|-------|--------:|--------:|
| GET /health (no DB) | 98,531 req/s | 52,263 req/s |
| GET / (DB write + JSON) | 6,866 req/s | 4,588 req/s |
| GET /greet/:name (params) | 102,204 req/s | 57,405 req/s |

See [docs/benchmark.md](docs/benchmark.md) for methodology.

## Authoring Compute Modules

WASM compute modules let you drop pure-function workloads (scoring,
transforms, parsing, vector math, image kernels) into a Hull app at
near-native speed without leaving the capability-secure sandbox.
Modules are written in C (Rust planned), compiled to WebAssembly,
and either embedded in the final binary or loaded from disk in dev.

> See [docs/wamr_architecture.md](docs/wamr_architecture.md) for the
> full WAMR design (ABI, gas metering, pooling, segments, streaming,
> AOT, Memory64); this section is the developer guide.

### Directory convention

A compute module is a pair of paths inside your app:

```
myapp/
  app.lua
  compute/
    score.wasm           ← compiled artifact (what gets embedded)
    score/               ← source directory (one per module)
      score.c            ← required: the actual source
      hull_compute.h     ← required: the freestanding ABI header
      test_fixtures.json ← optional: input/output fixtures for `hull compute test`
```

The runtime only ever loads `compute/<name>.wasm` (and the AOT siblings
`compute/<name>.aot.<arch>`). The source directory `compute/<name>/`
is purely a build input. It's not embedded in the final binary and
nothing in production looks at it.

### Lifecycle

```
                                              hull build (auto)
                                                  ▼
hull compute new score          ┌───────────────────┐
        │                       │ compute/score.wasm│ ──── embedded into
        ▼                       └───────────────────┘      the app binary
compute/score/score.c (edit)            ▲
        │                               │
        ├──► hull compute build score ──┘   (manual rebuild)
        │
        ├──► hull compute test  score        (run JSON fixtures)
        │
        └──► hull compute check score        (load + smoke-test in WAMR)
```

### Step 1. Scaffold

```bash
hull compute new score
```

Creates:

- `compute/score/score.c`. A 30-line skeleton implementing
  `hull_process(in, in_len, out, out_max)`. The default scaffold sums
  input bytes into a 0-100 score; replace it with your actual logic.
- `compute/score/hull_compute.h`. The freestanding ABI header
  (described below). Don't edit it; it's owned by Hull.
- `compute/score/test_fixtures.json`. A few example fixtures.

`hull compute new` is **idempotent-safe**: re-running on an existing
module errors instead of clobbering. Names must match
`[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`.

### Step 2. Write your module

Implement `hull_process` in `compute/<name>/<name>.c`. The ABI is the
function signature you export, nothing more:

```c
#include "hull_compute.h"

HULL_VERSION_EXPORT

HULL_EXPORT
int32_t hull_process(const void *in_ptr, int32_t in_len,
                     void *out_ptr, int32_t out_max)
{
    /* Read up to in_len bytes from in_ptr.
     * Write up to out_max bytes to out_ptr.
     * Return number of bytes written, or a negative HULL_ERR_* code. */
    if (out_max < 4) return HULL_ERR_OUTPUT;
    /* ... your logic ... */
    return 4;
}
```

`hull_compute.h` is freestanding (no libc dependency) and provides:

| API | Use |
|-----|-----|
| `HULL_EXPORT` / `HULL_VERSION_EXPORT` | Visibility macros. Required on `hull_process` and `hull_version`. |
| `HULL_OK`, `HULL_ERR_OUTPUT`, `HULL_ERR_INPUT`, `HULL_ERR_INTERNAL` | Standard return codes. |
| `int32_t host_call(opcode, ptr, len)` | The single host import. For logging, shared-data access, and UDF callbacks. |
| `hull_log(msg, len)` | Convenience wrapper around `host_call(HULL_OP_LOG, ...)`. |
| `hull_segment_count()` / `hull_segment_addr(id)` / `hull_segment_size(id)` | Read shared data segments loaded via `compute.segment(...)`. |
| `hull_memcpy`, `hull_memset`, `hull_memcmp`, `hull_strlen` | Minimal libc replacements. |
| `hull_alloc(n)` / `hull_alloc_reset()` | 64 KB bump allocator scoped to one call. |
| `HULL_UDF_*` constants | UDF wire format for modules registered as SQL functions via `db.udf.register`. |

Modules cannot import anything else. No WASI, no `open`, no `socket`,
no `time`. They are pure functions from input bytes to output bytes
with a strict gas budget (default 100M instructions per call) and a
strict memory budget (default 2 MiB heap, configurable up to ~4 GiB
on WASM32 or 16 GiB on Memory64).

> **Keeping `hull_compute.h` current.** Hull owns this header; the
> canonical version is embedded in the `hull` binary and written into
> each module's directory by `hull compute new`. When you upgrade Hull
> the per-module copies will not change automatically. Run
> `hull compute refresh-header <name>` (or with no name for all
> modules) to overwrite each `compute/<name>/hull_compute.h` from the
> embedded canonical version.

### Step 3. Build

```bash
hull compute build score        # one module
hull compute build              # all modules under compute/
```

`hull compute build` invokes `clang --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown -nostdlib`
with the flags Hull's runtime expects (`-Wl,--no-entry`, exports
`hull_process` + `hull_version` + `memory`, 128 KiB initial / 64 MiB max
linear memory). Toolchain expectations:

- **macOS**: `brew install llvm@18` (bundles `wasm-ld`). The build
  prefers `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm@18/bin/clang` then falls back to
  Homebrew `llvm` and finally to system `clang`.
- **Linux**: `apt install clang lld` (or equivalent. `wasm-ld` must
  be in PATH).
- **No toolchain installed?** `hull compute build` errors with a hint;
  pre-compiled `.wasm` files can be committed and used directly.

Output: `compute/<name>.wasm`. The compiler removes everything you
don't reference (LTO + `-O2`), so a typical module is 500 bytes - 5 KB.

### Step 4. Test

`compute/<name>/test_fixtures.json` is a JSON array of test cases:

```json
[
    {"name": "happy path", "input": "hello", "expect_status": 0},
    {"name": "empty input", "input": "", "expect_status": 0},
    {"name": "rejects nul", "input": "
]
```

Each fixture's `input` is fed to `compute.call("<name>", input)`. The
runner asserts the HTTP status matches `expect_status` (200 if `0`,
otherwise the literal value).

```bash
hull compute test score
```

Under the hood the runner generates a tempdir app with one route
(`GET /call?input=...`) and runs `hull test` against it. This means
your fixtures exercise the exact same `compute.call` codepath your
real handlers use. Same gas metering, same instance pool, same
limits.

For one-shot invocations with arbitrary inputs (no fixture file
needed), use `hull agent compute-call <name> <input-file>`.

### Step 5. Sanity-check

```bash
hull compute check score
```

Validates the WASM magic bytes, the WASM version, then loads the
module in WAMR with a trivial input and asserts the call returns 200.
This is the "yes, this module can actually run inside Hull" gate. If
`hull compute check` passes, `compute.call()` from your app code will
at least find the module.

### Step 6. Build and embed

`hull build` automatically:

1. **Rebuilds stale sources.** Before any other build step, it scans
   `compute/<name>/<name>.c` for sources whose mtime is newer than the
   matching `.wasm`. Any stale source is recompiled inline using the
   same logic as `hull compute build`. Output is reported as
   `hull build: compiled N compute source(s): <names>`.
2. **AOT-compiles `.wasm` artifacts.** If `wamrc` is available (`make
   wamrc`), every `compute/*.wasm` is AOT-compiled to
   `compute/*.aot.<arch>` for near-native speed. For cosmocc fat
   binaries both `x86_64` and `aarch64` AOT files are produced.
3. **Embeds both into the binary** via the unified VFS array. At
   runtime, AOT is preferred over interpreter; `hull build --no-aot`
   skips AOT compilation.

Opt out of step 1 with `--no-build-compute` (for hermetic CI builds
that ship pre-committed `.wasm` artifacts). Opt out of step 2 with
`--no-aot`.

Once embedded, modules are loaded via `compute.call("<name>", input)`
from Lua or `compute.call("<name>", input)` from JS, just like any
other capability. The bytes-in-bytes-out contract is the entire API.

### Deployment

`hull agent deploy <app_dir>` reports per-module status in its JSON
output:

```json
{
  "files": { "compute": 3, ... },
  "compute_modules": [
    {"name": "score",       "wasm_size": 1023, "has_aot": true,  "has_source": true,  "source_stale": false},
    {"name": "transform",   "wasm_size": 718,  "has_aot": true,  "has_source": true,  "source_stale": false},
    {"name": "vendored",    "wasm_size": 135,  "has_aot": false, "has_source": false, "source_stale": false}
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Compute source newer than .wasm. Run `hull compute build` or rebuild (hull build auto-rebuilds when clang is available)"
  ]
}
```

`hull deploy dockerfile`, `hull deploy systemd`, and `hull deploy fly`
don't need any compute-specific configuration: the `.wasm` (and any
AOT) files are already embedded in the binary at `hull build` time, so
the deployment artifact is whatever your build pipeline produces. The
generated configs treat compute modules transparently.

For pure compute services (no DB), combine with `HL_ENABLE_DB=0`:

```bash
make HL_ENABLE_DB=0          # ~3.66 MB binary, no SQLite
hull build myapp             # embeds compute/*.wasm + AOT
```

### Sharing data with modules

For multi-GB read-only datasets (routing graphs, ML weights, embeddings),
load via shared data segments instead of passing through input bytes:

```lua
compute.segment("router", "graph", fs.mmap("graph.bin"))
local out = compute.call("router", query)
```

Inside the module, query segments via `host_call(0x02, segment_id, 0/1)`:

```c
void *graph = (void *)(size_t)host_call(0x02, 0, 0);  /* segment 0 address */
int32_t graph_size = host_call(0x02, 0, 1);           /* segment 0 size */
```

Segments are page-aligned mmap regions in shared heaps. Multiple
worker threads read concurrently. Adding or removing segments drains
the instance pool and rebuilds it transparently.

### Stateful compute (persistent instances)

For stateful workloads (model weights you want to keep between calls,
pre-built indexes), use `compute.instance()` instead of `compute.call`:

```lua
local m = compute.instance("model", { heap = 64 * 1024 * 1024 })
m:call(query_1)   -- linear memory persists between calls
m:call(query_2)
m:close()
```

### Streaming I/O

For datasets larger than memory:

```lua
compute.stream("transform", { file = "input.csv" },
                            { file = "output.json" },
                            { chunk_size = 65536 })
```

The module exports `hull_process_chunk` instead of `hull_process` and
queries chunk metadata via `host_call(0x03, ...)`. See `examples/compute/`
for working modules.

### What about Rust?

C is the only supported source language today. Rust support
(`--lang=rust`) is on the roadmap. It requires Cargo + a
`#[no_mangle] extern "C"` template + `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
+ a `panic_handler`. Until then, modules in any compiled language are
loadable as long as they expose `hull_process` and `hull_version` with
the documented signatures (`Rust`, `Zig`, `AssemblyScript`, `TinyGo`
all work. Only the scaffolding shortcut is C-only).

### WASM Compute Overhead

WASM plugins run in isolated linear memory with no I/O. Both sync (`compute.call()`) and async (`compute.async.call()`) APIs are available. Async yields to the event loop so other requests are served during execution. The overhead vs native C depends on execution mode:

| Mode | Compute-intensive | Memory-intensive | Notes |
|------|------------------:|------------------:|-------|
| **Fast interpreter** | ~54x | ~37x | Fast-interp with gas metering |
| **AOT** | ~1.2x | ~1.9x | Pre-compiled with `wamrc -O3` |

Measured on Apple M-series (aarch64, -O2) with large inputs (4 MB) where per-call setup is amortized. Compute workload: iterative hash compression (64 rounds/block, integer ALU + rotations). Memory workload: histogram + counting sort (3-pass over input, scattered writes).

AOT compilation is automatic during `hull build` when `wamrc` is available. Per-call setup overhead (~50 µs) dominates at small input sizes; at 4 MB+ inputs the ratios above reflect steady-state throughput.

```bash
make wamrc                         # one-time: build AOT compiler (requires LLVM)
make bench-wasm                    # run benchmarks (interpreter + AOT if .aot files present)
hull build myapp                   # auto-AOT compiles compute/*.wasm during build
hull build myapp --no-aot          # skip AOT, interpreter only
hull build myapp --target=x86_64   # cross-compile AOT for different arch
```

### GPU Compute

GPU compute uses wgpu-native for massively parallel workloads via WGSL compute shaders. It ships as the **`gpu` composable feature** - `hull feature install gpu` then `hull build --with=gpu` (native-only; see [The composable base](#the-composable-base-features-flavors-and-tools) above) - or build hull from source with `make HL_ENABLE_GPU=1`. Declare `"hull/gpu@1"` in the manifest (`"hull/gpu@1?"` to fall back gracefully when no GPU is present). Features:

- **Dispatch + Pipeline**. Single or multi-stage shader execution with shared named buffers
- **Persistent buffers**. Keep data GPU-resident across requests (`gpu.buffer()`)
- **Fire-and-forget**. Update GPU buffers in-place without readback (`output = false`)
- **GPU-side copy**. Copy between persistent buffers without CPU roundtrip (`gpu.buffer_copy()`)
- **Zero-copy disk→GPU**. `fs.mmap()` data passes directly to GPU buffers
- **Shader files**. `gpu.load("name")` reads `shaders/<name>.wgsl` (dev: disk, build: embedded in binary via VFS)
- **GPU timeout**. 5-second deadline prevents shader hangs (`HL_GPU_TIMEOUT_MS`)
- **Unified buffer protocol**. WASM and GPU accept the same input types (string, MappedBuffer, WasmBuffer) for zero-copy data flow between disk, WASM, and GPU

**Performance** (cosine similarity, 128-dim vectors, Apple M1 Max):

| Vectors | Native C | WASM AOT | GPU | GPU vs AOT |
|---------|----------|----------|-----|------------|
| 64 | 7 µs | 7 µs | 2,630 µs | 0.0x |
| 1K | 118 µs | 108 µs | 2,630 µs | 0.0x |
| 16K | 1,830 µs | 2,534 µs | 2,629 µs | 1.0x |
| 64K | 7,270 µs | 10,969 µs | 2,653 µs | **4.1x** |

GPU latency is constant ~2.6ms. Use `gpu.pipeline()` for multi-stage compute (2.4x faster than separate dispatches). Use fire-and-forget for index updates that don't need results returned.

```bash
make fetch-wgpu                                            # download wgpu-native (SHA-256 verified)
make HL_ENABLE_GPU=1                                       # build with GPU
make bench-gpu HL_ENABLE_GPU=1                             # GPU vs WASM vs native benchmark
```

## Compute-only builds (`HL_ENABLE_DB=0`)

For pure compute deployments (REST endpoints wrapping WASM/GPU shaders, transform pipelines, signing services) where state lives elsewhere, drop SQLite entirely:

```bash
make HL_ENABLE_DB=0       # ~3.66 MB binary vs ~5.06 MB default (≈28% smaller)
```

Removed: SQLite + `db.*` + `migrate.*` + `worker_db` + DB-backed stdlib modules (session, ratelimit, idempotency, outbox, inbox, rbac, search) + the `hull migrate` and `hull agent db|migrate` subcommands.

Still works: HTTP routing, middleware, both runtimes, sandbox, `http.fetch`, `ws.*`, `fs.*`, `crypto.*`, `compute.*`, `gpu.*`, templates, static files, image codecs, SSE, timers, validation, CSV, i18n, CORS, ETag, health, JWT, stateless CSRF, form parsing, logger.

Combine with other flags freely, e.g. `make HL_ENABLE_DB=0 HL_ENABLE_HTTP=0 HL_ENABLE_GPU=1 WGPU_LIB_DIR=vendor/wgpu` for a GPU-focused compute service. (`HL_ENABLE_HTTP=0` is the `pure-compute` knob - drops mbedTLS + Keel entirely.)

## Terminal UI

Hull ships a built-in `hull.tui` module for interactive terminal apps. The same primitives power `hull doctor --tui`, `hull dev --tui`, and friends. Designed to make the obvious thing easy: one canonical entry point, cell-level diff rendering (flicker-free over ssh), async-integrated input (background fetches keep ticking while waiting for keystrokes), and an embedded Unicode 16.0 width table for identical rendering across glibc / musl / cosmo / macOS.

```lua
local tui = require("hull.tui")

app.manifest({
    tui = true,
    modules = { "hull/tui@1" },
})

app.main(function(ctx)
    local picked = tui.list({"apple", "banana", "cherry"}, {
        title = "Pick a fruit",
    })
    ctx.stdout:write((picked and "you picked: " .. picked or "aborted") .. "\n")
    return 0
end)
```

Helpers: `tui.run` (canonical immediate-mode loop), `tui.list` / `tui.confirm` / `tui.input` / `tui.frame` / `tui.progress` / `tui.spinner`, plus `tui.async` for fire-and-forget background work on the same event loop.

### First-party `--tui` tools

Five subcommands ship interactive TUI variants. Each is a Lua tool module (`stdlib/cli/lua/hull/X_tui.lua`) dispatched by the matching C command. All refuse cleanly without a real terminal.

| Command | TUI |
|---------|-----|
| `hull doctor --tui` | Live readiness pane: platform/compilers/subsystems/compute/CA-bundle sections with ✓/✗ glyphs, theme-aware colors via OSC 11, `r` reprobes, `c` copies the JSON to the system clipboard via OSC 52 |
| `hull dev --tui` | Live request log streamed from child's stderr+stdout into a ring buffer, status line (pid, reloads, lines, app_dir), inline substring filter, file-watch auto-reload, manual `r` reload |
| `hull agent context --interactive` | Two-pane task picker w/ live preview; ←/→ cycles level; Enter prints chosen context as JSON for shell pipelines |
| `hull agent errors --tui` | Scrollable error list + detail panel from `.hull/last_error.json` |
| `hull modules available --tui` | Searchable registry. `/` opens filter prompt; right pane shows caps + deps + a manifest snippet |
| `hull migrate status --tui` | Two-pane migration ledger with applied/pending counts; right pane shows the `.sql` source for the focused entry |

### Examples

Under `examples/`:

- **`tui_picker`**. Minimal `tui.list` usage in both Lua and JS, plus an `async_proof.lua/.js` that demonstrates how `tui.poll` yields to the event loop (a background ticker advances a counter while the main coroutine awaits a key).
- **`tui_dashboard`**. Three-pane layout via `tui.frame` (round / single borders), live progress bars in the metrics pane, a task list with cursor + checkbox glyphs, opt-in SGR mouse support.
- **`tui_repl`**. Single-line editor with full history navigation (↑/↓), ctrl+u/k for line kill, etc. The "eval" is a tiny safe calculator (Lua's `load` is sandboxed out).
- **`tui_chat`**. Split-pane chat mock; each user message spawns a background `tui.async` "bot reply" that hull.sleep()s 200–500ms before appending, proving the input stays responsive while async work is pending.
- **`tui_log_tailer`**. `tail -f`-style file follower; a `tui.async` coroutine polls the file via `fs.read` every 200ms while the main loop awaits keystrokes.

### Disabling

The TUI capability is gated by `HL_ENABLE_TUI` (default on). Disabling drops the cap layer (`cap/tui.c`, `cap/tui_input.c`), the runtime bindings, the `hull.tui` stdlib module, and every `--tui` flag for ~80–150 KB binary savings:

```bash
make HL_ENABLE_TUI=0
```

See [`docs/tui_mode.md`](docs/tui_mode.md) for the full design. Phases, architectural decisions, the Cosmo support matrix, and the async-integration model.

## Server Tuning

- **Response Compression**. Gzip via miniz, automatic for bodies >= 860 bytes when `Accept-Encoding: gzip`. Disable with `--no-compress`.
- **Connection Pooling**. Outbound HTTP reuses TCP+TLS connections (32 pool, 4 per host, 60s idle). Automatic when `hosts` declared in manifest.
- **Redirect Following**. 3xx redirects followed automatically (up to 10 hops). Cross-origin auth headers stripped per RFC 7231.
- **Server Stats**. `server.stats()` (Lua) / `server.stats()` (JS) returns `{active_connections, max_connections, async_suspended, listen_paused}`.

| Flag | Default | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--max-connections N` | 256 | Max concurrent connections |
| `--body-max-size SIZE` | 1m | Max request body size |
| `--read-timeout MS` | 30000 | Read timeout (milliseconds) |
| `--workers N` | 4 | Thread pool worker count |
| `--queue-capacity N` | 64 | Thread pool queue capacity |
| `--no-compress` | enabled | Disable gzip response compression |

## Using Hull with AI Agents

**Starting a new app with an AI coding agent?** Hand the agent
**[BOOTSTRAP.md](BOOTSTRAP.md)** plus your product spec. It's a
single-file prompt (Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode / Cursor compatible)
that installs Hull, walks the agent through the required-reading order,
forces a Phase 1 (discovery + clarifying questions) → Phase 2 (`PLAN.md`
for human approval) → Phase 3 (implement, tests after each step)
workflow, and sets up a `PLATFORM_GAPS.md` log so the agent flags
Hull-side gaps instead of coding around them. Same prompt works for
any product spec - fully app-agnostic.

Hull provides structured JSON interfaces for AI coding agents via the `hull agent` command. The same interfaces work for any automation (CI scripts, service orchestrators, or human developers who prefer structured output. **Twenty-eight machine-readable subcommands** cover routes, database schema, test results, server status, HTTP responses, deployment readiness, capability analysis, request preview, one-shot eval, the analyzed project model, and more) no screen-scraping or log parsing required.

```
# Core introspection

hull agent schema-diff [app_dir]         # DB schema drift vs migrations
hull agent sql named <qname> [--params J] [dir]  # named query from queries.json
```

27 of these (all but `hull agent inspect`, which delegates to the source-analysis tool VM) are also exposed via MCP (`hull mcp [app_dir]`) for IDE integrations like Cursor / Claude Code's MCP support.

Combined with `hull dev --agent` (which writes `.hull/dev.json`, `.hull/last_error.json`, and a per-reload `.hull/discovery.json` generation as sidecar files), agents get a complete feedback loop: edit code, check for errors, run tests, inspect the database, make HTTP requests, validate manifest coverage. All structured.

`hull agent inspect` surfaces Hull's **project source-discovery** model: a static, host-owned analysis of the app's source (Lua via the pure-Lua `hull.source.*` layer, JavaScript via a bundled QuickJS frontend session, without executing app code) that reports the annotated declarations - annotations attached to declarations, with exact ranges, deterministic IDs, and by-annotation indexes. It runs standalone, or serves the live generation a running `hull dev --agent` session has published. JavaScript is a first-class analyzable frontend on a default build (analyzed via a bundled QuickJS frontend session with parity to Lua; reported unsupported only on a `RUNTIME=lua` build, never parsed as Lua). This is the foundation a future codegen step (e.g. Query/Compute IR) consumes.

### Agent Development Workflow

The workflow is the same regardless of which AI coding tool you use:

```
1. hull new myapp && cd myapp        # scaffold project
2. hull dev --agent --audit app.lua  # start dev server (hot-reload + audit logging)
3. Agent edits code                  # dev server auto-reloads
4. hull agent status .               # did the reload succeed?
5. hull agent errors .               # if not, what broke?
6. hull agent test .                 # run tests, check results
7. hull agent request GET /health    # verify endpoint behavior
8. hull agent db schema .            # inspect current schema
9. hull build -o myapp .             # build standalone binary
```

Steps 3–8 repeat in a tight loop. The agent writes code, checks its work, and iterates. All through structured JSON interfaces.

### Claude Code

Claude Code reads [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) automatically on session start. Hull ships both `CLAUDE.md` (contributor guide with build commands, conventions, and API reference) and `AGENTS.md` (agent-specific guide with `hull agent` usage, app patterns, and stdlib reference). No additional configuration needed.

**Setup:**

```bash
# Install Claude Code
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Start working on a Hull project
cd myapp
claude
```

Claude Code discovers the project structure through `CLAUDE.md` and uses its built-in Bash tool to run `hull` commands. It reads `AGENTS.md` when it needs agent-specific patterns.

**Example session:**

```
You: Create a task management API with CRUD endpoints and tests

Claude Code:
  1. Reads CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md for Hull conventions
  2. Creates migrations/001_init.sql (tasks table)
  3. Writes app.lua with GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /tasks routes
  4. Writes tests/test_app.lua
  5. Runs: hull agent test .              → checks all tests pass
  6. Runs: hull agent routes .            → verifies route registration
  7. Runs: hull agent db schema .         → confirms schema matches expectations
```

**Optional: Custom skills** for repeated workflows. Create `.claude/skills/deploy/SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: deploy
description: Build and deploy the Hull app
---
1. Run `hull agent test .`. Abort if any tests fail
2. Run `hull build -o app .` to produce a standalone binary
3. Show the user the binary path and size
```

Then invoke with `/deploy` in Claude Code.

### OpenAI Codex CLI

Codex CLI reads `AGENTS.md` automatically (it's the [open standard](https://agents.md/) for agent instructions, supported by 60,000+ projects). Hull ships `AGENTS.md` with complete `hull agent` documentation, app patterns, and stdlib reference.

**Setup:**

```bash
# Install Codex CLI
npm install -g @openai/codex

# Start working on a Hull project
cd myapp
codex
```

Codex reads `AGENTS.md` on session start and runs `hull` commands through its shell tool.

**Optional: Project config** at `.codex/config.toml` for project-specific settings:

```toml
# .codex/config.toml
project_doc_max_bytes = 65536
```

**Optional: Read CLAUDE.md too**. Codex can be configured to read additional instruction files:

```toml
# .codex/config.toml
project_doc_fallback_filenames = ["CLAUDE.md"]
```

### OpenCode

OpenCode reads both `AGENTS.md` (primary) and `CLAUDE.md` (fallback) automatically. Hull ships both, so no configuration is needed.

**Setup:**

```bash
# Install OpenCode
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash

# Start working on a Hull project
cd myapp
opencode
```

**Optional: Custom commands** at `.opencode/commands/test.md`:

```yaml
---
description: Run Hull tests and show results
---
Run `hull agent test .` and analyze the results.
If any tests fail, read the failing test file and the relevant app code,
then fix the issue. Re-run tests until all pass.
```

Then invoke with `/test` in OpenCode.

### What Agents See

Every `hull agent` subcommand returns structured JSON. Here's what a typical agent interaction looks like:

```bash
$ hull agent routes .
```
```json
{
  "runtime": "lua",
  "routes": [
    {"method": "GET", "pattern": "/health"},
    {"method": "GET", "pattern": "/tasks"},
    {"method": "POST", "pattern": "/tasks"},
    {"method": "GET", "pattern": "/tasks/:id"},
    {"method": "DELETE", "pattern": "/tasks/:id"}
  ],
  "middleware": [
    {"method": "*", "pattern": "/api/*", "phase": "pre"}
  ]
}
```

```bash
$ hull agent test .
```
```json
{
  "runtime": "lua",
  "files": [
    {
      "name": "test_app.lua",
      "tests": [
        {"name": "GET /health returns ok", "status": "pass"},
        {"name": "POST /tasks creates task", "status": "pass"},
        {"name": "DELETE /tasks/:id removes task", "status": "fail",
         "error": "expected 204 got 200"}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "total": 3, "passed": 2, "failed": 1
}
```

The agent reads the structured error, opens the relevant handler, fixes the status code, and re-runs the test. All without human intervention.

```bash
$ hull agent db schema .
```
```json
{
  "tables": [
    {
      "name": "tasks",
      "columns": [
        {"name": "id", "type": "INTEGER", "pk": true},
        {"name": "title", "type": "TEXT", "notnull": true},
        {"name": "done", "type": "INTEGER", "default": "0"},
        {"name": "created_at", "type": "INTEGER"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

```bash
$ hull agent request POST /tasks -d '{"title":"Buy milk"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
```json
{
  "status": 201,
  "elapsed_ms": 3,
  "headers": {"Content-Type": "application/json", "Content-Length": "42"},
  "body": "{\"id\":1,\"title\":\"Buy milk\",\"done\":0}"
}
```

### Deployment

```bash
# Build standalone binary (embeds app + stdlib + the composable subsystems it uses)
hull build -o myapp .

# The binary is the product. No runtime, no dependencies
./myapp -p 8080 -d /data/app.db

# Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD)
hull build -o myapp . CC=cosmocc
```

The agent workflow for deployment: run `hull agent test .` to verify all tests pass, then `hull build -o myapp .` to produce the binary. Because the base is composable, the output size tracks what the app actually uses: a compute-only `app.main` links ~2.1 MB (zero Keel / mbedTLS / SQLite / WAMR), while a full web app composing all of them back is ~6.5 MB on aarch64. Copy the single file anywhere and run it.

#### `hull deploy`. Config Generator

`hull deploy` generates deployment configs informed by the app's manifest. It writes files that standard tools consume. It never makes network calls or executes the generated configs.

```bash
hull deploy dockerfile myapp/              # Dockerfile + .dockerignore
hull deploy systemd myapp/ --name myapp    # deploy/myapp.service + deploy/install.sh
hull deploy fly myapp/ --region lax        # fly.toml (+ Dockerfile if missing)
```

| Target | Output | Consumed by |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `dockerfile` | `Dockerfile` + `.dockerignore` | `docker build` |
| `systemd` | <code>deploy/&lt;name&gt;.service</code> + `deploy/install.sh` | `systemctl` |
| `fly` | `fly.toml` + `Dockerfile` (if missing) | `flyctl deploy` |

**Manifest-aware generation:** The generated configs automatically adapt based on the app's manifest and directory structure:
- **CA bundle**. Included only when manifest declares `hosts` (outbound HTTPS)
- **ENV declarations**. From manifest `env` array (documentation + `docker run -e`)
- **VOLUME**. Only when app has migrations (uses a database)
- **systemd hardening**. 17 security directives (NoNewPrivileges, ProtectSystem=strict, SystemCallFilter, etc.)
- **fly.toml mounts**. Persistent volume only for database apps

```bash
# Common flags
hull deploy <target> [app_dir] --port 8080 --name myapp -o /tmp/out
hull deploy dockerfile myapp/ --distroless     # FROM distroless instead of scratch
hull deploy dockerfile myapp/ --sign           # add hull verify step in build stage
hull deploy systemd myapp/ --user webapp       # custom system user
hull deploy fly myapp/ --memory 512            # 512 MB VM

# Agent introspection
hull agent deploy myapp/                       # JSON deployment readiness analysis
```

## Building Hull

```bash
make                    # build hull binary
make test               # run all unit tests (~58 suites, ~1280 cases)
make e2e                # end-to-end tests (all examples, both runtimes)
make e2e-migrate        # migration system tests
make e2e-templates      # template engine tests (40 tests, both runtimes)
make debug              # ASan + UBSan build
make msan               # MSan + UBSan (Linux clang only)
make check              # full validation (clean + ASan + test + e2e)
make analyze            # Clang static analyzer
make cppcheck           # cppcheck static analysis
make platform           # build libhull_platform.a
make platform-cosmo     # build multi-arch cosmo platform archives
make self-build         # reproducible build verification (hull→hull2→hull3)
make CC=cosmocc         # build with Cosmopolitan (APE binary)
make clean              # remove all build artifacts
```

## Release Process

Releases are tagged commits (`v0.1.0`, `v0.1.1`, …) that trigger
`.github/workflows/release.yml`. The workflow builds four platform
binaries in parallel (`hull-linux-x86_64`, `hull-linux-aarch64`,
`hull-darwin-arm64`, `hull-cosmo`), signs a SHA-256 manifest with an
offline Ed25519 key, and publishes a GitHub release. `hull update` then
verifies the signature against the public key embedded in the binary
(`HL_RELEASE_PUBKEY_HEX` in `include/hull/release.h`) before atomically
replacing itself.

### One-time setup

Generate the release-signing key on the maintainer's machine:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.hull/keys && chmod 700 ~/.hull/keys
cd ~/.hull/keys && hull keygen release      # writes release.{pub,key}
```

- `release.key` is 128 hex chars, mode `0600`. **Back this up offline**
  (USB stick / password-manager attachment / sealed envelope). Losing
  it means no more signed `v0.1.x` releases.
- `release.pub` is 64 hex chars. Paste its contents into
  `include/hull/release.h` as the value of `HL_RELEASE_PUBKEY_HEX`,
  replacing the all-zero placeholder. Commit and push.
- Set the GitHub Actions secret:
  `gh secret set HULL_RELEASE_KEY --body "$(cat ~/.hull/keys/release.key)" --repo artalis-io/hull`

### Per release

1. Wait for CI to go green on the commit being tagged. The release
   workflow re-runs `make`, signs from the freshly built linux native
   binary, and publishes. Broken CI means a broken release.
2. `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Hull vX.Y.Z" && git push origin vX.Y.Z`
3. `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds `hull-{linux-x86_64,linux-aarch64,darwin-arm64,cosmo}`,
   produces `hull.sha256` and `hull.sha256.sig`, and publishes the
   GitHub release.
4. Smoke-test on a clean machine:
   `curl -fsSL https://gethull.dev/install.sh | sh && hull update --check`.

Threat model, key-rotation plan, and the rationale for signing the
manifest rather than each binary individually are in
[docs/release_signing.md](docs/release_signing.md).

## Status

Hull is at **v0.15.0** (2026-09-20). Pre-stable: APIs and the manifest schema may change. Pin versions and read the [changelog](https://github.com/artalis-io/hull/releases) before upgrading. The v0.15.0 release completes the first-party Windows install story and widens backend + test coverage: `install.ps1` ships with non-admin installer tests plus Winget and Scoop metadata, the cosmo base compiles in the PostgreSQL and MySQL wire backends, `hull tools install` gains `--tag=` to pull from a named release, and SMTP now routes through Keel v3 public primitives. Two capability-layer fixes land with it: a server-supplied SCRAM iteration count is now bounded (an unbounded one let a hostile or MITM'd PostgreSQL server stall the client in PBKDF2), and `hull/search` rejects a SQL keyword as an identifier on the JS side as it already did on the Lua side. The 28 co-located stdlib test suites under `stdlib/{lua,js}/hull/tests/` now run in CI for the first time; wiring them up also surfaced an uninitialised read in vendored QuickJS that every `const [a, b] = x` triggered (see [`docs/quickjs_patches.md`](docs/quickjs_patches.md)). **Windows note:** Hull process startup on Windows is currently about 53ms slower per invocation than v0.14.0, traced to the vendored Keel v3.1.1 bump and reported upstream; it is felt most by tooling that shells out repeatedly. **Windows upgrade note:** a v0.13.0 Windows binary cannot self-update (that fix ships in v0.14.0); download `hull-cosmo` and replace `hull` once manually while it is not running, after which `hull update` works normally. Recent milestones: v0.14.0 (Windows stabilization, acceptance-tested on a non-admin, Developer-Mode-off environment, [`docs/release_acceptance_v0.14.0.md`](docs/release_acceptance_v0.14.0.md)), v0.13.0 (stdlib maturation), v0.10.0 (self-contained `hull build` on stock Windows), v0.9.0 (the fully-composable SLIM base).

**Platform coverage.** Linux (gcc + clang, x86_64 + aarch64), macOS (arm64), and Cosmopolitan APE (multi-arch fat binary). Capability sandbox enforced via pledge/unveil (Linux / Cosmo / OpenBSD) or Seatbelt (macOS). All releases are signed with Ed25519 (plus Sigstore/Rekor + SLSA provenance). Verify with `hull verify-release` or in-browser at [verify.gethull.dev](https://verify.gethull.dev).
