<br/>

Relationships are your most valuable asset, but they're also the hardest thing to keep track of. Contacts scattered across Apple, Google, and LinkedIn. Names you recognize but can't quite place. Introductions you meant to follow up on but never did. **Contrack fixes that.**

Sync your contacts from every source into one unified network with automatic dedupe across platforms. Let AI enrichment research your connections across the web and fill in the context you never had time to enter. Behind the scenes, proactive intelligence keeps watch over your network and nudges you to reconnect before important relationships go quiet.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**AI is optional at install time.** Add one API key (Gemini, OpenAI, or Anthropic), point Contrack at a self-hosted OpenAI-compatible server (Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio) from **Settings → AI** after first boot, or run with no AI at all — contact management and semantic search work offline on the built-in local embedding model.

### Option 1: Docker, prebuilt image (fastest)

CI publishes a multi-arch image (amd64 + arm64) on every release:

```bash
docker run -d --name contrack \
  -p 3210:3210 \
  -v "$PWD/contrack-data":/app/data \
  -e GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key \
  ghcr.io/arvarik/contrack:latest
```

Open **http://localhost:3210**. Everything that must survive a restart — database, uploads, backups, the embedding-model cache — lives in `/app/data`, so that one volume is the whole persistence story. The container reports its own health (`docker ps` shows `healthy` once the app answers), and `docker stop` shuts down cleanly.

Authentication is off by default, on the assumption that the container is reached from this machine only — set `-e AUTH_REQUIRED=true` if the port is reachable by anything else, and the first visit will walk you through creating an account.

### Option 2: Docker Compose (build from source)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arvarik/contrack.git
cd contrack
cp .env.example .env
# Optional: add an API key — or skip this and connect a provider in Settings → AI
docker compose up -d
```

Same behavior as Option 1; data persists to `./data`. The first build compiles native modules and takes a few minutes.

### Option 3: Native installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arvarik/contrack.git
cd contrack
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Optional: add an API key — or skip this and connect a provider in Settings → AI
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:3210**. The server auto-initializes the database, loads embedding models, and starts background tasks. Requires Node.js 22+.

> **Demo data:** Run `npm run db:seed` to generate ~30 realistic demo contacts, or `npm run seed` to add a single example contact to an empty database. Neither deletes existing data.

| `DATA_DIR`              | Root for runtime data (DB, uploads, backups, model cache) | project root |
| `MAPBOX_API_KEY`        | Mapbox geocoding (optional, higher accuracy)              | —            |

More variables (per-capability model pins, CORS, trash retention, background-job control) in the [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md). A liveness probe lives at `GET /healthz` — always reachable without a credential, used by the Docker `HEALTHCHECK`, and safe to point an uptime monitor at.
