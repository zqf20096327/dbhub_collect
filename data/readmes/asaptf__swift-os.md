**A modern operating system written from scratch in [Embedded Swift](https://www.swift.org/get-started/embedded/) for 64-bit ARM** — a small, capability-isolated, fast-booting core, built by *removing* legacy rather than emulating it. Small enough to trust; real enough to run nginx and Node.js.

</p>

> 🌐 **The page at <https://swiftos.tech> is served by SwiftOS itself.** It runs on a bare-metal Hetzner Cloud ARM VM — nginx, statically linked against our own newlib port, on top of our own kernel, syscall ABI, and in-kernel TCP/IP stack. Not QEMU, not a container.

## What works today

- **Freestanding Embedded Swift kernel** — swift.org toolchain, target `aarch64-none-none-elf`, no Foundation, no full standard library. Value types and `Unsafe*` pointers at the metal; ARC and classes only above the heap.
- **Real MMU isolation** — one address space per process — with a **capability/principal** security model (authorization is principal + capability mask, never `uid == 0`).
- **A native Swift userland** — coreutils, an interactive shell, `ps`/`top`, `sshd` — on our own POSIX-like syscall ABI. No Linux ABI, static linking only, no dynamic loader.
- **An in-kernel TCP/IP stack** — DHCP, TCP, UDP, DNS, HTTP, TLS — with a sans-IO, pure-Swift protocol core.
- **SMP** — schedules across multiple cores (tested at `-smp 4`) with cross-CPU TLB shootdown and spinlock-protected kernel state (`make smp-test`, `make s5-test`).
- **A three-tier filesystem** — an immutable signed read-only base, a RAM `tmpfs` scratch tier, and a persistent, `fsync`-durable `/data` tier, durable enough to back SQLite (`make datafs-sqlite-test`).
- **Runs real software** — **nginx** serving HTTPS (`make nginx-test`, `make nginx-tls-test`), and **Node.js 24.16** with bundled **npm** on V8 in `--v8-lite-mode` (jitless, so it needs no RWX pages): `node -e "console.log(6 * 7)"` prints `42` and `npm --version` prints `11.13.0` (`make node-test`, `make npm-test`).
- **Boots on real hardware** — a bare Hetzner Cloud ARM VM via ACPI + GICv3 + PCIe ECAM/virtio-pci, not just QEMU `virt` (`make hetzner-deploy-test`).

It is a learning project: intentionally minimal, rough in places, and not production. Some pieces stay in C/asm on purpose — third-party code (busybox, the newlib port) and the MMIO / boot / syscall bridges — but the rule is **Swift by default**. The goal is a small, testable, modern core.

## Try it

**See it live:** <https://swiftos.tech> — the page is served by the OS, so the site
loading *is* the demo. **In the browser:** [swiftos.tech/try](https://swiftos.tech/try)
runs the same image under `qemu-system-aarch64` compiled to WebAssembly (until the
pinned WASM bundle is published it plays a recorded boot).

**Or boot it yourself** under QEMU on macOS Apple Silicon or Linux:

```sh
make newlib && make busybox     # one-time: cross-build the libc + bring-up shell
make build && make run          # boot the kernel under QEMU virt (exit: Ctrl-A X)
make test                       # host unit tests + in-QEMU boot assertions
```

Log in as `root` / `swordfish`. New here? [docs/GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)
walks through the first boot; [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) covers
what usually goes wrong.

The project is not a Linux clone or a legacy-Unix compatibility exercise. The same minimalist core targets three profiles — **application & AI hosting** (flagship), **embedded/appliance**, and **desktop** (not excluded) — which differ mainly in which optional services and devices are present, not in the kernel.

## Current Status

The bring-up phase is complete; the system runs a native Swift userland with
networking, schedules across multiple cores (SMP), serves a persistent `/data`
tier, hosts nginx over HTTPS, and boots on real Hetzner Cloud ARM hardware.
Development continues under **Phase 1**: hardening for the product profile —
completing the capability/handle model and moving drivers toward restartable
userland services (see [docs/RISK_REMEDIATION_ROADMAP.md](docs/RISK_REMEDIATION_ROADMAP.md)).

What exists today, in the order it was built:

- **Phase 0 — bring-up (historical, M0–M8):** the kernel boots at EL1 on QEMU
  `virt`; UART, exceptions, GIC timer interrupts, the MMU, and preemptive EL0
  scheduling are up; each process has its own address space; fork/exec/waitpid
  work; a VFS exposes a read-only base FS plus a writable tmpfs; static ELF64
  programs load and execute from the VFS. The bring-up userland was a statically
  linked busybox `sh` (a legacy tool used to prove the syscall surface); the
  **native Swift userland is now the direction** (see below). `make test` covers
  host-side unit checks and QEMU boot assertions.

- **M9 — HAL + device tree:** the kernel reads its own DTB at boot and populates
  a global `Platform` struct; UART/GIC/RAM addresses come from the device tree
  instead of being hardcoded.

- **M10 (a/b/c) — UEFI boot from GPT disk:** a minimal AArch64 PE32+ EFI loader
  (`BOOTAA64.EFI`) calls `ExitBootServices` and hands off to the Swift kernel.
  `make disk` produces `build/swift-os.img`, a sparse GPT image with an EFI
  System Partition. `make disk-run` boots it under QEMU+AAVMF (edk2) with no
  `-kernel`. The direct `-kernel` path is kept as a fallback and both are tested
  by `make test`.

- **M10.5 — VirtualBox ARM prep:** the EFI loader emits diagnostics before
  handoff; a procedure for manually testing on VirtualBox ARM is in
  `docs/VIRTUALBOX.md`.

- **M11 (a–d) — virtio-blk + packed read-only base FS from disk:** a
  deterministic signed packed base image format (`SWOSBASE v3`); a host packer
  (`tools/basepack.swift`); a polled virtio 1.0 block driver; the VFS mounts the
  packed image at boot and serves `/bin`, `/etc`, and other base files directly
  from disk. The kernel no longer embeds any userland binary; the image shrank
  from ~1.4 MiB to ~208 KiB. Every `make run` / `make test` invocation attaches
  `build/base.img` as a virtio-blk device.

- **M12 (a–d) — capability/principal security + console-login as init:** a
  typed `ProcessSecurityContext` (principal, session, capability mask — not
  Unix uid==0); a base-image identity store `/etc/swos/passwd` with
  SHA-256-hashed passwords; `console-login` authenticates a principal, calls
  `SYS_LOGIN`, and `execve`s the shell with the adopted context; when a session
  ends, init loops back to a fresh login prompt.

- **M13 (a–c) + follow-ups — VFS capability enforcement, file ownership, shell
  redirection:** `vfsOpen` checks the caller's capability mask at open time
  (`capFsRead`, `capTmpWrite`); tmpfs namespace mutations (`mkdir`/`rm`/`mv`)
  require `capTmpWrite`; vnodes carry an owner (principal) and mode written at
  creation or packed from the base image; `ls -l` shows permission strings,
  owner names, sizes, and real timestamps (PL031 RTC); `fcntl` (`F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC`,
  `F_GETFD`/`F_SETFD`, `F_GETFL`) and close-on-exec semantics make shell I/O
  redirection (`echo > file`, `>>`, pipe-into-redirect) work correctly.

- **Native Swift userland coreutils:** a growing set of pure-Embedded-Swift EL0
  utilities over the `userland/lib/swift_user.*` bridge, all packed into the base
  image: `ls` (with `-l`), `cat`, `echo`, `pwd`, `ps`, `top`, `id`, `mkdir`,
  `rmdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `chmod`, `chown`, `head`, `touch`, `wc`, `date`, `calc`
  (an interactive expression REPL that exercises Swift `String`/`Array`/
  `Dictionary`/ARC), `kv` (an in-memory key-value REPL), and `console-login`.
  The userland free-capable allocator (K&R free-list over `sbrk`) backs ARC for
  these apps.

- **Network stack (N-series, in-kernel, sans-IO core):** a TCP/IP/UDP/ARP/ICMP/
  DNS stack in Embedded Swift. The protocol core (`kernel/net/`) is pure Swift
  (no MMIO/heap-per-packet), compiled into both the kernel and host unit tests.
  The virtio-net driver (`kernel/drivers/virtio_net.swift`) provides the DMA
  path. Capability-gated socket syscalls (`socket`/`bind`/`sendto`/`recvfrom`/
  `listen`/`accept`/`connect`/`resolve`) are exposed to EL0. Userland tools:
  `/bin/udpecho`, `/bin/tcpecho`, `/bin/tcpget`, `/bin/nslookup`, `/bin/httpd`
  (a concurrent poll()-driven static-file HTTP server with MIME types and
  directory listings), and `/bin/llmd` (TinyStories inference over HTTP). A
  ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD module (`kernel/crypto/`) is
  built and tested as TLS groundwork. DNS queries resolve against slirp's
  nameserver by default.

- **Restartable driver-service and device-discovery smoke:** the C5a-C5f path
  stages `/bin/drvsvcdemo` and `/bin/drvinputd`. The supervisor starts an
  input-driver service, exchanges endpoint IPC messages, discovers and claims
  `virtio-input.0` when QEMU exposes a keyboard device, falls back to
  `pseudo-input.0` in headless boots, surfaces virtio-mmio base/length as
  discovery metadata, proves future hardware-authority bits stay clear, keeps
  the current device grant metadata-only, transfers an opaque device handle,
  proves the grant moves, stays busy while the service owns it, is reclaimed
  after exit, and recovers with `C5a OK: restartable driver service recovered
  over IPC`, `C5b OK: opaque device handle transferred and released`, `C5c OK:
  virtio-input device grant discovered and matched`, `C5d OK: virtio input
  discovery metadata surfaced`, `C5e OK: device authority withheld until
  explicit handoff`, and `C5f OK: device grant rights stayed metadata-only`.
  The aggregate acceptance gate is `make c5-test`; real MMIO, IRQ, DMA, and
  virtio-input queue ownership are still roadmap work.

- **Threading runtime:** `thread_create`/`futex` (FUTEX_WAIT/FUTEX_WAKE)
  syscalls; EL0 threads share one address space; a futex-based mutex test proves
  correct concurrent increment across preemption.

- **Process teardown reclaims frames:** `address_space_destroy` walks and frees
  all user-half page tables and leaf frames on process exit/exec/reap; a boot-
  time reclaim test asserts zero leak across fork+exec+spawn round-trips.

- **Package and ports fixtures:** `.swpkg` packages, writable package-store
  images, signed static repository catalogs, and target-side `pkg install NAME`
  are covered by executable fixtures. The current ports path also cross-builds
  static AArch64 Lua, zlib, bzip2, zstd, xz, libarchive, OpenSSL, pcre2, nginx, and sqlite on the host,
  packages the pinned ca-certificates and tzdata bundles as data, publishes all
  twelve into one signed seed repository, emits a static-hostable repository
  root that can be served to QEMU, and proves install from a DNS-resolved
  hosted-style repository URL.

- **Product-profile hardening (post-M13):** **SMP** across cores (S0–S5: per-CPU
  scheduling, cross-CPU TLB shootdown, spinlock-protected kernel state; boots and
  runs the existing workloads at `-smp 4`); a persistent, `fsync`-durable **`/data`
  tier** (`datafs` on a dedicated virtio-blk disk, durable enough to back SQLite);
  **nginx** serving static HTTP and **HTTPS/TLS** from the base image and `/data`;
  **Node.js 24.16** cross-built for SwiftOS with bundled **npm**, running on V8 in
  `--v8-lite-mode` (jitless); and a bare-metal **Hetzner Cloud ARM** bring-up (ACPI
  tables, GICv3, PCIe ECAM + virtio-pci, DHCP, headless boot to `sshd`). Gates:
  `make smp-test`, `s5-test`, `datafs-sqlite-test`, `nginx-test`, `nginx-tls-test`,
  `make node-test`, `make npm-test`, `hetzner-deploy-test`.

## Philosophy

The design is intentionally narrow:

1. **Lightweight by design.** Every always-on subsystem must justify its memory
   cost, CPU cost, boot-time cost, and security surface.
2. **Simple enough to trust.** Prefer explicit, testable mechanisms over clever
   machinery.
3. **Secure by construction.** Separate address spaces, capability-based handles,
   small privileged code. Kernel authorization is principal/capability, not
   uid==0.
4. **Correctness proven by tests.** Each milestone must build, boot, satisfy its
   acceptance criterion, and ship executable checks.
5. **Modern over legacy.** Rebuild tools against the swift-os ABI instead of
   importing Linux compatibility or old platform assumptions.

See [docs/PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/PHILOSOPHY.md) for the full project stance.

## Architecture

```text
EL0  userland      native Swift coreutils + network tools; future Swift apps, Node.js, JVM (busybox: legacy bring-up)
      ----------   syscall boundary: swift-os POSIX-like ABI, not Linux ABI
EL1  kernel        Embedded Swift: runtime, mm, sched, vfs, drivers, net, security, tty
      arch/aarch64 boot (UEFI loader + direct -kernel fallback), exception vectors, context switch
```

Key architectural decisions:

- **Target:** `aarch64`, QEMU `virt` (primary), QEMU+AAVMF UEFI (primary boot path), VirtualBox ARM
  (best-effort). `make run` defaults to one CPU; SMP hardening has dedicated
  `-smp N` tests and readiness gates.
- **Boot:** UEFI (`BOOTAA64.EFI` on an ESP in a GPT disk image) is the primary path; direct `-kernel`
  is kept as a fallback.
- **Hardware discovery:** a boot-time DTB reader populates a global `Platform`; driver and PMM
  initialization read from it instead of hardcoded constants.
- **Kernel language:** Embedded Swift, freestanding, no Foundation, no full standard library.
- **Isolation:** real MMU-based process isolation, one address space per process.
- **Filesystem:** three-tier. A signed packed read-only base image (`SWOSBASE v3`) served off a
  virtio-blk device; a RAM tmpfs for writable scratch; and a persistent, `fsync`-durable `/data`
  tier (`datafs` on a dedicated virtio-blk disk) for state that must survive reboot. No FS
  journaling — crash-safety relies on honest `fsync` plus the application's own journaling.
- **Security:** capability/principal model. `/etc/swos/passwd` is the identity source; `/etc/passwd`
  is a generated compatibility view for busybox/newlib only.
- **ABI:** a small swift-os syscall surface, POSIX-like where useful, explicitly not the Linux
  syscall ABI.
- **Linking:** static userland only; no dynamic loader.
- **Network:** in-kernel, virtio-net, sans-IO pure-Swift protocol core; capability-gated socket ABI.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for subsystem boundaries, driver strategy,
long-horizon runtime constraints, and explicit non-goals. See
[docs/SWIFTCUBE_DESIGN.md](docs/SWIFTCUBE_DESIGN.md) for the recorded SwiftCube design — a
record-only note for a Swift-native cluster orchestrator that schedules applications as Cells.

## Build And Run

The default tool paths are pinned for the current macOS Apple Silicon bring-up
environment in [docs/NOTES.md](docs/NOTES.md). They can be overridden from
`make` if your local installation differs.

Prerequisites (run once):

```sh
make newlib    # cross-build newlib 4.6.0 into ./sysroot
make busybox   # cross-build busybox 1.38.0
```

Then:

```sh
make tools-check
make build
make run       # direct -kernel boot with base.img attached
```

UEFI boot (primary path):

```sh
make disk      # build BOOTAA64.EFI + GPT disk image (build/swift-os.img)
make disk-run  # boot under QEMU+AAVMF from the GPT disk
```

Other useful targets:

```sh
make test      # full test suite: host unit tests + QEMU boot assertions
               # (both -kernel and UEFI/disk paths are tested)
make uefi-run  # UEFI boot from a QEMU virtual FAT directory (quick, no GPT)
make debug     # boot QEMU paused with a gdbstub on :1234
make gdb       # attach aarch64-elf-gdb to the paused kernel
make base-image  # pack build/base.img from base/ + staged userland ELFs
make clean
```

`make run` starts:

```sh
qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -cpu cortex-a72 -m 256M -nographic \
  -global virtio-mmio.force-legacy=false \
  -device loader,file=<dtb>,addr=...,force-raw=on \
  -drive file=build/base.img,...,readonly=on \
  -device virtio-blk-device,drive=swosbase \
  -kernel build/kernel.elf
```

`make disk-run` starts:

```sh
qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt,acpi=off -cpu cortex-a72 -m 256M -nographic \
  -bios <AAVMF_CODE> \
  -drive file=build/swift-os.img,format=raw,if=virtio \
  <base.img as second virtio-blk>
```

Exit QEMU serial with `Ctrl-A X`.

## Toolchain Notes

The current pinned target is:

```text
aarch64-none-none-elf
```

The kernel is built with a swift.org Embedded Swift toolchain, LLVM `clang`,
`ld.lld`, `llvm-objcopy`, and QEMU. Exact versions and the rationale for the
current flags live in [docs/NOTES.md](docs/NOTES.md); do not guess or cargo-cult
Embedded Swift flags across toolchain versions.

## Roadmap

Work is organized in phases. Each milestone must remain buildable, bootable,
tested, and reviewable before moving on.

### Phase 0 — bring-up (done, historical)

The bring-up arc proved the kernel and syscall surface end to end. busybox was
the bring-up userland (a legacy tool); the native Swift userland is now the
direction.

- **M0:** boot skeleton and UART output. **Done.**
- **M1:** runtime hooks, exception vectors, heap, page allocator. **Done.**
- **M2:** GIC and timer interrupts. **Done.**
- **M3:** virtual memory and MMU. **Done.**
- **M4:** processes, scheduling, EL0 trap path. **Done.**
- **M5:** syscall entry and VFS skeleton. **Done.**
- **M6:** libc subset, ELF64 loader, spawn. **Done.**
- **M7:** TTY, termios, signals. **Done.**
- **M8:** static busybox `sh` with `ls`, `cat`, and `echo`. **Done.**
- **M9:** HAL + runtime hardware discovery from DTB. **Done.**
- **M10 (a/b/c):** UEFI boot from a GPT disk image under QEMU+AAVMF. **Done.**
- **M10.5:** VirtualBox ARM validation prep. **Done (prep only; manual run needed).**
- **M11 (a–d):** virtio-blk driver, packed `SWOSBASE` format + host packer,
  base FS served read-only from disk, disk-first executable lookup, embedded
  kernel blob removed. **Done.**
- **M12 (a–d):** capability/principal security core, identity store,
  console-login as init, SHA-256 password hashing. **Done.**
- **M13 (a–c):** VFS capability enforcement at open time, tmpfs mutation gating,
  file ownership + `ls -l`. **Done.**
- **Post-M13 follow-ups:** shell I/O redirection + `fcntl`; native Swift
  userland coreutils (`ls cat echo pwd ps top id mkdir rmdir rm mv chmod chown
  head touch wc date calc kv …`); busybox `vi`; PL031 RTC + per-file mtime;
  free-capable allocator for Swift ARC; threading (`thread_create` + `futex`);
  process teardown frame reclaim. **Done.**
- **N-series (networking):** virtio-net driver, sans-IO Ethernet/ARP/IPv4/ICMP/
  UDP/TCP/DNS core, capability-gated socket syscalls, `/bin/udpecho`,
  `/bin/tcpecho`, `/bin/tcpget`, `/bin/httpd` (concurrent poll-driven static-file
  HTTP server), `/bin/nslookup`, DNS resolver, TCP robustness + ephemeral-port
  allocator, ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD (TLS groundwork). **Done.**

### Phase 1 — hardening for the product profile (active)

The dedicated plan lives in `docs/RISK_REMEDIATION_ROADMAP.md`. It completes the
capability/handle model (C-arc), treats **SMP** as a required deliverable (S0–S5
series), moves drivers and the network stack toward the documented restartable
userland service model, and makes global kernel state concurrent-safe. Each
sub-milestone follows the strict rule: builds, boots (including `-smp N`), has
tests, is committed, then review. SMP and "restartable services" are tracked
work, not non-goals; C5a-C5f now prove the supervisor/service IPC shape,
virtio-input discovery metadata, fallback pseudo-device discovery, surfaced
virtio-mmio metadata, opaque device-handle transfer, withheld hardware
authority, and metadata-only grant rights before real device handoff lands.

### Phase 2 — full-OS capabilities (forward, record-don't-build-yet)

Toward a complete hosting/embedded OS: richer observability and metrics;
production update channels beyond the checked A/B validation paths; kernel-slot
health confirmation; the native Swift application runtime plus
Node.js and JVM hosting; the embedded footprint profile (small static image,
deterministic boot, fewer services); TLS 1.3 record layer and handshake; Cells
(kernel-native capability-based isolated execution domains); and a
hot-update-friendly kernel structure. Recorded, not implemented early.

## Non-Goals (minimalism by removing legacy)

These boundaries are deliberate. They are how the OS stays minimal — it removes
legacy surface rather than carrying it. They are not constraints on the
hosting/embedded/desktop profiles, which the same core already serves; they
constrain *how* it serves them.

- Linux ABI compatibility;
- dynamic linking;
- amd64/x86-64 support;
- full Cells isolation (the architecture is designed for it; the implementation
  is future work — see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/CAPABILITIES.md`);
- Docker/OCI compatibility;
- journaling or persistent writable filesystem guarantees;
- broad loadable kernel-module ABI;
- GPU/NPU acceleration;
- graphics as the *primary* display path (a basic VT100 framebuffer console +
  virtio-input keyboard exist for QEMU graphical mode; desktop use is not
  excluded, but a rich display stack is Phase 2 work, not a current target).

(See the risk remediation roadmap for the current status of SMP and restartable
driver services — they are no longer blanket non-goals.)

**SMP is a delivered capability, not a non-goal.** The S0–S5 series in
`docs/RISK_REMEDIATION_ROADMAP.md` brought up per-CPU scheduling, cross-CPU TLB shootdown, and
spinlock-protected kernel state; the system boots and runs the existing workloads at `-smp N`
(tested at `-smp 4`). `make run` still defaults to one CPU for speed. Phase 1 continues with
completing the handle-based capability model and moving drivers toward restartable userland services.

Networking is **not** a non-goal: a TCP/UDP/ARP/ICMP/DNS stack and a set of
userland network tools are present and tested. The long-term target (userland network
service reachable only via capability-gated IPC, after the C-arc + basic SMP) is recorded
in the risk remediation roadmap. What remains future work today is TLS in userland,
high-pps optimizations, and the actual service-ization.

These boundaries are not accidental omissions. They keep the kernel surface
small enough to measure, test, and trust.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome — start with the
[good first issues][gfi] and read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first: the
project has a few hard rules (Swift by default, no new legacy surface, every
change ships an executable check) that are easier to read than to rediscover in
review. Ports of existing programs and bring-up on new hardware — Raspberry Pi in
particular — are the most useful contributions right now.

## More from the author

swift-os is one strand of a wider argument that Swift belongs in systems and AI
work — that *AI doesn't have to speak Python*. The OS itself makes the case twice:
the kernel is Swift, and `/bin/llmd` serves transformer inference written in Swift
on top of it.
