# OpenCanvas

### Stop reading AI replies. Watch them assemble on an infinite canvas.

Ask a question and get a chart, a table and a kanban side by side, each one a real widget you can drag, pin and keep. Any model, including local, running on your machine under MIT.

## Why a canvas

Chat is a stream. The things you actually want from a model are not.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/why-canvas.svg" alt="Left: a chat transcript scrolling endlessly with the one useful line buried in it. Right: the same prompt on OpenCanvas, where a chart, a table and a kanban land side by side and the chat shrinks to one line." width="100%">
</p>

The model never prints the answer. It calls `place_widget` with a typed payload, a schema checks it, tldraw draws it. Answers become objects you can drag, pin, link and export. The chat shrinks to one line. The canvas remembers everything across conversations.

## Start in 60 seconds

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashark-ai-05/opencanvas.git && cd opencanvas
pnpm install && cp .env.example .env    # add one provider key, or none
pnpm electron:dev                       # or `pnpm dev` → http://127.0.0.1:3458
```

**No API key? Start typing anyway.** Timers, checklists, reminders, events, notes, arithmetic and unit conversions are recognised as you type and placed on Enter, with no model call at all.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/instant-widgets.svg" alt="Typing '25 min focus' into the composer. A chip previews 'Timer 25:00 · Focus', Enter places a live timer on the canvas, and a note reads 'Placed Timer 25:00 · Focus without the model'." width="100%">
</p>

## What you get

- **Any model, same agent.** Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter, or Ollama for fully offline. One tool-calling loop for all of them.
- **15 typed widget kinds**, from Vega-Lite charts and kanbans to live timers and sandboxed HTML. Adding one is a schema and a component; the model picks it up from the tool description.
- **The model grows its own toolbox.** It can register new widget kinds mid-conversation and reuse them later. A Python REPL and a JS REPL ship as examples.
- **MCP-native.** Point it at your filesystem, GitHub or Jira through any MCP server. Works with every provider, not just Claude.
- **Memory that compounds.** Every conversation indexes into a local SQLite + sqlite-vec store. `⌘K` finds any widget from any chat, weeks later.
- **Drive it from anywhere.** A REST API and SSE bus let cron jobs, scripts and other agents place widgets on your canvas.
- **Yours.** Binds to `127.0.0.1`, token-guarded routes, null-origin sandboxes for model-written HTML, no telemetry. [Threat model](./SECURITY.md).

</p>

*Six of the 15 built-in widget kinds. Each is a schema plus a React component; the model learns them from the tool description.*
