## What is CineLibrary?

CineLibrary is a native Windows app (C# + WinUI 3) that turns your already-organized movie and TV folders into a clean, fast, browsable catalog - posters, rich details, search, and playback - across as many external drives as you own.

Unplug a drive and its titles don't vanish; they fade to **offline** (posters and metadata intact) and wake up when you plug it back in. It's **free and open-source**, runs **portably** from any folder, and asks for nothing - no account, no subscription, no telemetry.

CineLibrary is a **reader, not a scraper**: it expects folders that already carry the standard Kodi-style `.nfo` metadata and poster/fanart images (the kind [MediaElch](https://mediaelch.github.io/mediaelch-doc/) or [CineLibrary Essentials](https://github.com/aungkokomm/CineLibraryEssentials) produce). That focus is what keeps it fast and non-destructive. When a title comes in only **partly scraped**, you can now **fetch just the missing details from TMDb on demand** - a deliberate, per-movie action, not a bulk scraper - and optionally write them back to the drive. Everything else stays fully offline.

## 📸 Screenshots

Your whole collection at a glance: the sidebar, the search, and every filter and sort on one tidy row.

📺 **TV shows get a page of their own**: the fanart, the cast with photos, the drive the show is on, and Fetch missing info from TMDB.

## ✨ Highlights

- **📺 Movies & TV shows** - full show pages with seasons, episodes, per-episode watched/favorite/notes, and "▶ Play next unwatched."
- **💾 Multi-drive, offline-aware** - index any number of external drives; offline ones stay visible with posters intact.
- **🔎 Fast search & filters** - title, actor, director, year; filter by genre, decade, rating, collection, tags, watched status.
- **🏷️ Your own organization** - favorites, watchlist, notes, free-form tags, and custom lists.
- **🧭 Discovery** - Continue Watching, Recently Watched, Recently Added, On This Day, and a filter-aware Surprise Me.
- **🎬 Watched & Gone** - a *memory keeper* for films you watched then deleted: the poster, your notes, tags and history stay as a record, isolated from your library so you never re-download by mistake. **Add watched movie** also logs ones you saw *elsewhere* - at the cinema, on streaming, or a friend's copy (looked up on TMDb).
- **🩹 Fetch missing info from TMDB** - a partly-scraped movie? Fill just the blanks (poster, plot, cast, year, …) on demand from any detail window. **Fill-only** - your existing MediaElch data is never overwritten.
- **🔄 Sync to drive (state + fetched art)** - write your personal state *and* any fetched art/details back into the movie folders (poster, fanart, `.actors\` - **never** rewriting your `.nfo`), so the drive stays the source of truth and a rescan can't lose them.
- **🧹 Find duplicates (Dupes).** Spots movies you have more than once and recommends which copy to keep, with reclaimable-space totals. Your dubbed and multi-language copies are left alone (recognised as kept on purpose). Non-destructive: it points you to the files, you decide.
- **💾 Backup & restore** - export all personal state (favorites, notes, lists, tags, history) to one portable JSON file.
- **🪪 State travels with the drive** - watched/favorite/notes/tags live next to each title, so they survive a drive move to another PC.
- **⚙️ Settings** - Light/Dark/System theme, optional card shadows, reduce-motion, and your own video player (VLC, MPC-HC, PotPlayer, mpv…).
- **🚀 Native & quick** - cold start under a second; smooth scrolling through thousands of posters.

## 📋 Before you start

> ⚠️ **CineLibrary reads metadata - it does not create it.** Your movie and TV folders must already be organized and scraped (each title in its own folder with a `.nfo` file and poster). If they aren't yet, use **[CineLibrary Essentials](https://github.com/aungkokomm/CineLibraryEssentials)** or **[MediaElch](https://mediaelch.github.io/mediaelch-doc/)** first - otherwise CineLibrary will have nothing to show.

## ⬇️ Download & install

1. Grab the latest **[portable installer](https://github.com/aungkokomm/CineLibraryCS/releases/latest)** - `CineLibrary-vX.Y.Z-Portable-Setup.exe`.
2. Run it and pick any folder - Desktop, external drive, USB stick. CineLibrary is fully portable; its data lives in `CineLibrary-Data\` right next to the exe.
3. Launch **CineLibrary** → open **Drives** → **Add folder**, point it at your movie/TV root, and let it scan.

Move the whole folder to another PC anytime - your library comes with it.

📖 New here? The **[User Guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md)** takes you from a fresh install to thousands of cataloged titles in about five minutes.

## 🧩 Companion app - CineLibrary Essentials

Folders not tidy yet? **[CineLibrary Essentials](https://github.com/aungkokomm/CineLibraryEssentials)** renames, organizes, and scrapes rich Kodi/Plex/Jellyfin-ready metadata in a few clicks. The recommended flow:

1. **Tidy & scrape** with CineLibrary Essentials (or MediaElch).
2. **Point CineLibrary** at the cleaned folders.
3. **Browse, search, and watch.**

---

## ⚙️ How it works

1. Scrape each folder with MediaElch / CineLibrary Essentials (Kodi-style `.nfo` + `poster.jpg` / `fanart.jpg`).
2. Launch CineLibrary → **Drives** → **Add folder**.
3. CineLibrary reads the `.nfo` files, caches the artwork, and writes everything to a local SQLite index.
4. Disconnect the drive - titles still appear (marked **OFFLINE**) with posters and metadata intact.

## 🛠️ Build from source

**Requirements:** Windows 10 20H1+ (19041) / Windows 11 · Visual Studio 2026+ with **.NET desktop development** and **Windows App SDK** workloads · .NET 10 SDK.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/aungkokomm/CineLibraryCS.git
cd CineLibraryCS
msbuild CineLibraryCS.csproj -t:Build -p:Configuration=Debug -p:Platform=x64
```

Self-contained portable build:

```powershell
msbuild CineLibraryCS.csproj -t:Publish -p:Configuration=Release -p:Platform=x64 -p:PublishDir=publish\
```

---

## 📂 Where your data lives

- **Dev build:** `CineLibrary-Data\` next to the `.csproj`.
- **Portable build:** `CineLibrary-Data\` next to `CineLibrary.exe`.

The SQLite database and cached artwork live there. Back it up to carry your favorites and watched state across machines (or use **Settings → Backup**).
