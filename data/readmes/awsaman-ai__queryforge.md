---

Your users stop translating what they want into dropdowns, checkboxes and date pickers — they just say it. You get back a parameterized query you can actually trust.

```
"orders over 500 dollars in the last 30 days that were not cancelled, newest first, top 20"
```

```sql
SELECT status, created_at, amount, customer_name FROM orders
WHERE (status <> $1 AND created_at >= $2 AND amount > $3)
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20
-- args: ["CANCELLED", "2026-06-29T08:49:06Z", 500]
```

The same sentence, against MongoDB, from the identical intermediate object — no second prompt:

```javascript
{ amount: {$gt: 500}, createdAt: {$gte: "2026-06-29T08:49:06Z"}, status: {$ne: "CANCELLED"} }
```

## Why not just ask an LLM for SQL?

Because you can't check what comes back. A model asked for SQL can invent a column, invent a table, quietly widen a filter, or hand you a statement that is only *probably* right.

QueryForge never lets the model near a query string. It fills in a **typed form** — the Query AST — constrained to a vocabulary your config registers. Everything after that is ordinary Go:

```
Natural language  →  [ AI planner ]  →  Query AST  →  [ generators ]  →  SQL / MySQL / Mongo
   (unbounded)        model + config     (typed)       pure code — no AI, no network
```

| | |
|---|---|
| **Invented a field?** | Rejected by the validator before anything compiles — with "did you mean" suggestions. |
| **SQL injection?** | The model emits structure, never a string. Values are bound (`$1`, `$2`); only config-supplied identifiers reach the statement. |
| **Asked to delete something?** | Not expressible. The AST has no mutation node, so every output is a `SELECT` or a `find`. |
| **Asked about a field you hid?** | `returnable: false` is enforced on the default projection too, not just explicit `select`. |
| **Asked something impossible?** | A typed refusal — not a plausible query built on a lookalike field. |
| **Asked for another tenant's rows?** | Scope filters (below) are AND-ed on after the model answers. It never learns the field exists. |

Everything that must be *guaranteed* lives on the deterministic side, where it can be tested offline.

## Install

Four ways to call it. All need the same two things and nothing else: a **config file** describing your data ([build one in your browser](https://queryforge-service.amtry.in/config-builder.html)) and a **model API key** in the environment. No server, no Docker, no database connection.

```

Restart Claude and ask *"cancelled orders over $200"* — it comes back as a validated query. [Docs →](https://github.com/awsaman-ai/queryforge_mcp)

</details>

Whichever you pick, the answer is the same query. Swap `postgres` for `mysql` or `mongo` and the same sentence compiles for that backend instead.

**QueryForge never connects to your database.** It hands you the query; executing it stays yours.

## Configure

One JSON file is the prompt context, the validation rulebook, the field→backend mapping, and the model selector:

```jsonc
{
  "entity": "Order",
  "model":    { "provider": "gemini", "baseURL": "…/v1beta/openai",
                "model": "gemini-3.1-flash-lite", "apiKeyEnv": "QF_API_KEY" },
  "backends": { "sql": { "table": "orders" }, "mongo": { "collection": "orders" } },
  "fields": [
    { "name": "status", "type": "enum", "values": ["PLACED", "DELIVERED", "CANCELLED"],
      "synonyms": ["state", "delivery status"],
      "mapping": { "sql": "status", "mongo": "status" } },
    { "name": "amount", "type": "number",
      "mapping": { "sql": "amount", "mongo": "amount" } },
    { "name": "createdAt", "type": "date",
      "mapping": { "sql": "created_at", "mongo": "createdAt" } }
  ]
}
```

**Don't hand-write it — build it.** The [config builder](https://queryforge-service.amtry.in/config-builder.html) is a single self-contained page (open it straight from disk, nothing leaves the browser). Four settings per field up front, the rest behind **Advanced**, every one with an ⓘ and a worked example, validated as you type by the same rules the loader enforces.

📖 **[Full configuration reference →](https://awsaman-ai.github.io/queryforge/)**

# Offline — no API key. Compiles a hand-written AST.
go run ./examples -config examples/orders.config.json -backend sql   -ast sample_ast.json
go run ./examples -config examples/orders.config.json -backend mongo -ast sample_ast.json

# Natural language — needs a key.

  -text "delivered but not refunded, created in the last 30 days, tagged premium and express"
```

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| 🗄 **Five backends, one brain** | Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch and OpenSearch ship today. A new database is one generator — not a prompt change, not a rewrite. |
| 🔒 **Scope filters** | Tenant, user and subscription predicates AND-ed onto every query, after the model has answered. |
| 🧭 **Field rules** | "Filtering passport expiry also needs a country" — a business-sense check the AST alone can't express. Reported as its own `POLICY_VIOLATION`, not a generic error. [Rules →](https://awsaman-ai.github.io/queryforge/config.html#requires) |
| 🔁 **Model fallback** | List several models; the first that answers wins. A rate limit on one provider falls through to the next. |
| 🧩 **Nested Mongo documents** | Dot paths for embedded docs, `elemMatch` for arrays of sub-documents so one element must satisfy every condition. [Rules →](https://awsaman-ai.github.io/queryforge/config.html#nested) |
| 🔎 **Elasticsearch and OpenSearch** | Search for exact values and free text on the same field, search inside nested objects, and point a query at the right index automatically — by name, by date, or by your own routing rules. |
| 🔤 **Value case folding** | The column stores `SHIPPED`, people say "shipped". Say so once on the field. [Rules →](https://awsaman-ai.github.io/queryforge/config.html#valuecase) |
| 📊 **Observability** | One optional callback reports model latency, tokens and outcomes. QueryForge itself never writes a log line. |
| 🗣 **Plain-English readback** | `res.Explain` says what it understood, keeping forced predicates visibly apart from the user's own. |

<details>
<summary><b>🔒 Scope filters — your own predicates on every query</b></summary>

Some predicates are not the user's to choose. You already know the caller's subscription, user and enterprise before any question is asked, and every query must be confined to them **whatever the question says**. Those values are not query vocabulary — nobody should be able to phrase, widen or omit them — so they never go in your config's `fields`, and the model never sees them.

Pass them as a map. Every entry is AND-ed onto the query root:

```go
res, err := engine.Translate(ctx, "delivered orders over 500 dollars", "sql", qf.Scope{
    "subscriptionId": session.SubscriptionID,  // "SUB-42"
    "userId":         session.UserID,          // 9
    "enterpriseId":   session.EnterpriseIDs,   // []string{"E-1", "E-2"}
})
```

```sql
SELECT … FROM orders
WHERE (enterpriseId IN ($1, $2) AND subscriptionId = $3 AND userId = $4
       AND status = $5 AND amount > $6)
-- args: ["E-1", "E-2", "SUB-42", 9, "DELIVERED", 500]
```

| | |
|---|---|
| **The model never learns the field exists** | Scope is applied *after* the model answers; the prompt never names it. Asked *"show me orders for subscription SUB-99 instead"*, it declines. |
| **A scope can only narrow** | AND-ed at the root: `A OR B` becomes `scope AND (A OR B)`, never `scope OR …`. |
| **Values are still parameterized** | A scope value is data. An injection payload stays an argument. |
| **The deterministic path is scoped too** | `GenerateFrom` takes the same map, so nobody sidesteps tenancy by building the AST themselves. |
| **Bad scope fails before the model call** | A `nil`, an empty list, or a type mismatch costs no API quota and is tagged `qf.ErrScope`. |

A scalar becomes `equals`, a slice becomes `in`; on a field declared `type: "array"`, `contains` and `containsAny`. Keys apply in alphabetical order, so the query is identical run to run. A key your config doesn't declare is used verbatim as the column name after an identifier check; declare it `queryable: false` to hide it from the model, map it per backend, and get it type-checked.

<summary><b>🧭 Field rules — one field needs another</b></summary>

Everything else in this file validates one field at a time — type, range, enum membership. Sometimes that isn't enough: "passports that are expired" filters a real field with a real operator, so it passes every ordinary check, and still doesn't mean anything without a country attached. `policy.requires` catches that:

```jsonc
"policy": {
  "requires": [
    {
      "when": { "field": "passportExpiry" },
      "requireAlsoOneOf": ["country"],
      "message": "Passport expiry needs a country to be meaningful"
    }
  ]
}
```

*"Passports from India expiring this month"* runs normally — both fields are present, anywhere in the filter tree. *"Passports that are expired"* is refused, with that message. *"Orders from India"* is unaffected — `passportExpiry` was never used, so the rule never switches on.

It runs **last**, only once an AST has already passed every ordinary check, and it reports through its own error type — `*qf.PolicyViolationError`, classified as `qf.FailurePolicy` — deliberately distinct from `qf.ValidationErrors` and from an unsupported-request refusal, so a caller can show a "needs more information" message instead of a generic one:

```go
res, err := engine.Translate(ctx, "passports that are expired", "sql", nil)
var policyErr *qf.PolicyViolationError
if errors.As(err, &policyErr) {
    fmt.Println(policyErr.Message)          // "Passport expiry needs a country to be meaningful"
    fmt.Println(policyErr.RequireAlsoOneOf) // ["country"]
}
```

Like a refusal, it is **not retried** — the model already answered correctly given the words it was given, and asking again would not add information the question never contained. The `cmd/queryforge` stdio protocol carries the same distinction on the wire as `"code": "POLICY_VIOLATION"` plus a structured `policyError` object, separate from `details`.

Build one without writing JSON: the [config builder](https://queryforge-service.amtry.in/config-builder.html)'s Step 6 turns it into two dropdowns — "When ▾ is filtered, also require ▾" — populated only from fields you've already added.

<details>
<summary><b>🔁 Choosing a model, and falling back</b></summary>

A config change, never a code change. The default provider speaks any **OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions`** endpoint; a second speaks **Anthropic's native Messages API**.

Naming a known provider supplies the endpoint, so the common case is two keys:

```jsonc
"model": { "provider": "groq", "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile", "apiKeyEnv": "GROQ_API_KEY" }
```

Built-in endpoints: `anthropic`, `cerebras`, `deepseek`, `fireworks`, `gemini`, `google`, `groq`, `lmstudio`, `mistral`, `nvidia`, `ollama`, `openai`, `openrouter`, `perplexity`, `together`, `vllm`, `xai`. `{ "provider": "ollama", "model": "qwen2.5" }` is a complete config on a stock install — no URL, no key.

This list holds **no model ids**, so a provider shipping a new model needs no QueryForge release. An explicit `baseURL` always overrides a preset, and a provider that is *not* listed is not unsupported — set `baseURL` and it works identically:

```jsonc
"model": { "provider": "acme", "baseURL": "https://api.acme.ai/v1", "model": "acme-ultra", "apiKeyEnv": "ACME_API_KEY" }
```

The key value never lives in the config — `apiKeyEnv` names the environment variable that holds it. From Java or Python you can supply it at runtime instead, straight from a secret manager:

```python
QueryForge.mysql("orders.config.json", credentials={"QF_API_KEY": vault.get("openai/key")})
```
```java
QueryForge.mysql(configPath)
        .withCredentials(Collections.singletonMap("QF_API_KEY", vault.read("openai/key")));
```

The value goes into the engine subprocess's environment only: never into the request, never into a log, never into your own process's environment.

**Retries.** A failed call is retried only when waiting could fix it — a rate limit, a 5xx, a dropped connection. A bad key, an unknown model, a malformed request or an exhausted quota fail immediately, because the next attempt would send exactly the same thing. Tunable per model block with `timeoutSeconds`, `maxRetries` and `retryBackoffMs`; a provider's `Retry-After` header always wins.

**Fallback.** List several and QueryForge tries them in order, using the first that answers, so a rate limit or billing block falls through transparently:

```jsonc
"model":  { "provider": "gemini", "model": "gemini-3.1-flash-lite", "apiKeyEnv": "QF_API_KEY", "baseURL": "…" },
"models": [
  { "provider": "groq",      "baseURL": "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1", "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile", "apiKeyEnv": "GROQ_API_KEY" },
  { "provider": "anthropic", "baseURL": "https://api.anthropic.com",      "model": "claude-opus-4-8",         "apiKeyEnv": "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" },
  { "provider": "ollama",    "baseURL": "http://localhost:11434/v1",      "model": "qwen2.5" }
]
```

Ready to run: [`examples/orders.fallback.config.json`](examples/orders.fallback.config.json).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>📊 Observability</b></summary>

QueryForge never writes a log line. It reports facts through one optional callback and lets you decide destination, format and severity:

```go
engine.SetObserver(func(ctx context.Context, e qf.Event) {
    switch e.Kind {
    case qf.EventModelCall:  // one round trip: latency, tokens, finish reason
    case qf.EventAttempt:    // one plan+validate cycle; e.Raw on failure
    case qf.EventTranslate:  // the whole call, on every exit path
    }
})
```

A traced live request measured the entire deterministic half — parse, validate, compile, explain — at **0.5 ms** against a **1,781 ms** model call. Roughly **99.97%** of a translation is one HTTP round trip, so the seam watches the model interaction and leaves the deterministic core alone.

**Privacy is a design property, not a convention.** The question text is never in an `Event`. Scope *values* are never in an `Event` — only `ScopeKeys` — because those values are tenant, user and enterprise ids. The API key is never in an `Event`. The one field that can echo caller data is `Raw`, the model's verbatim reply, populated only on a *failed* attempt; log it at debug level and truncate. A test asserts the rest with a canary.

Use `SetObserver`, not `engine.Observe`: only the former pushes the observer down into the provider, where latency and token counts live. The callback is synchronous, must be concurrency-safe, and must not panic.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🌳 What the AST looks like</b></summary>

**AST = Abstract Syntax Tree** — a plain JSON object describing *what the user asked for*, between the sentence and the query. A **tree** because filters nest; **abstract** because it knows nothing about SQL or Mongo: it says `"operator": "gt"`, never `>` and never `$gt`.

```json
{
  "entity": "Order",
  "filter": {
    "type": "logical", "op": "AND",
    "children": [
      { "type": "comparison", "field": "amount",    "operator": "gt",        "value": {"kind":"number","v":500} },
      { "type": "comparison", "field": "createdAt", "operator": "after",     "value": {"kind":"relative_date","unit":"day","amount":-30} },
      { "type": "comparison", "field": "status",    "operator": "notEquals", "value": {"kind":"enum","v":"CANCELLED"} }
    ]
  },
  "sort":  [{ "field": "createdAt", "dir": "DESC" }],
  "limit": 20
}
```

That one object compiles to SQL *and* Mongo with no second prompt. And it has **no node type that can write** — so "read-only" doesn't depend on a check someone might forget; it depends on there being no way to express a write.

📖 [Full AST reference →](https://awsaman-ai.github.io/queryforge/config.html#ast)

</details>

## Other languages

The same engine ships as a native library for Python and Java. Each SDK spawns the bundled binary as a **local subprocess** and exchanges one JSON object over stdin/stdout — no HTTP, no daemon, no socket. The SDKs contain **no query logic whatsoever**, so all three languages produce byte-identical output.

| | Python | Java |
|---|---|---|
| Install | `pip install queryforge-ai` | one Maven `<dependency>` |
| Runtime dependencies | none | none — not even a JSON library |
| Wrapper size | ~30 KB of code | ~35 KB jar |
| Engine binary | in the platform wheel (~6 MB) | in an auto-selected classifier jar (~2.5 MB) |
| Docs | [sdk-python/README.md](sdk-python/README.md) | [sdk-java/README.md](sdk-java/README.md) |

Both offer the full pipeline (`query`, one model call) and the deterministic half (`generate` / `validate` — no model call, no API key, testable offline). Writing an SDK for another language? The wire format is specified in [cmd/queryforge/PROTOCOL.md](cmd/queryforge/PROTOCOL.md).

## Logging and error handling

QueryForge **never fails silently**. If it cannot correctly complete an operation, it does not
pretend that it did: there is no path that returns an empty query, a partial result, or a nil in
place of a failure. Every failure carries a stable machine-readable code, keeps the original cause
reachable, and reaches the caller.

**The library itself does not log.** A library that logs on its own initiative picks a destination,
a format and a severity its host did not choose. Instead it reports facts through one optional
`Observer` callback — and ships the adapter almost everyone was going to write by hand:

```go
logger := slog.New(slog.NewJSONHandler(os.Stderr, nil))
engine := qf.New(cfg)
engine.SetObserver(qf.SlogObserver(logger))
```

```json
{"time":"2026-08-13T01:30:00.412Z","level":"ERROR","msg":"query generation failed",
 "library":"queryforge","language":"go","component":"engine","operation":"translate",
 "backend":"mysql","entity":"Order","duration_ms":1842,"outcome":"transport_error",
 "error_code":"MODEL_TRANSPORT","error_type":"*fmt.wrapError"}
```

The engine binary and both SDKs emit **the same field names, the same severities and the same error
codes**, so one saved search works across all four surfaces. Turn any of them on with
`QUERYFORGE_LOG_LEVEL`.

Two severity choices are deliberate: a **refusal is `INFO`**, because the model declining to invent
a query for something the config cannot express is the guard rail working; and a failed operation
produces **exactly one `ERROR`**, at the boundary, rather than the same stack trace at every layer.

**The question text, the scope values and the config contents are never logged**, at any level —
pinned by canary tests in all three languages. Only shape is: the entity, the backend, the scope
*keys*.

Full field schema, error-code table and level semantics: **[docs/OBSERVABILITY.md](docs/OBSERVABILITY.md)**.

## Testing

The deterministic half is fully tested with **no API key and no network**:

```bash
go test ./...
```

Every component ships happy-path and adversarial "try to break it" tests — injection strings, unknown fields, illegal operator/type pairs, out-of-domain enums, deep nesting, oversized limits. CI also runs [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run) against [`.golangci.yml`](.golangci.yml).

## Architecture

| File | Role | AI? |
|---|---|---|
| `ast.go` | Query AST types + JSON (de)serialization | — |
| `config.go` | Config types + loader + capability flags | — |
| `validate.go` | **The guarantee**: field/operator/type/enum/depth + capability checks, with suggestions | No |
| `generate.go`, `gen_sql.go`, `gen_mongo.go`, `gen_es.go` | Registry + backend generators (parameterized, read-only) | No |
| `elastic_config.go`, `source_es.go` | Elasticsearch/OpenSearch config validation and index resolution | No |
| `scope.go` | Caller-supplied filters → typed predicates AND-ed onto the query root | No |
| `explain.go` | AST → prose (dry-run, no execution) | No |
| `provider.go` | `ModelProvider` interface + OpenAI-compatible default + test stub | Yes |
| `planner.go` | Build prompt from config, parse model output → AST | Yes |
| `observe.go` | `Observer` seam: facts out, no logging | — |
| `slog.go` | Opt-in adapter: `Observer` events → structured `log/slog` records | — |
| `failure.go` | `Classify`: any error → one stable `FailureCode`, shared by all four surfaces | — |
| `queryforge.go` | `Engine`: `New`, `Translate`, `GenerateFrom`, `Validate`, `Register` | — |

The planner is the only place a model runs. Validate → generate → explain is pure Go — the guarantees live there.

## Roadmap

- **Shipped** — Go library, JSON config, validator, SQL/MySQL/Mongo/Elasticsearch/OpenSearch generators, scope filters, model fallback, observability seam, CLI, MCP server, Python and Java SDKs.
- **Next** — YAML config, confidence scores, REST facade.
- **Later** — Node and .NET SDKs over the same [stdio protocol](cmd/queryforge/PROTOCOL.md), a persistent engine process, an aggregation AST node, more backends (DynamoDB, Cassandra, ClickHouse).

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. CI runs `gofmt`, `go vet` and the full suite with the race detector on every PR, including from forks — the suite is entirely offline, so it needs no API key. If you're changing behaviour, please add a test that fails without your change.

Security issues go through [private disclosure](SECURITY.md), not a public issue.
