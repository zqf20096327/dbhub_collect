# moin.

Deploy anything. Lose nothing. Any app on any server you own, every SQLite and Postgres change backed up and checked every day. Web, CLI, terminal UI and MCP.

```bash
moin login              # sign in with an API token
moin servers add web-1  # prints the one-line install for your server
moin deploy             # ✓ moin. your app is live
moin                    # the live terminal UI
```

The agent on your server only dials out. Nothing listens for moin.
