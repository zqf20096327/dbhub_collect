# Capubridge

> A desktop devtool for developers debugging WebView-based Android apps — bridging the device world and runtime world in one place.

Capubridge is a [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app) desktop application for debugging Android Chromium WebViews exposed through Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP). It unifies ADB device management, CDP inspection, deep storage exploration, and live runtime tools into a single, native-feeling GUI. Framework wrappers are supported only when their WebView exposes a debuggable CDP target; native React Native/Hermes and iOS WebKit are outside the current scope.

Inspired by [aya](https://github.com/liriliri/aya) and the raw power of the [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/).

## The Problem

Debugging WebView apps on physical Android devices today means juggling:

- `adb` commands in a terminal to manage devices
- `chrome://inspect` in a browser to find WebView targets
- Chrome DevTools opened in a separate floating window
- Manual `adb forward` port management per device
- No integrated view of IndexedDB, LocalStorage, Cache API, or SQLite

Capubridge replaces this fragmented workflow with a single desktop app that speaks ADB and CDP for Android Chromium WebView targets.

---

## Features

### Device Management

- Auto-detect connected ADB devices (USB + TCP/IP)
- Connect / disconnect / pair wireless devices
- Per-device session with hot / warm / cold temperature model
- Restart ADB server, switch to TCP mode, root shell
- Shell command runner per device

### WebView & CDP Inspection

- Discover all debuggable WebView targets on the active device
- Forward CDP ports automatically (one port per device)
- Attach to any target — open Chrome DevTools externally or use the built-in console
- CDP proxy for direct WebSocket access from the frontend
- External DevTools lock prevents connection conflicts

### Framework DevTools (Vue & React)

- Runs the **official** Vue and React DevTools against a real Android WebView — component tree, props, reactive state, hooks
- Detected per target: the Vue or React tab only appears when that framework is actually present
- Backend injected at document start and bridged over CDP, so **no change to the debugged app is required** (an `adb reverse` WebSocket is impossible — Android refuses cleartext loopback with `ERR_CLEARTEXT_NOT_PERMITTED`)
- A capability probe explains a blocked target instead of spinning forever

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The target app must be built to allow inspection.**
>
> **Vue** — a stock production build is completely uninspectable: Vue drops `app._instance`, never emits `app:init`, and strips `__vnode` / `__vueParentComponent` from the DOM. Add `define: { __VUE_PROD_DEVTOOLS__: true }` to the target app's Vite config for staging builds, then rebuild.
>
> **React** — no flag needed; the Components tree works on a production build. But names are minified, and the **Profiler** requires a development or profiling build of React (`ionic cap run android -l --external`, or alias `react-dom/profiling`).

### Storage Explorer

- **IndexedDB** — browse databases, object stores, records; edit and delete via CDP writes (changes go to the actual device)
- **LocalStorage** — inspect and modify key/value pairs live
- **Cache API** — explore cached request/response entries
- **OPFS** — browse origin private file system
- **SQLite** — list, scan, and query supported `.db` snapshots; native Android snapshots are read-only

### Network Inspector

- Capture supported HTTP request lifecycles from the selected target
- Inspect headers, payloads, responses, redirects, timing, and failures
- Bound request history and retained payload data for long sessions
- Experimental request mocking backed by the local mock server

### Logcat

- Live log streaming with lease-based lifecycle (stops automatically when you leave)
- Tag and level filtering
- Bounded streaming output designed for high-throughput logs

### Performance Monitor

- Live CPU, memory, and network metrics per app process
- Lease-bound: starts when you enter, stops when you leave

### Screen Mirror

- Mirror Android screen to the desktop via scrcpy
- Touch, swipe, scroll, and keyboard injection
- Screenshot capture and screen recording
- Clipboard sync (device ↔ host)
- Detachable mirror window with compact controls

### Package Manager

- List installed packages (third-party or all)
- App icon resolution with persistent cache
- Open package details, launch apps

### File Browser

- Browse device filesystem
- Pull files to host and open in native OS app
- Handles protected paths gracefully (`/storage/self`, `/storage/emulated`)

### Session Recording & Replay

- **Record** — capture DOM mutations, network requests, console logs, and rrweb events during app usage
- **Playback** — replay recorded sessions with frame-by-frame scrubbing and timeline navigation
- **Multi-lane view** — synchronized replay of DOM changes, network activity, and console output
- **Event markers** — timeline shows key events (network requests, console logs) for quick navigation
- **Zip export** — download recordings as portable `.zip` files for sharing or archival

## Architecture

```
Android device
  ↕  ADB daemon / WebView sockets
Rust session runtime (Tauri backend)
  ├── device tracker          — USB/TCP attach/detach events
  ├── session registry        — per-device session lifecycle
  ├── per-device workers      — serialized control queue per device
  ├── live lease manager      — logcat / perf / mirror / console
  ├── cache store             — snapshot persistence (packages, targets, icons)
  └── typed session events    — pushed to frontend via Tauri event channel
Tauri IPC bridge
  └── Effect runtime wrappers — typed invoke + listen + cancellation
Pinia stores                  — presentation state, no invented device truth
Vue 3 modules                 — feature UI, composables, TanStack Query/Table
```

### Session Temperature Model

Each device session runs at one of three temperatures:

| State    | Meaning                                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **hot**  | Active device — live leases allowed               |
| **warm** | Known device — cached snapshots remain usable     |
| **cold** | Stale / offline — visible but not trusted as live |

### Work Classes

| Type               | Examples                                                       | Rules                                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Snapshot / control | device refresh, package list, target discovery, shell commands | Serialized per device, duplicate work coalesced  |
| Live / leased      | logcat, perf, mirror, console attach                           | Explicit lease — starts on enter, stops on leave |

### Key Design Rules

- Rust owns all operational runtime state. Vue owns presentation state only.
- No watcher-driven transport orchestration.
- No hidden target refresh triggered by component mount chains.
- Frontend never invents device or session truth.
- CDP writes always go through `Runtime.evaluate` to the actual device — no fake local mutations.

### Requirements

- Android device with **USB debugging enabled**
- ADB in your PATH (install via Android SDK Platform Tools if needed)
- For WebView inspection: app with debuggable WebViews (set `android:debuggable="true"` in `AndroidManifest.xml` — enabled by default for debug builds)

### Build from Source

```bash
# Install Vite+ on Windows
irm https://vite.plus/ps1 | iex

# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/aybinv7/capubridge
cd capubridge
vp install

# Run desktop app in dev mode
vp run tauri

# Production build
vp run -r build
```

**Requirements:** Vite+, Node 22+, and a Rust stable toolchain. Linux builds also require `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libxdo-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev`.

---

### For mac users

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/capubridge.app
```

### For Linux AppImage users

On recent Wayland systems using Mesa, including Hyprland-based Arch distributions, the 2.6.0 AppImage can fail during WebKitGTK EGL startup. Launch it with the host Wayland client library:

```bash
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libwayland-client.so.0 ./capubridge_2.6.0_amd64.AppImage
```

This is a temporary AppImage compatibility workaround. `.deb` and `.rpm` packages do not use the affected bundled Wayland library path.
