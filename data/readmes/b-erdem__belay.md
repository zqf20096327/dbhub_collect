![The embedded dashboard, live](assets/dashboard-live.gif)

Background jobs get awkward when one run contains twelve paid API calls, a
human approval, and a fan-out across the cluster. Classic queues retry the
*whole job*. Belay makes the **step** the unit of recovery: once a step's
result commits to the journal, later attempts replay it in microseconds and
continue from the first unfinished step. The same journal powers spend
accounting and replay debugging.

Dependencies: Postgrex, Jason, telemetry — no Ecto requirement, no Redis,
no separate service. PostgreSQL 14–18 are supported and exercised across
the CI compatibility matrix. Apache-2.0.

## Quick start

```elixir
# mix.exs
{:belay, "~> 2.0"}
```

```elixir
# config/config.exs — the Ecto/Phoenix convention, keyed by the instance name
config :my_app, MyApp.Belay,
  queues: [default: 10, mailers: [limit: 20]],
  crons: [[name: "digest", expr: "0 8 * * 1-5", worker: MyApp.Digest]]

# config/runtime.exs — runtime values (the database URL)
config :my_app, MyApp.Belay,
  storage: [adapter: :postgres, url: System.fetch_env!("DATABASE_URL")]
```

```elixir
# application.ex — otp_app pulls the config above; inline opts still override
children = [
  {Belay, otp_app: :my_app, name: MyApp.Belay},
  {Belay.Dashboard, belay: MyApp.Belay, port: 4004}
]

# once, at deploy time (idempotent)
Belay.Storage.Postgres.migrate!(db_url)
```

Prefer everything inline in the supervision tree? That works too — pass the
same keys to `{Belay, name: ..., storage: ..., queues: ...}` and skip
`otp_app`.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.WelcomeEmail do
  use Belay.Worker, queue: :mailers, max_attempts: 5

  @impl Belay.Worker
  def run(ctx) do
    MyApp.Mailer.deliver_welcome(ctx.job.input["user_id"])
  end
end

Belay.insert(MyApp.Belay, MyApp.WelcomeEmail.new(%{"user_id" => 42}))
```

Testing is deterministic — drain synchronously, travel through time:

```elixir
{:ok, job} = Belay.insert(name, MyApp.Pipeline.new(%{"id" => 1}))
assert %{succeeded: 1} = Belay.Testing.drain(name, :default)

Belay.Clock.Sim.advance(clock, 3_600)   # backoff, cron, rate windows, leases…
```

## Steps, waits, fan-out — one worker

Where Belay pulls ahead of a classic queue is jobs with expensive parts,
long waits, and moving pieces:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ResearchPipeline do
  use Belay.Worker, queue: :pipelines, max_attempts: 10

  @impl Belay.Worker
  def run(ctx) do
    # Committed steps replay from the journal; unfinished steps run again.
    text    = Belay.step(ctx, :transcribe, fn -> whisper!(ctx.job.input["url"]) end)
    summary = Belay.step(ctx, :summarize, fn -> llm!(text) end, cost: [usd: 0.02, tokens: 1200])

    # Fan out real jobs across the cluster; park at zero cost until all land.
    checks = Belay.map_children(ctx, :verify, MyApp.FactCheck,
               Enum.map(summary.claims, &%{"claim" => &1}))

    # Human in the loop: durable wait, instant wake on signal.
    case Belay.await(ctx, :approval, timeout: 86_400) do
      %{"approved" => true} -> {:ok, %{summary: summary, checks: checks}}
      _ -> {:cancel, :rejected}
    end
  end
end

# Attach a job budget and enforce uniqueness at insert:
Belay.insert(MyApp.Belay,
  MyApp.ResearchPipeline.new(%{"url" => url}, budget: [usd: 1.00], unique: "research:#{url}"))
```

Step bodies have **at-least-once execution until their result is committed**.
If a process dies after an external side effect but before the journal write,
that body can run again. Use provider idempotency keys or make external writes
idempotent. Once the journal row exists, normal retries do not re-execute it.

The same engine runs the unglamorous fleet — emails, webhooks, image
processing, nightly crons — and the newer shapes those queues were never
built for: declared workflow DAGs, month-long approval flows parked at zero
cost, and LLM/agent pipelines where each API call is a journaled step with
a price on it.

## Budgets and spend control

LLM-heavy workloads add a failure mode classic queues don't model: cost.
A retry that re-runs completed API calls buys them twice; a usage spike
outruns any dashboard. Belay enforces spend in the engine, in three
layers:

```elixir
# 1. Per-job fail-after-crossing limit. The step that crosses the limit runs;
#    no later unfinished step is admitted. Overshoot is bounded by that
#    step's declared cost in the modeled single-attempt path.
MyApp.ResearchPipeline.new(input, budget: [usd: 1.00])

# 2. Fleet-wide admission budget per window — a resource bucket spans every
#    queue that names it. Claims debit estimates atomically across the fleet.
queues: [
  ai: [limit: 20,
       rate: [resource: "anthropic_tokens", allowed: 2_000_000, period: 60, estimate: 3_000]]
]
# When the estimated allowance is spent, claims stop and work queues.

# 3. True-up — the claim debits the estimate; inside the job you correct it
#    with actuals, so the window converges on what the invoice will say.
#    A job debits its own queue's resource:
Belay.step(ctx, :summarize, fn ->
  %{text: text, usage: usage} = llm!(prompt)
  Belay.debit(ctx, "anthropic_tokens", usage.total_tokens)
  text
end, cost: [usd: 0.02])
```

Committed steps replay from the journal at zero declared cost, and budget
checks read durable spend, so a later attempt cannot forget recorded cost.
As with any at-least-once system, an external charge made before a crash but
not journaled may repeat and is not visible to Belay; use the provider's
idempotency mechanism for that window.

## Why it's built this way

- **The journal is the core.** Steps, costs, events, and results are
  first-class columns — so budgets, token-true-up rate limits, streaming,
  and replay debugging fall out of the schema instead of being bolted on.
- **Leaderless everything.** No peer election exists in the codebase: cron
  dedupes through a unique index, recovery is idempotent row-level work any
  node performs. The "leader stalled, nothing runs" failure class is
  structurally absent.
- **Millisecond dispatch on a polling-floor guarantee.** Adaptive burst
  polling plus an opt-in `pg_notify` accelerator — measured **11ms p50
  insert→result across unconnected processes** — while nothing load-bearing
  touches LISTEN/NOTIFY, so PgBouncer transaction pooling and serverless
  Postgres just work.
- **Leases with fencing, not rescue heuristics.** Crashed workers' jobs are
  reclaimed in seconds; zombie acks are rejected by attempt fencing.
- **Deterministic by design.** Storage behind a behaviour with an in-memory
  reference adapter; the clock injectable everywhere (SQL included). One
  suite runs against both adapters, and time-dependent behavior is tested by
  time travel, never sleeps.

## The workflow DAG view

Workflows, fan-outs, and spawned children render as a live graph —
deep-linkable (`#workflow=<id>`), with the full step journal one click away:

## Feature tour

| | |
|---|---|
| Durable steps + budgets | `step/4` with `cost:`; `budget: [usd:, tokens:]` — committed steps replay, jobs fail after crossing a limit |
| Human-in-the-loop | `await/3` parks at zero cost; `signal_job/4` wakes instantly; deadlines |
| Steering & cancellation | `steer_job/3` injects guidance mid-run; cooperative cancel at step boundaries |
| Dynamic children | `spawn/3`, `await_children/1`, `map_children/5` — replay-safe runtime DAGs |
| Workflows & batches | declared DAGs, transactional release, cascade/ignore policies |
| Event streams | `emit/2` + live subscriptions + offset replay — survives crashes |
| Replay debugging | `Belay.Replay.dry_run/2` — re-run code against the recorded journal |
| Cluster limits | `global_limit`, sliding-window `rate` (request- or **token**-based with true-up), per-tenant `partition` fairness (exact, skew-proof) |
| Transactional enqueue | `Belay.Txn.insert/3` in your Postgrex/Ecto transaction; wake-ups deliver exactly on commit |
| Unique jobs | constraint-backed: while-incomplete, windowed, or forever |
| Chunk workers | `chunk: [size:, gather_ms:]` — N jobs, one invocation (batch-priced APIs, bulk INSERTs), per-job partial failure |
| Adaptive concurrency | `limit: [min:, max:]` — per-node scaling under load, exactly bounded by cluster limits |
| Encrypted inputs | AES-256-GCM at rest; plaintext only in the executing process |
| Runtime CRUD | `Belay.Queues` / `Belay.Crons` — change queues and schedules with no deploy |
| Scheduling | `schedule_in`, durable `sleep/3`, leaderless cron with exactly-once slots |
| Embedded dashboard | zero dependencies, one child spec — everything in the GIFs above |
| MCP server | `mix belay.mcp` — AI assistants inspect the queue; writes are disabled by default and require an authorizer or explicit opt-in |
| Oban migration | `mix belay.migrate_oban` — pending jobs move in one command: dry-run analyzer, port verification, idempotent |

## Measured, not claimed

Numbers from this repo's reproducible harnesses on a laptop (Postgres 16):

| What | Result | Harness |
|---|---|---|
| Dispatch, same node | **8.6ms** p50 insert→result | `bench/run.sh` |
| Dispatch, cross-process + `pg_notify` | **11.0ms** p50 / 24.5ms p99 | `bench/run.sh` |
| Throughput (unbatched acks, 3 workers) | ~416 jobs/s end-to-end | `bench/throughput.exs` |
| Endurance soak (7h) | 99,004 jobs · 4,978 `kill -9` · 13 DB restarts — surfaced one real bug (below); **13/13 invariants** on the post-fix revalidation | `soak/run.sh` → reports in `soak/reports/` |
| Durable-core model | Recorded complete TLC run: **187,975,659 distinct states, zero violations**, depth 49 | `verify/spec/RESULT.md` |
| Trace conformance | **7/7 real execution traces admitted** (60/60 events), including crash/reclaim and cancel windows | `verify/traces/` (via `Attest.trace_check/2`) |
| Attempt fencing | Complete 10-state model passes; removing the fence produces the expected zombie-ack counterexample | `verify/attempt_fence/` |
| Schedule exploration | READ COMMITTED wake race reproduced + fix proven across 400 schedules | `verify/wake_protocol/` |
| Suites | 137 (Memory) + 149 (PostgreSQL), same behavioral suite plus PostgreSQL-only integration checks, `--warnings-as-errors` | `mix test` |

Six real bugs were found by these harnesses before any user could: two by
the chaos soak (a READ COMMITTED wake race among them), one by the 7-hour
endurance run (the budget crash window), one by adapter-equivalence
property testing (lost cancel requests), and two by extending the formal
model (retry semantics). The model is validated by *rediscovery*: revert
any fix in it and TLC reproduces the production failure, step for step
([CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md), [verify/](verify/README.md)). The race lessons
are codified in the [wire contract](SCHEMA.md).

## Proven on a real app

The first design-partner port replaced Oban in a production-shaped Phoenix
ingestion service (4 workers, webhooks, GDPR deletion flows, hourly cron,
uniqueness everywhere): **222/222 tests green and a live-producer run on the
first attempt, with zero engine changes required**. Dead-node recovery
tightened from a conservative 45-minute rescue plugin to ~2× a 60-second
lease — renewed leases replace guessing.

## Coming from Oban?

Workers port mechanically (`perform/1` → `run/1`), the plugins you delete
are engine config (Pruner → `retention:`, Lifeline → renewed leases, Cron
→ `crons:`), and pending jobs move in one command:

```bash
mix belay.migrate_oban --url postgres://.../my_app            # dry-run report
mix belay.migrate_oban --url postgres://.../my_app --execute
```

The [migration guide](guides/migrating-from-oban.md) has the full porting
map, the uniqueness translation, and the archive pattern for historical
rows — with field notes from a real port that went 222/222 on the first
run.

## Status

**1.0.0.** The public API and wire contract are stable. Belay is tested against
PostgreSQL 14–18 and Elixir 1.15–1.19 / OTP 26–28. Production adoption remains
early, so evaluate it against your failure modes before replacing a queue that
already works. Post-1.0 candidates: SQLite storage, batched acking, and
additional language clients.
