A real SQLite engine (official [sqlite-wasm](https://sqlite.org/wasm)) runs in a Web Worker on
OPFS with synchronous access handles; your app talks to it through a complete ADO.NET provider
and EF Core. Data survives refreshes, restarts and browser updates. No server, no emulated
filesystem, no manual serialization.

**[Try the live demo](https://b-straub.github.io/SqliteWasmBlazor/)** — installable as a PWA for offline use.

| Solution | Storage | Persistence | EF Core |
|----------|---------|-------------|---------|
| InMemory | RAM | none | full |
| IndexedDB | IndexedDB | yes | limited — no SQL |
| SQL.js | IndexedDB | yes | none — manual serialization |
| besql | Cache API | yes | partial — emulated filesystem |
| **SqliteWasmBlazor** | **OPFS** | **yes** | **full** |

## Install

```bash
dotnet add package SqliteWasmBlazor --prerelease
```

Optional at-rest encryption and its drop-in UI are separate packages:

```bash
dotnet add package SqliteWasmBlazor.Crypto --prerelease     # encrypted VFS
dotnet add package SqliteWasmBlazor.Crypto.UI --prerelease  # auth / encryption panels
```

Upgrading from an earlier pre-release? Breaking changes are listed per version in the
[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Quick Start

**Program.cs**

```csharp
using SqliteWasmBlazor;

var builder = WebAssemblyHostBuilder.CreateDefault(args);

builder.Services.AddDbContextFactory<TodoDbContext>(options =>
{
    var connection = new SqliteWasmConnection("Data Source=TodoDb.db");
    options.UseSqliteWasm(connection);
});

builder.Services.AddSqliteWasm();

builder.Services.AddSqliteWasmDbContext<TodoDbContext>();

var host = builder.Build();
await host.RunAsync();
```

Then place the initializer once, in your layout:

```razor
<SqliteWasmDatabaseInitializer/>
```

`Program.cs` only registers. `<SqliteWasmDatabaseInitializer/>` renders nothing;
after the first render it starts the worker and applies pending migrations for
every context declared with `AddSqliteWasmDbContext<T>()`. A migration that
cannot be applied — the schema on disk disagrees with the migrations in the
assembly — reports `SCHEMA_INCOMPATIBLE` with SQLite's reason, and the remedy is
a reset: delete the database, `ISqliteWasmInitializer.Reset()`, `InitializeAsync()`.

The base package reports and never renders — it carries no UI framework. Read
`IDbInitializationStatus`, or register an `IDbInitNotifier` with
`AddDbInitNotifier<T>()` to be told of `MIGRATING`, `READY` and every failure as
it happens. `SqliteWasmBlazor.Crypto.UI` ships `<DatabaseInformationAlert/>`, which
renders those states and offers the reset through the host's `IHostRecoveryService`.

Initializing after the app renders is what lets a long migration be reported
instead of freezing a blank page — and it is the only way an encrypted pool can
be opened at all, since its key comes from a WebAuthn ceremony that needs a UI.

Apps deployed on a sub-path must set the base href explicitly:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSqliteWasm(o => o.BaseHref =
    new Uri(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress).AbsolutePath);
```

**Use it**

```razor
@inject IDbContextFactory<TodoDbContext> DbFactory

@code {
    private async Task SaveTodo(TodoItem todo)
    {
        await using var db = await DbFactory.CreateDbContextAsync();
        db.TodoItems.Update(todo);
        await db.SaveChangesAsync(); // persisted to OPFS
    }
}
```

Your `DbContext` is an ordinary EF Core context — migrations, LINQ, `Include`, relationships and
decimal arithmetic all work as usual.

## Public API

`ISqliteWasmDatabaseService` (via DI) covers database management outside of EF Core. Every file
path streams; none of them holds a database in managed memory.

```csharp
public interface ISqliteWasmDatabaseService
{
    bool CanCancelQueries { get; }   // a service worker carries cancels to the running statement

    Task<IReadOnlyList<string>> ListDatabasesAsync(CancellationToken ct = default);
    Task<bool> ExistsDatabaseAsync(string databaseName, CancellationToken ct = default);
    Task DeleteDatabaseAsync(string databaseName, CancellationToken ct = default);
    Task RenameDatabaseAsync(string oldName, string newName, CancellationToken ct = default);
    Task CloseDatabaseAsync(string databaseName, CancellationToken ct = default);

    Task ExportDatabaseToStreamAsync(string databaseName, Stream destination,
        CancellationToken ct = default);
    Task ExportDatabaseToDownloadAsync(string databaseName, string filename,
        CancellationToken ct = default);
    Task ExportDatabasesToDownloadAsync(IReadOnlyList<string> databaseNames,
        string filename, CancellationToken ct = default);
    Task ImportDatabaseFromStreamAsync(string databaseName, Stream stream, long size,
        Func<string, CancellationToken, ValueTask>? validateImported = null,
        CancellationToken ct = default);
    Task ImportDatabasesFromStreamAsync(Stream envelopeStream, long envelopeSize,
        Func<string, CancellationToken, ValueTask>? validateImported = null,
        CancellationToken ct = default);

    Task<int> ImportRowsAsync(string databaseName, byte[] data,
        CancellationToken ct = default);
}
```

Imports park what they replace, run the incoming file past an optional `validateImported`
check, and re-run the host's migrations before the import counts; a refusal restores the
previous files byte-identically.

Cancelling a `CancellationToken` always ends the wait; whether it also stops the running
statement depends on a service worker. One `importScripts` of
`_content/SqliteWasmBlazor/sqlite-wasm-cancel.sw.js` and a call to
`handleSqliteWasmCancel(event)` from its `fetch` and `message` listeners is the whole
integration; `CanCancelQueries` says whether a session has it. See
[Cancelling Queries](docs/advanced-features.md#cancelling-queries).

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SqliteWasmConnection` / `Command` / `DataReader` / `Parameter` / `Transaction` | ADO.NET provider for direct SQL |
| `IDbInitializationStatus` | Initialization state and errors |
| `IDbInitNotifier` / `AddDbInitNotifier<T>()` | Initialization states pushed to the host as they happen; the host writes the sentences |
| `ISqliteWasmInitializer` | `InitializeAsync()` (idempotent) for a page that renders before the layout; `Reset()` before re-initializing |
| `MessagePackFileHeaderV2` / `SchemaHashGenerator` | Header of an `ImportRowsAsync` payload and the schema hash it carries |
| `PoolImportResult` | Outcome of a raw `.db` import |
| `SchemaMismatchException` | Thrown by `ValidateImportedSchemaAsync`; carries `MissingTables` |
| `PoolOperationRejectedException` | Typed precondition refusal, carries `Reason` |

Everything else — worker bridge, VFS — is internal.

## Optional: at-rest encryption

`SqliteWasmBlazor.Crypto` adds an encryption layer to the same VFS. Without a registered key it
falls through to byte-for-byte vendor SAHPool behavior.

- Every 4 096-byte page is sealed with **ChaCha20-Poly1305**, with the AEAD bound to
  `(versionTag, dbPath, slotIndex)` so relocated or cross-database pages fail authentication.
- The key is derived from a **passkey via the WebAuthn PRF extension** — no password, no key file.
- Unlock is verified (slot-0 AEAD probe + manifest MAC), not silent.
- Encrypted whole-pool export (`.eds`) wraps the key for a recipient X25519 pubkey.
- `SqliteWasmBlazor.Crypto.UI` ships drop-in RxBlazorV2 panels (en + de), requires
  `RxBlazorV2.MudBlazor` 1.3.2+.
- Machine-checked: 3 Tamarin theories, 74 lemmas, all verified.

## Browser Support

Chrome/Edge 108+, Firefox 111+, Safari 16.4+ — every browser from 2023 on, including
iOS/iPadOS Safari and Android Chrome. All support OPFS with synchronous access handles.

**Large databases move on mobile.** Exports stage through an OPFS file the browser saves from
disk; imports stream into the worker one chunk at a time. Neither heap ever holds the whole
file, so a multi-hundred-megabyte database transfers on a phone. iOS/iPadOS has the tightest
memory budget of the four engines — building for it is what makes the paths safe everywhere.

Installed to the Home Screen there is no downloads folder, so WebKit presents an export on a
full-screen OS sheet ("Open in …") instead of saving it. The file streams at any size and the
sheet's share menu saves to Files — worth telling your users, since it looks like a failure.

## Project Status

Pre-1.0. The public API is deliberately small and has been stable in practice, but broader
real-world feedback is needed before committing to long-term guarantees.

Shipped: ADO.NET provider · OPFS SAHPool · EF Core migrations · FTS5 · multi-database ·
V2 worker-side bulk import/export · memory-flat streamed export/import · query cancellation ·
at-rest encryption with passkey-derived keys · drop-in auth/encryption UI · Tamarin-verified crypto lifecycle.

Next: stable NuGet release · CryptoSync (E2E encrypted delta sync) · server-side delta generation.
