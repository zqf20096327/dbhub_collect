# Bear MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides Claude with comprehensive access to your Bear notes using a **hybrid sync-safe approach** - combining direct database reads with Bear's API for writes.

> **🔄 Sync-Safe Hybrid Mode**: All operations now work safely with iCloud sync!

## ⚠️ **Disclaimer**

This tool uses a hybrid approach: direct database reads + Bear API writes. While comprehensive safety measures are implemented:
- Read operations access Bear's database directly (read-only, safe)
- Write operations use Bear's official API (sync-safe)
- The tool is not affiliated with Bear's developers
- Always maintain regular Bear backups as good practice


## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Prerequisites
- Bear app installed on macOS
- Claude Desktop app
- Node.js 18+ installed

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd bear-notes-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

2. **Add to Claude Desktop configuration:**
Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {

```

### Environment Variables
- `BEAR_DB_PATH`: Override default database location (for reads)
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to 'development' for debug logging

## 📚 **Usage Examples**

### Basic Note Management
```
"Show me my recent notes"
"Find all notes tagged with 'project'"  
"Create a new note about today's meeting"
"Search for notes containing 'API documentation'"
"Update my project notes with the latest status"
```

### Advanced Operations
```
"Analyze my note-taking patterns this month"
"Find notes similar to my current project"
"Show me notes with attachments"
"What are my most-used tags?"
```

### Organization & Cleanup
```
"Archive old notes from last year"
"Find duplicate or similar notes"
"Show me notes that might need better tags"
"Duplicate this note with a new title"
"Add tags to organize my notes better"
```

## 🛡️ **Safety & Best Practices**

### ⚠️ **Safety Guidelines**
1. **Bear can run during operations** - Write operations use Bear's API safely
2. **Automatic tag validation** - Tags are sanitized with warnings
3. **iCloud sync compatible** - No conflicts or sync issues
4. **Keep Bear updated** - Ensure API compatibility

### 💡 **Best Practices**
- **Read operations** are instant - direct database access
- **Write operations** work with Bear running or closed
- **Tag warnings** show when tags are auto-corrected
- Use specific search terms for better results
- Archive notes instead of deleting when possible

### 🏷️ **Tag Formatting Guidelines**

**✅ RECOMMENDED TAG FORMATS:**
- Simple tags: `work`, `personal`, `urgent`, `meeting`
- Nested categories: `work/projects`, `personal/health`, `study/math`
- Time-based: `2024`, `january`, `q1`
- Project codes: `proj001`, `alpha`, `beta`

**❌ AVOID THESE FORMATS (auto-corrected):**
- **Hyphens**: `project-alpha` → becomes `projectalpha`
- **Spaces**: `work meeting` → becomes `workmeeting`  
- **Mixed case**: `ProjectAlpha` → becomes `projectalpha`

**🔧 Automatic Tag Sanitization:**
The server automatically validates and sanitizes all tags:
- **Lowercase only**: `Project` → `project`
- **No spaces**: `tag name` → `tagname`
- **No hyphens**: `project-alpha` → `projectalpha`
- **No commas**: `tag,name` → `tagname`
- **✅ Forward slashes preserved**: `project/alpha` → `project/alpha` (for nested tags)

**Tag warnings** are returned when tags are modified, so you'll know exactly what changes were made.

## 🏗️ **REFACTORED SERVICE ARCHITECTURE**

**✅ Completely refactored from monolith to modern service-oriented architecture!**

### Transformation Overview

We've completely rebuilt the system from a **2,589-line monolithic BearService** into a **modern, testable, service-oriented architecture**:

**🔧 Service-Based Design**
- **7 specialized services** with clear responsibilities
- **Dependency injection** for testability and flexibility
- **Interface-driven development** for maintainability
- **384 comprehensive tests** across all services

**🛡️ Hybrid Sync-Safe Architecture**
- **Read Operations**: Direct SQLite database access for maximum performance
- **Write Operations**: Bear's x-callback-url API for sync safety
- **Perfect coordination** using `ZUNIQUEIDENTIFIER` bridge

**📊 Quality & Performance**
- **100% TypeScript** with strict type checking
- **Comprehensive error handling** and validation
- **Multi-level caching** for performance optimization
- **Structured logging** and health monitoring

### Service Architecture
