## Overview

Open Brain gives coding agents a durable, model-independent brain. It stores semantic memory in PostgreSQL and pgvector, preserves where knowledge came from, follows work across sessions and agents, and assembles compact context for the next task.

Open Brain is the memory and intelligence layer, not the agent runtime. Connected agents remain responsible for reasoning, filesystem and terminal access, browser or computer use, and execution. Native integrations currently exist for Hermes, Medusa, Codex, and Claude Code; other agents connect through REST, MCP, the CLI, or the provider SDK.

It separates three concerns:

1. **Canonical evidence** — append-only events, imported records, sessions, tool results, and artifacts.
2. **Knowledge model** — current assertions, projects, tasks, decisions, procedures, and outcomes.
3. **Retrieval projections** — embeddings, indexes, revisions, caches, and context packets that can be rebuilt safely.

Imported or provider-supplied records are never silently promoted into truth. They retain authority and provenance until reconciliation classifies them as durable facts, instructions, procedures, historical episodes, stale information, or inference.

## How the banner maps to the code

| Promise | Current implementation |
|---|---|
| **Persistent memory** | PostgreSQL and pgvector semantic memory, hybrid search, canonical identities, append-only events, structured assertions, provenance, and exact agent attribution |
| **Continuous learning** | Retrieval feedback, contradiction reconciliation, compaction, and review queues for consolidation, lifecycle, and pruning proposals; durable changes require explicit acceptance and leave immutable receipts |
| **Context-aware intelligence** | Trust-labelled context packets use project, task, session, freshness, diversity, and token-budget signals, with revision-aware caching and feedback scoring |
| **Works across agents** | Native Hermes, Medusa, Codex, and Claude Code integrations plus REST, MCP, CLI, and a provider SDK with a conformance suite for additional hosts |

The Mem0, Honcho, and Hindsight integrations are provenance-preserving import adapters, not interchangeable live storage backends. Agents without a native adapter use the generic interfaces above.

## What is implemented

| Area | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| Memory and retrieval | Semantic and filtered search, recent and related memory, entities, tags, trends, weekly reports, context packets, and retrieval feedback |
| Continuity and knowledge | Canonical user, agent, workspace, project, task, and session identities; session lineage; idempotent events; evidence-backed assertions; decisions, procedures, and outcomes |
| Learning and governance | Contradiction reconciliation, memory compaction, bounded maintenance, proposal generation, human review, reversible consolidation, lifecycle transitions, conservative pruning, and immutable automation receipts |
| Interfaces | FastAPI REST service and OpenAPI docs, MCP tools, CLI, Streamlit dashboard, provider SDK, and conformance checks |
| Imports and connectors | Staged and resumable imports for Hermes memory, context, sessions, skills, and cron jobs; Mem0, Honcho, and Hindsight exports; file watcher, Claude Code logs, Gmail Takeout, Telegram, and WhatsApp exports |
| Operations | API-key authentication, request-size and rate limits, explicit CORS, structured diagnostics, health and readiness probes, retry-aware database access, checksum-protected migrations, and `openbrain-release-check` |

## Agent integrations

| Agent | Integration | Lifecycle coverage | Offline behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hermes | Native upstream-compatible memory provider | recall, remember, prefetch, turn sync, session switch, compression, delegation, session end | local spool and cached recall |
| Medusa | Provider SDK adapter | session start/end, user and assistant messages, tool results, compression, delegation | local spool and replay |
| Codex | Explicit host lifecycle bridge | session start/end, user and assistant messages, tool results, compression | host-controlled failure handling |
| Claude Code | Explicit host lifecycle bridge | session start/end, user and assistant messages, tool results, compression | host-controlled failure handling |
| Other agents | REST, MCP, or provider SDK | capability-dependent | integration-defined |

The Codex and Claude Code bridges deliberately avoid undocumented local transcript formats. A host wrapper supplies stable session, workspace, version, and scope identifiers and calls explicit lifecycle methods.

## Installation

Open Brain requires Python 3.11+ and Docker (Docker Desktop on Windows / macOS, docker Engine on Linux). The default docker-compose stack uses a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) service for embeddings, so no external API key is required.

### One-line install (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/benclawbot/open-brain.git
cd open-brain
bash scripts/quickstart.sh --with-hermes
```

`scripts/quickstart.sh` is idempotent: it copies `.env.example` to `.env` on first run, brings up the docker stack, waits for the api to become healthy, ensures the embedding model is available, and (with `--with-hermes`) wires Open Brain into a locally-installed Hermes as the active memory provider. If Hermes is not on PATH the integration step is skipped with a follow-up hint rather than failing.

### Manual install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/benclawbot/open-brain.git
cd open-brain
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
docker exec openbrain-ollama ollama pull nomic-embed-text   # one-time
docker compose ps
```

### Just the CLI (no docker stack)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benclawbot/open-brain/master/install.sh | sh
```

The installer uses `pipx`, keeping Open Brain isolated from system Python packages. It generates a private OpenBrain API key once in `~/.config/openbrain/.env`; upgrades reuse that key. This path is intended for users who already have a Postgres+pgvector instance elsewhere — the docker stack on this repo is the supported local-stack path.

Point `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASSWORD` at that database, then initialize it directly from the installed package:

```bash
openbrain migrate
```

The packaged migration chain starts at `001_base_schema.sql`, so a clean pipx install can create the core schema without cloning the repository or manually downloading `src/db/schema.sql`.

Verify:

```bash
openbrain --version
openbrain --help
```

### Hermes

```bash
openbrain install-hermes
hermes memory setup
```

Select `openbrain` as the active memory provider when prompted. `quickstart.sh --with-hermes` does both steps automatically when hermes is on PATH.

Optional scope variables:

```bash
export OPENBRAIN_PROJECT_ID=<project-uuid>
export OPENBRAIN_TASK_ID=<task-uuid>
export OPENBRAIN_TIMEOUT=3
```

If Open Brain is unavailable, Hermes continues operating. Writes are appended to `$HERMES_HOME/openbrain-spool.jsonl` and replayed later.

### Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/benclawbot/open-brain.git
cd open-brain
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

## Database and local stack

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5433
DB_HOST_PORT=5433
DB_NAME=openbrain
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-random-password
DB_TIMEZONE=auto
```

```bash
bash scripts/quickstart.sh           # recommended
# or, step by step:
openbrain configure --project-root .
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps
```

| API docs      | `http://127.0.0.1:8765/docs`         | FastAPI / OpenAPI                            |
| Dashboard     | `http://127.0.0.1:8501`              | Streamlit                                    |
| PostgreSQL    | `127.0.0.1:5433`                     | From the host (compose publishes 5432→5433)  |
| Ollama        | `127.0.0.1:11434`                    | Embeddings service (HTTP API)                |

The default API port is **8765** rather than 8000 because the Windows IP Helper service (`iphlpsvc`) often holds port 8000 on Windows hosts, which would prevent the api container from binding. Override `API_PORT` in `.env` if you need a different port.

The API container applies pending migrations on startup, then starts uvicorn. Containers reach PostgreSQL as `postgres:5432` and Ollama as `ollama:11434` over the internal compose network. From the host, use the published ports above.

The compose stack ships its own Ollama service running the `nomic-embed-text` model (768-dim). To use a hosted embeddings provider instead, set `EMBEDDER_PROVIDER` in `.env` to `openrouter` or `openai` and provide the matching API key, then edit `config/settings.yaml` to point at the new model and dimensions. The schema migration `015_embedding_dim_change.sql` alters `memory.embedding` to `vector(768)` to match the default embedder; if you switch to a 1536-dim model you must add a new migration that alters the column back (existing embeddings are lost).

Already-applied migrations must never be edited. Add a new migration instead.

## API keys

`OPENBRAIN_API_KEY` protects the OpenBrain HTTP API and the memories stored behind it. It is OpenBrain's own shared secret—not a key issued by OpenAI, OpenRouter, or another model provider. The installer generates it automatically, stores it in the private per-user environment file, and the API, provider SDK, host adapters, and Hermes plugin load it transparently. `openbrain configure --project-root .` copies the same key into the project's private `.env` and generates its database password. Existing credentials are preserved on upgrades and repeated configuration runs.

Production mode (`OPENBRAIN_ENV=production`) requires authentication and refuses to start without this key. You normally do not need to view or copy it. Explicit environment variables still take precedence when connecting to a remote OpenBrain deployment.

Embedding-provider keys are separate. Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` only when using that hosted provider for semantic embeddings. Create those keys in the provider's account dashboard. A local Ollama server does not require an API key.

## CLI

```bash
openbrain search "what did I decide about Hermes?"
openbrain store "Use upstream NousResearch/hermes-agent" --source cli --tag hermes
openbrain stats
openbrain import file ./notes.md
openbrain report --days 7
openbrain serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
openbrain migrate
openbrain install-hermes
openbrain update
```

## MCP

The MCP server uses the standard stdio transport:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

It exposes `memory_search`, `memory_store`, `memory_get_related`, `memory_get_entity`, `memory_today`, `memory_stats`, and `memory_weekly_report`. Configure an MCP-capable host to launch that command from the repository or installed environment.

## REST API

The complete, live contract is available through the OpenAPI documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`. Core semantic-memory endpoints include:

```text
GET  /memories
POST /memories
POST /memories/search
GET  /memories/{memory_id}
GET  /stats
GET  /trends
GET  /report/weekly
```

Continuity endpoints:

```text
POST /v1/events
POST /v1/identities/resolve
POST /v1/sessions/open
POST /v1/sessions/{session_id}/close
POST /v1/imports/hermes/markdown
GET  /v1/imports/providers
POST /v1/imports/providers
POST /v1/context
POST /v1/context/feedback
```

Reviewed automation is exposed under `/v1/lifecycle`, `/v1/consolidation`, `/v1/pruning`, `/v1/compaction`, and `/v1/maintenance`.

Context packets contain selected current state rather than raw transcript fragments. Items carry labels such as `user_confirmed`, `tool_observed`, `curated_memory`, `inferred`, `stale`, or `contradicted`.

## Memory lifecycle

```text
candidate → active → confirmed
                     ├→ superseded
                     ├→ contradicted
                     ├→ dormant
                     └→ archived → tombstoned → deleted
```

Open Brain prunes retrieval before storage. Old evidence can leave hot retrieval while remaining available for history, provenance, audit, and reconciliation. User-authored information is not automatically physically deleted.

## Security and authority

Typical authority ordering:

1. direct user statement
2. user-curated memory
3. tool observation
4. provider inference
5. Open Brain inference
6. assistant claim

Sensitive records can carry sensitivity and retention classifications. Provider inference remains distinguishable from user-confirmed truth.

Review `install.sh` before execution in high-security environments. Use a reviewed release tag rather than the moving `master` branch for reproducible deployment.

## Production readiness

Run the machine-readable gate before deployment:

```bash
openbrain-release-check --help
```

The gate validates production mode, authentication, API-key strength, and explicit CORS configuration. It also requires operator attestations for controls that cannot be inferred safely from application configuration:

- TLS termination verified
- backups verified
- restore drill completed
- monitoring enabled
- migration records confirmed

A deployment is not certified merely because configuration files exist. See [`docs/RELEASE_READINESS.md`](docs/RELEASE_READINESS.md).

## Validation

```bash
pip install -e '.[dev]'
python scripts/migrate.py
pytest -q
python -m build
```

GitHub Actions validates package installation, PostgreSQL and pgvector migrations, the full test suite, provider conformance, wheel creation, installed CLI execution, and Hermes provider installation smoke tests.

## Release status

**Open Brain 1.0.2 is the current production/stable release.** This patch includes embedding resilience and recovery, MCP SDK compatibility, packaged database bootstrap for pip/pipx installs, and release automation that publishes verified wheel and source-distribution artifacts.

Production readiness still depends on the target environment. Operators must run the readiness gate and verify external controls such as TLS, backups, restore drills, and monitoring before serving real data.

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for release details.
