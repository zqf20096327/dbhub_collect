# 🧬 Self-Healing Database Substrate

> *"The database that fixes itself — safely, transparently, and with your approval."*

**Part of the [cognitive foundation](https://github.com/bernard-kavanagh) portfolio** — demonstrating **procedural memory** and safe autonomous remediation on a unified TiDB data substrate. This repo proves that a cognitive foundation allows an agent to "practice" in a forked environment before committing knowledge to the substrate, solving the **Memory Wall** for database operations.

An autonomous DBA agent that detects performance degradation, proposes and validates fixes in an isolated sandbox, and waits for your sign-off before touching production. Every action is explainable. Every fix is reversible. LLM-agnostic.

Built with **Claude / OpenAI / Gemini** · **LangGraph** · **Streamlit** · **TiDB Cloud** · **Plotly**

## What is a Self-Healing Database Substrate?

Traditional databases are passive — they accumulate technical debt silently until a human notices a slow query, a hotspot alert, or a 3am page. This project inverts that model.

The **substrate** is the combination of:
- A **live production database** (TiDB Cloud Serverless) that serves real traffic
- A **copy-on-write branching layer** (TiDB Cloud Branches) for zero-risk sandboxing — every fix is proven before it touches production
- An **LLM-powered reasoning agent** (LangGraph ReAct loop) that observes, hypothesises, and validates
- A **vector episodic memory** (TiDB Vector Store) that learns from every past incident

Together they form a system that continuously monitors itself, proposes targeted structural improvements, benchmarks them safely, and self-heals — without ever modifying production until a human says yes.

### Three-Tier Memory in the DBA Agent

This agent implements all three tiers of the cognitive foundation's memory architecture:

**Episodic Memory** (`dba_episodic_memory` via TiDB Vector Store): Every past incident — slow queries detected, indexes proposed, fixes applied — is stored with vector embeddings. The agent recalls similar past incidents via semantic search before forming new hypotheses.

**Procedural Memory** (branching + RCA logic): The agent's learned workflow for safe remediation: observe → hypothesise → branch → apply fix in sandbox → benchmark with EXPLAIN ANALYZE → present results → wait for human approval. This procedure is the 'playbook' that improves with each incident.

**Semantic Memory** (implicit, planned for explicit implementation): Patterns confirmed across multiple incidents — e.g., 'write-heavy tables with UUID primary keys consistently benefit from AUTO_RANDOM' — are currently stored as episodic records. The cognitive foundation project will promote these to an explicit semantic memory tier with scoping and lifecycle management.

### Custodial Duties

The DBA agent implements three of the five custodial duties defined by the cognitive foundation:

- **Write Control**: Only validated investigation outcomes are persisted to episodic memory. The agent's intermediate reasoning (tool calls, failed hypotheses) stays ephemeral in the conversation context.
- **Deduplication**: Vector similarity search prevents duplicate incident records — if a new incident is semantically identical to a recent one, the agent references the existing record rather than creating a duplicate.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Reconciliation**: Every proposed fix is validated in a branch before touching production. The human approves or rejects, ensuring the knowledge base stays accurate.

**Not yet implemented**: Confidence decay and compaction are planned for the cognitive foundation project, where episodic records that haven't been referenced in 90+ days would lose relevance weight.

### Cognitive Foundation Role

In the cognitive foundation portfolio, this repo serves as the **procedural memory specialist**:

| Repo | Domain | Primary memory tier | Key capability |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tidb-self-healing-db-agent` | Database operations | **Procedural** | Safe RCA via branching |
| `ev_charger_anomaly_detection` | Industrial IoT | **Semantic** | Fleet-wide learning at scale |
| `tidb_fraud_detection` | Fintech / Payments | **Episodic** | Adaptive fraud detection |

All three repos run on the same architectural principle: a **unified data substrate** where the agent's memory lives alongside the operational data in one ACID boundary.

## How it works

**Prompted mode** — describe an issue in the chat:
1. **Triage** — you describe a slow query or performance issue
2. **Recall** — the agent searches its vector memory for similar past incidents
3. **Sandbox** — a TiDB Cloud branch (copy-on-write snapshot of production) is created with isolated credentials
4. **Fix & Verify** — the proposed DDL (`CREATE INDEX`, `ALTER TABLE`, etc.) is applied to the branch and benchmarked with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
5. **Report** — the agent presents before/after metrics and waits for your approval before touching production

**Autonomous mode** — click 🚨 Run Health Check in the sidebar:
The agent independently runs `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` across all known hotspot queries, scans for write hotspots and region imbalances, checks episodic memory for past incidents, and produces a prioritised findings report — no prompting required.

The agent loads relevant episodic memories via vector similarity search before each reasoning step — an early form of **context assembly** that the EV charger platform later formalised as `assemble_context()` with priority-ordered sources under a hard token budget. The principle is the same: the platform decides what the model sees, not the model itself.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A [TiDB Cloud](https://tidbcloud.com) Serverless cluster
- TiDB Cloud API keys (for branching)
- An LLM API key — Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google Gemini (see [LLM Configuration](#llm-configuration))
- The ISRG Root X1 SSL certificate ([download](https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrgrootx1.pem))

---

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in your values:

```env
# TiDB Cloud Serverless connection
TIDB_HOST=gateway01.<region>.prod.aws.tidbcloud.com
TIDB_PORT=4000
TIDB_USER=your_cluster_user.root
TIDB_PASSWORD=your_password
TIDB_DATABASE=dba_agent_db
TIDB_SSL_CA=/path/to/isrgrootx1.pem

# TiDB Cloud API (required for branch creation)
TIDB_CLOUD_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
TIDB_CLOUD_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
TIDB_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
TIDB_CLOUD_CLUSTER_ID=your_cluster_id

# ── LLM Provider (pick one) ──────────────────────────────────────
LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic           # anthropic | openai | gemini

# Anthropic Claude (default)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5

# OpenAI — set LLM_PROVIDER=openai to activate
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
# OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o

# Google Gemini — set LLM_PROVIDER=gemini to activate
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
# GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-pro

# Embedding model (local, no API key needed)
EMBEDDING_MODEL=all-MiniLM-L6-v2
EMBEDDING_DIM=384
```

### 3. Initialise the database

First load your `.env` vars into the shell, then apply the schema and seed:

```bash
# Load env vars into shell
set -a && source .env && set +a

# Apply schema (creates dba_agent_db — will not touch existing databases)
mysql -h $TIDB_HOST -P $TIDB_PORT -u $TIDB_USER -p --ssl-ca=$TIDB_SSL_CA < schema.sql

# Seed demo data
python3 seed_data.py
```

The seeder generates realistic production-like data:

| Table | Volume | Realism features |
|---|---|---|
| `users` | 10,000 | 3-year signup history, tier distribution |
| `products` | 500 | Multiple categories and brands |
| `orders` | 50,000 | Growth-weighted dates, power user concentration |
| `order_items` | ~96,000 | Variable line items per order |
| `reviews` | 10,000 | Skewed rating distribution |
| `events` | 200,000 | Session-based, business-hours weighted, funnel sequencing |
| `support_tickets` | 2,500 | Realistic priority and status distribution |
| `dba_episodic_memory` | 22 | Pre-seeded incidents spanning 8 resolution types |

**Power user model:** 15% of users generate 60% of orders and events, mirroring a real Pareto distribution.

### 4. Run the agent

```bash
python3 -m streamlit run agent.py
```

The UI will be available at `http://localhost:8501`.

### 5. Reset for a fresh demo run

After the agent has applied fixes to production you can wipe the database and start over:

```bash
bash reset.sh
```

One command. That's it. Here's what happens under the hood:

```
1. DROP DATABASE dba_agent_db        ← wipes everything, including the vector table
2. mysql < schema.sql                ← recreates all app tables with intentional missing indexes
3. python3 seed_data.py              ← re-seeds 10K users, 50K orders, 200K events …
                                        └─ seed_episodic_memory() fires at the end
                                             └─ TiDBVectorStore.add_texts() auto-creates
                                                dba_episodic_memory with the correct schema
                                                and writes all 22 pre-seeded incidents ✅
```

The `dba_episodic_memory` table is owned by TiDBVectorStore — it never appears in `schema.sql`. Dropping the whole database is therefore the cleanest possible reset: the vector table is recreated with the right schema automatically on first write, every single time.

## LLM Configuration

The agent is **LLM-agnostic**. Set `LLM_PROVIDER` in `.env` to switch models with no code changes:

| Provider | `LLM_PROVIDER` | Required env var | Default model |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anthropic Claude | `anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `claude-sonnet-4-5` |
| OpenAI | `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `gpt-4o` |
| Google Gemini | `gemini` | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | `gemini-1.5-pro` |

All three providers are wired through LangChain's unified chat interface. See `agent.py` → `build_agent()` for the provider selection logic.

---

## Demo schema

The schema (`schema.sql`) mimics a real e-commerce backend with **intentional performance issues** for the agent to find and fix:

| Table | Intentional problem |
|---|---|
| `orders` | No index on `status`, `user_id`, or `created_at` |
| `order_items` | No index on `order_id` — causes N+1 full scans |
| `events` | No index on `user_id`, `event_type`, or `created_at` (high-volume table) |
| `products` | No index on `category` or `brand` |
| `reviews` | No index on `product_id` or `rating` |

The agent detects these via `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` and proposes targeted index additions.

---

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `explain_query` | Runs `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on production (read-only) |
| `create_branch` | Spawns a copy-on-write TiDB branch with isolated credentials |
| `list_branches` | Lists all active branches |
| `delete_branch` | Cleans up a branch by ID |
| `delete_branch_by_name` | Cleans up a branch by name |
| `apply_ddl_on_branch` | Runs `CREATE INDEX` / `ALTER TABLE` on a branch only |
| `run_query_on_branch` | Benchmarks a query on the branch post-fix |
| `check_write_hotspots` | Detects `AUTO_INCREMENT` PKs and monotonic index risks |
| `check_table_regions` | Inspects TiKV region distribution for write hotspots |
| `check_slow_queries` | Queries the TiDB slow query log |
| `recall_memory` | Semantic search over past resolved incidents |
| `save_memory` | Persists a verified fix to the vector store |

---

## Autonomous diagnostics

Click **🚨 Run Health Check** in the sidebar to trigger an unprompted sweep. The agent will:

1. Search episodic memory for known past incidents
2. Run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on known hotspot queries
3. Scan for write hotspots (`AUTO_INCREMENT`, monotonic indexes)
4. Check TiKV region distribution for imbalanced tables
5. Produce a prioritised report (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW) with recommended fixes

This is a read-only pass — no branches are created until you ask the agent to apply a fix.

---

## Visualisations

Tool outputs are rendered with rich UI rather than raw JSON:

| Tool | Visualisation |
|---|---|
| `explain_query` | Execution time metric + index-used/full-scan badge + plan text |
| `run_query_on_branch` | Same as above, for the post-fix measurement |
| `recall_memory` | Past incidents as an interactive sortable table |
| `check_write_hotspots` | Severity badge + AUTO_INCREMENT PK table + monotonic index table |
| `check_table_regions` | Hotspot badge + region count + sortable regions dataframe |
| `check_slow_queries` | Slow query log table with formatted timing columns |
| `list_branches` | Branch table with per-row 🗑️ Delete button |
| Before + after in same turn | Plotly before/after bar chart with % improvement |

## Safety guardrails

- `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, and `DELETE FROM` are **blocked** on all branch connections
- DDL against the production host is **refused** at the tool level by comparing user prefixes
- Branch root passwords are **generated randomly per-branch** and never reused or stored
- No fix is applied to production **without explicit user approval**
- PII is never printed to the chat window

## Contributing

PRs welcome. The codebase is intentionally minimal — one file per concern, no frameworks beyond LangChain/LangGraph. The goal is a substrate you can clone, point at your own TiDB cluster, and have running in under 10 minutes.
