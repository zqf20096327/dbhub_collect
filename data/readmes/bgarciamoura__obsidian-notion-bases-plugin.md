## Why Notion Bases?

Obsidian's built-in Bases plugin is great for tables and has its own expression-based formula system. Notion Bases focuses on a different set of trade-offs — more views, more column types, and a spreadsheet-style formula syntax.

### Views

| View | Notion Bases | Core Bases |
|------|:---:|:---:|
| Table | Yes | Yes |
| Board / Kanban | **Yes** | No |
| Gallery | **Yes** | No |
| List | Yes | Yes |
| Calendar | **Yes** | No |
| Timeline / Gantt | **Yes** | No |
| Chart view | **Yes** | No |

> Notion Bases offers **5 exclusive views** that Core Bases doesn't have — Board, Gallery, Calendar, Timeline, and Chart — giving you the flexibility to visualize data the way that fits your workflow.

### Data modeling

| Feature | Notion Bases | Core Bases |
|---------|:---:|:---:|
| Column types | **18** | 6 |
| Formulas | Spreadsheet-style (`IF`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `CONCAT`) | Expression-based (JS-like) |
| Relation columns | **Yes** | No |
| Lookup columns | **Yes** | No |
| Rollup columns | **Yes** | No |
| Image columns | **Rendered in cell** | Text only |
| Subtasks / Sub-rows | **Yes** | No |
| Number formatting (prefix, suffix, decimals, thousands) | **Yes** | No |

> With relation and lookup columns, you can link databases together and pull values across notes — just like Notion. The spreadsheet-style formula syntax is familiar to anyone who has used Excel or Google Sheets.

### Table experience

| Feature | Notion Bases | Core Bases |
|---------|:---:|:---:|
| Column reordering (drag) | Yes | Yes |
| Column resizing (drag) | Yes | Yes |
| Column pinning | **Yes** | No |
| Row height options | Yes | Yes |
| Text wrap toggle | **Yes** | No |
| Aggregation row | **5 functions always visible** | Right-click → Summarize |
| Multi-column sort with priority | **Yes** | Basic sort |
| CSV import / export | **Yes** | No |
| Bulk actions (delete, duplicate, move) | **Yes** | No |

> Both plugins let you resize, reorder columns and adjust row height. Notion Bases goes further with **column pinning**, **text wrap**, a **persistent aggregation footer**, **multi-column sort with drag-to-reorder priority**, **CSV import/export**, and **bulk row actions**.

### Shared features

| Feature | Notion Bases | Core Bases |
|---------|:---:|:---:|
| Embed database in any note | Yes | Yes |
| Multiple views per database | Yes | Yes |
| AND/OR filter logic | Yes | Yes |
| 100% local Markdown | Yes | Yes |

**If you ever wished Obsidian had Notion-level databases without leaving your vault, this is it.**

## Views

### Table

A fully interactive spreadsheet: inline editing, resizable/reorderable/pinnable columns, aggregation footer, row height options, text wrap, multi-column sort, and bulk row actions.

![Table view](docs/images/view-table.png)

### Board (Kanban)

Drag cards between columns grouped by any `select` or `status` field. Add cards directly to a column. Hide empty or no-value columns. Configure which properties appear on each card.

![Board view](docs/images/view-board.png)

![Board drag](docs/images/feature-board-drag.gif)

### Gallery

A responsive card grid. Pick a cover field, choose card size (small / medium / large), and display any properties below the title.

![Gallery view](docs/images/view-gallery.png)

### List

A minimal, single-line view — title plus property chips. Great for quick overviews and task-oriented databases.

![List view](docs/images/view-list.png)

### Calendar

Monthly calendar. Position notes by any `date` field. Click a day to create a note with the date pre-filled. Notes without a date appear in a collapsible section.

![Calendar view](docs/images/view-calendar.png)

### Timeline (Gantt)

Horizontal bar chart with three zoom levels (days / weeks / months). Drag bar edges to resize start or end dates. Group rows by any field.

![Timeline view](docs/images/view-timeline.png)

![Timeline resize](docs/images/feature-timeline-resize.gif)

### Chart

Bar, line, and pie charts rendered as pure SVG. Pick a category column (X axis), choose count or a number column (Y axis), and select an aggregation function. Smart axis formatting with k/M suffixes and integer ticks. Responsive sizing and full mobile support.

## Getting started

### Installation

**Via Community Plugins (recommended)**

Notion Bases is available in Obsidian's Community Plugins directory:

1. Open **Settings → Community plugins → Browse**
2. Search for **"Notion Bases"**
3. Click **Install**, then **Enable**

Or install it in one click from your browser: [open in Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=notion-bases).

**Manual installation**

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/bgarciamoura/obsidian-notion-bases-plugin/releases/latest)
2. Create `<your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/notion-bases/`
3. Copy the three files into it
4. Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin in **Settings → Community plugins**

### Create your first database

1. Open the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`) → **"Create new database"**
2. Pick a folder — a `_database.md` file marks it as a database
3. Click the table icon in the ribbon (or run **"Open database"**) to open it

### Add views

Click **+** in the view tab bar to add a new view. Each view has its own filters, sorts and field visibility. Drag tabs to reorder.

### Embed in a note

````markdown
```nb-database
path: Projects
```
````

Pin a fixed view type (no tabs) — any of `table`, `list`, `board`, `gallery`, `calendar`, `timeline` or `chart`:

````markdown
```nb-database
path: Projects
type: board
```
````

A pinned embed inherits its configuration (board grouping, calendar date column, …) from the matching view defined in the database, so different notes can show the same data as a board, a calendar or a chart.

![Embed in note](docs/images/feature-embed.png)

## How data is stored

Everything lives in your vault as plain Markdown:

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Rows | `.md` files in the database folder |
| Column values | Frontmatter fields in each note |
| Schema & view config | Frontmatter of `_database.md` |
| Embed view configs | Frontmatter of the hosting note |

Open any file in any text editor and your data is right there.

## Requirements

- Obsidian `1.8.7` or later
- Desktop and mobile supported
