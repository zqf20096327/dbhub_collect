## How QuickStack Compares

QuickStack is a self-hosted, Kubernetes-native alternative to platforms like [Coolify](https://coolify.io), [Dokku](https://dokku.com), [Dokploy](https://dokploy.com), [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io) and [CapRover](https://caprover.com). Under the hood, QuickStack installs and manages [K3s](https://docs.k3s.io/), a lightweight Kubernetes distribution, together with [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/docs/latest/what-is-longhorn/) for distributed persistent storage across nodes. This gives you proven Kubernetes primitives such as scheduling, services, ingress, persistent volumes, jobs, probes and multi-node orchestration through a simple web interface for day-to-day deployments.

## About

QuickStack was originally developed as a student project by [glueh-wyy-huet](https://github.com/glueh-wyy-huet) and [biersoeckli](https://github.com/biersoeckli) at the [Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences](https://ost.ch/). Since then, new features have been added to make QuickStack a powerful and user-friendly platform for self-hosting.
