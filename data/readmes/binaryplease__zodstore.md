# zodstore

A native **SQLite + Zod** document-store library for Bun. Zod is the gatekeeper;
SQLite (`bun:sqlite`) is the synchronous, in-process engine. No migrations, no ORM —
the shape lives in Zod, the rows live in SQLite.

## Design

### Core

- **Zod is the gatekeeper.** Every document is validated on the way in and re-parsed
  on the way out. Everything that crosses the boundary is validated.
- **Nothing is written that cannot be read back as it was written.** The write gate
  refuses a document whose stored JSON its own schema would reject, or would re-parse
  into something different — see [the write gate](#the-write-gate).
- **One fixed table per collection:** `(id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, doc TEXT NOT NULL)`. The
  shape lives in Zod, so there are **no migrations** — old rows read forward via schema
  defaults, because every non-identity field declares a `.default(...)`.
- **`json_extract` expression indexes** for declared index fields; filters compile to
  matching predicates.
- **`bun:sqlite`, synchronous, in-process.** Native API, a real typed where-clause,
  transactions, `count`, and batch operations.

### Joins

Batched populate is the default join API:

- **`findByIds(ids)`** — one `IN` query, gated and deduped.
- **`populate(parents, foreignKey, target, as)`** — a resolver over `findByIds` that
  dedups ids (each referenced doc is parsed once) and emits `null` for missing refs.
- **`ref(prefix)`** — a schema helper so references are typed and validated at the gate.

## Install

`@binaryplease/zodstore` is a Bun-native library. Zod is a peer dependency, so
install both:

```bash
bun add @binaryplease/zodstore zod
```

It imports `bun:sqlite`, so it runs under Bun only — not Node.

The package ships TypeScript sources rather than a compiled bundle: `exports` points
at `src/index.ts`, which Bun imports directly and which is also where the types come
from. There is no build step to run and no `dist/` to configure.

## Quick start

```ts
import { z } from "zod";
import { createStore, populate, ref } from "@binaryplease/zodstore";

// Schemas are the single source of truth. Every non-identity field declares a
// default so old rows read forward without migration.
const UserSchema = z.object({
  id: ref("user"),                       // identity — required, fails loudly if absent
  name: z.string().default(""),
  age: z.number().default(0),
  active: z.boolean().default(true),
  nickname: z.string().nullable().default(null),
});

const PostSchema = z.object({
  id: ref("post"),
  authorId: ref("user"),                 // typed, validated foreign key
  title: z.string().default(""),
  views: z.number().default(0),
});

const store = createStore({ path: "data.sqlite" }); // omit path for an in-memory store

const users = store.collection("users", UserSchema, {
  indexes: ["age", { fields: ["active"], unique: false }],
});
const posts = store.collection("posts", PostSchema, { indexes: ["authorId"] });

users.insert({ id: "user_alice", name: "Alice", age: 30 });
posts.insert({ id: "post_1", authorId: "user_alice", title: "Hello" });
```

### Reads, writes, and a typed where-clause

```ts
users.get("user_alice");                 // → full document, or null

users.find({
  where: { active: true, age: { gte: 18, lt: 65 } },
  orderBy: { field: "age", direction: "desc" },
  limit: 20,
  offset: 0,
});

users.findOne({ where: { name: "Alice" } });
users.count({ active: true });
users.validate();                        // → [{ id, error }] for rows the schema now rejects

users.update("user_alice", { age: 31 }); // shallow-merge + re-validate; null if absent
users.replace("user_alice", { id: "user_alice", name: "Alice II" });
users.upsert({ id: "user_bob", name: "Bob" });
users.delete("user_alice");              // → boolean
users.deleteMany({ active: false });     // → number removed
```

Where-clause operators: `eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `in`, `notIn`, `contains`,
`startsWith`, `endsWith`, `like`, `isNull`. A bare value is shorthand for `eq`. `null`
(or `{ eq: null }`) compiles to `IS NULL`; `{ ne: null }` / `{ isNull: false }` to
`IS NOT NULL`. A `Date` operand binds as the ISO string it is stored as, so a
range query over a `dateParser` field — `{ at: { gt: new Date("2026-01-01") } }` —
and an `orderBy` over it answer chronologically; an invalid `Date`, or one
outside years 0000–9999 (whose expanded ISO form would not order against stored
timestamps — `dateParser` refuses to store one either), is refused naming the
operator or field at fault.

**An operand that cannot be compared is refused, not answered with an empty result.** A
filter that quietly matches nothing reads exactly like a truthful "no rows", so the
operand is named instead: `NaN` (which is what `Number(badQueryParam)` produces, and which
binds as SQL `NULL`), a non-boolean `isNull` (`"false"` is what `?isNull=false` yields
before anything parses it, and it used to select the rows it was written to exclude), a
`null` operand to `gt`/`gte`/`lt`/`lte` (a range comparison against no value has no
answer — `isNull` or `eq: null` is the spelling that does), and a non-string operand to
`contains`/`startsWith`/`endsWith`/`like` (a pattern is text; `LIKE NULL` is `NULL` for
every row). `Infinity` and `-Infinity`
pass: they bind as numbers and order against every stored value, so `{ age: { lt:
Infinity } }` is the "any number" filter it looks like.

### `ne` and `notIn` keep the null-valued rows

**A row with no value is excluded from the named *set*, not from the *answer*.** `ne` and
`notIn` are total over the nullable domain: a `null` is not the value you named, so it
comes back.

```ts
users.insert({ id: "user_1", nickname: "mine" });
users.insert({ id: "user_2", nickname: null });

users.find({ where: { nickname: { ne: "mine" } } });        // → [user_2]
users.find({ where: { nickname: { notIn: ["mine"] } } });   // → [user_2]
users.deleteMany({ nickname: { ne: "keep" } });             // removes both, not just user_1
```

This is not what raw SQL does — `NULL <> 'mine'` and `NULL NOT IN ('mine')` are both
*unknown*, which a `WHERE` drops — so the compiled predicate names the null case
explicitly (`(expr IS NULL OR expr <> ?)`). Until it did, the null-valued rows vanished
from every exclusion filter and survived every `deleteMany` built on one (F042). Two
consequences of that, both deliberate:

- **A stored `null` and an absent key are the same thing here.** `json_extract` returns SQL
  `NULL` for a JSON `null` and for a key that is not in the document, so `eq: null`,
  `isNull: true`, `ne` and `notIn` cannot tell them apart and do not try. A field added by
  an extended schema reads as absent on every row written before it existed, and reads as
  `null` under these operators — see
  [Forward compatibility](#forward-compatibility-no-migrations).
- **A `null` inside an `in`/`notIn` list names that same "no value".** It is a member of
  the set rather than a bound parameter nothing can equal, so `in: [null]` means
  `eq: null`, `notIn: [null]` means `ne: null`, and `notIn: ["mine", null]` returns the
  rows that are neither `"mine"` nor unset. The two operators are exact complements of one
  another at every list shape.

`eq: null`, `ne: null` and `isNull` are unchanged. `NOT` is still SQL's `NOT` over whatever
it wraps — see [`OR` and `NOT`](#or-and-not).

### An absent value narrows

**A condition whose value is `undefined` matches nothing.** Filters get built from state
that may not be loaded yet, and the alternative — dropping the condition — turns a filter
into its opposite:

```ts
const currentUser: string | undefined = undefined;      // session not loaded yet

cases.find({ where: { assignee: currentUser } });       // → [] , not every case
cases.count({ assignee: currentUser });                 // → 0
cases.deleteMany({ assignee: currentUser });            // → 0 rows deleted, not all of them
```

The rule holds wherever the value goes missing: in an operator object
(`{ age: { gte: undefined } }`), beside a live sibling (`{ status: "open", assignee:
undefined }` matches nothing rather than every open case), and in an operator object that
names no operator at all:

```ts
const minimumAge: number | undefined = undefined;       // the facet is cleared

// the idiomatic optional filter — `{ age: {} }` when the bound is not supplied
users.find({ where: { age: { ...(minimumAge !== undefined && { gte: minimumAge }) } } });
// → [] , the same answer as `{ age: { gte: undefined } }`
```

**A gap can never be negated into a match.** A clause carrying a missing value anywhere
below it compiles to "no rows" under `NOT` rather than being negated, at any depth:

```ts
// "delete everything except mine and the unassigned" — the retention shape
cases.deleteMany({ NOT: { OR: [{ assignee: currentUser }, { assignee: null }] } });
// → 0 rows deleted while `currentUser` is unset, not "everything except the unassigned"
```

That case is worth stating separately because the disjunction is still a *usable* filter in
positive position — `OR: [{ assignee: currentUser }, { assignee: null }]` returns the
unassigned rows, and keeping that is deliberate. Negation inverts it: the branch that
narrowed the disjunction widens its complement by exactly the rows the missing condition
existed to protect. So whether a clause is usable and whether it is safe to negate are two
different questions, and `NOT` asks the stricter one. An *explicit* `OR: []` decided "no
rows" with nothing missing, so `NOT: { OR: [] }` still matches every row.

To mean "no filter", say so: omit `where`, or pass `{}`. Only a clause that names no key
at all matches everything, which is what keeps `deleteMany({})` meaningful.

To make a condition genuinely optional, leave the key out rather than setting it to
`undefined`:

```ts
const where = { status: "open", ...(assignee !== undefined && { assignee }) };
```

### Substring matching

`contains`, `startsWith`, and `endsWith` **escape their operand**: `%` and `_` are
ordinary characters in names, paths, and case references, and a search box that turns
`%` into a full-collection scan is a cheap way to make a server unresponsive.

```ts
users.find({ where: { name: { contains: "50%" } } });   // matches a literal "50%"
users.find({ where: { name: { startsWith: "Al" } } });
```

`like` is the raw escape hatch and means what SQL means — the operand *is* the pattern,
wildcards and all. It compiles with `ESCAPE '\'`, so an expert can still match a literal:

```ts
users.find({ where: { name: { like: "A%" } } });        // wildcard, as written
users.find({ where: { name: { like: "%\\%%" } } });     // a literal "%" anywhere
users.find({ where: { name: { like: "C:\\\\%" } } });   // a literal backslash, doubled
```

Because `\` is the escape character, a **literal backslash in a `like` pattern must be
doubled** — an undoubled one escapes the character after it. `contains`, `startsWith`,
and `endsWith` do that for you; only the raw `like` operand is yours to escape.

None of these can use an index — a `json_extract` expression index serves equality and
range, and a leading-wildcard `LIKE` cannot use one at all. A substring filter scans, so
pair it with a `limit` on a large collection.

### Nested paths

Anywhere a field is named — `where`, `orderBy`, and `indexes` — a **dotted path** into a
nested object works and is typed, up to three levels (`a`, `a.b`, `a.b.c`). A typo is a
compile error rather than a clause that silently matches nothing:

```ts
const PlaceSchema = z.object({
  id: ref("place"),
  address: z
    .object({
      city: z.string().default(""),
      geo: z.object({ zone: z.string().default("") }).default({ zone: "" }),
    })
    .default({ city: "", geo: { zone: "" } }),
});

const places = store.collection("places", PlaceSchema, { indexes: ["address.city"] });

places.find({
  where: { "address.city": "Berlin", "address.geo.zone": { in: ["east"] } },
  orderBy: { field: "address.city" },
});
```

The three-level bound is a compile-time budget, not a runtime one: deeper paths still
work through `compileWhere`/`jsonExtract` directly, they are simply not offered by the
typed surface, where unbounded recursion would blow TypeScript's instantiation limit.

### Index names and redefinition

An index is named after its field list alone — `idx_<table>_<fields>`, with a literal
`_` doubled, a `.` written `_dot_` and `_and_` between two fields, so no two field lists
can produce one name. `["status"]` is `idx_notes_status`; `["address.city"]` is
`idx_places_address_dot_city`. The name is a pure function of the fields, so reopening a
collection with a declaration it already carries creates nothing. An index name is
scoped to the database rather than to one table, so on the rare shapes where two
collections derive onto the same name the open throws instead of quietly creating
nothing.

`unique` is deliberately not part of the name, so declaring the same fields once
non-unique and once unique is a **redefinition, and it throws**:

```ts
store.collection("things", schema, { indexes: ["email"] });
store.collection("things", schema, { indexes: [{ fields: ["email"], unique: true }] });
// throws: index "idx_things_email" over (email) already exists as a non-unique index …
//         Run DROP INDEX "main"."idx_things_email" and reopen if the change is intended.
```

Dropping a UNIQUE index takes away a constraint the application may still believe it
has, and adding one can fail against rows already stored; neither is decided quietly on
the caller's behalf. An index a version up to `0.4.2` wrote under the older, lossy name
is adopted on the next open — recreated under the current name, then dropped — so an
existing file ends up with one index per declaration and no migration to run.

### `OR` and `NOT`

Sibling keys of a `where` are joined with `AND`. Two reserved keys combine clauses
instead of naming a field, and they nest:

```ts
users.find({
  where: { active: true, OR: [{ nickname: "mine" }, { nickname: null }] },
  orderBy: { field: "age", direction: "desc" },
  limit: 20,
});

users.find({ where: { NOT: { OR: [{ age: { lt: 30 } }, { age: { gt: 40 } }] } } });
```

The `orderBy` and `limit` above apply across the whole union — the property two `find()`
calls merged in JavaScript cannot give you, because you cannot page a union assembled
after the fact.

**A combinator fails closed.** An empty `OR: []` matches nothing, as an empty `in` does,
and so does a *branch* that carries no condition:

```ts
const currentUser: string | undefined = undefined;      // session not loaded yet
cases.find({ where: { OR: [{ assignee: currentUser }, { assignee: null }] } });
// → the unassigned rows only. The empty branch matches nothing rather than everything.
```

An empty `NOT: {}` matches nothing for the same reason, by the other route: it negates a
clause that matches everything.

`NOT` is SQL's `NOT`, with SQL's three-valued logic: `NOT { name: "Ann" }` does not match
a row whose `name` is `null`, because `null = 'Ann'` is unknown rather than false. Say
`{ OR: [{ NOT: { name: "Ann" } }, { name: null }] }` when you want the nulls too.

The keys are uppercase so they cannot be mistaken for fields, and `store.collection(...)`
refuses an **object** schema carrying a field named `OR` or `NOT` — including one under a
wrapper that hides its `.shape`, such as `.transform()`, `.pipe()`, `.brand()` or
`.default()`, and on both sides of a `.pipe()`.

That guard is a **strong default rather than a proof**, so do not name a field `OR` or
`NOT`. Two cases are left: a `.transform()` that *adds or renames* a field declares its
output in a function body, which no reader can see into, and a schema whose fields are not
one readable shape — a union of object schemas, an intersection — contributes no names and
only reaches a collection under `{ enforceDefaults: false }`
(see [Forward compatibility](#forward-compatibility-no-migrations)). In both, the field
names are yours to keep clear of these two.

A `where` is a nested, JSON-shaped structure, and it is a plain TypeScript type rather
than a Zod schema — the deliberate in-process exception to Zod owning every shape,
because a `where` is assembled from already-validated input. **Never pass an unvalidated request
body as `where`** — parse it into the shape your handler intends first.

### The result ceiling

A `find()` with no `limit` selects every matching row and parses each one through Zod
into memory. That read is legitimate — an export job wants every row — but it should be
*chosen*, not defaulted into, so it is capped at `maxRows` (default `10_000`) and
**throws rather than truncates** when the cap is exceeded: a silently truncated result
is a wrong answer.

```ts
createStore({ maxRows: 50_000 });        // raise it
createStore({ maxRows: null });          // disable it
users.find({ limit: 100, offset: 0 });   // an explicit bound is the caller's own
// otherwise: find() on "users" returned more than maxRows (10000). Pass an explicit
// limit, paginate, or raise/disable maxRows on the store.
```

### When a stored row no longer parses

Reads re-parse, so a schema change that is *not* an added defaulted field — tightening
a type, narrowing an enum — can strand a row written under the old schema. The default
policy is to throw, naming the row:

```
Collection "docs": stored row "p_2" does not match the current schema. …
```

The blast radius is that row, not the collection. Two ways past it:

```ts
store.collection("docs", Schema, { onParseError: "skip" });
// find()/findByIds() omit the row, get() returns null, findOne() steps over it
// to the first readable match. The row is still there.

store.collection("docs", Schema).validate();
// → [{ id: "p_2", error: ZodError }] — reads only, throws nothing, streams the table.
```

`validate()` is the repair primitive: it turns "the collection is broken" into a list of
ids to act on, without dropping to `store.database` and hand-written SQL.

**`"skip"` is a read-for-repair mode, not a paging mode.** The filter runs *after* SQL
has applied `LIMIT`, so a page containing a skipped row comes back short:

```ts
// rows p_1 (stale), p_2, p_3 under { onParseError: "skip" }
docs.find();              // → [p_2, p_3]
docs.find({ limit: 2 });  // → [p_2]      ← a short page, not an error
docs.findOne();           // → p_2        ← steps over p_1 to the first readable match
docs.count();             // → 3          ← count() answers from SQL, Zod uncalled
```

The short page is a deliberate cost: `limit`/`offset` page over *stored* rows, and paging
over readable rows instead would make every page's `offset` require parsing the whole
table ahead of it. `findOne()` is the exception, because there is no page to keep
consistent — it streams to the first readable match, so a `null` still means "no match"
rather than "the first match was skipped".

Use it to read past damage while `validate()` tells you what to repair, then go back to
`"throw"`. Writes never skip: `update()` on a row whose stored JSON is malformed throws,
naming the collection and the row, whatever the policy says.

### Batched joins

```ts
const allPosts = posts.find();
const withAuthors = populate(allPosts, "authorId", users, "author");
// withAuthors[i].author is a fully-parsed user document, or null for a missing ref.

users.findByIds(["user_alice", "user_bob", "user_alice"]); // deduped, order-preserving
```

`populate` resolves every distinct reference in a single `findByIds` query, so each
target document is fetched and parsed exactly once. Missing references become an
explicit `null` key, never a dropped property: nullish properties are emitted, so a
caller always sees the full shape.

### Transactions

```ts
store.transaction(() => {
  users.insert({ id: "user_carol" });
  posts.insert({ id: "post_2", authorId: "user_carol" });
}); // committed on return, rolled back if the body throws

users.insertMany([{ id: "user_d" }, { id: "user_e" }]); // atomic batch insert
```

`store.transaction` covers **the connection it was called on and no other**. A callback
that also writes through a collection of a *different* store is only half inside a
transaction: the other store's write commits on its own statement, and a throw rolls
back this half while leaving that one behind. There is no ordering of the two writes
that makes them atomic — reverse them and the surviving row is the other one.

### Cross-store transactions

`transactionAcross` is the primitive for work that spans two files. It attaches every
store's database to a single connection, so one transaction covers all of them:

```ts
const orders = createStore({ path: "orders.sqlite" });
const inventory = createStore({ path: "inventory.sqlite" });

transactionAcross([orders, inventory], ([ordersTx, inventoryTx]) => {
  inventoryTx.collection("stockLevels", StockLevelSchema).update("stk_widget", { onHand: 41 });
  ordersTx.collection("orders", OrderSchema).insert({ id: "ord_1" });
}); // both files committed on return, both rolled back if the body throws
```

The callback gets one handle per store, in the order the stores were given, and **only
those handles are inside the transaction**. A collection opened on the outer `orders`
or `inventory` object writes on that store's own connection — it does not get to do so
quietly, because the transaction holds the write lock on every file it spans, so such a
write waits out its `busyTimeoutMs` and then throws `database is locked`. The handles
stop working once the transaction returns.

> ([`lang_attach.html`](https://sqlite.org/lang_attach.html)) — and WAL is this library's

What it refuses, all before anything is opened:

| Refused | Why |
| --- | --- |
| An empty list | A store left out is a write outside the transaction. |
| A store `createStore` did not open | The file behind it is unknown, so it cannot be attached. |
| An in-memory store, in any position | `ATTACH ':memory:'` opens a *second*, empty database rather than reaching the store's — every write would land there and vanish at close. |
| The same file twice (symlinks resolved) | One file attached twice is two writers on one connection, which deadlocks against itself. |
| More than 11 stores | `SQLITE_LIMIT_ATTACHED` is 10 and one store is the connection's own `main`. |
| A set whose `journalMode`s disagree | The mixed set would silently give every file WAL's guarantee, including to a caller who took the escape hatch above. |

The transaction runs on a connection of its own, under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, so it takes
every write lock up front and contention fails before anything is written rather than
halfway through. `busy_timeout` is per-connection, so that wait is `stores[0]`'s
`busyTimeoutMs`; a write attempted through an *outer* store while the transaction is
open waits out that store's own.

### WAL checkpoints

```ts
store.checkpoint();                      // PASSIVE — what SQLite's auto-checkpoint does
store.checkpoint("TRUNCATE");            // → { busy, log, checkpointed }; sidecar back to zero bytes
```

In WAL mode SQLite lets the `-wal` sidecar grow to a high-water mark and then
reuses it in place, so a long-lived writer can sit behind a sidecar far larger than
the database itself even though no frames are outstanding. `TRUNCATE` is the mode
that actually reclaims that space. `PASSIVE` (the default) copies what it can
without blocking; `FULL` and `RESTART` sit between the two.

The result is SQLite's own row: `busy` is 1 if a reader or writer blocked the
checkpoint, `log` the frames still in the WAL, `checkpointed` the frames copied back
into the main database. A database that is not in WAL mode — an in-memory store, or
one opened with `journalMode: "DELETE"` — answers with `-1` counts rather than
failing, so the call is safe to make unconditionally.

`close()` already checkpoints and removes the `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars, so a process
that is exiting cleanly needs nothing extra. Reach for `checkpoint("TRUNCATE")` when
the handle *stays open* but the file should shrink — before copying a database file
somewhere, for instance.

## Forward compatibility (no migrations)

Because every non-identity field declares a `.default(...)`, you extend a schema by
appending a defaulted field — no migration, no backfill. Rows written under the old
schema parse cleanly under the new one, with the default filling the gap at read time:

```ts
// v1 wrote: { id: "user_legacy", name: "Legacy" }
const UsersV2 = z.object({
  id: ref("user"),
  name: z.string().default(""),
  role: z.enum(["admin", "member"]).default("member"), // new field
});
store.collection("users", UsersV2).get("user_legacy");
// → { id: "user_legacy", name: "Legacy", role: "member" }
```

Identity fields (`id`, foreign keys) carry no default and fail loudly when absent —
a fabricated id is worse than a missing one. They are the honest exception to the
default rule, and the exemption survives the wrappers that leave a foreign key's
identity intact, so a nullable relation is written as it reads:

```ts
z.object({ id: ref("post"), authorId: ref("user").nullable() });   // accepted, no default
```

`.nullable()`, `.optional()`, `.describe()`, `.brand()` and `.refine()` all keep it. A
`.default(...)` on a reference ends it: a defaulted foreign key invents a reference to a
row that may not exist, so it is held to the ordinary rule — which it passes, because it
declares a default.

Prefer `.nullable()` over `.optional()` for a stored reference. Both are accepted, but an
absent `.optional()` is dropped from the row by `JSON.stringify`, so the stored key set
varies row to row — the incompleteness the rule below exists to prevent — while
`.nullable()` stores the explicit `null` you want anyway.

Reopening a collection may extend the schema and may declare further indexes, which are
cumulative across handles. It may **not** change `idField`: identity is what the stored
rows are keyed and shaped by, so a conflicting reopen throws instead of writing two
conventions into one table.

```ts
store.collection("ks", z.object({ id: ref("k") }));
store.collection("ks", z.object({ slug: ref("k") }), { idField: "slug" });
// throws: collection("ks"): already open with idField "id", cannot reopen with "slug".
```

The check is case-insensitive, because SQLite identifiers are — `"KS"` and `"ks"` are one
table and so one binding.

It **survives a close**. The binding a handle records lives in memory, so a second
connection — a redeployed process opening a file that already holds rows — starts without
it; the convention is therefore also read back off the rows themselves, because every
write stores the id column as `document[idField]`. A reopen whose `idField` is not what a
stored row is keyed by is refused the same way, naming the field the rows carry:

```ts
// a fresh process, on a file the snippet above wrote
store.collection("ks", z.object({ slug: ref("k") }), { idField: "slug" });
// throws: collection("ks"): stored rows are keyed by idField "id", cannot reopen with "slug".
```

Nothing of this library's is written to the file to make that work — there is no metadata
table — so the guard answers on files that already exist, and on exactly the evidence the
rows carry. An **empty** table carries none, so there the in-process binding is the whole
of the check.

That rule is **enforced, not documented**: `store.collection(...)` walks an object
schema at creation and refuses a non-identity field with no `.default(...)`,
naming the field. A field with no default is not merely un-forward-compatible — its
`undefined` is dropped by `JSON.stringify`, so the key disappears from the stored row
entirely and the key set varies row to row, which is exactly the incompleteness a
stored document must never have. Pass
`{ enforceDefaults: false }` for a deliberate exception.

The object schema is found through whatever wraps it — `.transform()`, `.pipe()`,
`.brand()`, `.default()`, `z.lazy()` — so a wrapper cannot switch the rule off without
saying so. A schema that declares no fields of its own (`z.string()`,
`z.record(z.string(), z.string())`) has nothing of its own to enforce and is skipped,
though the walk still descends into what a container *stores* — see the boundary below. A
schema whose fields are **not one readable shape** — a union of object schemas, an
intersection — is *refused*, because enforcing nothing there would be a rule reporting a
check it never ran:

```ts
store.collection("variants", z.union([DraftSchema, FinalSchema]));
// throws: the schema's fields cannot be read as one shape …
store.collection("variants", z.union([DraftSchema, FinalSchema]), { enforceDefaults: false });
// accepted — the schema's fields are now yours to hold to the rule
```

### How deep the walk goes

The guard's reach *is* the guarantee's reach, so its boundary is stated here rather than
left to be rediscovered. The walk is **recursive**: a default on an enclosing object does
not cover its members, because a row that already stores the object is parsed against
every one of them. The error names the full path.

```ts
// v1 wrote: { id: "s_old", settings: { theme: "light" } }
store.collection("s", z.object({
  id: ref("s"),
  settings: z.object({ theme: z.string().default("light"), fontSize: z.number() })
             .default({ theme: "light", fontSize: 14 }),
}));
// throws: field "settings.fontSize" has no default …
// — refused here, rather than accepted and then failing every read of an old row.
```

| Where the walk goes | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| A declared field, at any depth | Held to the rule, then descended into — `settings.fontSize` |
| What a container stores — an array's elements, a tuple's declared positions **and its `rest` tail**, a record's values, an object's **`.catchall()`** keys | Descended into: each is a schema an already-stored value is parsed against, whether or not a declared field name reaches it — `tags[].color`, `pair[0].x`, `pair[].x` (the tail), `prefs.<key>.size`, `bag.<key>.size` (the catchall) |
| A `ref()` foreign key | Exempt **at any depth** — identity-shaped wherever it sits |
| A member named like `idField` | Exempt **only at the top level**: that name is the column the rows are keyed by, so a nested `id` is an ordinary field and needs a default — declare a recursive document's identity with `ref()`, which is exempt wherever the cycle reaches it |
| A nested union or intersection | *Refused*, naming the field, on the same terms as a top-level one |
| A shape the walk has already seen | Skipped — this is what lets a self-referential schema terminate; its members were held to the rule where they were first reached |
| A `z.map()` or `z.set()`'s contents | **Skipped on purpose**: neither survives the write gate's JSON round-trip, so no such field reaches storage and there is no stored member to read forward |
| Nesting more than 10 levels deep | *Refused*: a `z.lazy()` can hand back a fresh schema on every call, which no seen-shape check catches, so the walk is bounded — and it refuses at the bound rather than enforcing nothing past it |

Where the `z.lazy()` sits decides which of the last two rows a recursive schema
lands in, and the error message cannot say so — put it around the *reference*, not
around the object:

```ts
const Node = z.object({                                  // one shape, walked once
  id: ref("n"), name: z.string().default(""),
  children: z.lazy(() => z.array(Node)).default([]),     // accepted
});
const Node = z.lazy(() => z.object({                     // a fresh shape per call
  id: ref("n"), name: z.string().default(""),
  children: z.array(Node).default([]),                   // refused at the depth bound
}));
```

Because it defaults to `true`, this is a **breaking change for an existing schema**:
every optional field without a default throws at `store.collection(...)` rather
than silently vanishing from storage — and, since the walk recurses, every *nested* one
does too, including a schema that opened cleanly under an earlier version of this library.
Expect a batch of these the first time an existing
consumer upgrades; fix them at the schema, or pass `{ enforceDefaults: false }` to stage
the migration.

## The write gate

Reads re-parse the stored JSON, so a document is only storable if its stored form
survives that trip intact. Every write asserts both halves and throws, naming the
collection, if either fails:

1. **The stored form must pass the schema.** `z.date()` does not: it is written as an
   ISO string and rejected by its own schema on the way back, leaving a row that no
   read can ever return. Declare timestamps with **`dateParser`** — a `Date` passes
   through, an ISO string is rehydrated into a `Date`.
2. **The stored form must parse back to itself, by type as well as by value.** A
   schema whose parse *rewrites* an already-parsed value (`z.number().transform((n) =>
   n + 1)`) would drift on every read and compound on every update. Transforms and
   coercions are fine as long as they are idempotent — `z.coerce.number()` and
   `.toUpperCase()` are, `+ 1` is not. The comparison is structural, not a byte
   comparison, so it also catches a value whose *type* changes while its bytes do
   not: a `Date` under `z.record(…, z.unknown())` or `z.union([z.string(), z.date()])`
   serialises to a string the schema happily accepts and then reads back as a
   `String`. Store it as `dateParser`, or as the string it reads back as.

A refusal names the **field paths** that failed and never the values at them:
documents are consumer data, and an uncaught throw would otherwise put whole records
into a log.

```ts
const EventSchema = z.object({
  id: ref("evt"),
  at: dateParser.default(() => new Date()),   // stored "2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", read as a Date
  note: z.string().default(""),
});

store.collection("events", z.object({ id: ref("evt"), at: z.date().default(new Date(0)) }))
  .insert({ id: "evt_1", at: new Date() });
// throws: Collection "events": document does not survive a JSON round-trip …
```

The cost is one extra parse per write. It buys the property the store's whole premise
rests on: what a read returns is what a write stored, on every read, forever.

`update(id, patch)` merges the patch into the **stored** document rather than into the
parsed result of a read (parsed output is `z.output`; feeding it back as `z.input`
re-applies the schema), and runs the whole read-merge-write inside a `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`
transaction, so it holds the write lock across both statements. A second connection
racing the same row waits out its `busyTimeoutMs` and then fails loudly — it never has
its committed change silently overwritten. `replace` takes the write lock the same way.

**A patch key holding `undefined` is not supplied**, and leaves the stored value alone —
the same reading a `where` gives an absent value, so a patch built from optional inputs
cannot erase a field it never mentioned:

```ts
users.update("user_alice", { name: form.name, age: 31 });  // form.name?: string
// → age is 31; name keeps whatever was stored, even when form.name is undefined
```

To *clear* a field, name the value you want it cleared to — `{ nickname: null }` on a
nullable field, or the empty value the schema takes. This matters because every
non-identity field carries a `.default(...)`: were an `undefined` assigned, `JSON.stringify`
would drop the key and that default would quietly refill it, replacing a stored value with
no error and no trace. The rule covers `ref()` foreign keys too — an `undefined` there
keeps the stored reference instead of failing the parse.

`replace(id, input)` is the wholesale form and is unaffected: it is a whole new document,
so a field omitted there does take its schema default. Under the default
`enforceDefaults: true` that is a convenience; under `{ enforceDefaults: false }` it is the
**only** way to clear a field that declares no default, since such a field rests at
`undefined` and `update()` has no value left to name.

## API

| Export | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `createStore(options?)` | Open a store over one `bun:sqlite` database. `{ path?, journalMode?, synchronous?, busyTimeoutMs?, maxRows? }` — defaults `"WAL"` / `"NORMAL"` / `5000` / `10_000`. |
| `store.collection(name, schema, options?)` | Define/reopen a collection. `{ idField?, indexes?, enforceDefaults?, onParseError?, maxRows? }` — `enforceDefaults` defaults to `true`, `onParseError` to `"throw"`. |
| `collection.validate()` | List the stored rows the current schema rejects, as `{ id, error }`. Reads only. |
| `store.transaction(work)` | Run `work` in a single transaction — over **this store's connection only**. |
| `transactionAcross(stores, work)` | Run `work` in one transaction spanning several stores, over a connection that attaches each store's file. `work` receives one handle per store, positionally; only those handles are inside. Up to 11 file-backed stores, all in the same `journalMode`. Atomic commit needs a non-WAL one — see above. |
| `store.checkpoint(mode?)` | Run a WAL checkpoint — `"PASSIVE"` (default), `"FULL"`, `"RESTART"`, `"TRUNCATE"`. `TRUNCATE` reclaims the `-wal` sidecar. Returns `{ busy, log, checkpointed }`. |
| `store.database` | The underlying `bun:sqlite` `Database` (escape hatch). |
| `store.close()` | Close the connection. |
| `createCollection(database, name, schema, options?)` | Lower-level collection factory. |
| `populate(parents, foreignKey, target, as)` | Batched reference resolver. |
| `ref(prefix)` | Zod schema for a typed `prefix_…` reference. |
| `dateParser` | Zod schema for a timestamp that survives storage — accepts a `Date` or an ISO string, always yields a `Date`. |
| `compileWhere` / `compileOrderBy` / `compileLimitOffset` / `jsonExtract` | SQL-fragment helpers (advanced). `compileWhere` and `compileLimitOffset` return `{ sql, parameters }` — their values bind rather than interpolate, so concatenate the parameters in the order the fragments appear in the statement. `compileOrderBy` and `jsonExtract` return a `string`. |

## Development

You need [Bun](https://bun.sh). [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) is optional and
runs the same tasks CI does:

```bash
bun install
mise run typecheck        # bunx tsc --noEmit
mise run test             # bun test
mise run build            # bundle src/index.ts → dist/
mise run ci               # typecheck + test — the gate
```

Without mise, `bunx tsc --noEmit` and `bun test` are the same two steps. There is
also a Nix flake with a dev shell (`nix develop`) providing Bun and mise.

[`.github/workflows/check.yml`](.github/workflows/check.yml) runs `mise run ci` on
every pull request and every push to `main`. It calls that task rather than
re-spelling its steps, so the gate has one definition.
