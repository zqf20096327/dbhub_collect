## FAQ
Q: Why does the MacOS device installation show as damaged?

A: macOS adds an attribute called com.apple.quarantine to apps that are not notarized when downloading or installing them. This command is used to manually remove that attribute. Run sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/blinko.app
