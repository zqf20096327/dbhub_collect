A self-hosted ebook library server that knows how you read -- not just what you own.

Most library servers stop at file management. Tome connects to your e-reader via a custom [KOReader](https://koreader.rocks) plugin, records every reading session with page-level granularity, syncs positions bidirectionally between device and browser, and turns all of it into stats that get sharper the more you read.

Built with FastAPI, React, and SQLite. Ships as a single Docker image.

## Highlights

- **TomeSync** -- custom KOReader plugin records reading sessions, syncs positions bidirectionally (device to web, web to device), and works fully offline. This is what makes Tome different. Use a current KOReader release (v2024.07 or newer for all features). [Details](docs/koreader-plugin.md)
- **Reading stats** -- session tracking, streaks, time-of-day heatmaps, reading pace, completion estimates, genre trends, monthly comparisons, and per-book breakdowns -- all powered by real session data from your e-reader
- **Hardcover sync** -- push your ratings (half-stars included), progress, and finish dates to your [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app) profile. One-way, opt-in, per-user; nothing is ever deleted on Hardcover. If you don't know Hardcover yet: it's the indie, ad-free Goodreads alternative with a public API -- well worth a look even without Tome. [Details](https://tome.bndct.sh/docs/hardcover)
- **Metadata from 3 sources** -- fetch and compare metadata from [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app), Google Books, and OpenLibrary with a side-by-side diff UI
- **Built-in reader** -- EPUBs, manga (CBZ/CBR), and PDFs render directly in the browser. Two-page spread, RTL mode, webtoon scroll, pinch-to-zoom on mobile. [Details](docs/reader.md)
- **Bindery** -- an inbox for incoming books. Drop files in a folder, review pre-filled metadata, accept into your library. Optional auto-import on a schedule. [Details](docs/bindery-deployment.md)
- **Scribe** -- a Claude Code Skill for conversational batch ingest, metadata refresh, series-wide audits, and series-level annotation (arc breakdowns, publication status). Uses API tokens for auth and talks to Tome over HTTP. [Details](docs/scribe.md)
- **OPDS feed** -- browse and download from KOReader, Panels, Chunky, or any OPDS client
- **SSO (OIDC)** -- optional single sign-on against any OpenID Connect provider (Pocket ID, Authelia, Authentik, Keycloak, …) with group-to-role mapping and account linking. Local login always stays. [Details](docs/sso.md)
- **Themes** -- 3 built-in (light, dark, amber) plus fully custom themes via 10-value hex palette

Plus: series browsing with story arcs and publication status, bulk operations, libraries with icons, shelves (saved filters), Quick Connect (6-char code sign-in), OPDS PINs (e-ink-friendly passwords), role-based access control, per-user book visibility, user-level API tokens, audit logging, and a bulk import script.

## How is Tome different?

There are several self-hosted ebook tools — here's where Tome sits.

| | Tome | Calibre-Web | Komga | Kavita |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Reading session tracking** (time, pace, streaks from your e-reader) | ✅ via TomeSync plugin | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Bidirectional position sync** with KOReader | ✅ | partial (KOSync) | ❌ | partial |
| **Built-in EPUB + manga reader** | ✅ | ✅ | manga only | ✅ |
| **Stats / reading insights** | ✅ rich | minimal | minimal | minimal |
| **Single-binary deploy** | ✅ Docker, FastAPI + SQLite | requires Calibre install | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Comics & novels in one place** | ✅ | EPUB-focused | comics-focused | ✅ |
| **Maturity** | v1.0 | mature, dated UI | mature | mature |

Pick **Calibre-Web** if you want the largest ecosystem and don't mind the dated UI. **Komga** if you're comics/manga-only. **Kavita** if you want a featureful all-rounder. **Tome** if reading-session tracking and KOReader integration are what you actually want — that's what it's built around.

### Mobile

Tome works as a PWA on mobile. Pin it to your home screen for a native app feel.

### iPhone

Tome Reader is a native iPhone app for your Tome: pair with a QR code from
Settings → Quick Connect, browse the library and series, read EPUB and comics
offline, and keep progress and stats in sync. It is in **free beta until
31 December 2026** — [join it on TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/JrHyntNU).

The app is closed source and entirely optional. Tome never requires it, and
everything it does goes through the same public API any other client can use.

## Quick Start

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name tome \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v ./data:/data \
  -v ./books:/books \
  -v ./bindery:/bindery \
  ghcr.io/bndct-devops/tome:latest
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` and follow the setup wizard to create your admin account.

Or with Docker Compose -- the canonical `docker-compose.yml` in this repo is portable; clone and `docker compose up -d`. See `docs/examples/` for setups specific to Unraid and similar.

### Try it in 60 seconds

Want to kick the tires before committing it to your homelab? This installer spins Tome up in a fresh `~/Tome` folder on a free port and prints the URL -- all it needs is Docker installed and running:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tome.bndct.sh/install.sh | bash
```

Upload a book, click around, decide if it's for you. It uses a **fresh, empty** `~/Tome/books`, so nothing in your real library is touched. (It's a plain shell script -- read it first with `... | less` if you like.)

Didn't click? Remove every trace -- container, image, and folder:

```bash
cd ~/Tome && docker compose down             # stop + remove the container
docker rmi ghcr.io/bndct-devops/tome:latest  # drop the image
rm -rf ~/Tome                                 # delete data + the test books folder
```

Did click? **Don't run it on your laptop long-term.** Move `~/Tome` to an always-on box (NAS, mini-PC, that spare Pi) and point the `books` volume at your real library. A sleeping laptop is a poor host for KOReader sync and OPDS -- a box that's always up is where Tome belongs.

### Volumes

| Mount | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/data` | SQLite database and cover cache |
| `/books` | Ebook library (read-only is fine) |
| `/bindery` | Incoming folder for new books |

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PUID` / `PGID` | No | `1000` / `1000` | Host UID/GID the container runs as. Set to the owner of your mounts (Synology/QNAP/TrueNAS: your docker user; Unraid: `99`/`100`) |
| `TOME_SECRET_KEY` | Yes | -- | JWT signing secret |
| `TOME_DATA_DIR` | No | `/data` | DB and cover cache |
| `TOME_LIBRARY_DIR` | No | `/books` | Library root |
| `TOME_INCOMING_DIR` | No | `/bindery` | Bindery folder |
| `TOME_PORT` | No | `8080` | HTTP port |
| `TOME_PUBLIC_URL` | No | -- | Canonical public origin (e.g. `https://tome.example.org`). Pin this behind a reverse proxy so the KOReader plugin is baked with the correct `https://` URL |
| `TOME_HARDCOVER_TOKEN` | No | -- | [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app) API token for metadata |
| `TOME_AUTO_IMPORT` | No | `false` | Auto-import files from the bindery on a schedule |
| `TOME_AUTO_IMPORT_INTERVAL` | No | `300` | Seconds between auto-import scans |
| `TOME_SCAN_WORKERS` | No | `1` | Parallel scan workers (>1 = multi-process; ~60–80 MB each) |
| `TOME_KOSYNC_POSITION_BRIDGE` | No | `false` | Experimental: let TomeSync plugin devices pick up progress pushed by third-party KOSync clients (read-only bridge) |

## Translating

The web UI is translatable. English is the source and lives in the code;
every other language is a community-maintained catalog under
`frontend/src/locales/<code>/messages.po`, editable with any text editor or
[Poedit](https://poedit.net/). Anything not yet translated falls back to
English, so partial catalogs are fine to ship. To improve a language, fill in
the empty `msgstr` entries and open a pull request; to add one, see
[docs/translating.md](docs/translating.md) for the two-line setup. The
KOReader plugin and this website stay English for now.
