# Portscape

**Turn an nmap scan into a 3D city you can walk through.**

Every device on your network becomes a building. Height is the number of open ports,
colour is the risk band, and anything that wasn't there last time is marked on the ground.

## Why this exists

nmap tells you *what is open*. Portscape tells you *what that means*, and then makes it
something you can look at.

Most network tools hand you a table. A table of forty hosts is a table; a street of
forty buildings is a place — you notice the one that's taller than everything around it,
and you notice the one that wasn't there yesterday. The interesting engineering isn't
running nmap, it's the two layers on top:

- **A risk model with an opinion.** A device isn't dangerous because it has many ports
  open. It's dangerous because it has the *wrong* ports open. Telnet on 23 costs 35
  points; HTTPS on 443 costs 2. Every point carries a reason string, so the UI can
  answer "why 78?" instead of just showing the number.
- **Identity that survives DHCP.** Devices are tracked by MAC address, not by IP. A
  phone that moves from `.68` to `.70` overnight is the same phone — comparing by
  address turned every lease renewal into "a host vanished and a new one appeared",
  which is exactly the alarm this project exists to make trustworthy.

</p>

## Highlights

|   | |
|---|---|
| **Real CVEs, not guesses** | Cross-references detected service versions against the NVD, resolving the canonical CPE first — because nmap and NIST rarely agree on a product's name. Every port carries its own flaws: id, CVSS, severity, description and a link to the NIST record. |
| **CVSS in plain language** | `AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N` becomes *reachable from the network · works reliably · no account needed · no user action needed*. The score stops being a number you have to trust. |
| **Exploited in the wild** | CVEs are checked against the CISA KEV catalog. CVSS says how bad it *would* be; KEV says it *is happening*, and flags the ones used in ransomware campaigns. |
| **Baseline diffing** | Every scan is compared against a 7-day inventory, or against a snapshot you pin yourself. New and changed devices are marked in the city. |
| **Honest degradation** | If the NVD is unreachable the scan still completes, flagged `cveLookupDegraded`. "No CVEs found" and "couldn't check" are never shown as the same thing. |
| **Deterministic architecture** | A building's shape is derived from its IP and its MAC vendor, so the same device looks the same in every scan. A gateway is always a spire. |
| **Stoppable scans** | A `/24` with version detection takes minutes. Cancelling kills the nmap process itself, not just the job row — a cancel that leaves a scanner running is worse than no button at all, so there's a test that proves the process dies. |
| **Usable without a mouse** | Every device and scan card is a real button, the details modal is a proper dialog that traps and restores focus, and progress is announced rather than only drawn. Verified in a browser, not just in jsdom. |
| **442 tests** | 256 unit + 39 integration on the backend (Testcontainers, real PostgreSQL), 147 on the frontend. Every scoring rule, parser and layout calculation is covered. |

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Why |
|---|---|---|
| [Java](https://adoptium.net/) | 21+ | Runs the backend (Spring Boot) |
| [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) | 3.9+ | Builds and runs the backend |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) | 22+ | Runs the frontend (Vite) and the root dev scripts |
| [nmap](https://nmap.org/download.html) | 7.9+ | Does the actual scanning — must be on `PATH` |
| [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) | any recent | Runs PostgreSQL only — see note below |

Check what you already have:

```bash
java -version && mvn -version && node -v && nmap --version && docker --version
```

`make` is optional — only needed if you want `make dev` instead of `npm run dev`. It
ships with macOS and most Linux distributions; Windows doesn't have it by default, which
is exactly why `npm run dev` exists as the cross-platform option.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brunovieira88/PortScape.git
cd PortScape

npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts PostgreSQL (Docker), the backend (`http://localhost:8080`) and the
frontend (`http://localhost:5173`) together, with all three logs interleaved in one
terminal. Ctrl+C stops the backend and frontend; `npm run dev:down` stops the database.
On macOS or Linux, `make dev` does the same thing if you'd rather not touch npm for the
Java side.

Prefer three separate terminals (cleaner logs, easier to restart just one piece)?

```bash
docker compose up -d                    # PostgreSQL only — see note below
cd backend  && mvn spring-boot:run      # http://localhost:8080
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev   # http://localhost:5173
```

Then open http://localhost:5173, leave the target blank, and hit **Initiate Scan**.

> **The database runs in Docker; nmap does not.** On Docker Desktop for macOS,
> `--network host` is the LinuxKit VM rather than macOS itself — the scan reports hosts
> that don't exist on the real network. A silent wrong answer is worse than an error,
> so nmap runs natively on the host.

### Just want to look around, no install?

**[Live demo](https://brunovieira88.github.io/PortScape/)** — the sample city this
README's screenshots come from, running with every network call to the backend switched
off. `npm run build:demo` (from `frontend/`) builds the exact same thing locally; it's
what `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` deploys.

### Privileged scanning

The default configuration uses `-sS` (SYN scan) and `-O` (OS detection), which need
root. Without privileges the scan fails with `NMAP_PRIVILEGE` and a message explaining
the options.

```bash
sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/portscape-nmap
# <user> ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /opt/homebrew/Cellar/nmap/*/bin/nmap
```

```yaml
portscape:
  nmap:
    command: ["sudo", "-n", "/opt/homebrew/bin/nmap"]
```

Setting the setuid bit on nmap is *not* recommended: a setuid-root nmap lets anyone run
NSE scripts as root, and `brew upgrade` resets the permissions anyway.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[POST /api/scans] --> B[TargetValidator]
    B --> C[Phase 1: discovery<br/>privileged, -sS -O]
    C --> D[Phase 2: versions<br/>unprivileged, -sT -sV]
    D --> E[ScanResultMerger]

    G2 --> H[CityLayoutCalculator<br/>districts by risk band]
    H --> I[(PostgreSQL)]
    I --> J[React Three Fiber<br/>the city]
```

Scans are asynchronous — a `/24` takes minutes. `POST` returns `202` immediately and the
client polls `GET /api/scans/{id}`, which reports real progress parsed from nmap's own
task output.

### Why two nmap invocations

On macOS, running `-sV` as root makes nmap fail to bind its version probes
(`NSOCK ERROR mksock_bind_addr ... Invalid argument`) and *every* port comes back as
`tcpwrapped` — even an obvious SSH or HTTP. It doesn't depend on `-sS` vs `-sT`, or on
`-O`. It happens whenever `-sV` runs as root on this platform.

So the scan runs twice:

1. **Discovery** — privileged, configurable, no `-sV`. Finds hosts, ports and OS.
2. **Version detection** — unprivileged, fixed as `-sT -sV`, only against the hosts and
   ports phase 1 found open.

`ScanResultMerger` joins them field by field: ports and OS always come from phase 1;
service, product and version come from phase 2 when available. If phase 2 fails
entirely the scan still finishes `DONE`, just without versions — a weaker second pass
is not a reason to throw away the first.

## The risk model

Scores run 0–100 and saturate at the top. Every point has a reason attached.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshot-hologram.png" alt="The in-world info panel, floating over a CRITICAL host: score 100, four exposed Windows ports" width="100%">
  <br>
  <sub>Walk up to a building and its score explains itself, right there in the city — no separate dashboard to alt-tab to.</sub>
</p>

| Rule | What it scores |
|---|---|
| `OPEN_PORT` | Each open port, weighted by port number. Telnet (23) and SMB (445) cost a lot; HTTPS (443) costs almost nothing. Ports without a weight of their own are capped in total, so a NAS with ten mundane ports can't reach CRITICAL by volume alone. |
| `KNOWN_CVE` | Real CVEs from the NVD for the detected version, weighted by the worst CVSS. One critical flaw outweighs several minor ones. |
| `UNKNOWN_HOST` | The device wasn't in the baseline. Costs risk purely for existing, regardless of its ports. |
| `NEW_PORT` | Ports a known host didn't have open before. |

All weights live in `application.yml` under `portscape.risk`. They are an editorial
judgement, not a constant of the universe — and they're meant to be argued with.

**The KEV catalog deliberately scores nothing.** Knowing a flaw is being exploited right
now belongs on the screen, not in the arithmetic: pulling an external feed into the score
would make the same scan produce different numbers depending on whether CISA happened to
be up. It is shown, loudly, and left out of the sum.

<details>
<summary><b>How CVE lookup actually works</b></summary>

<br>

The CPEs nmap emits almost never match the NIST dictionary. nmap says
`matt_johnston:dropbear_ssh_server`; the NVD knows
`dropbear_ssh_project:dropbear_ssh`. For nginx, nmap says `igor_sysoev` and NIST says
`f5`. So the client makes two requests: it resolves the canonical name via `/cpes/2.0`
first, then asks for CVEs via `/cves/2.0`.

A CPE **without a version** is deliberately ignored. It would match every CVE ever
published for that product, and attributing those to the host would be inventing risk.

Responses are cached in PostgreSQL. Without the cache, the NVD rate limit (5 requests
per 30s without a key) dominated the scan duration. Set `PORTSCAPE_NVD_API_KEY` to
raise it to 50.

The `empty-cache-ttl` is deliberately shorter than `cache-ttl`: "no CVEs" comes both
from a genuinely clean product and from a name the NVD didn't recognise, and caching
the second case for a week would hide the problem for a week.

**At most 25 CVEs are kept per port**, highest CVSS first, and the real total is stored
alongside them. This is not tidiness — the client doesn't paginate and the NVD returns up
to 2000 CVEs per page, so a kernel CPE (`cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:5.15`) would drag
thousands into every scan's JSON and into the database. Truncating without saying by how
much would be lying by omission, so the panel shows *"showing the 25 highest-scoring of
431 known CVEs"*.

**Three CVSS formats, all of them real.** A service with any history returns all three at
once, so the translation handles all three: v2 has no prefix and calls authentication
`Au`, v3.x puts impact in `C`/`I`/`A`, and v4.0 carries thirty-two metrics of which the
NVD writes twenty-one as `:X` — 174 characters, 63 of them meaning anything.

A flaw in something shared — the OS kernel, typically — is listed under **every** port
that runs it, while the risk score charges for it **once**. That looks like a bug and
isn't: the port list answers *what is known to be wrong with what runs here*, the score
answers *what did this cost you*. Different questions, different answers.

**Privacy:** only software CPE identifiers are sent to the NVD (e.g.
`cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:9.6`) — never IP addresses, hostnames or scan results. Turn
it off entirely with `portscape.nvd.enabled: false`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The second source: what is actually being exploited</b></summary>

<br>

CVSS measures how bad a flaw *would* be for whoever exploits it. It says nothing about
whether anyone is. A 7.5 used in ransomware campaigns this week is more urgent than a 9.8
from 2015 that never had a public exploit, and without a second source the two are
indistinguishable.

So every CVE is checked against the [CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities
catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) — a single public
JSON file, no key, no rate limit. A match brings the date CISA added it, the remediation
they require, and whether it has been seen in ransomware.

The catalog is fetched once a day, not per scan, and enrichment happens **after** the NVD
cache: that cache lasts seven days and the catalog changes daily, so storing the KEV state
next to the cached CVE would make today's scan show what was true last week.

When the fetch fails, the previous catalog is kept rather than emptied. The asymmetry is
the point — an unreachable catalog means *"I couldn't check"*, never *"it isn't being
exploited"*, and stale information beats silence that reads as safety. Turn it off with
`portscape.kev.enabled: false`.

</details>

## The likely attack path

The panel holds every piece — the port, the version, the CVE, the KEV listing, what the
protocol is — and still asks the reader to assemble them. So it assembles them:

```
LIKELY ATTACK PATH
  445/tcp (SMB) running Samba smbd 4.6.2 is exposed, on a host reported
  as Linux 3.2 - 4.9. CVE-2017-7494 (CVSS 9.8, CRITICAL) affects it, and is
  reachable from the network, without an account. It is on CISA's list of
  vulnerabilities confirmed as exploited in the wild, including in ransomware
  campaigns. From here, 22/tcp (SSH) is what the same network would be
  reached through next.

  [Initial Access]  [Execution]  [Lateral Movement]
```

Composed from templates filled with data already in the JSON — nothing generated,
nothing inferred beyond what the CVSS vector states. Most hosts get no path at all, and
that is the point: inventing one for a phone with no open ports would cost the
credibility of the hosts where it matters.

It cites ATT&CK **tactics**, never techniques — naming `T1110.001` would be asserting
*how* the attack would happen. And it says *"reported as"*, never *"is"*: the OS
fingerprint is a guess, and the narrative inherits that.

## What to fix first

A score you cannot act on is just a number. Every host carries a plan, ordered by what
each action actually removes:

```
WHAT TO FIX FIRST
  Close 445/tcp (microsoft-ds)            −69   score → 73
  Update Samba smbd 4.6.2 on 445/tcp      −39   still CRITICAL (100)
```

Simulating a fix is re-running the scorer with that port gone — `RiskScorer.score` is a
pure function, so **no rule is duplicated** and the answer cannot drift from the real
number. Subtracting a reason's points would be wrong: unweighted ports share a cap, so
closing one can remove nothing at all.

<details>
<summary><b>Why each action carries two numbers</b></summary>

<br>

The score saturates at 100; the reasons behind it do not. A host whose reasons total 142
shows 100, and removing 39 of them leaves 103 — still 100 on screen. Reporting only the
visible score would print *"−39, score → 100"* and read like a bug.

So `pointsRemoved` comes from the **unsaturated** total and does the ordering, while
`scoreAfter` is the saturated number the city uses. When they disagree, that is the
honest message: this host does not get fixed by one action.

Being new to the network generates no action. A device that appeared without permission
is not *fixed* by closing a port — it is authorised, and that is an action on the scan
(`POST /api/baselines`), not on the host.

</details>

## Reading a port

nmap tells you `445/tcp open microsoft-ds`. That is a fact with no consequence attached.
Click the port and it opens:

```
445  MICROSOFT-DS · Samba smbd 4.6.2          EXPLOITED   31 CVES  ⌄

     CVE-2017-7494   9.8 CRITICAL   ACTIVELY EXPLOITED · RANSOMWARE
     [reachable from the network] [works reliably] [no account needed]
     [no user action needed] [reads everything] [alters everything] [can take it down]
     Samba since 3.5.0 allows remote authenticated users to upload a shared library
     to a writable share and cause the server to load and execute it.
     CISA: Apply updates per vendor instructions.

     Showing the 25 highest-scoring of 31 known CVEs.
```

Three things are doing work there.

**The version.** Without `4.6.2` there is no CVE to look up — a service name alone
matches everything and nothing.

**The vector, translated.** `AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` is the anatomy of the
flaw, and it is what makes a 9.8 mean something instead of asking you to trust it.

**The KEV badge.** Everything above it is a description of what could happen. That badge
says it is happening.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshot-port-detail.png" alt="An open port expanded: the SMB dossier, what an attacker gains, and how to fix it" width="80%">
</p>

<details>
<summary><b>The port that has no CVEs</b></summary>

<br>

All of the above needs a version to hang off. Telnet has none of it — and Telnet is the
worst thing on most networks it appears on:

```
23   TELNET                                                          INFO  ⌄

     Telnet
     Remote terminal sessions with no encryption at all. Everything — the
     username, the password, every command typed — travels in plain text.

     WHY IT'S HERE — Predates SSH by about fifteen years. Survives in switches,
     printers, IPMI boards and industrial gear that was never updated.

     WHAT AN ATTACKER GAINS — Anyone able to observe the traffic reads the
     administrator credentials without an exploit and without breaking
     anything. There is nothing to crack — the protocol hands them over.

     HOW TO FIX
       · Turn it off and use SSH instead.
       · If the device cannot do SSH, restrict it to a management VLAN.
       · Rotate every credential that has crossed this port.

     SAFE ALTERNATIVE — SSH (22)
```

No API answers this — the NVD has no entry explaining what Telnet *is*, because that is
knowledge, not data. So it is written by hand in `frontend/src/knowledge/ports.ts`, for
every port the risk model penalises. SSH, HTTP and HTTPS get entries too, saying they are
fine: without those, the tool is an alarm that goes off every time.

The dossier scores nothing — it lives in the frontend because the static demo has no
backend, and because this is presentation. What keeps the halves honest is a test that
reads `port-weights` out of the backend's `application.yml` and fails, naming them, if a
port worth 25 points or more has nothing to say for itself.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Where the line is drawn</b></summary>

<br>

Portscape describes **the mechanism and the consequence**, never the procedure. *"Anyone
who can observe the traffic reads the administrator credentials"* is what the exposure
means; how to position yourself to observe that traffic is not here, and will not be. No
payloads, no exploit commands, no credential testing — the scan identifies service
versions and looks them up, and never tries anything against them.

Half of that is enforced: `NmapCommandBuilder.buildVersionDetection` hardcodes `-sT -sV`
and takes no arguments from configuration, so nothing from nmap's `vuln` or `brute`
categories can reach it. The discovery pass is not — its flags come from
`portscape.nmap.arguments`, so `-sS -O --open -T4` is a deliberate default rather than a
guarantee. Anyone editing that list owns what they put in it.

</details>

## Taking it with you

Everything above lives inside a 3D scene, which is fine for exploring and useless for a
meeting. The inventory panel exports the whole scan two ways:

- **PDF** — the inventory, then one page per host with its attack path, its fix list and
  its ports. Text stays searchable and selectable.
- **Markdown** — the same document, for pasting into a ticket or an issue.

No watermark, no footer, no "generated by". A document you can send without editing it
first.

<details>
<summary><b>Why the PDF costs nothing</b></summary>

<br>

It is `window.print()`. A print stylesheet hides the application, reveals the document,
and the browser's own engine produces the file — with real page breaks, repeating table
headers, and selectable text.

The alternative was a PDF library: `jsPDF` with `html2canvas` is about a megabyte on a
bundle that already warns at 1.2 MB, and it rasterises — the text stops being text. The
only thing it buys is one fewer click, because `window.print()` opens the browser's
dialog rather than downloading directly.

Both outputs read the same `report/model.ts`, which decides what goes in and in what
order. `markdown.ts` and `ReportDocument.tsx` only know about syntax — two functions
deciding the same content is how they drift apart.

</details>

## Baseline and change detection

Each scan is compared against a reference, resolved in this order:

1. The scan **pinned** for that network, if one exists (`POST /api/baselines`).
2. Otherwise, a **7-day inventory** — every device seen on that network in the last week,
   merged by identity, most recent record winning.
3. Otherwise, nothing. On the first scan of a network there is no term of comparison,
   and marking every host as new would be noise rather than signal. Hosts come back
   `UNKNOWN`, which is not the same as `UNCHANGED`.

A host is `CHANGED` if its open ports or its OS fingerprint changed. Service version
does *not* count: nmap gets it intermittently, and treating that as a change would fill
the city with false alarms.

> **Scores are stored; diffs are computed on read.** A score depends on the CVEs the NVD
> knew about at scan time — recomputing it weeks later would give a different number and
> the history would stop being comparable. A diff depends on the *current* baseline, and
> storing it would leave the flags lying the moment someone pins a different one.

## The inventory panel

The city is for noticing; the side panel is for finding. Every host, sorted by IP
address (not alphabetically — `192.168.1.2` sorts before `192.168.1.100`), filterable
by risk band. Click one and a **Go To** button drops you next to that exact building in
the 3D city, facing it.

## API

With the backend running, the full contract is served from the code itself at
**<http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html>** — every endpoint, every field of every DTO,
and a form to try each call. The raw document is at `/v3/api-docs`. The table below is
the short version.

| Method | Route | Response |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/scans` | `202` + `Location`. Body `{"target":"192.168.1.0/24"}` is optional — without it, the local network is detected automatically. |
| `GET` | `/api/scans/{id}` | Scan state, and when `DONE`, hosts with risk scores and change flags. |
| `GET` | `/api/scans/{id}/diff` | Full comparison against the baseline, including hosts that disappeared. |
| `GET` | `/api/scans` | Scan history (summaries). |
| `POST` | `/api/scans/{id}/cancel` | Stops a running scan and returns it. `409` if it already finished. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/scans/{id}` | Deletes a scan. |
| `GET` | `/api/baselines` | Pinned baselines. |
| `POST` | `/api/baselines` | Pins a scan as reference. Body `{"scanId":"..."}` — the network comes from the scan itself. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/baselines?target=192.168.1.0/24` | Reverts to the implicit baseline. |

The target goes in the query string rather than the path because it contains a slash
(`192.168.1.0/24`), and an encoded slash in a path variable is rejected by Tomcat by
default.

```bash
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/api/scans \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"target":"192.168.1.0/24"}'

curl localhost:8080/api/scans/<id> | jq

When a scan fails, the status is `FAILED` and the response carries
`error: {code, message}` — for example `NMAP_PRIVILEGE`, `NMAP_NOT_FOUND` or
`NMAP_XML_PARSE_FAILED`. Client errors follow RFC 7807 with a Portscape-specific `code`.

## A note on OS detection

nmap doesn't read a device's operating system. It compares the signature of its TCP
stack against a database and returns the closest neighbour it knows. A device that
isn't in that database comes back as something else entirely — with high confidence.

Two scans of the same Xiaomi TV, four hours apart, produced *Nintendo Switch (97%)* and
*Android 10–12 (97%)*. The percentage is nmap's confidence in the resemblance, not in
the answer. So the UI labels it `OS Fingerprint` rather than "OS detected", and where
the fingerprint disagrees with the MAC vendor, the vendor wins — that one is derived
from an IEEE-registered prefix and is verifiable.

## Configuration

Everything lives in `backend/src/main/resources/application.yml`:

| Prefix | Controls |
|---|---|
| `portscape.nmap` | `command`, `default-target`, `arguments`, `timeout`, `host-timeout` |
| `portscape.nvd` | `enabled`, `base-url`, `api-key`, `timeout`, `min-request-interval`, `cache-ttl`, `empty-cache-ttl`, `max-cves-per-port` |
| `portscape.kev` | `enabled`, `feed-url`, `timeout`, `refresh-interval` — the CISA exploited-in-the-wild catalog |
| `portscape.risk` | `port-weights` and the weight of every scoring rule |
| `portscape.baseline` | `window` — how far back the inventory reaches (default 7 days) |
| `portscape.layout` | `spacing`, `grid-width`, `district-gap` for the 3D layout |

The database is configured by environment variables — `POSTGRES_URL`, `POSTGRES_USER`,
`POSTGRES_PASSWORD` — with development defaults.

If `POST /api/scans` doesn't name a target, the app asks the OS which interface holds
the default route and derives the subnet from it, without sending a single packet. This
avoids picking the wrong interface on a machine with several active (Wi-Fi + Ethernet,
VPN), and keeps the target correct when you move between networks.

## Tests

```bash
cd backend
mvn test        # 256 unit tests, seconds, no Docker needed
mvn verify      # + 39 integration tests (Testcontainers, needs Docker)

cd frontend
npm test        # 147 tests
npx tsc -b      # type check
```

The schema is owned by Flyway (`backend/src/main/resources/db/migration`) and Hibernate
runs with `ddl-auto: validate`, so entities and migrations can't drift apart unnoticed.

CI runs both suites on every push and pull request. It exists because of a specific
incident: a sort-order inversion in baseline resolution shipped inside an unrelated
commit, two integration tests caught it the same day, and nobody noticed — the suite was
already red for other reasons, and a suite that already fails stops being a signal.

## Stack

- **Backend** — Java 21, Spring Boot 3.5, PostgreSQL, Flyway, springdoc (OpenAPI), JUnit 5, Testcontainers
- **Frontend** — React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Three.js via React Three Fiber, Tailwind CSS
- **Scanning** — nmap, parsed from its XML output

Deliberately a simple monolith. No message queues, no microservices, no WebSockets — the
complexity belongs in the visualisation and the scoring, not in the infrastructure.
