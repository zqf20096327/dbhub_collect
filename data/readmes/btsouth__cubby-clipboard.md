## Why Cubby?

Windows Clipboard History is convenient, but its short memory makes it hard to depend on. Cubby keeps the familiar `Win+V` workflow while adding persistent local history, instant search, offline text recognition for screenshots, rich clipboard formats, and controls for sensitive apps.

</p>

## Search inside your screenshots

Copy a screenshot and Cubby reads the text inside it using the built-in Windows OCR engine, fully on your PC with no cloud and no extra downloads. Weeks later, search for a word you remember seeing (an error message, an address, a confirmation code) and the screenshot turns up in your history. Press `Shift+Enter` on an image to paste just the recognized text.

| Built for everyday use | Private by design |
| --- | --- |
| Search your history by text, including words inside copied screenshots (offline OCR) | No account, cloud sync, ads, or desktop analytics |
| Text, HTML, RTF, and images | AES-256-GCM encryption for stored clipboard payloads |
| Pinning, folders, filters, and per-app context | Encryption key protected for the current Windows user |
| Keyboard-first navigation and paste | Ignored-app and sensitive-content controls |
| Windows 11 flyout, tray, themes, and startup options | Open-source GPL-3.0 code |
| RDP and remote-support workflows | Signed updates from GitHub Releases |

## Install

Cubby supports Windows 11 on x64 and ARM64.

1. Download the installer for your PC from the [latest release](https://github.com/btsouth/cubby-clipboard/releases/latest).
2. Run the `*-setup.exe` file. Windows may ask you to confirm the publisher during early releases.
3. Open Cubby from the tray, finish the short setup, then use `Win+V`.

The app checks for signed updates at startup and every 30 minutes while it is running. See the [beginner-friendly setup guide](https://cubbyclipboard.com/start.html) for screenshots and troubleshooting.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Win+V` | Open or close Cubby |
| `Ctrl+F` | Focus search |
| `Up` / `Down` | Move through clips |
| `Enter` | Paste the selected clip |
| `Shift+Enter` | Paste as plain text, or paste recognized text from an image |
| `Ctrl+Enter` | Copy the selected clip without pasting it |
| `Ctrl+P` | Pin or unpin the selected clip |
| `Delete` | Delete the selected clip |
| `Escape` | Clear search or close Cubby |

## Privacy

Clipboard data stays on your PC. Cubby encrypts stored clipboard payloads and image data with AES-256-GCM, with the key protected by Windows for your user account. The desktop app contains no analytics or usage telemetry.

Copying files is not recorded. A copied file is a path, not content, so a saved entry for it would break as soon as the file moves. Cubby ignores file payloads instead of storing paths you copied. Screenshots are unaffected: a tool that copies a real image alongside a file reference is kept as the image.

The app contacts GitHub to check for signed updates and opens links you request. The website uses limited, cookie-free first-party analytics; it does not receive clipboard content. Read the full [privacy policy](https://cubbyclipboard.com/privacy.html).
