Lucid CMS is a TypeScript-first headless CMS for teams that need flexible content modeling, polished editorial workflows, and control over where their content platform runs.

Developers get a code-first collection system, typed APIs for consuming content, runtime and database adapters, and plugin support for shaping Lucid around real project needs. For content teams, Lucid provides a modern editing experience with media management, release review, scheduled publishing, localization, and AI content tools.

## ✨ Features

- **Model content your way:** code-defined collections, reusable bricks, custom fields and localization.
- **Manage publishing with confidence:** publishing targets, revisions, workflow stages, release review, approvals, and scheduled publishing.
- **Organize teams:** roles, granular permissions, and integrations.
- **Handle media and email properly:** folders, private media, shareable links, image processing, cropping, email logs, previews, and redaction policies.
- **Extend it for your project:** plugins, service hooks, toolkit, and custom routes let you add content behavior, integrations, and side effects.
- **Choose your infrastructure:** Node.js or Cloudflare Workers, PostgreSQL, LibSQL, SQLite, D1, queues, KV, email, storage.
- **Use AI where it helps:** generate and edit images, generate alt text, create custom field values, and track AI usage.

AI features require a subscription with Lucid. This is planned to become publicly available with the beta release.

## 🏁 Getting Started

Follow the [installation guide](https://lucidcms.io/en/cms/docs/getting-started/installation/) for the full setup flow.

For a local Node.js project, the smallest useful setup is typically:

```bash
npm install @lucidcms/core @lucidcms/runtime-node @lucidcms/db-sqlite @lucidcms/plugin-filesystem
```

Then create a `lucid.config.ts` file with a runtime, database adapter, secrets, media settings, and collections. SQLite plus the filesystem plugin is the fastest way to explore Lucid locally without external infrastructure.

Or deploy our Cloudflare template by clicking the button below.

## 📊 Anonymous Telemetry

Telemetry is **enabled by default** and sends anonymised technical data about the Lucid version, setup, enabled features, coarse project size, and whether `dev`, `serve`, or `build` succeeds. Events use a random project identifier and never include content, names, paths, environment values, user data, secrets, error messages, or stack traces.

Disable it with `telemetry: false` in your Lucid config, or set `LUCID_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` or `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`.

## 📄 Licensing

Lucid CMS is licensed under the [MIT License](./LICENSE).
