## 🚦 Current Implementation State

Kuayle's published releases are runnable MVPs, not a mature enterprise platform. This development branch also contains unreleased work described below. The repository includes the Go API, SvelteKit frontend, database migrations, development tooling, and reference self-hosting configuration.

| Area             | State                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Why Kuayle?

Kuayle started with a narrow requirement: keep a fast, keyboard-oriented issue workflow while adding multiple assignees, self-hosting, and complete source access.

The distribution model is deliberately simple:

- one public repository under Apache 2.0;
- no paid tier or enterprise edition;
- no feature gate or license key;
- no per-user software fee;
- infrastructure, backups, monitoring, and updates remain the operator's responsibility.

The product is intentionally smaller than broad project-management suites. It covers issues, cycles, projects, saved views, analytics, GitHub automation, public sharing, real-time events, and portable per-workspace transfer. It does not currently include enterprise identity, a wiki, or modules.

## 🤖 Dev Machines (Agentic Coding)

Dev Machines are an unreleased opt-in multi-container subsystem for self-hosted Kuayle. Machines can be created generically, then attach issue worktrees when work starts. Every machine has collector and egress services; it may also include a shared code-server/native-terminal developer container and a browser, while agent containers are created on demand for runs. PostgreSQL-backed operations provide durable reconciliation and authenticated wildcard routing.

> See [`TECHNICAL.md`](TECHNICAL.md) for the full specification, architecture diagrams, schema, and API reference.

### Architecture

```
You (browser)
  │
  ├─ 0123456789abcdef0123.kuayle-machines.example.net         → code-server
  ├─ 0123456789abcdef0123-terminal.kuayle-machines.example.net → native xterm over ttyd.v1
  └─ 0123456789abcdef0123-browser.kuayle-machines.example.net → Chrome via KasmVNC (in-browser web navigation)
        │
        └── All routed through Machine Gateway auth — no public ports, no port management
```

The implementation:

1. **Orchestrate cooperating containers** per machine. Collector and egress services are always represented. The optional developer service runs code-server on `8080` and ttyd on `7681` in one container (`/workspace`, `HOME`, tools, processes, and tmux); browser and on-demand agent services run separately on the isolated bridge network. The Kuayle UI renders `@xterm/xterm` natively and speaks `ttyd.v1`; it does not expose ttyd's web page.
2. **Support multiple agent providers** — Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, or admin-configured generic CLIs. The shared developer image includes pinned OpenCode, Claude Code, and Codex CLIs for direct interactive terminal use. Kuayle's dashboard launches bounded autonomous runs in separately pinned provider images and normalizes their results.
3. **Assign random subdomains** through a separate registrable wildcard domain (`*.kuayle-machines.example.net`) with launch-ticket auth and host-restricted machine session cookies. The machine domain must be a completely separate registrable domain to prevent cookie leakage between the main application and machine workloads.
4. **Authenticate** through a dedicated unprivileged Machine Gateway; the privileged Machine Manager is the only Dev Machines runtime component with Docker socket access. The separately optional system updater also mounts the socket when enabled.
5. **Prepare issue worktrees** from issue, project, team, then workspace repository/environment defaults. One machine has affinity to one repository and can hold several independent issue worktrees from that repository; use a separate machine for another repository/environment or concurrent conflicting work.
6. **Record best-effort activity** from filesystem, shell, root-checkout Git, browser, agent, gateway, and lifecycle telemetry and attach it to project work

### Modes

| Mode              | Who                             | What happens                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent-only**    | A user starts a bounded run      | Agent works autonomously, records a normalized result, and optionally pushes a branch or opens a pull request with a repository-scoped GitHub App token |
| **Human + Agent** | Developer opens an issue workspace | Uses code-server or the dedicated persistent terminal while launching and monitoring bounded agent runs from Kuayle |

### Configuration

Machines are created without requiring a repository, branch, issue, project, or manual TTL. Friendly random names are case-insensitively unique per creator within a workspace and have an availability API. Opening an issue resolves its repository and environment using issue, project, team, then workspace defaults and creates an isolated Git worktree. Workspace policies control concurrency, maximum hard runtime, a default 240-minute idle pause, per-machine disk size, providers, repositories, and custom CLI access. A per-machine **Keep running** switch bypasses idle pause; no automatic deletion is performed. Owners and admins can create a writable Environment Builder, pause or stop it, and save selected tooling/home customization as an immutable local OCI Development Environment image.

| Size   | CPU     | Memory | PID basis | Disk (hard quota) |
| ------ | ------- | ------ | --------- | ----------------- |
| Small  | 2 cores | 4 GB   | 512       | 20 GB             |
| Medium | 4 cores | 8 GB   | 512       | 50 GB             |
| Large  | 8 cores | 16 GB  | 512       | 100 GB            |

Per-container PID limits are derived from the profile basis; 512 is not one aggregate machine-wide process limit. Per-machine workspace-volume limits use Docker local-volume project quotas. Self-hosted Dev Machines require Docker's data root on XFS mounted with `pquota` or `prjquota`; the manager fails its startup quota probe instead of running an unbounded workspace when the host does not support this boundary.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Docker

```sh
cp .env.example .env
make docker-up
```

App at `http://localhost:5173` · API at `http://localhost:8080`

### Local Dev

```sh
cp .env.example .env
make reset-dev
make seed
make dev-start-services
make dev
```

`make dev` runs the Go backend on `localhost:8080` and Vite on
`localhost:5173` directly on the host for hot reload. The root Compose stack is
for supporting services only during local development: Postgres, Redis, the Dev
Machine gateway/manager, runtime image builds, and the Caddy wildcard TLS proxy
for `https://*.machines.localhost`. The dev proxy binds `127.0.0.1:80` and
`127.0.0.1:443`; stop the selfhosting stack first if it is using those ports.
The root gateway container is named `kuayle-dev-machine-gateway` to avoid the
selfhosting `kuayle-machine-gateway` name.

## 🏠 Self-Hosting

Kuayle is designed to be self-hosted. The reference stack in [`selfhosting/`](selfhosting/) includes Caddy, PostgreSQL, Redis, the backend, the frontend, and an update script. Review secrets, backups, monitoring, and host security before production use.

### Portable workspace transfer

Workspace owners and admins can download a versioned `.kuayle.zip` archive from **Settings → General → Workspace transfer**. An authenticated user with no workspace can choose **Import workspace** during workspace setup; an owner or admin can also start an import from the transfer settings. Import always creates a separate workspace and never overwrites an existing one.

The archive contains a logical `manifest.json`, `data.json`, and the workspace's uploaded asset bytes. It preserves teams, statuses, labels, projects, cycles, issues and their relationships/history, templates, views, favorites, shared links, workspace notifications, integration metadata, AI prompts, and safe Dev Machine workspace policy/scope settings. Database and asset IDs are regenerated and references—including protected asset URLs—are remapped during import.

Workspace transfer deliberately excludes password hashes, refresh tokens, personal preferences, webhook secrets, GitHub App credentials and access tokens, AI API keys, Dev Machine credentials, active machines, Docker volumes/networks, environment images, logs, sessions, and runtime artifacts. Imported webhooks, shared links, GitHub repositories/automation, and Dev Machine policy are disabled or rotated where appropriate; GitHub, AI, webhooks, and Development Environments must be reconfigured on the target instance.

Users are matched to existing target-instance accounts by normalized email. The importing user becomes the new owner; all other referenced users must register on the target instance before import. The preview reports any missing emails without creating partial data.

This feature transfers one logical workspace. It is not a replacement for an operator backup: disaster recovery and whole-instance migration still require PostgreSQL backups, object-storage backups, deployment configuration/secrets, and any required local Docker volumes or Development Environment OCI images.

### Prerequisites

- A Linux server with Docker + Docker Compose v2
- A domain pointing to your server (for HTTPS via Let's Encrypt HTTP-01)
- If enabling Dev Machines: a second registrable domain with a wildcard DNS record and either a custom Caddy DNS-01 build or an imported wildcard TLS certificate

### 1. Clone and configure

```sh
git clone https://github.com/carbogninalberto/kuayle.git
cd kuayle/selfhosting
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your domain and production values:

```env
DOMAIN=kuayle.yourcompany.com
FRONTEND_URL=https://kuayle.yourcompany.com
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<strong-random-password>
JWT_SECRET=<random-string-at-least-32-chars>
```

`FRONTEND_URL` must be the exact public browser origin, including scheme and any non-default port. Dev Machine native terminal WebSockets use this value for strict `Origin` validation.

### 2. Launch

```sh
docker compose up --build -d
```

This starts 5 containers: Caddy (auto TLS), PostgreSQL, Redis, backend API, and frontend.

### 3. Run migrations and seed

```sh
docker compose exec backend /app/server migrate up
docker compose exec backend /app/server seed
```

Caddy handles HTTPS termination and proxies `/api/*` to the backend and all other requests to the frontend, so one public origin is enough.

### Enabling Dev Machines

Dev Machines remain disabled in the default five-service deployment. Before enabling them:

1. Set `DEV_MACHINES_ENABLED=true`, then configure `DEV_MACHINE_DOMAIN` on a separate registrable domain from `DOMAIN`, with wildcard DNS pointing to the host.
2. Replace the checked-in local `tls internal` wildcard configuration with either a mounted wildcard certificate or a DNS-01-enabled Caddy build for production. Profile startup rejects public production machine domains while Caddy internal TLS remains active. The wildcard route already proxies machine HTTP and WebSocket upgrades to the gateway.
3. Keep `FRONTEND_URL` set to the exact public Kuayle origin; the gateway uses it for native terminal WebSocket `Origin` checks.
4. Set `DEV_MACHINE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to an independent random value of at least 32 characters and set `DEV_MACHINE_INGEST_URL` to the public HTTPS API URL.
5. Set an independent `DEV_MACHINE_GATEWAY_DB_PASSWORD`; Compose provisions a restricted `kuayle_gateway` login and the gateway rejects the application database credential in production.
6. On Linux, set `DEV_MACHINE_DOCKER_GID` to the numeric group owner reported by `stat -c '%g' /var/run/docker.sock`; Docker Desktop commonly uses the default `0`.
7. Build the runtime images, migrate, provision gateway grants, and start the optional control plane:

```sh
docker compose --profile dev-machine-images build
docker compose exec backend /app/server migrate up
docker compose --profile dev-machines run --rm machine-gateway-db-provision
docker compose --profile dev-machines up -d
```

The API rejects a production machine domain that shares the main application's registrable domain. `machines.localhost` is supported only for local development. The gateway rejects parent-domain and reserved session cookies from workloads. Browser-cookie launches for code-server and browser require exact machine origins for mutations and service WebSockets; native terminal WebSockets use a separate one-use ticket bound to exact `FRONTEND_URL`, host, user/service, tmux session, and working directory.

For DNS-01, replace the stock `caddy:2-alpine` image with a trusted custom Caddy build containing your provider module, replace `tls internal` with a `tls` block using that DNS provider, and pass its scoped API credential through a Compose override. For operator certificates, bind-mount a host directory read-only at `/etc/caddy/certs` through a Compose override and use `tls /etc/caddy/certs/machines.pem /etc/caddy/certs/machines.key` in the wildcard block. Keep private keys outside the repository and container image.

Environment snapshot bytes are local OCI images stored in the host Docker image store, while their image references and lifecycle metadata are PostgreSQL rows. Snapshots exclude the repository workspace named volume and tmpfs secret mounts; plan backup, migration, pruning, and host disk monitoring accordingly.

The manager process runs as UID/GID 1000 with only the Docker socket's host group added. Access to that socket remains host-root-equivalent despite the non-root container UID, so never expose it to machine workloads or general application services.

### Updating

```sh
cd kuayle
bash selfhosting/update.sh
```

The update script pulls the latest code, rebuilds images, applies pending migrations, and recreates containers. If Dev Machines services are running, it rebuilds their control-plane and runtime images first, stops the existing gateway and manager only while migrations and restricted gateway-role grants are applied, then starts the updated control plane. A failure after the stop clears the upgrade marker, preserves logs, restarts the same previous containers, and returns the original nonzero status. Disabled optional profiles remain disabled.

Instance sysadmins can also enable one-click updates from **Settings → Version**:

1. Copy your user ID from **Settings → Profile**.
2. Add it to `SYSADMINS` in `selfhosting/.env`.
3. Set a strong `SYSTEM_UPDATER_TOKEN` and keep `SYSTEM_UPDATER_URL=http://updater:8081`.
4. Apply the env and start the internal updater sidecar with `docker compose --profile updater up -d backend updater` from `selfhosting/`.

The updater sidecar is internal-only and runs the same `selfhosting/update.sh` flow. If it is not configured, the Version page shows the manual update command instead.

### Storage options

By default, uploads use a local Docker volume (`STORAGE_TYPE=local`). The alternative S3 backend accepts a configurable endpoint and path-style requests:

```env
STORAGE_TYPE=s3
S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
S3_BUCKET=kuayle-uploads
S3_REGION=us-east-1
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your-key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your-secret
```

The backend is intended for AWS S3 and compatible APIs such as R2, MinIO, and SeaweedFS. Test bucket creation, permissions, public URL behavior, and signed downloads with your chosen provider.

### GitHub Integration (optional)

Kuayle connects to GitHub through a **GitHub App**. By default, each workspace uses GitHub's App Manifest flow and stores the returned credentials encrypted. Deployments with shared App credentials can let workspaces install a preconfigured App instead (see `.env.example` for the `GITHUB_APP_*` variables).

#### What it does

- **Links development activity** — mention `ENG-123` in a branch name, PR title/body, or commit message (case-insensitive)
- **Auto-transitions** — branch created → In Progress, PR opened → In Review, PR merged → Done (configurable)
- **Activity feed** — linked PRs, branches, and commits on the matching issue detail page

#### Publicly reachable instance

If GitHub can reach your Kuayle instance (for example `https://kuayle.yourcompany.com`), the manifest flow can populate the callback and webhook URLs:

1. Go to **Settings → GitHub** in your workspace
2. Click **Set up GitHub App** — redirects to GitHub with a pre-filled form
3. Click **Create GitHub App** on GitHub
4. Redirected back — credentials saved automatically, webhook URL configured
5. Click **Install on GitHub** to grant access to your repos
6. Select which repositories to link

GitHub events appear after the App is installed on repositories, webhook delivery succeeds, and an issue identifier is present in supported activity.

#### Private network / no public domain

If your instance runs on a private network (for example behind a VPN), GitHub cannot send webhooks directly. Use a relay or expose only the webhook endpoint through a controlled tunnel.

**Option A: Webhook proxy with smee.io**

[smee.io](https://smee.io) is a free webhook relay that forwards GitHub events to your private instance.

1. Go to [smee.io/new](https://smee.io/new) and copy your channel URL (e.g. `https://smee.io/abc123`)
2. Run the proxy on your server:
   ```sh
   npx smee-client --url https://smee.io/abc123 --target http://localhost:8080/api/github/webhook
   ```
3. Set up the GitHub App from **Settings → GitHub** (same steps as above)
4. After the app is created, go to its settings on GitHub:
   **GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → your app → General**
5. Set **Webhook URL** to your smee channel URL (`https://smee.io/abc123`)
6. Check **Active** and save

The smee client must stay running to receive events. You can run it as a systemd service:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/smee-kuayle.service
[Unit]
Description=Smee webhook proxy for Kuayle
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/npx smee-client --url https://smee.io/abc123 --target http://localhost:8080/api/github/webhook
Restart=always
User=kuayle

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now smee-kuayle
```

**Option B: Reverse tunnel**

Use a reverse tunnel to expose just the webhook endpoint. With [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/):

```sh
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8080
```

Or with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com):

```sh
ngrok http 8080
```

Then set the generated public URL as the webhook URL in your GitHub App settings (append `/api/github/webhook`).

#### Local development

For local development, the GitHub App is created without a webhook URL (since localhost isn't reachable). To receive webhook events during development:

1. Set up the GitHub App from Settings → GitHub (works on localhost)
2. Start a smee proxy:
   ```sh
   npx smee-client --url https://smee.io/your-channel --target http://localhost:8080/api/github/webhook
   ```
3. Update the webhook URL in your GitHub App settings to your smee channel URL
4. Events will now flow through to your local instance
