Export chats from the [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) [Desktop app](https://www.signal.org/download/) to Markdown and HTML files with attachments. Each chat is exported as an individual .md/.html file and the attachments for each are stored in a separate folder. Attachments are linked from the Markdown files and displayed in the HTML (pictures, videos, voice notes).

Currently this seems to be the only way to get chat history out of Signal!

Adapted from [mattsta/signal-backup](https://github.com/mattsta/signal-backup), which I suspect will be hard to get working now.

## Example

An export for a group conversation looks as follows:

```markdown
[2019-05-29, 15:04] Me: How is everyone?
[2019-05-29, 15:10] Aya: We're great!
[2019-05-29, 15:20] Jim: I'm not.
```

Images are attached inline with `![name](path)` while other attachments (voice notes, videos, documents) are included as links like `[name](path)` so a click will take you to the file.

This is converted to HTML at the end so it can be opened with any web browser. The HTML export is styled as a chat view with grouped messages, day dividers, reactions, and an image lightbox. It follows your browser/OS light or dark preference by default, and a switcher in the top bar lets you pin light or dark (remembered per browser).

## 🐧 Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed.

2. Install this package:

```bash
pip install signal-export

# ...if you have the "pipx" command available, you're probably better off installing with "pipx install signal-export"
```

1. Then run the script!

```bash
sigexport ~/signal-chats

# or for Windows:
python -m sigexport C:\Temp\SignalExport
```

## 🪟 Installation: Windows

If you need step-by-step instructions on things like enabling WSL2, please see the dedicated [Windows Installation](./INSTALLATION.md) instructions.

## Installation nix/nixOS

`signal-export` is packaged in nixpkgs, so you can run

```bash
nix-shell -I nixpkgs=channel:nixpkgs-unstable --packages signal-export --command 'sigexport ~/signal-chats'
```

If you get an error message about `secret-tool` not being found, you probably need to install `libsecret-tools` via your Linux package manager. If you get this on NixOS then just add `libsecret` in the previous command

```bash
nix-shell -I nixpkgs=channel:nixpkgs-unstable --packages signal-export libsecret --command 'sigexport ~/signal-chats'
```

## 🚀 Usage

Please fully exit your Signal app before proceeding, otherwise you will likely encounter an `I/O disk` error, due to the message database being made read-only, as it was being accessed by the app.

See the full help info:

```bash
sigexport --help
```

Disable pagination on HTML:

```bash
sigexport --paginate=0 ~/signal-chats
```

List available chats and exit:

```bash
sigexport --list-chats
```

Export only the selected chats:

```bash
sigexport --chats=Jim,Aya ~/signal-chats
```

You can add `--source /path/to/source/dir/` if the script doesn't manage to find the Signal config location.
Default locations per OS are below.
The directory should contain a folder called `sql` with `db.sqlite` inside it.

- Linux: `~/.config/Signal/`
- Linux Flatpak: `~/.var/app/org.signal.Signal/config/Signal`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Signal/`
- Windows: `~/AppData/Roaming/Signal/`

You can also use `--old /previously/exported/dir/` to merge the new export with a previous one.
_Nothing will be overwritten!_
It will put the combined results in whatever output directory you specified and leave your previos export untouched.
Exercise is left to the reader to verify that all went well before deleting the previous one.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carderne/signal-export.git
cd signal-export
uv sync --all-groups
```

Various dev commands:

```bash
uv run poe fmt        # format code with Ruff
uv run poe lint       # lint code with Ruff
uv run poe check      # typecheck with Pyright
uv run poe test       # run tests with pytest
uv run sigexport      # run the signal-export CLI
```
