> **Which version does this page describe?** This README on `main` documents the **next, unreleased** version. The current stable download is **v1.5.0** ([release notes](https://github.com/cdavid817/vanehub-ai/releases/tag/v1.5.0) · [README as released](https://github.com/cdavid817/vanehub-ai/blob/v1.5.0/README.md)), which ships OnePiece plus five external CLIs (Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Antigravity CLI). The six ACP agents and iFlow legacy support below are **available on `main` only** until the next release. Per-agent status is tracked in the [agent capability matrix](docs/reference/agents/capability-matrix.md); the vocabulary (stable, main/unreleased, fixture-qualified, live-qualified, legacy, planned) is defined in [terminology](docs/reference/terminology.md).

<!-- docs-section:overview -->

## Overview

Working with several AI coding agents scatters sessions, projects, terminals, permissions, and cost across tools. VaneHub AI puts them in one desktop workbench: unified sessions and workspaces, unified permission approvals, unified observability and usage accounting, and multi-agent collaboration across vendors.

It supports two kinds of agents — **pick one path to start; you do not need to install every CLI**:

- **OnePiece** — the built-in native API agent that calls model providers over HTTP directly, requiring no external CLI at all;
- **External CLI agents** — Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Antigravity CLI (stable since v1.5.0), plus Qwen Code, Kimi Code CLI, Qoder CLI, CodeBuddy Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Cursor Agent CLI (on `main`, next release), installed by you and authenticated through each vendor's own flow in your terminal. iFlow CLI is kept as an opt-in legacy terminal entry on `main`.

<!-- docs-section:features -->

## Core capabilities

- **One entry point for every agent** — manage the OnePiece native API agent and the supported external CLI agents from one workspace. Session, configuration, permission, and observability capabilities vary by transport (native API, terminal/headless, ACP) and by provider; the [capability matrix](docs/reference/agents/capability-matrix.md) states what each agent actually gets.
- **Sessions and workspaces** — projects, interactive terminals (PTY), Git worktrees, remote workspaces over SSH.
- **Multi-agent collaboration** — group-chat seats with `@` handoff, expert roles, Loop automatic iteration, Plan mode, goals and the work board.
- **Context and code intelligence** — context compaction, cross-session memory, personalization, retrieval, workspace code indexing, LSP code intelligence.
- **Extensibility** — Skills, MCP servers, Prompt Hooks, local extensions, plugin integrations, IM connectors, local media (OCR, speech recognition and synthesis).
- **Governance and operations** — permission templates with per-call approvals, execution observability, unified logging, agent evaluation, scheduled tasks, usage statistics.

<!-- docs-section:agents -->

## Agents and CLI support

Release status per row: **stable** = in the v1.5.0 download; **main** = implemented on `main`, not yet in a stable release; **legacy** = detect-only terminal entry. Permission, MCP relay, evaluation, and usage-reporting support differ per agent — see the [capability matrix](docs/reference/agents/capability-matrix.md).

| Agent | Status | Kind | Command | Model source | In-app install | Authentication and model configuration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OnePiece | stable | Built-in native API agent | No CLI needed | Provider catalog or a custom compatible endpoint | Ships with the app | Configure provider and API key in-app |
| Claude Code | stable | External CLI | `claude` | Anthropic | ✅ npm / WinGet / vendor installer | Terminal OAuth; third-party compatible endpoints configurable in-app |
| Codex CLI | stable | External CLI | `codex` | OpenAI | ✅ npm | Terminal OAuth; third-party compatible endpoints configurable in-app |
| OpenCode | stable | External CLI | `opencode` | Whatever model you configure; no fixed family | ✅ npm / vendor installer | Terminal auth; third-party compatible endpoints configurable in-app |
| Gemini CLI | stable | External CLI | `gemini` | Google | ✅ npm | Terminal auth; endpoint editable, catalog ships the official preset only |
| Antigravity CLI | stable | External CLI | `agy` | Google | ✅ vendor installer (latest only) | Terminal Google sign-in; the CLI itself also supports API keys and compatible endpoints, which VaneHub does not yet manage in unified provider configuration |
| Qwen Code | main | External CLI (ACP) | `qwen` | Alibaba Qwen | ✅ npm | Terminal sign-in; managed conversation over `qwen --acp` |
| Kimi Code CLI | main | External CLI (ACP) | `kimi` | Moonshot | ✅ npm | Terminal sign-in; managed conversation over `kimi acp`; the older Python/uv distribution is detected but never migrated |
| Qoder CLI | main | External CLI (ACP) | `qoder` | Qoder | ✅ npm (Windows arm64 unsupported upstream) | Terminal sign-in; managed conversation over `qoder --acp` |
| CodeBuddy Code | main | External CLI (ACP) | `codebuddy` | Tencent | ✅ npm | Terminal sign-in; international / China / iOA account environment chosen per session; managed conversation over `codebuddy --acp` |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | main | External CLI (ACP) | `copilot` | GitHub | ✅ npm / WinGet | Terminal sign-in; managed conversation over `copilot --acp --stdio` |
| Cursor Agent CLI | main | External CLI (ACP) | `agent` | Cursor | ✅ vendor installer (latest only) | Terminal sign-in; managed conversation over `agent acp`; the program is identity-checked, not matched by name |
| iFlow CLI | legacy (main) | Legacy external CLI | `iflow` | iFlow (official service ended 2026-04-17) | ❌ detect-only | Native terminal only with your own custom API configuration; no managed conversation, no automation, no official service claimed |

- **In-app install** means VaneHub AI can install and upgrade the CLI from Settings → CLI Management: it drives npm, WinGet on Windows, and per-CLI audited vendor installers. A copy that came from Homebrew, Bun, Volta, a desktop bundle, or a system package is detected and reported but never changed.
- **Vendor subscription login (OAuth) always happens in your terminal**; VaneHub AI neither brokers nor stores subscription credentials.
- **ACP** rows run their managed conversation over the Agent Client Protocol: the CLI stays running for the session, and its permission requests, questions, and plans appear as cards you answer in-app. Token usage is reported as unavailable for these CLIs, never as zero. Detection on the settings page never starts an ACP session or a login.
- The integrated OpenCode is the open-source sst/opencode (npm package `opencode-ai`); it drives whichever model you configure, so policies like "require a reviewer from a different model family" do not apply to it.
- Gemini CLI's consumer path is narrowing: Google announced that from 2026-06-18, consumer accounts such as Gemini Code Assist Individuals and Google AI Pro/Ultra are no longer served through Gemini CLI and their "Login with Google" path is unavailable, with migration to Antigravity recommended; Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise are unaffected. API keys and Vertex are separate authentication paths — refer to Google's official documentation.

**Model providers**: the app ships a provider configuration catalog shared by OnePiece and the CLI agents that accept third-party endpoints; anything outside the catalog can be added as a custom compatible endpoint, with API keys stored in the operating-system credential service. The full vendor list, endpoint protocols, and default models are in the [built-in model provider catalog](docs/model-providers.md) (Simplified Chinese).

<!-- docs-section:quick-start -->

## Quick start

1. Download and install the desktop package for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/cdavid817/vanehub-ai/releases). The stable package is v1.5.0; agents marked **main** above are not in it. To try `main`, build from source (see [Run from source](#run-from-source-and-develop)) or download a manual `Package Desktop Apps` workflow artifact from GitHub Actions.
2. Pick one: configure a model provider and API key for OnePiece in Settings → Agent Configurations; or install any one supported external CLI, authenticate it in your terminal, then refresh detection in Settings → CLI Management.
3. Click New, choose an agent and a project folder, and create your first session.
4. Send your first task from the session workspace input box.

For details, see the user guide's quick start, CLI installation and authentication, and first-session chapters (the [Documentation](#documentation) section below).

<!-- docs-section:download -->

## Download, platforms, and release integrity

Prebuilt desktop packages are published on the [Releases page](https://github.com/cdavid817/vanehub-ai/releases):

| Platform | Architecture | Format |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | x64 | NSIS `.exe` installer |
| macOS | x64, Apple Silicon | `.dmg` |
| Linux | x64, ARM64 | `.deb`, AppImage |

No `.msi` or `.rpm` is published; the NSIS installer and the AppImage serve those users respectively.

**Keep three signing facts apart**:

- **Release integrity** — every release ships `SHA256SUMS`, an SPDX SBOM, and GitHub attestations for integrity and provenance verification;
- **Auto-update artifacts** — Tauri updater artifacts carry updater signatures;
- **Operating-system code signing** — **Windows Authenticode signing and macOS Developer ID signing/notarization are not yet in place** (a later phase), so Windows SmartScreen and macOS Gatekeeper may warn about the installers; the release notes carry per-platform handling steps.

Verification steps, the credential inventory, and the signing roadmap are in [release signing](docs/release-signing.md).

<!-- docs-section:runtimes -->

## Runtime modes

| Runtime | Purpose | Capabilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tauri desktop runtime** | Real use | Real CLI/PTY execution, SQLite persistence, filesystem access, desktop lifecycle and system integration, and the implemented local capabilities such as local media |
| **Web/mock runtime** | Deterministic UI preview, documentation screenshots, frontend development | An in-browser simulation — **no** real CLI execution, database persistence, file modification, or any system side effects happen |

Web/mock screens and simulated states are not evidence that a desktop feature passed real-environment verification.

## Architecture overview

  UI[React UI] --> Service[Frontend service interfaces]
  Service --> Web[Web/mock adapters]
  Service --> Tauri[Tauri adapters]
  Tauri --> Commands[Rust commands]

```

React components call only the frontend service interfaces in `src/services/` and never call Tauri `invoke()` directly; Tauri-specific calls live in the frontend Tauri adapters, while SQLite, CLI processes, filesystem access, and desktop lifecycle behavior all live in Rust. The full module inventory is in the [native architecture inventory](src-tauri/ARCHITECTURE.md).

<!-- docs-section:from-source -->

## Run from source and develop

<!-- docs-fact:node-minimum value:22+ -->

Prerequisites: Node.js 22+, npm, stable Rust, and the [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your platform. Platform linker requirements and build measurements are in the [native build performance guide](docs/build-performance.md).

```bash
npm ci
```

Run the Web/mock preview (an in-browser simulation — see [Runtime modes](#runtime-modes) above):

```bash
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1
```

Run the real desktop application:

```bash
npm run tauri:dev
```

> Windows troubleshooting: if the desktop launch cannot find the Rust toolchain, temporarily add cargo to PATH in PowerShell and retry:
>
> ```powershell
> $env:PATH="$env:USERPROFILE\.cargo\bin;$env:PATH"
> ```

Before submitting changes, run every command in the validation-commands section of [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) verbatim; new features and architecture changes require an OpenSpec proposal first — see [openspec/project.md](openspec/project.md).

**Technical reference**: the [agent infrastructure documentation](docs/agent-infrastructure/README.md) covers **external protocols, general architecture patterns, and engineering methods themselves** — MCP, LSP, RAG, and the rest — and is not a promise of delivered VaneHub capability; judge implementation status by the user guide, the developer guide, the [OpenSpec main specifications](openspec/specs/), and the generated references. See also the [CLI parameter reference](docs/reference/cli/builtin-cli-reference.md) and [release signing](docs/release-signing.md).

<!-- docs-section:roadmap -->

## Project status and roadmap

- **Delivered** — implemented behavior and interface contracts are recorded in the [OpenSpec main specifications](openspec/specs/); usage is covered by the user guide.
- **Implemented on `main`, not yet released** — code that has merged since v1.5.0 (for example the six ACP agents and unified memory read governance) is described here and in the guides with a `main` / unreleased label; it is not evidence that the stable package has it.
- **In progress** — see the [unarchived OpenSpec changes](openspec/changes/); the entries there are the complete list. Highlights, not a full status: the built-in Skill catalog, remote Skill registry and supply-chain governance, governed cross-session memory, region screenshot capture. A change whose code is on `main` but whose live-qualification tasks are still open stays **fixture-qualified** until the evidence exists.
- **Planned** — listed only when a public proposal or issue exists; this section promises no dates.
- Some capabilities (individual IM connector platforms, the per-platform desktop matrix) are qualified by live-environment records — see the developer guide's engineering delivery domain.

<!-- docs-section:support -->

## Support and security

- Usage questions and defects: read the [support notes](SUPPORT.md) first, then file a bug report or feature request through the issue forms.
- **Never report a security vulnerability as a public issue**: use [GitHub private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/cdavid817/vanehub-ai/security/advisories/new); the process is in the [security policy](SECURITY.md).
- Community participation follows the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

<!-- docs-section:contributing -->

## Contributing

Read the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a change. Keep documentation, both frontend runtime adapters, native interface contracts, tests, and OpenSpec artifacts aligned with the behavior you change.
