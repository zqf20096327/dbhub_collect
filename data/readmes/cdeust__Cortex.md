**Sovereign is what it is today.** Everything runs on your machine: a local SQLite file by
default, or PostgreSQL + pgvector if you prefer. No LLM in the retrieval loop, and nothing
leaves localhost unless you configure an integration that does. Your project's memory is a
file you own and can delete.

**Claude Code and Codex share Cortex memory.** Both native plugins provide the same
memory tools and 11 lifecycle hook modules for automatic capture, recall and project
context. Use either agent on a project and keep its memory when you switch.
[Verified with real Claude and Codex sessions on macOS](docs/verification/claude-codex-handoff-2026-09-22/README.md).
The same stdio MCP server also supplies memory tools to Claude Desktop, Claude Cowork
and other local MCP hosts.

**Eco-responsible is what we are aiming at.** Work that never reaches a datacenter is work
nobody has to power, and an agent that finds the right context first time re-reads fewer
files. We hold that intent to the
[Green Software Foundation's SCI method](https://sci.greensoftware.foundation/), and we
publish **no CO₂ or energy figure**, because we have not measured one.

## Install

**Claude Code** — add the marketplace and install the plugin:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add cdeust/Cortex
claude plugin install hypermnesia-mcp
```

Update the same way, one command:

```bash
claude plugin update hypermnesia-mcp
```

**Claude Desktop** — download `hypermnesia-mcp.mcpb` from
[Releases](https://github.com/cdeust/Cortex/releases) and open it, or use
**Settings → Extensions**. The bundle carries the tools but no hooks; the MCPB format has none.

**Claude Cowork** is detected automatically (`CLAUDE_ENVIRONMENT=cowork`) and uses the local
SQLite store. No PostgreSQL required.

For **Codex**, install the native plugin for memory tools and automatic hooks:

```bash
uv tool install "hypermnesia-mcp[sqlite]"
codex plugin marketplace add cdeust/Cortex
codex plugin add hypermnesia-mcp-codex@cortex-codex-plugins
```

Open `/hooks` in Codex to review and trust the Cortex hooks, then start a fresh
session. Changed hook definitions require renewed trust after an update. The
plugin uses the same saved backend selection as Claude Code; both hosts share
memory when they use the same configuration root and store.
[Codex setup details](docs/codex-plugin.md).

**Other stdio MCP hosts** (Gemini CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code) launch the same
server and get the same tools. See [launch commands](#every-other-mcp-host).
WSL, TLS client certificates and corporate proxies are covered in
[deployment scenarios](docs/deployment-scenarios.md).

The first use creates a local SQLite store under `~/.claude/methodology/`. Models are downloaded
once when needed and then run offline. The embedding and reranking model files are both fetched
on first use. Optional integrations, remote PostgreSQL, and OTLP telemetry use the network only
when explicitly configured. [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) lists the exact scope.

An existing PostgreSQL install is never silently downgraded: the installer detects a
configured `DATABASE_URL`, a prior backend marker, or a reachable local `cortex` database and
keeps it across updates.

<details>
<summary><strong>Upgrading from an older plugin identity</strong></summary>

The plugin was renamed `hypermnesia-mcp` in v4.15.0, after a community-directory collision
with an unrelated `cortex` plugin. Memories, configuration and storage paths are untouched.

```bash
claude plugin uninstall cortex
claude plugin install hypermnesia-mcp
```

The visualization companion, <a href="https://github.com/cdeust/cortex-viz">hypermnesia-mcp-viz</a>,
was renamed the same way:

```bash
claude plugin uninstall cortex-viz@cortex-plugins
claude plugin marketplace update cortex-plugins
claude plugin install hypermnesia-mcp-viz@cortex-plugins
```

The retained `cortex-viz@cortex-plugins` entry is a frozen shim that only prints this notice
and exposes no server or tools.

Allowlists, hooks, skills and agents must migrate both composed tool names:
`mcp__plugin_cortex-viz_cortex-viz__open_visualization` becomes
`mcp__plugin_hypermnesia-mcp-viz_hypermnesia-mcp-viz__open_visualization`, and
`mcp__plugin_cortex-viz_cortex-viz__get_methodology_graph` becomes
`mcp__plugin_hypermnesia-mcp-viz_hypermnesia-mcp-viz__get_methodology_graph`.

</details>

## Keep context useful

Across sessions, agents need to remember decisions, bring prior fixes back when a similar problem
returns, and show you which sources support a memory so you can correct it. Cortex keeps that
context available while making its status visible.

Cortex does this with local quality checks: what is written, whether its references resolve, what
happens when a decision changes, and what can fade over time.

### What gets in

A write passes a local novelty check (the implementation calls it a predictive-coding gate) against
what is already stored. Novel content is written; a near-duplicate is merged into the memory it
restates rather than filed beside it.

```js
// Illustrative project decision:
remember({ content: "Keep session state in Redis so TTL expiry is handled consistently." })
// → { stored: true, action: "stored" }
```

Deliberate writes are never rejected for being unsurprising. Unattended capture is, which is
what keeps automatic capture from burying the memories you meant to keep.

### Whether it can be checked

Every memory is graded at write time, locally, with no network call. The grade is not a
confidence score: it is whether the claims carry references that resolve on this machine.

```js
// → provenance: { grade: "unverifiable",
//                 reason: "dead_refs: deps/numpy/_core/_multiarray_umath.cpython-313-darwin.so",
//                 hint: "1 of 9 checkable reference(s) could not be resolved" }
```

That memory named a file that no longer existed, so it was stored and labelled `unverifiable`
instead of being silently presented as verified. Rewritten against paths that resolve, the same
memory grades `verified`. A recalled memory tells you which kind it is; a `verified` grade still
means that the references resolve locally, not that the claim has been independently proven true.

### When it turns out wrong

Corrections supersede rather than overwrite. The new memory records what it replaces, the old
one is demoted in recall, and the chain stays readable.

```js
remember({ content: "...", supersedes_id: 4360411 })
// → { action: "superseded", memory_id: 4360412, superseded_id: 4360411 }
```

### Whether it was right

A memory records what happened. A prediction records what was expected before the outcome
was known, so that Cortex can later find out it was wrong. `predict` writes a falsifiable
claim with the confidence held at the time; `resolve_prediction` settles it against an
observation the caller supplies, naming the verdict, the kind of source that decided it and
a reference to that source; `calibration` scores the resolved set.

```js
predict({ claim: "The p90 of the SQLite job is under 6 minutes",
          prediction: "a 20-minute budget leaves headroom", test: "21 attempts of 2026-09-16",
          confidence: 0.8 })
// → { prediction_id: 12, status: "open" }
resolve_prediction({ prediction_id: 12, verdict: "confirmed",
                     observed: "p90 348 s over 18 successes",
                     source_kind: "ci", source_ref: "cdeust/Cortex actions, 2026-09-16" })
// → { prediction_id: 12, verdict: "confirmed", resolved: true }
calibration()
// → { scored: 9, brier: 0.11, uninformative_brier: 0.25, confirmed: 7, refuted: 2,
//     reliability: [{ band: [0.6, 0.8], resolved: 4, mean_confidence: 0.78,
//                     observed_frequency: 0.75 }, ...] }
```

`brier` is the mean squared distance between confidence and outcome; 0.25 is what a constant
0.5 forecast earns, so a score above it means the confidences carried less information than
saying nothing. Cortex never fetches the evidence itself: the verdict, the observation and
the source reference come from the caller, which is what lets the same contract hold in any
repository and under any review convention.

### What fades

Memories carry heat that decays unless replay reinforces them, and episodic traces can consolidate
into semantic ones. A specific debugging session may compress to the principle it taught; the
commands can fade while the lesson survives. This lifecycle is designed to keep the store useful
as it grows, though it is not a promise of a fixed size or guaranteed semantic compression.

## What it feels like in use

Here is an illustrative workflow: decisions, prior fixes, and source checks becoming useful again.

**Monday.** An hour debugging a webhook handler ends in a race condition: TTL expiry firing
between the auth check and the permission lookup. You agree on a fix, implement it, close the
session.

**Thursday.** In another session, a user reports intermittent logouts. Cortex surfaces relevant
prior analysis, the Redis decision, and the TTL lesson when their content matches the new work.

**Three weeks later.** The sessions can consolidate into a pattern about authentication and
TTL-based caches; some details may fade while the principle remains useful.

In Claude Code and Codex alike that is automatic: 11 lifecycle hooks inject context at session
start, recall per prompt, capture as you work, checkpoint before compaction, and run a wiki that
curates itself. In any other stdio MCP host you call the same 57 tools yourself, or 60 when
the optional `ai-architect-mcp-codebase` and `ai-architect-mcp-spec` integrations are present.

## Does the retrieval work

Measured against a published benchmark, retrieval only. No LLM reader in the loop: the
question is whether the right memory surfaces, not whether a model can write a good answer
from it.

**LongMemEval**: 500 human-curated questions buried in about 40 sessions of history.

| | v4.14.1 (historical) | v4.20.0 (current release) |
|---|---|---|
| Recall@10 | **98.2%** | **97.8%** |
| MRR | **0.9167** | **0.905** |

Both are single runs: n=500, clean database, consolidation disabled, retrieval only.

v4.14.1, 2026-07-14: [artifact JSON](benchmarks/results/repro/20260714-v4.14.1-pretag/longmemeval-s.json);
[code SHA](https://github.com/cdeust/Cortex/commit/28145f0b7a113fc06e22568de6feea7f8444eaf5).
This is the run the ablation campaign in [Verification](#verification) was built around.

v4.20.0, 2026-09-09: [artifact JSON](benchmarks/results/repro/20260909-v4.20.0-longmemeval-s/longmemeval-s.json) and its
[manifest](benchmarks/results/repro/20260909-v4.20.0-longmemeval-s/MANIFEST.json); [code SHA](https://github.com/cdeust/Cortex/commit/86251ab8fc27a18f80f9b09b99a75f3b60edd9cb),
dirty=false. A single run of the LongMemEval-S leg alone (`benchmarks/reproduce.sh --only longmemeval
--no-ablation`) in an isolated ephemeral PostgreSQL container, reranker loaded, consolidation
disabled. Against v4.14.1 the change is 0.4 points of Recall@10 and 0.012 of MRR. The run's own
floor check reports Recall@10 within the 0.005 tolerance of the July floor (0.982) and MRR
0.0093 below its floor (0.914), which the script treats as non-blocking by design;
[docs/agent-guidance.md](docs/agent-guidance.md) records that `main` no longer clears those
floors and that the release gate is `--no-regression` against `origin/main`. The same tree has
no LoCoMo or BEAM figure yet.

Reproduce with `benchmarks/reproduce.sh`, which runs in an isolated ephemeral container, never
against a live store.

Recall@10 is the share of questions whose answer-bearing session appears in the first ten
retrieved sessions. MRR (mean reciprocal rank) rewards finding that session near the top. These
numbers describe retrieval only; they do not measure whether an LLM writes a correct answer.

Retrieval fuses vector similarity, full-text search, trigram match, heat and recency, then
reranks with a cross-encoder. PostgreSQL combines the signals as a weighted sum; SQLite uses
weighted reciprocal-rank fusion and has no trigram signal. LoCoMo
and BEAM results, the ablations and the floor gates are in [benchmarks/](benchmarks/).

## Storage

SQLite by default. PostgreSQL is one configuration field, worth it for very large stores or a
database shared across a team.

```bash
bash <plugin-dir>/scripts/install-plugin.sh --postgres
```

|  | SQLite (default) | PostgreSQL 15+ |
|---|---|---|
| Setup | none | pgvector, pg_trgm |
| All 57 tools | yes | yes |
| Retrieval contract | identical | identical |
| Fusion | in-process | server-side PL/pgSQL |
| ANN index | none | pgvector HNSW |
| Cross-agent team decisions, preemptive context, pipeline heat bumps | no-op | active |

Three hook enrichments are PostgreSQL-only and degrade to silent no-ops on SQLite. Session
banners, auto-recall, auto-capture, checkpoints and every memory tool work on both.

## Cortex in Codex and Claude Code

Both plugins expose the complete memory tool profile and use the same 11 Cortex
hook modules. They share project-associated memories when connected to the same
store, so a decision saved in Claude can be recalled in Codex and vice versa.

With the native Codex plugin installed and its hooks trusted, Cortex:

- **Restores project context when a session starts** and recalls relevant memories
  as you submit prompts.
- **Captures significant tool results automatically**, keeping useful work
  available across sessions.
- **Preserves session state** through compaction checkpoints and durable
  session-end recording.
- **Briefs subagents** with project and role context.
- **Provides the full memory toolset** for decisions, lessons, wiki pages, ADRs,
  predictions, calibration, triggers, rules and codebase ingestion.
- **Shares memories with Claude Code** when both use the same store and project
  association. You can switch agents and retrieve what the other saved.

Claude Code uses the same Cortex memory tools and hook modules. Both plugins
support the autonomous wiki cycle, SQLite storage and optional PostgreSQL.

**Verified on installed hosts:** Claude wrote a random test payload and Codex
retrieved it; Codex wrote another and a fresh Claude session retrieved it. Neither
read prompt supplied the expected payload. Both hosts excluded the test record
when recalling from another project, and both delivered Cortex context through
native startup hooks. [Read the verification and tool traces](docs/verification/claude-codex-handoff-2026-09-22/README.md).

Hook trust is part of Codex setup: review `/hooks` after installation or a changed
hook definition, then start a fresh session. Event mapping, task-context handling
and session-end delivery are documented in the [Codex integration guide](docs/codex-plugin.md).
Cognitive profiles are shared too; the current profile builder derives them from
Claude Code session logs, so that historical input must exist for either host to
retrieve a populated profile.

## Every other MCP host

Any host that can launch the stdio server gets the complete memory tool profile,
with SQLite by default and PostgreSQL as an option. A direct MCP registration,
including `codex mcp add`, provides explicit `remember` and `recall` tools.
Automatic lifecycle behavior comes with the native Claude Code or Codex plugin.
The Claude Desktop bundle provides tools without hooks. ChatGPT web would require
a remote deployment; this repository ships a local stdio server.

The launch command on every host is the PyPI package. The `[sqlite]` extra enables
sqlite-vec vector search; without it the store still works, with vector search disabled.

```bash
uvx --from "hypermnesia-mcp[sqlite]" hypermnesia-mcp
```

**Gemini CLI** ships as an extension (`gemini-extension.json` is in this repository):

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/cdeust/Cortex
```

**Codex and ChatGPT desktop** have a native plugin with the full tool surface and the same
11 lifecycle hooks the Claude Code plugin installs. It reads the
same saved backend selection as the Claude Code launcher (`~/.claude/methodology/backend.json`),
so both hosts write to one store (since 4.23.0); explicit `CORTEX_MEMORY_STORE_BACKEND`, `CORTEX_BACKEND` or a database URL
still wins. Pre-install
the package once so the plugin's first `uvx` handshake reuses the local uv cache instead of
spending its startup budget downloading a Python environment:

```bash
uv tool install "hypermnesia-mcp[sqlite]"
codex plugin marketplace add cdeust/Cortex
codex plugin add hypermnesia-mcp-codex@cortex-codex-plugins
```

The direct fallback registers the executable without the plugin:

```bash
codex mcp add cortex --env CORTEX_MEMORY_STORE_BACKEND=sqlite -- hypermnesia-mcp
```

The host boundary, the measured startup ceiling and the public-directory requirements Cortex
deliberately does not claim are in [docs/codex-plugin.md](docs/codex-plugin.md).

## Green software engineering

Cortex runs a standing efficiency programme, gated by the same evidence rule as
the retrieval work: **no unsourced efficiency claim ships.** Waste is treated as
a defect with a reproduction, not as a virtue to advertise.

### The measurement harness — and what it does not establish

`benchmarks/energy/` implements the [Green Software Foundation SCI
specification](https://sci.greensoftware.foundation/): operational emissions
`O = E × I`, embodied allocation `M = TE × TS × RS`, reported per functional
unit. For the embedding path the functional unit is **1000 model input tokens**,
counted from the tokenizer's own `attention_mask` — never estimated from
characters.

Read `benchmarks/energy/README.md` before quoting anything from it. Its own
first paragraph is the important one: the automated fixtures exercise arithmetic
and failure paths, they **do not measure device energy and do not establish an
energy improvement.** Further, by design:

- **No default carbon factors.** `--carbon-intensity` (gCO2eq/kWh) and
  `--embodied` (gCO2eq/s, an *already allocated* rate) are mandatory operator
  inputs, validated before any model import. The harness records the values and
  their units; it does not vouch for their provenance. You supply the region,
  observation period, lifecycle assessment and reservation assumptions.
- **A stated boundary.** `raw_system_energy_j` is the sensor's combined
  CPU+GPU+ANE estimate. It is neither wall-plug energy nor a complete device SCI
  score: memory, storage, screen, power-supply losses, model warm-up and token
  counting are all excluded.
- **Artifacts or it did not happen.** A successful run preserves `results.json`,
  a `MANIFEST.json` of commit and source hashes, and the exact analyzed
  `powermetrics.txt` snapshot.

No energy results are committed to this repository. That is deliberate: a
figure measured on one operator's machine, region and duty cycle is not a
property of the software, and publishing it as one would be the drift this
programme exists to prevent.

### What has actually shipped

Efficiency work lands as ordinary reviewed PRs. Two workstreams are merged:

| Workstream | Change | PR |
|---|---|---|
| **CI / build** | run pytest once, on the coverage leg, instead of twice | [#475](https://github.com/cdeust/Cortex/pull/475) |
| | build runtime images only on Docker changes + a weekly validation | [#476](https://github.com/cdeust/Cortex/pull/476) |
| | cache pinned dependency and actionlint downloads | [#477](https://github.com/cdeust/Cortex/pull/477) |
| | sdist under 5 MB, with a byte-identical wheel | [#478](https://github.com/cdeust/Cortex/pull/478) |
| | measured job timeouts; cancel superseded PR runs | [#479](https://github.com/cdeust/Cortex/pull/479) |
| | bound the local Docker build context | [#481](https://github.com/cdeust/Cortex/pull/481) |
| | stop exporting an unreadable layer cache on every PR run | [#506](https://github.com/cdeust/Cortex/pull/506) |
| **Runtime** | defer unused pipeline hook imports | [#482](https://github.com/cdeust/Cortex/pull/482) |
| | route PostToolUse hooks by the tool names they handle | [#483](https://github.com/cdeust/Cortex/pull/483) |
| | audit and clean orphan plugin dependencies | [#484](https://github.com/cdeust/Cortex/pull/484) |
| | rotate telemetry and detached-worker logs | [#485](https://github.com/cdeust/Cortex/pull/485) |
| | persist hook cascade cadence; cool down misses | [#486](https://github.com/cdeust/Cortex/pull/486) |
| | pinned CPU-only Torch on Linux — no CUDA payload pulled | [#487](https://github.com/cdeust/Cortex/pull/487) |

The hook work is the load-bearing one, because hooks run on *every* tool event.
Deferring the handler/store stack keeps hook boot at **~0.05 s** against
**~0.6 s** for the full registry import (measured 2026-07-28; the constant is
cited in `mcp_server/hooks/auto_recall.py` at its call sites, per the
no-invented-constants rule).

### Demand reduction is the primary lever

The largest efficiency term in an LLM-assisted workflow is not this server's own
CPU — it is the tokens a model must process because the right context was not
found the first time. That makes retrieval quality an energy property, and it is
why the benchmark tables above and this section are the same programme:
`response_budget.py` bounds a payload and keeps ids so truncation stays
resumable, the reranker degrades to first-stage scores rather than fetching a
model, and `CORTEX_RERANKER_OFFLINE=1` refuses the download outright.

This paragraph is a design rationale, not a measurement. Cortex publishes no
token-savings or CO2 figure for end-to-end agent sessions, because it has not
measured one.

---

## Verification

The v4.14.1 figures above are backed by a per-mechanism ablation campaign — full *n*, single-seed, with code SHAs, dirty flags, manifests, and per-row JSON preserved; the v4.20.0 figures are a single measurement without one:

- **LongMemEval-S, 17 rows, n=500** — `docs/benchmarks/e1-v3-results.md`. Per-mechanism deltas at the calibrated equilibrium + category-specialization analysis.
- **LoCoMo, 14 rows, n=1986** — `docs/benchmarks/e1-v3-locomo-results.md` (pre-fix) and `docs/benchmarks/e1-v3-locomo-results-post-fix.md` (post plasticity result-shape fix). Two-baseline design (NO_CONSOLIDATION / WITH_CONSOLIDATION).

The full per-mechanism evidence lives in the thermodynamic paper (§6.3); the BEAM decay dose-response (§6.4) documents a re-scoped negative result after a dirty-store confound was caught and traced. **[Thermodynamic Memory vs. Flat-Importance Stores (PDF, 34 pages)](docs/arxiv-thermodynamic/main.pdf)** · **[Stage-Aware Context Assembly (PDF, 39 pages)](docs/arxiv-context-assembly/main.pdf)**.

---

## Under the hood

The mechanisms above are implemented as 36 system mechanisms spanning encoding, consolidation,
retrieval and forgetting. Each is cited to published work and exposed as a live system vital. The
[bibliography](docs/papers/bibliography.md) is
the check: its entry count is what the references badge reports, and a gate fails the build if
the two disagree.

Clean Architecture, concentric layers: `server → handlers → core ← shared`, and
`infrastructure → shared`. Core is pure and testable without mocks.
[docs/agent-guidance.md](docs/agent-guidance.md) is the map;
[docs/mcp-tools.md](docs/mcp-tools.md) is the tool reference.

</p>

[Where Claude's memories go](https://ai-architect.tools/notes/how-cortex-remembers)
follows a memory from the hook that captures it to the recall that brings it back, and a decision
from its ADR file to the session that reads it, with every claim linked to the lines of the
v4.22.0 release ([en français](https://ai-architect.tools/fr/notes/how-cortex-remembers)).

## Limits worth knowing before you install

- Automatic capture and context injection are provided by the native Claude Code and
  Codex plugins. Direct MCP connections use explicit memory tools.
- SQLite fusion is in-process and unindexed. Fine at personal scale, slower at very large one.
- The retrieval scores above are retrieval-only. They say nothing about answer quality.
- Provenance grading is local and structural. It checks that a reference resolves, not that a
  claim is true; a DOI or arXiv link is never auto-verified.
- No energy or carbon figure is published, for the reasons stated above.
- First use downloads both the embedding and reranking model files. Optional integrations, remote
  PostgreSQL and OTLP telemetry add network activity only when explicitly configured; see
  [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

## Security

Runs **100% locally** — MCP over stdio, the storage backend (SQLite file or PostgreSQL on localhost) never leaves your machine (the optional [hypermnesia-mcp-viz](https://github.com/cdeust/cortex-viz) companion binds its server to 127.0.0.1). No data leaves your machine. SafeSkill scan: **94/100** (code 97, content 88 — [docs/safeskill-report.json](docs/safeskill-report.json)).

## Privacy Policy

Cortex is **local-first**: your memories, conversations, and profiles stay on your machine — stored in a local SQLite database (`~/.claude/methodology/memory.db`) by default, or in a PostgreSQL database you control. Cortex sends **no** memories, content, or telemetry to the author, Anthropic, or any third party. The only outbound network activity is a one-time download of open-source embedding/reranking models from Hugging Face (model files only), plus any integrations you explicitly configure. Full policy: **[PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md)**.

The neuroscience and information-retrieval algorithms encoded in this software are derived
from published academic work cited in
[`docs/papers/bibliography.md`](docs/papers/bibliography.md) and inline in the source via
`# source:` annotations (Friston on predictive coding, Anderson & Lebiere on rate-distortion
forgetting, Nader et al. on retrieval-induced lability, McClelland et al. on consolidation,
and others). The MIT license covers this implementation; it does not assert ownership over
the underlying mechanisms, which remain attributable to their original authors and
publications.
