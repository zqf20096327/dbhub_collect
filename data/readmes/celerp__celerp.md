## Install

| Platform | Link |
|----------|------|
| Windows (.exe) | [Download](https://celerp.com/download-thanks.html?dl=win) |
| Linux (.deb) | [Download](https://celerp.com/download-thanks.html?dl=linux) |
| macOS (.dmg) | [Download](https://celerp.com/download-thanks.html?dl=mac) |

**Double-click. No account. No credit card. Your computer securely becomes the server for your office**

Or install via pip:

```bash
pip install celerp
celerp init        # sets up the database and launches Celerp
```

Open **http://localhost:8080**. Done.
Your office can securely access the system at your IP address :8080.

No PostgreSQL to install: `celerp init` uses your existing PostgreSQL server if one is
running, and otherwise starts a self-contained bundled database — no `sudo`, no system
service. Point it at a specific server with `celerp init --db-url postgresql+asyncpg://…`.

Running headless or under a process manager? Use `celerp init --no-start` to set up
without launching, then have your service run `celerp start` — see
[Run as a service (systemd)](CONTRIBUTING.md#run-as-a-service-systemd).
Updates install automatically overnight; the owner can turn that off from the update
card in the notifications panel.

## How it works

Celerp runs on your machine and keeps its primary database local. Optional Connect features can relay remote access or send selected data to Celerp cloud services.

- **No setup** - the desktop app bundles Postgres, runs migrations on launch, opens in your browser
- **No lock-in** - your data stays in a standard Postgres database you control
- **Teams** - run as a local server, teammates connect over the LAN

## Modules

Every business domain is a self-contained module. The full set ships with the download:

| Module | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `celerp-inventory` | Items, stock levels, locations, barcode scanning, valuation |
| `celerp-contacts` | Contacts, addresses, tags, notes, file attachments |
| `celerp-docs` | Invoices, POs, quotations, credit notes, receipts |
| `celerp-accounting` | Chart of accounts, journal entries, P&L, balance sheet |
| `celerp-reports` | AR/AP aging, sales, purchases, inventory valuation |
| `celerp-subscriptions` | Recurring billing, auto-invoice generation |
| `celerp-manufacturing` | BOMs, production orders, merge/split/transform |
| `celerp-labels` | Label printing, barcode generation |
| `celerp-verticals` | Industry presets - configure for your business type on first run |

The onboarding wizard lets you pick your industry. Modules can be toggled any time at **Settings > Modules**.

### Build your own

> "My vision for Celerp is that anyone with AI coding tools can describe what their business needs and get a module that imports right into the system."
>
> Noah Severs, Founder

Every feature above is a module on one loader API, and you can build against the same API. A module is a Python package you drop into Celerp's `modules/` folder; it adds its own tables, API routes, and UI pages, no fork or build step.

- [**celerp-module-template**](https://github.com/celerp/celerp-module-template) - a working example module you can run in about ten minutes, plus a lint script
- [**Build a module**](https://www.celerp.com/docs/modules) - the guide
- [**community-modules**](https://github.com/celerp/community-modules) - a directory of community-built modules, and how to list yours

## Architecture

- **Event-sourced** - every change is an immutable ledger entry, projections materialize queryable state
- **Modular** - each domain is a plugin with its own models, routes, and projections
- **Python/FastAPI** backend, **FastHTML** UI, embedded **PostgreSQL**
- SQLite in-memory for tests - no external dependencies to run the test suite

---

## Development

```bash
git clone git@github.com:celerp/celerp.git
cd celerp
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
celerp init   # creates DB, runs migrations, starts servers
```

`celerp init` boots a bundled PostgreSQL when no server is running, so no `sudo` and no
system Postgres are required. To develop against your own server instead, pass
`--db-url postgresql+asyncpg://…`.

Open **http://localhost:8080**. Run tests with `pytest tests/`.
