# Cerberus

Cerberus is a command-line password manager written in C++. It stores credentials in an encrypted SQLite database, using strong cryptography and a simple, user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Secure storage:** Passwords are encrypted using libsodium (XChaCha20-Poly1305) and protected by a master password-derived key (Argon2id).
- **SQLite backend:** All credentials are stored in a local SQLite database.
- **Automatic password generation:** Generates strong, random passwords for new entries.
- **Simple CLI:** Add and retrieve credentials with straightforward commands.
- **Cross-platform:** Designed for Linux, but portable to other platforms with minimal changes.

## Usage

After building, run the program:

```sh
./main
```

You will be prompted to create or unlock your vault with a master password. Available commands:

- `add` — Add a new credential (website, user, password is generated automatically)
- `get` — Retrieve a password for a given website and user
- `quit` or `exit` — Exit the program

Example session:

```txt
Commands:  add   get   quit
> add
Website: example.com
User identifier: alice
Generated password: [displayed password]
✓ Stored / updated credential.
> get
Website: example.com
User identifier: alice
Password: [displayed password]
> quit
```
