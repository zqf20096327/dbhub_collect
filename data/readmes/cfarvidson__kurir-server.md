# Kurir

A self-hosted email client inspired by [HEY](https://www.hey.com). Kurir connects to your existing email via IMAP/SMTP and gives you a calmer, more focused experience. Open source under the [O'Saasy License](LICENSE).

## Features

- **Screener** — New senders land here, not your inbox. You decide who gets through.
- **Imbox** — Only mail from approved senders. The important stuff.
- **The Feed** — Newsletters and subscriptions in a browsable feed.
- **Paper Trail** — Receipts and notifications, kept separate.
- **Full-text search** — PostgreSQL-powered search across every email.
- **Snooze & follow-ups** — Snooze messages until later. Set follow-up reminders.
- **Reply Later & Pinned** - Mark threads you owe an answer, and pin threads to keep them at hand, also from the archive.
- **Private thread notes** - Notes on a thread that only you see, never sent with replies.
- **AI Rules** - File a sender's mail by what it says, with a plain-language criterion checked by your Claude or Grok subscription.
- **Draft generation** - A compose assistant that writes replies and new mail from an instruction and a tone, using your Claude Pro/Max or SuperGrok subscription (no API key).
- **Calendar** - Google, Outlook, CalDAV and calendar URLs in Week, Day and Month views, invitations answered from the mail, and available hours per weekday.
- **Scheduled send** — Write now, send later. Full To/Cc/Bcc support.
- **Threaded conversations** — Messages grouped by thread, reply inline.
- **Compose in Markdown** — Rich email authoring with auto-save drafts.
- **Keyboard-first** — Full shortcuts, command palette, vim-style navigation.
- **Native iPhone and Mac apps** - Swift apps on the App Store, offline-first, with push notifications through the kurir-notify relay.
- **Mobile PWA** — Install on iOS and Android with push notifications.
- **Dark mode** — Light, dark, or match your system.
- **Multi-account** — Connect multiple email accounts, send from any.
- **Archive** — Archive with undo, swipe gestures on mobile.
- **Contacts** — Create, edit and group contacts, linked to your senders.
- **Mobile API** — Bearer-token API with delta sync, offline-queued actions, drafts, scheduled send, contacts and files — powers the native iPhone and Mac apps. Device sign-in runs through your server's own login page (PKCE-bound), so it works against any self-hosted domain.
- **MCP** - Connect Claude to your instance at `/mcp` to work with mail, contacts and the calendar.
- **Admin dashboard** — System health, sync status, user management.
- **One-command install** — Single `curl` command provisions a fresh server.
- **Auto-updates** — Checks for new versions, one-click update from admin.
- **Backup & restore** — Full database + config backup and restore, plus per-user settings backups saved to your own Sent folder.

## Claude / MCP

Point Claude at `https://<your-domain>/mcp` as a custom connector. Sign in
with your Kurir passkey and approve access. The agent can read and search
mail, triage, screen senders, list calendars and read calendar events, and change
your own settings. Sending, creating or deleting events, replying to
invitations and other destructive actions ask for a confirmation in Claude
first. Revoke
access under Settings → Connected apps. See the [MCP docs](https://kurir.io/docs/mcp) for the full tool list.

Clients identify themselves with a Client ID Metadata Document (Claude does
this on its own). For a host that cannot publish one, an admin registers it
under Admin → Apps with its redirect URI and hands over the generated
`client_id`. PKCE is required either way; there is no client secret.

## Quick Start

### One-Command Install (Recommended)

Provisions a fresh Ubuntu 22.04+ or Debian 12+ server with everything:

```bash
# Public domain (default) — Caddy + Let's Encrypt
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cfarvidson/kurir-server/main/install.sh | sudo sh

# Tailscale-only deploy — Tailscale Serve handles TLS
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cfarvidson/kurir-server/main/install.sh | sudo sh -s -- --mode tailscale

# HTTP-only (local VM testing — passkeys won't work)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cfarvidson/kurir-server/main/install.sh | sudo sh -s -- --mode http
```

The installer handles Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis, TLS, and all secrets. Once running, open the URL to complete the setup wizard. Run with `--help` to see all options.

### Setup Wizard

On first visit, Kurir walks you through:

1. **Create account** — Set your name and register a passkey (WebAuthn)
2. **Connect email** — Enter your IMAP/SMTP credentials (or use OAuth for Gmail/Outlook)
3. **Initial sync** — Kurir fetches your emails with a live progress indicator
4. **Done** — You land in your Imbox

### Local Development

```bash
pnpm install
docker compose up postgres -d
cp .env.example .env
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:push
pnpm dev
```

## Email Providers

Kurir works with any IMAP/SMTP provider:

| Provider | IMAP Host             | SMTP Host           | Auth                                                                       |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gmail    | imap.gmail.com        | smtp.gmail.com      | OAuth or [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) |
| Outlook  | outlook.office365.com | smtp.office365.com  | OAuth or App Password                                                      |
| iCloud   | imap.mail.me.com      | smtp.mail.me.com    | [App Password](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102654)                     |
| Fastmail | imap.fastmail.com     | smtp.fastmail.com   | App Password                                                               |
| Yahoo    | imap.mail.yahoo.com   | smtp.mail.yahoo.com | App Password                                                               |

For other providers, use the custom option and enter your server details.

## Deployment Options

### Option A: One-Command Installer

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cfarvidson/kurir-server/main/install.sh | sudo sh
```

Handles everything: Docker, secrets, HTTPS, database. Idempotent — safe to re-run.

### Option B: Docker Compose

```bash
cp .env.production.example .env
# Edit .env — set DOMAIN, generate secrets
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

### Option C: Kamal

For multi-host deploys across Tailscale-connected servers. See [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md).

Always use `bin/deploy`, never bare `kamal`. The wrapper loads `~/.kamal/kurir-secrets.env` (mode 0600). Running `kamal` without that file injects empty secrets and wipes production config.

```bash
bin/deploy setup    # First deploy
bin/deploy          # Subsequent deploys
```

## Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev          # Dev server (Turbopack, port 3000)
pnpm build        # Production build
pnpm lint         # ESLint
pnpm db:push      # Push Prisma schema to DB
pnpm db:generate  # Regenerate Prisma client
pnpm db:studio    # Prisma Studio GUI
pnpm add-user     # CLI: add user with IMAP/SMTP config
pnpm list-users   # CLI: list users
pnpm sync-user    # CLI: trigger sync for user(s)
pnpm backup       # Create backup archive (pg + redis + env)
pnpm restore      # Restore from backup archive
```
