## 安装

需要 **Windows, 微信 PC 4.1+, [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)**。
在 Claude Code 里执行：

```
/plugin marketplace add chengmarc/wechat-to-ai
/plugin install wechat-to-ai@chengmarc
```

> 装好后不需要记任何命令，直接说人话就行。

## 首次使用

1. **保持微信登录**，然后对 Claude 说「帮我准备微信数据」。
2. 本插件的所有命令都是 **PowerShell**，所以第一次运行时 Claude 会请求执行 PowerShell 的权限。
   请选择**允许**；如果选项里有「不再询问 / 始终允许」，选它，之后就不会再被打断。
   > 全新的目录默认没有这个权限，会在第一条命令就卡住 —— 这不是出错，同意即可继续。
   > 事后想调整，在 Claude Code 里用 `/permissions` 管理。
3. Claude 会跑 `preflight` 自检，并把接下来该做什么逐条告诉你。
4. 准备数据需要管理员权限，但**你不用自己开管理员终端，也不用记任何命令** ——
   Claude 会替你弹出一个提权窗口，你只需要点一下「是」。
5. 窗口跑起来后，请在微信里**逐个点开聊天（新旧都开）、通讯录、收藏、朋友圈并搜索**
   —— 微信只在相关内容被打开时才准备对应的数据，浏览得越全，能读到的记录越全。
   等窗口里的计数不再增长，**在那个窗口里按一次 `Ctrl+C`**，然后告诉 Claude 你按完了。
6. Claude 接着会（同样弹一次提权窗口）把数据库建好。之后想拿到最新消息，让 Claude 重跑一次建库即可；
   日常使用直接提问。

> **Windows Defender 等杀毒软件会将本程序标记为可疑，需要手动放行。**

# Declarations

*This statement is made by the maintainer of `wechat-to-ai` and forms part of the
documentation of this project. Defined terms have the meanings given in `LICENSE`.*

### §1 — Nature and operation of the Software

1.1 `wechat-to-ai` is a **local-only** data-portability utility. Database
construction, query, and export occur entirely on the operator's own machine.

1.2 The Software performs **no network transmission of Operator Data** and
contains no telemetry, analytics, crash reporting, or update channel.

1.3 The maintainer **has no technical means of access** to any data the Software
produces. The Software reads only data already present on the operator's device
and from the account signed in there; it is not a network or remote-access tool.

### §2 — Purpose and legal basis

2.1 This project is supplied to help a natural person obtain a portable copy of
their own personal data, a right recognised in the jurisdictions in which the
project is offered, including GDPR Articles 15 and 20, PIPEDA Schedule 1
Principle 9, and the California Consumer Privacy Act.

2.2 It does not authorise any particular act. Lawfulness of use in any given
jurisdiction remains the operator's responsibility, per §6.2 of `LICENSE`.

### §3 — Findings of record concerning the WeChat platform

*The following are matters of published record by named institutions. They are
reproduced here, with citation, to document the conditions that make a local
data-portability tool necessary. Each is the finding of its author and is
attributed as such.*

| # | Source | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | **The Citizen Lab** — *We Chat, They Watch* (May 2020) | Documents content surveillance of files exchanged entirely among non-China-registered accounts, and their use in censorship system training. |
| 3.2 | **The Citizen Lab** — *Should We Chat, Too?* (15 October 2024) | Reports that much WeChat network traffic lacks forward secrecy, that some metadata is sent in plaintext, and that server-side message visibility is inherent to content censorship. |
| 3.3 | **Government of Canada**, Treasury Board Secretariat (30 October 2023) | Records a finding that WeChat presents an unacceptable privacy and security risk and was removed from government-issued mobile devices. |
| 3.4 | **Directly verifiable by any user** | The platform provides no facility by which a user may obtain a complete, human-readable copy of their own message history. |

3.5 Taken together, the cited record describes a platform whose servers can read
message content, that uses content analysis in censorship workflows, that has been
assessed by a G7 government as posing unacceptable privacy and security risk, and
that does not provide users with a complete human-readable export of their own
records.

6.1 The Software is furnished for use **on the operator's own machine**, against
**the operator's own account data**, in compliance with applicable law.

6.2 Use against any account, device, or data store that the operator is not
authorised to access is prohibited, falls outside the licence grant, and
terminates it (`LICENSE` §4.3, §11.2).

### §7 — Notice to complainants

7.1 The maintainer will consider any good-faith notice of claimed infringement or
circumvention on its merits and will act promptly where a claim is substantiated.
