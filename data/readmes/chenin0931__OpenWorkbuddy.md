# OpenWorkbuddy

OpenWorkbuddy is a local-first macOS desktop agent for real work: files,
Shell, the web, an existing Chrome session, MCP, Skills, Memory and scheduled
automations. It is designed as a recoverable workbench with explicit permission
boundaries rather than a chat wrapper.

> **Project status:** early open-source preview. The current local artifact is
> an unsigned Intel macOS build. Signed, notarized and universal releases require
> maintainer-provided Apple Developer credentials and are not published yet.

## Product principles

- **Local-first and BYOK.** Structured state, tools and audit data live on the
  Mac. Users connect their own OpenAI, Anthropic or Kimi/Moonshot API key.
- **Model intent is not authority.** Every external action becomes a structured
  tool request that is validated and, when necessary, presented for approval.
- **Recoverable by design.** Work state, tool receipts and checkpoints survive
  app and worker restarts.
- **Evidence over celebration.** Diffs, checks, sources and outputs are shown as
  result evidence; ordinary completion does not generate a success dashboard.
- **No developer account, cloud sync or telemetry.** Network requests still occur
  when users call a model, search/fetch the web, use remote MCP or act on a site.
  See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

## What it includes

- OpenAI, Anthropic and Kimi/Moonshot model profiles with replaceable BYOK keys.
- Permissioned file access, stale-write protection, snapshots, Diff and undo.
- Per-work access switch beside “Add files”: keep the project boundary and
  request approval, or explicitly grant full-disk local access for that work.
- The access choice is made in each work composer, persists with that work and
  does not create a broad global default. External, destructive and irreversible
  actions stay behind approval in either mode.
- Shell execution with a deterministic risk policy: ordinary categorized
  commands follow the per-work access mode, while destructive or external side
  effects still require approval.
- Cursor-based managed processes for long-running commands, with timeout,
  cancellation, crash interruption and Artifact-backed logs.
- Web Search and safe Web Fetch with redirect, address and response-size checks.
- MCP stdio and Streamable HTTP, encrypted secrets and OAuth PKCE.
- Progressive Skill loading, confirmed Memory and local capability packages.
- Chrome Manifest V3 bridge with explicit task-scoped tab binding.
- Local sub-agents, schedules, crash recovery, audit export and macOS notifications.
- Ordered Context Pipeline, provider-neutral tool-receipt integrity checks,
  hierarchical Trace and SHA-256-chained audit entries.
- Sandboxed Markdown-to-PDF export with automatic output registration.
- Quiet Workbench UI with grouped work turns, an inline expandable execution
  process and a persistent artifact shelf for outputs, screenshots and changes.

### Explainable execution, not hidden chain-of-thought

For work that uses tools, each user message maps to one OpenWorkbuddy response.
The response contains a compact “execution process” row that expands in place to
show deterministic summaries such as planning, search, file reads, writes,
verification and recovery. These steps are derived from persisted Trace spans,
tool receipts and plan state; they do not expose or fabricate a model's private
reasoning. Raw parameters, call identifiers and redacted errors stay in the
secondary Diagnostics view.

## Architecture

```text
React Renderer (sandboxed, no Node or secrets)
    │ versioned preload API + Zod validation
    ▼
Electron Main / product Harness
    ├── Run Coordinator, Context, Memory, Skills, Automation
    ├── Tool Broker, risk policy, approvals, audit
    ├── SQLite WAL, safeStorage, Artifact Store
    ├── Agent Host utilityProcess ── Pi Agent Loop ── model APIs
    ├── Tool Runner utilityProcess ── files / Shell / Web / MCP
    └── Unix socket ── Rust Native Host ── Chrome extension
```

The Agent Loop uses MIT-licensed `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core` and
`@earendil-works/pi-ai` for model streaming, tool turns, steering, cancellation
and provider abstraction. OpenWorkbuddy keeps credentials, permissions,
approval grants, state, tools and recovery in its own Harness. Pi is not treated
as a security boundary.

[the Context and Harness Engineering design](docs/context-and-harness-engineering.md),
[the Pi decision record](docs/adr-001-pi-agent-core.md) and
[the security model](docs/security.md) for the detailed boundaries.

## Repository layout

```text
apps/desktop          Electron, React, Main Harness, Agent Host, Tool Runner
apps/chrome-extension Chrome MV3 tab bridge
apps/native-host      Rust Native Messaging ↔ Unix socket bridge
packages/contracts    Versioned TypeScript and Zod process contracts
packages/core         Policy, state machine, path guard and verification logic
```

## Requirements

- macOS 14 or later
- Node.js 24
- pnpm 10.28 (`corepack` recommended)
- Rust stable
- Google Chrome for optional Chrome Bridge development

## Development

```bash
corepack pnpm install
corepack pnpm dev
```

On first launch, add an OpenAI, Anthropic or Kimi/Moonshot API key and authorize
a workspace. Keys are system-encrypted and are not returned to the Renderer.
Kimi protocol details and the opt-in online smoke test are documented in
[docs/kimi.md](docs/kimi.md).

## Verification

```bash
corepack pnpm typecheck
corepack pnpm lint
corepack pnpm test
cargo test --manifest-path apps/native-host/Cargo.toml --locked
corepack pnpm build
corepack pnpm test:e2e
```

The test suite covers provider event conversion, policy classification, path
guards, persistence and crash recovery, tool cancellation, approvals, Chrome tab
authority, WorkTurn aggregation, accessibility and fixed visual scenarios.

## Local packaging

```bash
corepack pnpm package:mac
```

Without a Developer ID this produces unsigned x64 `.app`, `.dmg` and `.zip`
artifacts plus a Chrome extension ZIP under the ignored `outputs/` directory.
Do not redistribute unsigned development builds as trusted production releases.
See [docs/release.md](docs/release.md) for the signing/notarization pipeline and
the Chrome/Native Host READMEs for local bridge installation.

## Security and privacy

- The Renderer has no Node integration, model key or filesystem authority.
- Model tool requests must pass through Main-process policy and approval checks.
- File access uses real-path, symlink and path-traversal checks. Full-disk mode
  is explicit, persisted per work and still subject to macOS privacy controls.
- Approved Shell commands and user-installed stdio MCP servers are local code;
  Electron utility processes are not an OS hard sandbox.
- Authorized browser or file content may be sent to the user's configured model
  provider when required for the task.

Please report vulnerabilities through the process in
[.github/SECURITY.md](.github/SECURITY.md), not a public exploit report.
