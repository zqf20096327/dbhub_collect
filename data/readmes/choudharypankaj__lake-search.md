Databend has a genuinely strong text-search engine — BM25 relevance through `score()`,
order-sensitive phrase search, English stemming, index-backed fuzzy matching, Ngram substring
search. What it has no equivalent of is the query *language* an engineer arriving from
Elasticsearch already knows. lake-search closes that gap by **translating** rather than passing
through, so the habits people already have either work or fail loudly.

- 🔍 **Lucene-style syntax** — `field:value`, `field:(a OR b)`, `"phrases"`, `AND`/`OR`, `-exclude`, `field:[a TO b]`, `field:>100`, `field:*`, `term~2`, `pref*`, `/regex/`, `term^2`
- 🧨 **Kills the silent failures** — a fuzzy `term~N` and a wildcard `*` return **zero rows and no error** inside this engine's search syntax; they are rewritten, not forwarded
- 🧠 **Knows the one-search-function rule** — the engine allows at most one search function per *scan*, so full-text logic folds into a single `query()` call where it can and into a row-key subquery where it cannot; two in one scan is `[1065]`
- 🔁 **Rewrites what the engine gets wrong** — `a OR -b` has its negative clause silently dropped here, so De Morgan folds it into the one clause shape that evaluates correctly, still inside a single `query()`
- 🧮 **Excludes with an anti-join, not a bare `NOT`** — `NOT (query(x))` returns **zero** rows rather than every row when `x` matches nothing, so `-pdctl` used to blank the screen
- 📦 **Zero dependencies** — standard library only, so it vendors into a Grafana datasource plugin without dragging anything along
- 🔭 **Bootstraps itself, without a driver** — `introspect` prints probe SQL, you run it through whatever client you already have, and a second call writes the descriptor. It reads a *sampled value profile*, not only types, because a column's declared type does not tell you whether its values suit the role
- 🔌 **Schema is data, not code** — describe your table in a JSON file (`-schema`) or pick a built-in (`-preset`); unknown fields route into a `VARIANT` bag, which is what makes open-ended log schemas searchable, and a schema that cannot support something says so when it loads rather than when a panel renders
- 📊 **A Grafana macro** — `$__search(msg, '$q')` expands in the datasource backend, retiring the hidden predicate-generating dashboard variable
- ✅ **Conformance by row count, not by exit code** — 98 cases across two fixtures asserting *relationships between counts*, because a wrong query here is indistinguishable from an empty result
- 🧪 **Verified live** — every engine claim below was measured on a running warehouse, not read off a doc page

<img alt="Lucene-style search text compiled to a Databend SQL predicate" src="docs/img/pipeline.svg">

## Quick start

```console
$ lake-search compile 'level:(error OR warn) region -snapshot'
((lower(level) = lower('error') OR lower(level) = lower('warn')) AND query('(msg:region) NOT (msg:snapshot)'))
```

One statement, one search function: the field-scoped group becomes ordinary SQL on a plain
column, and the full-text half — including its exclusion — folds into the single `query()` call
the engine allows. On the reference table that predicate returns 955 rows, 296 of them from the
last two hours.

```bash
go install github.com/choudharypankaj/lake-search/cmd/lake-search@latest
```

```
lake-search compile [-score] <query>    print the WHERE predicate
lake-search sql [-table T] <query>      print a complete SELECT
lake-search conform                     print the row-count conformance script
```

Or as a library:

```go
import "github.com/choudharypankaj/lake-search/databend"

schema, notes, err := databend.LoadSchema("my-logs.json") // or databend.Preset("k8s-logs")
// notes  -> "no severity field: a log view over this schema cannot colour …"
r, err := databend.CompileString(userInput, schema)
// r.SQL       -> predicate, safe to splice into WHERE
// r.Warnings  -> "this will be a full scan", "fuzziness ignored", …
// r.UsesMatch -> whether score() is legal alongside it
```

## Why

The gap is worse than a missing feature, because the familiar syntax does not error — it silently
returns nothing:

| What you type | What Databend does | What you conclude |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `snapshot~1` | `~1` is not understood; **0 rows** | "there are no matches" |
| `snapsh*` | the term is **truncated at the star**, and `snapsh` is not a token; **0 rows** | "prefix search is broken" |
| `snapshot*` | truncated to `snapshot`, which *is* a token; **full result set** | "prefix search works!" |
| `reg*on` | truncated at the star, so this searches for `reg`; **36 rows, none about regions** | "there were 36 region events" |
| `pod:tikv-??????` | `?` is not a wildcard, it is compared literally; **0 rows** | "no pods match" |
| `no`, `not`, `to`, `is` | 33 English stopwords are deleted from the query; **0 rows** | "the word isn't in the logs" |
| `"not ready"` | the phrase loses `not` and stops being a phrase; **9x too many rows** | "there are 2,320 of these" |
| `"peer stat*"` | inside quotes the star is punctuation: the phrase splits there and `stat` is not a token; **0 rows** against 88,441 for `peer status` | "there are no peer status lines" |
| `msg:not` | the value is read as an operator and the filter disappears; **every row** | "everything matches" |
| `http://a.com` | the colon reads as a field selector; **0 rows** | "that URL isn't in the logs" |
| `-absent_term` | the search function prunes the scan; **0 rows** | "nothing survives the exclusion" |
| *(empty box)* | `match(col,'')` matches nothing; **0 rows** | "there are no logs" |
| `RemoteStopped OR level:ERROR` | a search function under `OR` prunes the scan to the blocks its index says match, and the other branch is evaluated only there; **253,587 rows against a true 343,695** — and **0** if the text term matches nothing | "that is all the errors there are" |
| a word the collector parsed out of the message | `err=RemoteStopped` is moved into the `kv` bag, so `RemoteStopped` is not in `msg` any more; **0 rows** against 605 for the same word in the reconstructed line | "that error never happened" |
| `latency_ms:>30` on a bag key | one non-numeric value anywhere in that key fails the **whole statement**: `[1006] invalid float literal ... to_float64('Some(25)')`, where the truth is 39,140 rows | "the query is broken" |
| `err:RemoteStopped` through the index alone | `query()` is tokenised and stemmed, so it matches a value merely *containing* a token that stems to the term: `kv.request:command` is **501 rows** whose value is `batch_commands`, where the equality is 0 | "501 requests were `command`" |

Every row above is rewritten into SQL that answers the question that was asked, with one
exception, and the exception is marked: `"peer stat*"` is **explained rather than rewritten**.
Quotes and a wildcard ask for contradictory things — one says "these exact characters in this
order", the other says "any token shaped like this" — and guessing which one was meant would be
inventing a query nobody typed. The compiler says what the engine will do with it instead:
measured on two disjoint windows, `"peer stat*"` returns 0 both times where `peer status` returns
88,441 and 38,076.

The exclusion row is the most quietly wrong, and it is the one a responder is most likely to hit:
excluding a noise pattern that has stopped being emitted in the selected window empties the screen
rather than leaving it untouched. It is covered under
[engine rules](#why-a-leading-not-is-compiled-as-an-anti-join).

The last row is the sharpest, and its reason is narrower than it looks — it is the **empty
argument** that poisons the statement, not the boolean around it. An empty search function prunes
the index scan before any surrounding boolean is evaluated, so even `(1=1 OR match(msg,''))`
returns zero. A *non-empty* search function composes with ordinary SQL exactly: measured,
`query('msg:peer')` is 109,950, `lower(level) = lower('warn')` is 9,287, their conjunction 341,
and their disjunction 118,896 — the union to the row.

## Syntax

| Lucene | Databend |
| --- | --- |
| `term` | `query('col:term')` |
| `"two words"` | `query('col:"two words"')` — order-sensitive |
| `a b`, `a AND b` | `query('(col:a) AND (col:b)')` — one call, not two |
| `a -b` | `query('(col:a) NOT (col:b)')` — bare and trailing, never `AND NOT` |
| `-a -b` | De Morgan to `(col:a) OR (col:b)`, then excluded by anti-join — **not** a bare `NOT` |
| `a OR -b` | De Morgan to `(b) NOT (a)`, then excluded the same way |
| `term~2` | `match(col, 'term', 'fuzziness=2')` |
| `pref*`, `*sub*`, `a*b`, `a?b` on the text column | one **token**: `lower(col) RLIKE '(^\|[^a-z0-9])pref[a-z0-9]*([^a-z0-9]\|$)'`, `*` being any run of token characters and `?` exactly one. A star does not cross a word boundary — served as `LIKE '%reg%on%'`, `reg*on` is exactly `RLIKE 'reg.*on'` and 4,196 of its rows contain no word matching reg…on at all. It does not stem either, so the bare token still finds inflections the pattern does not |
| a wildcard the tokenizer would split (`tikv-tikv-*`, `*0.0.0.0:8686/x*`) | `LIKE` — it cannot describe one token, so the substring reading is kept and the warning says which one was used |
| `pod:tikv*`, `pod:a?b` on a plain column | `LIKE 'tikv%'`, `LIKE 'a_b'` — anchored, because on a value column a prefix really does mean "the value starts with" |
| a stopword (`no`, `not`, `to`, …) | `lower(col) RLIKE '(^\|[^a-z0-9])no([^a-z0-9]\|$)'` — the index deletes these 33 words, so they are matched by scan |
| `"a b"` the analyzer cuts to one token | `query('col:b')` **and** `lower(col) LIKE lower('%a b%')` — the token keeps the index and its stemming, the scan checks the adjacency the quotes asked for. A phrase the analyzer leaves alone, `"snapshots"` included, is untouched: it is 17,595 rows through the index against 9 as a substring, because the index stems |
| `"a b"` the analyzer empties | `lower(col) LIKE lower('%a b%')` — nothing left for the index to match |
| `and`, `or`, `not` — any case | an operator only where an operator is **grammatical**: `and`, `or`, `&&` and `\|\|` between two terms, `NOT` before a term. Anywhere else — the whole query, a field's value, the only thing inside a `field:(…)` group, leading with nothing to its left — it is the word the user typed, matched by a word-boundary scan; read as an operator there, `msg:(not)` and a bare `not` compiled to a filter that matched everything. `NOT` is the one that must be capitalised, because it **inverts** the term it takes while `and`/`or` only join terms that keep their own meaning either way: `msg:(not ready)` is the two words, `msg:(NOT ready)` is the complement of `ready` — 3,537 rows against 711,157 over `ts < '2026-08-19 08:00:00'` (715,185 rows). A *trailing* `and`/`or` is dropped rather than demoted — `region or` is someone mid-keystroke, so it still returns `region`. The cost of the word reading, stated rather than hidden: on a single-valued column `level:(error not warn)` is three ANDed equalities and can never match — write `level:(error -warn)` or `level:(error NOT warn)` |
| `term^2` | `(col:term)^2` inside the one `query()` — reorders `score()`, matches the same rows |
| `/re/`, `field:/re/` | `col RLIKE 're'` — not a search function, but no index serves it |
| `file.rs:360`, `file.rs` | a source **file position**: `query('(line:…) OR (source_file:…)') AND (source_file = 'file.rs:360' OR source_file LIKE '%/file.rs:360' OR line LIKE '%file.rs:360%')` — one call over both surfaces to prune, a literal comparison to make it exact. Read as `field:value` it was a bag key nothing writes, and 0 rows; read as a token search alone it was 40% of the table. Needs a declared `source_file` role; without one nothing changes |
| `field:value` | `lower(field) = lower('value')` — there is no case-insensitive `=` here |
| `field:(a OR b)` | the group compiles under the field: SQL on a plain column, one `query()` on the text one |
| `-field:value` | `COALESCE(NOT (…), TRUE)` — so `x` and `-x` partition the table |
| `field:>100` | `field > 100` |
| `ts:>2026-08-18 22:30:00` | one instant, space and all; a bound that is not a complete instant is a compile error, because the engine rounds it up to the top of the unit in silence |
| `field:[a TO b]`, `{a TO b}`, `[a TO *]` | `field BETWEEN a AND b`, `>`/`<` — plain SQL, never inside `query()` |
| `field:*` | `field IS NOT NULL AND field <> ''` on a real column; plain `kv['field'] IS NOT NULL` on a bag key, where a key present with an empty value still exists |
| `"key with space":value` | a quoted name is a field name, so a bag key containing a space is reachable |
| `+term` | consumed — adjacency already means AND, and the literal `+term` matches nothing |
| `"a b"~N` | `query('col:"a b"~N')` — real proximity, `N` honoured |
| `http://a.com`, `localhost:3000` | whole-term searches: a colon before `//`, or a port, is not a field selector |
| *(empty)* | `1=1` — and no search function anywhere in the output |
| unknown field | `kv['field']::VARCHAR` via the VARIANT column; `kv.a.b` chains subscripts |

## The one-search-function-per-scan rule

Verified on a live warehouse (Databend v0.34.0), and it shapes the whole design:
**a search function may appear only in a `WHERE` clause, and at most one may appear in any one
scan.** Both halves are load-bearing and both were measured.

*Only in `WHERE`.* `SELECT query('line:peer') …`, `HAVING … AND query(…)` and `count_if(query(…))`
are each `[1065] search function query can only be used in where clause` — even with a single call.
That is why the conformance suite counts with `count(*)` over a `WHERE` and never with `count_if`
over a search function.

*One per scan, not per statement.* Two search functions in one `WHERE` are `[1065] duplicate search
function for table 0` — the same call twice, `query()` beside `match()`, two `match()`es, under
`AND` or under `OR`, and even on two different indexed columns:

```sql
match(msg,'a') AND match(msg,'b')                 -- [1065] duplicate search function for table 0
match(msg,'a') AND query('msg:b')                 -- same
query('msg:a') AND query('msg:b')                 -- same
query('msg:peer') AND query('source_file:raft')   -- same, two different indexed columns
```

But the limit binds a **scan**, so one statement may hold as many search functions as it has scans.
Measured over `ts < '2026-08-20 04:00:00'` (1,072,856 rows):

```sql
query('line:rpc') AND query('line:RemoteStopped')          -- [1065]

query('line:rpc')                                          -- 717 rows
  AND _row_id IN (SELECT _row_id FROM logs.k8s_logs WHERE query('line:RemoteStopped'))
  AND _row_id IN (SELECT _row_id FROM logs.k8s_logs
                  WHERE match(line,'RemoteStopped','fuzziness=1'))
```

— the same 717 as the search-free reference `line ILIKE '%rpc%' AND line ILIKE '%RemoteStopped%'`,
and the same 717 with the calls spread over the two scans in either order, all three hoisted, four
calls over four scans, or nested four subqueries deep. A row-key subquery is one such scan; so is
each branch of a `UNION ALL`, each CTE, and each scalar subquery in a select list. That is why the
compiler can put more than one text condition in a statement, and it is the reason the
[row-key subquery](#why-a-schema-declares-a-row-key) works at all rather than merely being a
workaround for block pruning.

Two consequences worth knowing. `score()` needs a **bare** search function in its own scan: beside
only a hoisted call it is `[1065] Score function must be used together with match or query
function`, which is why `-score` emits `0` rather than `score()` for any query whose search function
was hoisted or anti-joined. And a search function cannot be applied to a joined or derived table at
all — `match(a.line,'peer')` in a self-join is `[1006] Unable to get field named …` — so a row-key
subquery is the only way to put two of them in one answer.

So boolean full-text logic still folds into one `query()` call wherever it *can* — `a b` merges and
costs nothing extra — but where it cannot, the extra call is given a scan of its own rather than
being refused, and the refusal survives only where there is nowhere to hoist to: a schema that
declares no `row_key`. Inside that one `query()` call, the mini-language has three undocumented
behaviours that all fail silently:

| Form | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `(a) AND NOT (b)` | **0 rows** — `AND NOT` is broken in every spelling |
| `(a) NOT (b) AND (c)` | everything after the first `NOT` is **ignored** |
| `(a) OR NOT (b)` | the negative clause is **silently dropped** |
| `NOT (…)` alone | `[1903] Invalid query: Only excluding terms given` |
| `(a) AND (b) NOT (c)` | correct — matches the equivalent LIKE exactly |
| `(a) NOT (b) NOT (c)` | correct — matches the equivalent LIKE exactly |
| `(a) NOT ((b) NOT (c))` | correct — a `NOT` nested in a negative group evaluates properly |
| `msg:peer msg:status` | the default operator is **OR**, not AND |

lake-search emits only the forms that work: negatives are bare and trailing, never `AND NOT`, and
operators are always explicit. The two shapes the engine gets wrong are rewritten rather than
refused — an all-negative search and an `OR` with a negative both fold through De Morgan into one
positive `query()` under a SQL `NOT`:

```
   p1 OR p2 OR NOT n1 OR NOT n2
== NOT( n1 AND n2 AND NOT(p1 OR p2) )
-> NOT( query('(n1) AND (n2) NOT ((p1) OR (p2))') )
```

Still one search function, and the result is still a *text* fragment, so it composes further —
which is only sound because a `NOT` nested inside a negative group evaluates correctly here.
Measured: `query('(region) NOT ((peer) NOT ((store)))')` returns 15,634, exactly
20,144 − 4,853 + 343.

### Why a leading `NOT` is compiled as an anti-join

`NOT (query(x))` is **not** the complement of `query(x)`. The search function is pushed into the
index scan whatever the surrounding boolean, so when `x` matches no row the scan is pruned to
nothing and the `NOT` returns **zero rows instead of every row**. Measured over a 152,317-row
window:

| token | `query()` | `NOT (query())` | anti-join |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `zzzznosuchtoken` | 0 | **0** | 152,317 |
| `qqqqwwww` | 0 | **0** | 152,317 |
| `pdctl` | 0 | **0** | 152,317 |
| `tiflash` | 23,381 | 128,936 | 128,936 |

The three absent tokens are the defect. "Everything except a term that does not occur here" is
the whole window, and the bare `NOT` answers nothing — which is exactly what a responder gets
when excluding a noise pattern that has stopped being emitted in the selected time range. No SQL
wrapping rescues it: `COALESCE`, `CASE`, `= FALSE`, `AND TRUE` and `1=1 OR …` were each measured
and each returns zero, because the pruning happens before any of them is evaluated.

So a *leading* negation compiles to an anti-join instead, which keeps tokenised semantics rather
than degrading to a substring `NOT LIKE`:

```sql
COALESCE(msg NOT IN (SELECT msg FROM logs.k8s_logs WHERE msg IS NOT NULL AND query('msg:pdctl')), TRUE)
```

The search function now runs in its own scan, where pruning it to nothing correctly yields an
*empty exclusion set*. It costs a second scan — measured at 0.25–0.32s against 0.12s for the
(wrong) bare `NOT`, on the same half-million rows — and it needs `Schema.Table`, which is the one
thing a `WHERE` fragment cannot infer. A negation that keeps a positive term beside it, `a -b`,
never comes here at all: it stays inside the single `query()` call, where the positive drives the
scan and an absent excluded term costs nothing.

Two consequences worth knowing. The exclusion's search function is in a *different scan*, so it
neither counts against the one-per-scan rule — `snapshoot~1 -tiflash` compiles now, and returns
17,608 rows — nor satisfies `score()`, whose binder does not see through the subquery. And
because the outer scan carries no search function, it sees every row including the most recent
hour of ingest, which the inverted index has not caught up on; a fresh row that should have been
excluded is included until the index does.

Structured predicates, `LIKE` and ranges are *not* search functions, so they compose freely with the
single `query()` call. Fuzziness is the exception: it exists only as an option argument to `match()`,
so a fuzzy term is a search function in its own right and cannot merge into the shared `query()`
string. Combined with another full-text term it therefore takes a scan of its own — `a b~1` compiles
to a `query()` call beside a row-key subquery — rather than emitting SQL that dies with `[1065]`, and
it is refused only when the schema declares no `row_key` and there is nowhere to hoist to.

> **A small `LIMIT` and a row-key subquery do not mix (engine bug, Databend v0.34.0).**
> `SELECT ts, level … WHERE _row_id IN (SELECT …) LIMIT 10` is
> `[1006] Unable to get field named "2"`; `LIMIT 11` and above is fine, one projected column is fine
> at any limit, and `count(*)` is always fine. `lake-search sql` defaults to `LIMIT 100`, above the
> threshold — but `-limit 3` over a hoisted or anti-joined query walks into it.

## Testing against a real warehouse

`go test ./...` covers the compiler offline. It cannot tell you whether the *engine* behaves as
documented — and on this engine a wrong query is indistinguishable from an empty result, so a
harness that checks "the SQL executed successfully" proves nothing.

`lake-search conform` generates a script that asserts on **row counts**:

```console
$ lake-search conform > conformance.sql
$ # run conformance.sql through lakesql, the REST endpoint, or a Grafana panel
```

Each statement prints PASS or FAIL. Assertions are relative — `snapshoot~1` must return at least
what `snapshot` returns, `"status peer"` must return nothing when `"peer status"` returns many — so
the suite stays valid as the table grows.

An upper bound is not enough here. `actual <= baseline` passes when `actual` is zero, which is
precisely the failure the suite exists to detect, so cases whose result must be non-empty assert
`narrows` (non-zero **and** not wider), and the negation cases assert `partitions`: `a -b` and `a b`
must add up to `a` exactly, with both halves non-empty. A `NOT` that swallowed its predicate would
return 0 and pass an upper-bound check; it cannot pass this one.

Three cases exist to catch the *engine* rather than the compiler:

- **negation** relies on the optimiser handling an inverted-index scan under `NOT`, which is not
  something `match()` pushdown obviously respects;
- **literal `%`** depends on Databend honouring backslash escapes inside string literals;
- **the time-of-day bound** depends on the engine *not* quietly accepting a truncated timestamp
  literal, which it does — `'2026-08-18T22'` is read as 22:00:00 with no diagnostic, so the
  assertion is a strict inequality against a bound an hour earlier rather than an upper bound.

There are two fixtures, because a suite has to know the schema it was written against.
[`testdata/conformance.json`](testdata/conformance.json) names `"preset": "k8s-logs"` and its 86
cases run against the live table; many of them pin a bare term against an explicit `msg:` baseline,
so under a schema whose default field is a different column the two sides measure different columns
and the assertion stops meaning anything.
[`testdata/conformance-line.json`](testdata/conformance-line.json) is the derived-surface suite, 25
cases over a frozen copy carrying the STORED column and the widened index group.

All 86 cases in the first suite were re-run against the live warehouse (Databend v0.34.0, 975,927
rows) and pass, and all 25 in the second against the 967,912-row frozen copy. The earlier figures
below were measured on the same table at ~603k rows.
Every partition identity holds to the row — 19,962 + 5,717 = 25,679 inside one `query()`,
20,309 + 5,370 = 25,679 for the De Morgan fold, 594,705 + 8,277 = 602,982 for a negated bag key,
504,803 + 98,179 = 602,982 for a full-text exclusion, and 305,406 + 297,576 = 602,982 for a
bracket range — so negation is **exact** here, not approximate. (Counts drift between runs only
because the table gains about a thousand rows a minute; each identity is one statement, so each
balances against its own snapshot.)

Three of those are worth reading twice. The bag-key one only balances because negation on a
column is compiled as `COALESCE(NOT (…), TRUE)`: `NOT (col = 'x')` is NULL — and therefore
excluded — wherever the key is absent, which is 97% of rows for most keys. The full-text one only
balances because the exclusion is an anti-join rather than a bare `NOT`. And a partition whose
three counts straddle the search-function boundary cannot be asserted at all, because a search
function sees only the blocks the index scan has reached — which is why the De Morgan case is
scoped under a third term that keeps all three of its counts inside one `query()` call.

Note also that a co-occurrence pair has to be chosen against real data, and chosen for abundance
rather than for mere existence:
`snapshot` and `peer` never appear in the same line in that table, so an intersection case built on
them is vacuous — but a pair meeting in five rows out of half a million is barely better, because it
fails the day those rows age out or the process that wrote them stops running, and the failure looks
exactly like a compiler bug.

[`docs/grafana-macro.md`](docs/grafana-macro.md) has a `$__search(col, '$q')` macro for
[`databendlabs/grafana-databend-datasource`](https://github.com/databendlabs/grafana-databend-datasource).
It is an additive change to the plugin's backend macro registry — one new file and two map entries —
and it retires the hidden predicate-generating dashboard variable entirely.

[`dashboards/`](dashboards/) generates a Grafana dashboard built on the macro: Lucene search box,
component / level / log-format / machine / exclude-machine variables, event deltas, field facets, and
a BM25 relevance panel.

Two Grafana traps worth knowing before you wire this up yourself:

- **Template-variable queries never reach the datasource backend**, so `$__timeFilter` and
  `$__search` do not expand in them. Variable queries have to be plain SQL.
- **A raw-SQL logs panel carries no column hints** — the plugin only attaches them to
  visual-builder queries — so Grafana falls back to "first time field, first string field" to pick
  the log line. With `SELECT ts, level, msg, …` that is `level`, and every line renders as `INFO`.
  Alias to the logs-frame names: `ts AS timestamp, msg AS body, level AS severity, kv AS attributes`.

## score() and the empty search box

`score()` is rejected unless a search function exists **anywhere in the statement**:
`[1065] [SQL-BINDER] Score function must be used together with match or query function`. Because the
`score()` call sits in the select list, **no predicate can rescue it** — `SELECT score() … WHERE 1=0`
still fails. That was verified live, and it rules out the obvious workaround.

`CompileScore` therefore emits a search function that matches nothing:

```sql
SELECT msg, score() FROM logs.k8s_logs WHERE match(msg, 'zzqqnolakesearchmatchqqzz')
```

The binder is satisfied, the panel returns zero rows, and the user sees an empty relevance panel
rather than a red error.

## Notes on proximity

`"a b"~N` is genuine phrase proximity here — `N` is an edit distance, not an on/off switch — and it
is easy to measure otherwise. The full ladder, frozen:

| query | rows | | query | rows |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | ---: |
| `"region peer"` | 654 | | `"peer status"` | 88,441 |
| `"region peer"~1` | 654 | | `"status peer"` | 0 |
| `"region peer"~2` | 4,593 | | `"status peer"~1` | 0 |
| `"region peer"~3` | 4,593 | | `"status peer"~2` | 88,441 |
| `"region peer"~10` | 4,853 | | | |
| `region peer` (AND) | 4,853 | | | |

Strictly monotone, converging on the unordered AND from below, and the reversed phrase first
matches at exactly `~2` — a transposition costs two, which is textbook Lucene. Sample only the
exact phrase and a large `N` and both land on plateaus, which reads as "`N` is ignored"; an earlier
revision of this library rejected the marker at compile time on precisely that mistake.

## Notes on fuzziness

Edit distance is measured against the **stem**, not the word typed. With the `english_stemmer`
filter, `unreachable` is indexed as `unreach`, so `unreachble` is two edits from the stored token
rather than one and needs `~2`. Any UI exposing fuzziness should say so, or users will see it behave
inconsistently between words the stemmer alters and words it leaves alone.

## Schema

A schema is **data**. It names the table, its columns, their kinds and its indexes, so pointing
lake-search at your own log table is a file rather than a patch:

```
lake-search sql -schema my-logs.json 'level:error latency_ms:>250 timeout'
lake-search sql -preset k8s-logs-line '...'      # a built-in
export LAKE_SEARCH_SCHEMA=my-logs.json           # or set it once
lake-search schema -schema my-logs.json          # validate and describe it
```

[`testdata/schema-app-logs.json`](testdata/schema-app-logs.json) is a complete worked example over a
table with nothing in common with the built-in one — a different name, expressions rather than column
names for the time and severity roles, two attribute bags one of which is prefixed, and typed bag
keys. The shape:

```json
{
  "table": "app.request_log",
  "default": "line",
  "time": "ts", "severity": "sev",
  "display": ["ts", "sev", "service", "route", "status", "line"],
  "indexes": [
    {"name": "idx_text", "kind": "inverted", "columns": ["line", "message", "attrs"],
     "tokenizer": "english", "filters": ["english_stop", "english_stemmer"]},
    {"name": "idx_text_ng", "kind": "ngram", "columns": ["line", "message"]}
  ],
  "bags": [
    {"column": "resource_attrs", "prefix": "resource"},
    {"column": "attrs", "keys": {"latency_ms": "number"}}
  ],
  "fields": [
    {"name": "line", "kind": "text", "aliases": ["body"]},
    {"name": "message", "kind": "text", "aliases": ["msg"]},
    {"name": "ts", "column": "from_unixtime(ts_micros / 1000000)", "kind": "timestamp"},
    {"name": "sev", "column": "upper(severity_text)", "kind": "string", "aliases": ["level"]},
    {"name": "status", "kind": "number"}
  ]
}
```

Five things about that file are load-bearing rather than decorative.

**Indexes are declared, and the per-field flags are derived from them.** Nothing restates "this
column has an NGRAM index" or "this column's index deletes stopwords" — those are read off the index
declaration, which is what you can copy straight out of `SHOW CREATE TABLE`. That removes the
failure the old Go-literal shape invited: claiming `english_stop` on a column whose index has no such
filter routes 33 ordinary words onto needless full scans, and claiming it is absent when it is
present makes those 33 searches return zero rows silently.

**All the searchable surfaces must sit in one index group, and that is checked when the file loads.**
A single `query()` call reaches only the columns of one index. Measured, a table carrying separate
`idx_line(line)` and `idx_line2(line2)` answers each column alone and fails
`[1065] columns line2, line don't have inverted index` for a query naming both — so a schema spread
across two groups describes a table where ordinary queries cannot run, and the right time to say so
is at load.

**A field may be an expression, not just a column name.** `from_unixtime(ts_micros / 1000000)` is a
perfectly good time role. Expressions are aliased to the typed name in a select list, so callers get
something they can address.

**Roles replace hardcoded column names.** `time`, `severity`, `source_file` and `display` are how the
CLI and the dashboard generator build a statement without knowing this deployment's spelling; `SELECT ts, level,
component, pod, msg` used to be a literal in both, and the dashboard used to write eleven panels'
worth of column names into its SQL with no check that the table had them — pointing it at another
table emitted 129 references to columns that did not exist. It now refuses the panels a schema has
not earned and says which role was missing.

**Optional roles are optional, and their absence is announced.** A table with no attribute bag and no
severity column is a real shape, not a broken one — but a bagless schema turns `store_id:7` into a
compile error and a severity-less one leaves a log panel unable to colour anything, and neither fact
is visible at query time. Loading prints them:

```
schema my-logs.json: no attribute bag: a field name that is not declared here is a compile error
  rather than a bag lookup, so `store_id:7` will be refused instead of read from a VARIANT
schema my-logs.json: no severity field: a log view over this schema cannot colour or count by level
```

`source_file` is the one optional role whose absence is *not* announced, and deliberately: it is the
state every deployment starts in, and it changes nothing a reader could otherwise see — a schema
without it compiles every query exactly as it did before the role existed. See
[The file position](#the-file-position).

### The attribute bag

Fields not declared in the schema are read from a bag, which is what makes an open-ended log schema
searchable: the unified TiDB/TiKV/PD/TiCDC log format carries arbitrary `[k=v]` pairs whose names
differ between components, so no fixed column list can cover them. A bag with a `prefix` is addressed
explicitly (`resource.pod`); bags without one are catch-alls, tried in declaration order.

**A bag in the index group is searched through the index.** An inverted index covers a VARIANT column
by JSON path, so `err:RemoteStopped` compiles to `query('kv.err:RemoteStopped')` — index-backed, with
no per-key DDL and no per-key declaration, including keys that first appear after the index was
built. It keeps the equality beside it, because the index is *wider* than the equality it
accelerates: `query('kv.request:command')` returns 501 rows whose value is `batch_commands`, where
the equality returns 0. A value the index deletes cannot go through it at all — a row with
`kv = {"verb":"the"}` is found by the equality and not by `query('kv.verb:the')` — so a stopword
value skips the index, and so does a key with a space in it, which the query language cannot spell.

**Bag key types are resolved at emission, and declaring one is an override.** This engine does not
need static per-key types the way a fixed-type map does: a VARIANT is self-describing per value and
the index covers it by path. A numeric bound converts with `TRY_CAST`, and that choice is
load-bearing rather than stylistic — a plain cast does not mis-sort, it *kills the statement* on the
first value that is not a number:

| | rows |
| --- | --- |
| `kv['store_id']::VARCHAR::DOUBLE > 100` | `[1006] invalid float literal ... to_float64('Some(25)')` |
| `TRY_CAST(kv['store_id']::VARCHAR AS DOUBLE) > 100` | 39,140 |
| `component::DOUBLE > 5` (a plain column, same failure) | `[1006] ... to_float64('other')` |
| `TRY_CAST(component AS DOUBLE) > 5` | 0 |

1,243 of that key's 40,516 rows hold a `Some(25)`-style debug rendering, which is enough to lose the
other 39,140. The decomposition, so the figure is checkable rather than quoted: 40,516 rows hold the
key, **39,273** cast, 39,140 of those exceed 100 and 133 do not, and 40,516 − 39,273 = **1,243** do
not cast at all. Where a cast survives, the two agree exactly — both 32,929 for `kv['term'] > 40`.

**What TRY_CAST costs, stated rather than buried.** Those 1,243 rows are *silently excluded* from any
bound on that key, and store_id is the mild case. Rows that hold the key but whose value does not
cast, same window:

| kv key | rows with key | silently dropped | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `store` | 16,154 | 15,784 | 97.7% |
| `to` | 6,604 | 5,681 | 86.0% |
| `observe_id` | 3,369 | 3,369 | 100% |
| `vote` | 4,952 | 2,171 | 43.8% |
| `duration` | 1,945 | 1,943 | 99.9% |
| `store_id` | 40,516 | 1,243 | 3.1% |
| `from` | 9,937 | 360 | 3.6% |
| `id`, `tableID` | 5,059 / 231,986 | 5 / 3 | — |

30,559 rows across nine keys, and the distribution is the problem more than the total: the keys a
human puts a bound on are the worst ones. Every one of `duration`'s 1,945 values is a Go duration —
`47.823614ms` — so `duration:>100`, the most natural latency query there is, returns **0 of 1,945**.
That is true whatever the descriptor says; see [Bootstrapping a descriptor](#why-it-looks-at-the-data)
for what a value profile can and cannot do about it.

So every numeric conversion emits a warning that names the field, says the rows are excluded rather
than counted, and hands over the predicate that counts them
(`count_if(kv['duration'] IS NOT NULL AND TRY_CAST(…) IS NULL)`). **Be aware that in Grafana that
warning is invisible today** — the frame-notice channel is not in the deployed plugin, so warnings
reach only the SQL comment in the query inspector (see
[`docs/grafana-macro.md`](docs/grafana-macro.md)). That is a gap in the plugin rather than in the
compiler, and until it closes a bound on a bag key is a query to check by hand.

Comparing as text instead is the other wrong answer and it is silent: on the 33,300 rows carrying
`kv['term']`, `term:>40` is 30,584 as text against 32,929 as a number, and `term:<9` answers **32,961
rows where the truth is 0**, because every value from 10 to 99 is textually less than `"9"`.

### The derived text surface

The collector lifts `k=v` pairs out of the message, so text a reader can see in the line is not in
`msg` any more. A field declared with a `derived` expression is a STORED computed column that puts it
back — the message concatenated with the bag's values — carrying the same inverted index, so a bare
word finds it:

| | rows |
| --- | --- |
| `query('msg:RemoteStopped')` | 0 |
| `query('line:RemoteStopped')` | 605 |
| `query('line:RemoteStopped AND msg:rpc')` | 585 — two columns, one `query()` call |

It exists **only** for the bare word. There is no all-fields search in this query language: `query()`
with no field is an error and so is `kv.*:x`, and a compiler cannot write an explicit cross-field OR
over keys it does not know. Field-scoped bag search does not need it.

It concatenates the bag's *values*, not its `key=value` pairs, and that is a trade-off in both
directions: values-only means a key name is reachable only as field syntax, while the pair form would
make a bare `err` match every row that merely *has* an `err` key. Since the bag is separately
searchable by key, the noise is not worth buying.

**Making it the default field widens existing searches.** That is the intent, and it is still a
behaviour change every saved link will notice: `query('msg:snapshot')` is 17,649 rows and
`query('line:snapshot')` is 25,488 — 7,839 rows, +44%, that carry the term only in bag values.
`msg:` typed explicitly still means exactly what it always did. This is also why it is a separate
preset (`k8s-logs-line`) rather than a change to `k8s-logs`: the migration is a deployment decision,
and pointing a schema at a column the table does not have is `[1065]` on the first query.

### The file position

Every unified TiDB/TiKV/PD/TiCDC line carries its call site in brackets, so a reader can see it and
therefore types it:

```
[2026/08/20 16:20:59.070 +00:00] [INFO] [compaction_runner.rs:360] ["collected 0 compaction candidates"]
```

Both ways of typing it used to answer **zero**. The collector parses the call site into its own column
and the derived surface is the message plus the bag's *values*, so a bare `compaction_runner.rs`
reached no surface that holds it; and `compaction_runner.rs:360` parses as the field
`compaction_runner.rs` with the value `360`, which is not a column, so it took the VARIANT path and
compiled to a lookup for a bag key nothing writes. It warned — and in Grafana a warning is a SQL
comment nobody sees.

A schema that declares the **`source_file` role** gets both spellings compiled against the field that
holds a call site. `name.ext` is a file name, `name.ext:digits` is a file position, and each is
searched in the default surface **and** in that field — one `query()` call that PRUNES the scan, with
a literal comparison ANDed on top that makes the answer EXACT:

```sql
query('(line:"manager.go:124") OR (source_file:"manager.go:124")')
  AND (lower(source_file) = lower('manager.go:124')
       OR lower(source_file) LIKE lower('%/manager.go:124')
       OR lower(line) LIKE lower('%manager.go:124%'))
```

Both halves are load-bearing. `source_file:` is a **token** search and this analyzer splits on `_` as
well as `.`, so the search function alone answers for every file whose name *ends* with the one you
typed: over `ts < '2026-08-20 16:25:00'` (1,292,338 rows) `query('source_file:manager.go')` is
**513,055** rows — 40% of the table — of which 199 are that file and 512,856 are `*_manager.go`
(199 + 512,856 = 513,055 exactly). The literal comparison cannot prune, and the search function
cannot anchor; together they land on the oracle. Measured against a SQL truth computed with no
compiler in the loop:

| bare term | search function alone | this compiler | SQL oracle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `manager.go` | 514,446 | **1,590** | 1,590 |
| `client.go` | 41,086 | **17,487** | 17,487 |
| `compaction_runner.rs` | 3,790 | **3,790** | 3,790 |
| `compaction_runner.rs:360` | 1,571 | **1,571** | 1,571 |
| `server.go:342` | 1,720 | **1,720** | 1,720 |
| `tidb_monitor_controller.go:101` | 7,752 | **7,752** | 7,752 |

Eleven terms were checked on both presets, 22 of 22 exact. The refinement roughly doubles a
sub-second query and the search function still earns its place: for `compaction_runner.rs`, 0.12s for
the search function alone (wrong), **0.24s** for search-plus-filter, 0.39s for the filter with no
search function, best of three over the same window. On the plain-column preset exactness is free —
0.15s before, 0.16s after — because there was no search function to keep.

The `%/X` disjuncts are what keep this honest on a deployment whose collector stores a path
(`components/raftstore/src/peer.rs:100`): the role promises a call site, not a basename. And
`LIKE 'X%'` rather than `LIKE 'X:%'` assumes nothing about the separator, so `file.rs:360`,
`file.rs 360` and a bare `file.rs` all match.

**It is a union rather than a redirect, and this table is what refuses the redirect.** Three log
formats arrive here and they do not agree on where the call site ends up. Measured over the closed
window `[2026-08-20 16:00:00, 16:25:00)` — 8,142 rows:

| term | `line:` | `source_file:` | union | a redirect would give |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `compaction_runner.rs` (tikv, bracket format) | 0 | 30 | 30 | 30 |
| `compaction_runner.rs:360` | 0 | 15 | 15 | 15 |
| `reflector.go` (csi-driver, klog) | 0 | 69 | 69 | 69 |
| `factory.go` (named in a klog message) | 69 | 0 | 69 | **0** |
| `warnings.go:110` (controller, logfmt `caller=`) | 32 | 0 | 32 | **0** |

The bracket format has its position parsed out, so only `source_file` holds it. A logfmt line —
`caller=…/rest/warnings.go:110`, `source=compact.go:565` — has no bracket to parse, so `source_file`
is empty and the position survives in the bag and therefore in `line`. 143 of those 8,142 rows carry
a `.rs`/`.go` file-shaped token in `line`, so this is not a corner; over the wider closed window
`[2026-08-20 00:00:00, 16:00:00)` (286,604 rows) `factory.go` is 2,559 in the text against 0 in the
column and `warnings.go` splits 1,280 against 128, the two sides disjoint wherever both are non-zero
— 1,280 + 128 = 1,408 and 19 + 16 = 35, measured.

The text half is therefore never *absent*, but it is no longer a strict superset of what a bare term
answered before: the literal comparison described below narrows it, deliberately and in one measured
family. What is pinned structurally is presence, not size — see
`TestSourceFileKeepsTheTextSurface`.

**The shape rule is structural, not a list of known extensions.** `name.ext` needs name segments of
file-name characters and an **all-letters** extension, so `10.0.0.1`, `192.168.176.28` and `v8.5.7`
are ordinary text — their last segment is digits. It is *not* keyed on `{go, rs}`, and that is a
deliberate refusal: this warehouse's `source_file` holds 972 distinct values and only those two
extensions occur in any of them, so a rule keyed on them would pass every test this data can pose and
fail silently the first time a C++ or Python component logs into the table. `handler.py:88` and
`db_impl_compaction_flush.cc:1042` therefore behave exactly like `.rs`, with no code change.

The price is that `foo.bar`, `example.com` and `k8s_logs.ts` (a column reference in a logged
statement) are read as files too. That is affordable *because* the rule expands rather than
redirects: the extra disjunct is on a column holding no such token, so it contributes nothing and
removes nothing. Under a redirect the same false positive would have thrown the answer away.

A **declared** name always outranks the shape: a field or alias spelled `parser.go`, a bag addressed
by column or prefix (`kv.compaction_runner.rs:360` is the bag), or a bag key declared under exactly
that spelling. Quotes narrow the search back to the text surface, which is what makes them the escape
hatch — `"compaction_runner.rs:360"` is the message and nothing else — and so does naming a field.

**The text half is an intersection, and that is the point.** The prose disjunct is
`line LIKE '%X%'` ANDed with the analyzed match beside it, because neither test is right alone and
their blind spots are opposite. The **analyzer** splits on `-` and `.` alike, so it cannot tell the Go
module `client-go` from the file `client.go`: `query('line:client.go')` is 16,501 rows and the literal
11,769, and all 4,732 it drops carry `client-go` — `/go/pkg/mod/k8s.io/client-go` (3,548),
`github.com/tikv/client-go/v2/tikv.` (852), `pkg/mod/k8s.io/client-go` (230),
`k8s.io/client-go/informers/factory.go` (79), `/gomodcache/k8s.io/client-go` (23), summing to 4,732
exactly. The **literal** has no word boundaries, so it cannot tell `grpcutil.go` from `util.go`,
`leaderelection.go` from `election.go`, `sysinfo.go` from `info.go`, `terror.go` from `error.go`,
`runtime.goexit` from `runtime.go`, or `main.go:1542` from `main.go:154`. Together they reject both
families.

Which is why the exactness claim is checked against every value the table has, not a handful:
compiled and executed for all **971** distinct `source_file` values and all **262** distinct
basenames over `ts < '2026-08-20 16:25:00'`, the answer equals
`source_file LIKE 'X%' OR line LIKE '%X%'` for **963** and **250** of them, with **zero**
over-matches — and every one of the 20 differences is that oracle being wrong (13 substring artifacts
from the list above; the other 7 are the two holes recorded below). ANDing a filter onto a search
function is only safe if the search function covers it, so that was checked too: for all 1,233 values,
`count(anchored)` equals `count(anchored AND query(…))` — the file half loses nothing.

**The explicitly-scoped spellings are untouched.** `source_file:manager.go` typed by hand is still a
token search and still 513,055 rows; only the spelling this rule owns is made exact. The warning says
so, so nobody concludes the scoped form is a narrower way to ask.

**Every expansion says so**, because searching a column the user did not name is exactly the class of
thing this compiler warns about. In Grafana that warning is still a SQL comment
([`docs/grafana-macro.md`](docs/grafana-macro.md)).

**A plain column is served too, and told to expect a scan.** The role accepts `text` and `string`. A
text field is in the index group, so the position joins the one `query()` call. A plain column has no
tokens, and an equality is the wrong reading of both spellings — the stored value is the whole call
site, so `source_file = 'compaction_runner.rs'` is 0 rows for all 36 of that file's lines — so it is
matched as a literal substring instead. Measured on the `k8s-logs` preset, whose `source_file` is a
plain VARCHAR: `lower(source_file) LIKE lower('%compaction\_runner.rs:360%')` is the same 18, and
`…rs%'` the same 36. A `number` or `timestamp` role is refused at load.

Fuzziness is dropped on a file **position** and kept on a file **name**, and the difference is the
colon: fuzziness reaches this engine only through `match()`, whose query text is parsed as
`field:value`, so `match(source_file, 'compaction_runner.rs:360', 'fuzziness=2')` is
`[1903] Field does not exist: 'compaction_runner.rs'` where `match(source_file,
'compaction_runner.rs', 'fuzziness=1')` is 36.

**A deployment that declares no role keeps today's behaviour exactly** — the rule is off, both
spellings compile as they did before it existed, and both shipped conformance suites emit
byte-identical SQL either way.

## Why a schema declares a row key

`row_key` names a column identifying a row uniquely — `_row_id` on this engine. It exists for one
reason, and it is the most severe thing measured in this project.

**A search function inside a disjunction prunes the scan for the whole predicate.** The index scan
visits only the blocks the index says contain matches, and every other branch of the `OR` is evaluated
only in those blocks. So what is lost is the other branch's rows in the blocks the text term never
touched. Measured on the 5-block frozen copy, with `level=ERROR` spread across all five:

| text term | blocks touched | emitted | truth | lost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `peer`, `snapshot` | 5 of 5 | 364,945 | 364,945 | none |
| `rejections` | 4 of 5 | 276,648 | 345,850 | **20.0%** |
| `RemoteStopped` | 4 of 5 | 253,587 | 343,695 | **26.2%** |
| `the` (a stopword, 0 matches) | 0 of 5 | 0 | 343,090 | **100%** |

So `RemoteStopped OR level:ERROR` — an ordinary query, not a typo — silently lost a quarter of the
error rows. Branch order makes no difference, and the loss scales with the number of branches: a
three-way disjunction lost two of them.

The fix is to put the search function in a subquery and test row membership in the outer scan, which
is an ordinary comparison no optimiser rewrites:

```sql
_row_id IN (SELECT _row_id FROM logs.k8s_logs WHERE query('line:snapshot'))
  OR lower(level) = lower('ERROR')
```

Exact in both cases — 424,841 with a matching term and 402,974 with one that matches nothing, each
equal to its independently computed truth.

**The repo already contained half of this.** A *negated* branch under `OR` was always correct, because
a negation compiles to an anti-join and its search function therefore already sat in a subquery:
`-zzzznosuchtoken OR level:ERROR` returns the whole table. The fix is the same move at the opposite
polarity, so both are built from one constructor — `IN` for a positive branch, `NOT IN` for a negated
one.

**A search function ANDed with something else and then ORed is the same bug.** `level:WARN OR
(level:ERROR RemoteStopped)` returned **27,502 where the truth is 60,727** — 54.7% lost — because the
conjunction collapses its text child into ordinary SQL, so nothing downstream could see that a search
function was inside that branch. The whole branch is now hoisted into the subquery, and the fragment
carries a count of the search functions in it rather than the compiler inspecting its own output.

That shape also used to be *refused* in another form: `(peer level:error) OR (status level:warn)` needed
two search functions in one statement. Each branch now gets its own subquery, which is its own scan, so
it compiles — verified live at 368,007, matching 368,002 + 5 computed from the branches independently.

**With no row key declared, each shape falls back to the strongest option that is still exact.** A plain
full-text term and a negation are keyed on their own text column, and that is exact rather than
approximate: the subquery's predicate is a function of that one column, so rows sharing a value match or
miss together. Measured — `query('line:region')` is 228,209 and `line IN (SELECT line WHERE
query('line:region'))` is also 228,209, and the disjunction is exact for every term tried.

Only the **composite** branch is refused, because there the text key is genuinely unsound: the branch
constrains other columns too: two rows sharing a text value can differ in `level`, and expanding by
shared text then pulls in a row the branch excluded. Measured on the live table, where exactly two
`msg` values out of 160,802 occur at more than one level, `level:ERROR tso` is **1,728** rows
row-keyed and **1,884** msg-keyed — 156 over. The magnitude is a property of the data rather than a
ratio worth quoting. The row key is preferred everywhere anyway, for cost:
comparing an 18-byte identifier beats comparing a log line that can run to 29KB.

The AND path is untouched: a conjunction pruned to nothing is the *right* answer, so it keeps a bare
`query()` and buys no second scan.

`_row_id` is stable enough to key a subquery on a table taking thousands of rows a minute — one
statement over a closed bound is one snapshot, and `_row_id IN (SELECT _row_id FROM t)` is the whole
table while `NOT IN` of the same is 0. It is unique and never NULL over both the 1,063,259-row live
table and the 967,912-row copy. It is schema data rather than a constant because it is engine-specific:
`_block_name` and `_segment_name` exist here but identify a file, and `_row_number` does not exist at
all.

## Bootstrapping a descriptor

Writing a descriptor for a table you did not build is a lot of guessing. `introspect` does the
guessing from evidence, and records which parts were guesses.

```
lake-search introspect probe   -table logs.k8s_logs                       # 1. print SQL
lake-search introspect profile -table logs.k8s_logs -shape shape.txt      # 2. print more SQL
lake-search introspect build   -shape shape.txt -profile prof.txt -o s.json
lake-search introspect verify  -schema s.json                             # later: drift check
lake-search introspect verify  -schema s.json -shape verify.txt
```

**It never connects to anything.** Each step prints SQL for you to run through the client that
already holds your credentials, and the next step reads what came back. That keeps the module
dependency-free — the property that lets the compiler be vendored into a Grafana datasource plugin —
and it means introspection works against warehouses this tool could not reach at all: SSO-only,
air-gapped, or reachable only through a datasource that holds the credentials already. Nothing to
grant, nothing to leak, and the SQL is auditable before you run it.

It is three steps rather than two, and the third is forced. The value profile cannot be written
until the shape is known: its window needs the timestamp column, its bag-key branches need to know
which columns are `VARIANT`, and its casts have to go through `::VARCHAR` because
`TRY_CAST(ts AS DOUBLE)` is not a NULL but `[1006] unable to cast type Timestamp to type Float64`,
which fails the whole statement.

### Why it looks at the data

This is the part that earns the tool. A declared type does not tell you whether a column's values
suit a role, and the failure is silent. Measured on the live table over
`ts < '2026-08-20 00:00:00'` (997,592 rows):

| bag key | rows | cast to a number | inferred |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kv.term` | 33,300 | 33,300 | numeric — safe |
| `kv.tableID` | 250,036 | 250,033 | **refused**, 3 rows would vanish |
| `kv.store_id` | 43,546 | 42,303 | **refused**, 1,243 rows would vanish |
| `kv.to` | 6,604 | 923 | **refused**, 5,681 rows would vanish |
| `kv.duration` | 2,046 | 2 | **refused** — every value is a Go duration, `47.823614ms` |

`duration:>100` answers **0 of those 2,046 rows**. Be precise about what the profile does and does
not do about that, because the obvious claim is wrong: **it does not change the SQL.** A numeric bound
on a bag key compiles to `TRY_CAST(kv['duration']::VARCHAR AS DOUBLE) > 100` with a profile, without
one, and with `-bag-numeric` — byte for byte, verified — and the
[numeric-conversion warning](#the-attribute-bag) fires in all three. Nothing in this tool types that
key as a number at any flag setting.

What the profile buys is **knowing**. It is the only thing that can say the ratio is 2 of 2,046
rather than 2,046 of 2,046, and it puts the key in `refused` so a human reads it before writing the
query instead of after reading a zero. It also buys three decisions that are otherwise unavailable:
`-bag-numeric` has nothing to act on without it, a mostly-empty column cannot be kept out of
`display`, and a VARCHAR holding instants cannot be recognised as a time column. That is a smaller
claim than "it stops the silent drop", and it is the true one.

### What content evidence may and may not decide

Content can **demote** a type but never silently promote a column's declared one: a VARCHAR stays a
string even if every value casts, because `Number` changes how equality is emitted and the declared
type is the only thing the engine itself guarantees.

There are **two** promotions, not one, and the second is the more consequential:

- a **bag key** to `Number` — under `-bag-numeric` only, because a bag key has no declared type at
  all, which is exactly why the duration trap lives there;
- a **VARCHAR column** to `Timestamp`, read through `TRY_CAST`, when every sampled value casts *and*
  the name is a time candidate. Both halves are required: content alone promotes any stringified
  date, the name alone is the guess that types a free-text field as time.

The timestamp promotion is gated harder than the numeric one, because it is worse when wrong. A
numeric cast drops rows from one filter; the time role gates **every** time-bounded query — every
panel, every `$__timeFilter`, every conformance window — so a value that fails to cast removes its
row from all of them at once. Measured on a 3-row probe holding two ISO timestamps and the string
`yesterday`, `event_time:>2026-08-01T00:00:00Z` returns 2 of 3 and says nothing.

So: it needs at least **1,000** non-null sampled values (`-min-sample`). Below that the candidate is
recorded and the role is left **empty**, which is loud — the descriptor still loads (a table with no
time column is legal) but says so in a note, the dashboard generator refuses to emit any panel, and
`introspect build` exits non-zero. Confirm it with `-time-column NAME` and it is applied. Either way
the field carries `"conversion"`, which makes the compiler warn on **every** use:

```
$ lake-search compile -schema awkward.json 'event_time:>2026-08-20T01:00:03Z'
warning: "event_time" is not stored as timestamp — it is read through a cast (the column is VARCHAR,
read as an instant), and a value that does not cast becomes NULL, so that row is EXCLUDED from the
comparison rather than raising an error. On the time field that removes the row from EVERY
time-bounded query, not just this one. Count them with
count_if(event_time IS NOT NULL AND TRY_CAST(event_time AS TIMESTAMP) IS NULL)
```

A real `TIMESTAMP` column declares no conversion and warns about nothing, so the advisory stays
signal.

### Provenance

Every field records how it was decided, and the descriptor carries a block saying what was
considered and rejected:

```json
"introspect": {
  "profiled": true, "window": ".. 2026-08-20 00:00:00",
  "columns_digest": "fnv1a64:…",
  "roles": {
    "default": "derived-text-surface (line is a STORED column reading msg and the kv bag, and
                index idx_msg covers it, so a bare word reaches text the collector moved out of msg)",
    "severity": "canonical-name (level, rank 1 of level,severity,…) — content-sample agrees: ~5 distinct values"
  },
  "refused": ["bag key \"kv.duration\" is NOT typed as a number: 2 of its 2,046 values cast (0.1%) …"]
}
```

A guess laundered into configuration reads as fact to the next person, which is worse than no guess.
`refused` is the most important field in the block: it is the only record that a plausible inference
was deliberately *not* made.

### What it refuses to guess

Roles are decided by a type gate, then a ranked case-insensitive name match, and — **for bag roles
only** — a lone-compatible-column fallback. A lone `String` column is deliberately not guessed as the
log body: getting the bag wrong costs a lookup, getting the body wrong points every free-text search
in the deployment at the wrong column and looks like it works. The timestamp role is the exception
that uses no name list at all: a timestamp-typed column, preferring one in the cluster key, else left
empty. Unmatched roles stay blank and are refused by the load-time validation rather than filled in.

Two things are opt-in, both because their failure mode is silent:

- `-aliases` offers the other names in a role's list (`message` for `msg`). Off by default because an
  alias that shadows a bag key answers a question about the bag with the aliased column's value —
  and these are real keys on this very table: `body` on 3 rows, `service` on 476,490, `labels` on 47.
- `-bag-numeric` types a cleanly-numeric bag key as a number. Off by default because it changes only
  the **equality**, and changes it from an index-backed lookup to a full scan: `term:40` is
  `query('kv.term:40') AND lower(kv['term']::VARCHAR) = '40'` undeclared and
  `TRY_CAST(…) = 40` declared. Both return the same 26 rows, and `kv['term']` has no value with a
  leading zero or a decimal point, so the default keeps the index and loses nothing.

### It has to be told about the index

A text field outside the inverted-index group is not slow, it is **unusable** — one search function
per statement, and no index means no search function. So `SHOW CREATE TABLE` is mandatory in the
probe: it is the only form that reports an index's tokenizer and filters. If nothing indexes the
chosen default field, the descriptor records that and *fails at load naming it*:

```
refused: no inverted index covers "content", the chosen default field. …
this descriptor does NOT load: schema: field "content" is kind "text" but no inverted index covers
column "content"; declare the index, or give the field kind "string" …
```

`build` exits non-zero when the descriptor does not load, so `introspect build && deploy` cannot ship
one — the file is still written, because the fastest fix is usually to edit one line of it.

### Drift

A descriptor is a snapshot, and that is the honest cost of not holding a connection. `verify` is the
answer, and it earned its place on a real defect rather than a constructed one.

A plain column `raw` was added to `logs.k8s_logs` and the collector began populating it. No descriptor
declared it, so with a bag configured `raw:hello` compiled to `kv['raw']` — and `kv['raw'] IS NOT
NULL` was **0** against `raw IS NOT NULL` of **5,112**. The query was empty forever, and the warning
made it worse by asserting that `raw` "is not a column".

**Binding did not catch it**, which is the finding: the bind statement never mentions a column nobody
declared, so it succeeded. Only comparing the column lists finds it:

```
$ lake-search introspect verify -preset k8s-logs-line -shape verify.txt
logs.k8s_logs: 1 drift finding(s).

  • column "raw" (VARCHAR) exists in the table and is NOT declared: it will be read from the
    attribute bag and match nothing
```

It reports the other directions too — a column the descriptor names and the table has lost, an index
that grew or lost its filters, a column whose declared **type** changed, a STORED expression the table
has redefined, and a moved column digest. Against the pre-migration `k8s-logs` preset the
same live table gives four findings, two of them index growth.

#### The attribute bag

`DESCRIBE` does not enumerate a `VARIANT`'s keys, so a declared bag key that vanished, changed shape
or stopped casting used to be invisible to drift detection. That is the drift **most likely to
happen** — log formats change without anyone touching code — and its consequence is the silent row
drop this whole project is about. `verify` emits a third section for it.

Four things, measured on `logs.a2_bagdrift`, a table built with an older era where every declared key
is present, clean and scalar, and a recent one where the writer changed:

| finding | measured |
| --- | --- |
| a declared key is **no longer in the data** | `kv['gone_key']` in 0 of 7 rows — its typed comparisons match nothing, silently, forever |
| a declared numeric key **stopped casting** | `kv['latency_ms']`: only **2 of 7** values cast (28.6%) — a bound drops the other 5 |
| a declared key **stopped being a scalar** | `kv['shape_key']` is an object on 7 of 7 — `shape_key:value` compares against rendered JSON |
| a key **shadows a column**, either direction | `kv['latency_ms']` on 12 rows *and* `latency_ms` is an undeclared column — the shape that made `raw` answer nothing |

`kv['retries']` is present, clean and scalar throughout and is reported **nothing**, which is the
half that matters: a check that cries wolf gets turned off.

**What neither window sees.** A key clean *inside* the statistics window and dirty *outside* it
reports nothing: 500 recent rows that cast and 500 older ones that do not is "no drift", while a bound
on that key silently drops the older half. The Limits clause discloses both directions rather than
just absence, and names the check that does see it — the compiler's own cast advisory fires on that
query and hands over a count predicate. Run verbatim against a table built that way, it returns
exactly the dropped rows.

**Two windows, because the questions differ.** Per-key statistics are bounded and recent — "has this
key stopped appearing" is a question about now, and an unbounded window answers it wrongly because a
key abandoned an hour ago is still all over the history. The name enumeration is **unbounded**,
because existence is not a question about now and a bounded window can hide a key entirely. Both are
measured, both directions:

| | recent 24h | unbounded |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kv['gone_key']` present | **0 of 7** → drift | 5 of 12 → nothing |
| `kv['latency_ms']` casts | **2 of 7** (28.6%) | 7 of 12 (58.3%) → understated |
| `kv['body']` on the live table | 0 over `[00:00, 02:00)` → hazard **lost** | **3 rows** → hazard found |

Both windows are carried in the probe's own output and read back from it, the way the value profile
does, so neither can be laundered by a flag that defaulted differently. Neither has an upper edge in
the future.

**The enumeration is name-directed, not top-N.** It lists only keys whose names something in the
descriptor already claims — a column, a field, an alias, a typed key — with an exact `IN` list. That
is *complete* for the question rather than truncated, so its output can never read as "these are all
the keys": it never claims to be about all keys. A top-N would be more expensive and less
conclusive, because the dangerous shadowing key is a rare one — `kv['body']` is three rows — and that
is exactly what a top-N drops. The per-key statements are capped at 64 per bag and say so when the cap
bites.

**New keys are not drift.** A schemaless bag gains keys constantly; reporting those would be noise.
The signal is declared keys plus the shadowing hazard.

**A bag key's spelling is its identity.** On this engine `kv['tableID']` and `kv['tableid']` are
different keys — measured on the live table, the first is present on 282,718 rows and the second on
**0** — so a declared key is stored, looked up and subscripted under the exact spelling the descriptor
gives it. This is not a corner case: over the settled hour `[2026-08-20 02:00, 03:00)` the bag holds
**78 distinct keys and 26 of them carry uppercase**, and the busiest key of the hour *is* `tableID`.
The names are ordinary Go logger output — `controllerGroup`, `reconcileID`, `TiFlash`, `needWait`,
`safePoint`, `startKey`, `indexID`.

Folding is not merely wrong, it is **inexpressible**, and that is what rules out the tempting middle
road of folding for lookup while keeping the original for SQL. Two live keys on this table differ only
by case:

| | rows |
| --- | --- |
| `kv['safepoint']` | 1,740 |
| `kv['safePoint']` | 459 |

A folded declaration cannot say which one it means, so a folding schema cannot describe this table at
all — and a case-insensitive lookup over it has *two* right answers, which makes it an error or a
warning rather than a silent pick.

That is the opposite of how *field* names work, and the difference is deliberate:

| | folded? | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| field names | **yes** — `Level:error` is `level:error` | a field name is a label this library chose, and users type it how they like |
| bag keys | **no** | the key is data, and the engine treats its case as identity, so folding one into the other silently retargets the lookup |

Getting that wrong is how the check first failed: a descriptor correctly declaring `tableID` — one the
introspector had *generated* — was probed as `kv['tableid']`, found nothing, and reported the key as
vanished. The library was making the exact mistake its own compiler advisory warns users about.

A declared spelling the data does not use is now a **hazard** with its own sentence, because that is a
different mistake from a key going away and a person can make it by hand:

```
~ declared key kv['tableid'] is absent, but the data has kv['tableID'] on 5 rows — the same name in
  a different case. VARIANT keys are case-sensitive on this engine, so the declaration reaches
  nothing and `tableid:value` queries a key that does not exist. Re-declare it as "tableID"
```

When more than one spelling matches it names them all and refuses to choose, because on this table
that situation is real:

```
~ declared key kv['SAFEPOINT'] is absent, but the data has the same name in a different case:
  kv['safePoint'] on 459 rows and kv['safepoint'] on 1743 rows. … There are 2 of them, so nothing
  can choose for you — declare the one you mean
```

A key with no spelling in the data at all is still drift.

#### Drift versus standing hazards

Some findings are not changes. `kv['namespace']` exists on ~29,700 rows of the live table while the
descriptor declares a `namespace` **column** — the field wins, which is documented precedence, so it
is not a wrong answer, but the obvious spelling cannot see those rows. Reporting that as drift would
make `verify` fail on every run against a correct descriptor.

So they are separated. **Drift** is what changed and sets the exit status; **hazards** are standing
ambiguities that print and do not; and **limits** say what the probe could not see, so silence is
never mistaken for absence. Against the shipped preset the live table reports *no drift*, four
hazards (`namespace`, `node`, `body`, `component` — all real keys), and one limit naming both windows.

## Pipeline

[`pipeline/`](pipeline/) holds the collector that fills the table the built-in presets describe — a
Vector DaemonSet that parses five log formats into it. It lives here because the parser and the schema
have to agree: `kv` is what makes an unknown field searchable, and it only holds anything because the
transform puts it there. The same transform is why the derived text surface exists at all — lifting
`k=v` out of the message is what takes it out of `msg`.
