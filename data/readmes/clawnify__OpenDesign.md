# OpenDesign: The Open-Source Canva Alternative for SaaS

[![Deploy with Clawnify](https://app.clawnify.com/deploy-button.svg)](https://app.clawnify.com/deploy?repo=clawnify/OpenDesign)

A design editor for creating professional social media graphics — LinkedIn posts, quote cards, announcements, and more. Part of the [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) ecosystem. Zero cloud dependencies — runs locally with SQLite.

Built with **Preact + Fabric.js + Tailwind CSS + Hono + SQLite**. Ships with a Figma-inspired dark editor UI, retina canvas rendering, and pre-built LinkedIn post templates.

## What Is It?

OpenDesign is a production-ready graphic design editor designed for the OpenClaw community. Think of it as an open-source Canva alternative — a visual design tool you can self-host, customize, and embed in any SaaS product.

Unlike Canva or Adobe Express, this runs entirely on your own infrastructure. No subscriptions, no watermarks, no vendor lock-in. Create pixel-perfect social media graphics with professional typography and export at 2x resolution.

## Features

- **Fabric.js canvas** — full object manipulation with retina/HiDPI rendering (2x device pixel ratio)
- **Pre-built templates** — LinkedIn-optimized: Quote Card, Stats Highlight, Announcement, Tips List, Profile Card, Minimal Text
- **10 Google Fonts** — Inter, Playfair Display, Montserrat, Poppins, Roboto, Open Sans, Lora, Raleway, Source Sans Pro, Merriweather
- **Text editing** — font family, size, weight, alignment, color, line height, letter spacing
- **Shapes** — rectangles, circles, triangles, lines with fill, stroke, border radius
- **Image uploads** — drag-and-drop or click to upload, place on canvas
- **Backgrounds** — solid colors, gradients, uploaded images
- **Canvas sizes** — LinkedIn Square (1080x1080), LinkedIn Landscape (1200x627), LinkedIn Portrait (1200x1500), Instagram Story (1080x1920)
- **Undo/Redo** — full history with keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z)
- **2x PNG export** — crisp high-resolution output for social media
- **Auto-save** — designs persist to SQLite with debounced saves
- **Dual-mode UI** — human-optimized + AI-agent-optimized (`?agent=true`)

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clawnify/OpenDesign.git
cd open-design
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5178` in your browser. Data persists in `data.db`, uploads in `uploads/`.

### Agent Mode (for OpenClaw / Claude Code)

Append `?agent=true` to the URL:

```
http://localhost:5178/?agent=true
```

This activates an agent-friendly UI with:
- Explicit buttons always visible (no hover-to-reveal)
- Large click targets for reliable browser automation
- All controls accessible without drag interactions
- Semantic labels for AI navigation

### Using with Claude Code

Claude Code can interact with the design editor through the REST API:

```bash
# Create a new design
curl -X POST http://localhost:3006/api/designs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Q1 Results", "width": 1080, "height": 1080}'

# Load a template
curl http://localhost:3006/api/templates/1

# Update design with canvas JSON
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3006/api/designs/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"canvas_json": "{...}"}'
```

OpenClaw agents can also use the browser tool to visually interact with the editor — navigate, click templates, edit text, and export PNGs.
