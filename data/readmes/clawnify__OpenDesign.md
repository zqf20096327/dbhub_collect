# OpenDesign: The Open-Source Canva Alternative for SaaS

[![Deploy with Clawnify](https://app.clawnify.com/deploy-button.svg)](https://app.clawnify.com/deploy?repo=clawnify/OpenDesign)

A design editor for creating professional social media graphics — LinkedIn posts, quote cards, announcements, and more. Part of the [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) ecosystem. Zero cloud dependencies — runs locally with SQLite.

Built with **Preact + Fabric.js + Tailwind CSS + Hono + SQLite**. Ships with a Figma-inspired dark editor UI, retina canvas rendering, and pre-built LinkedIn post templates.

## What Is It?

OpenDesign is a production-ready graphic design editor designed for the OpenClaw community. Think of it as an open-source Canva alternative — a visual design tool you can self-host, customize, and embed in any SaaS product.

Unlike Canva or Adobe Express, this runs entirely on your own infrastructure. No subscriptions, no watermarks, no vendor lock-in. Create pixel-perfect social media graphics with professional typography and export at 2x resolution.

## Features

- **Template fields** — name any text or image object, then fill it from data or an agent over the API; one name can drive several objects and pages at once
- **Fabric.js canvas** — full object manipulation with retina/HiDPI rendering (2x device pixel ratio)
- **Pre-built templates** — LinkedIn-optimized: Quote Card, Stats Highlight, Announcement, Tips List, Profile Card, Minimal Text
- **10 Google Fonts** — Inter, Playfair Display, Montserrat, Poppins, Roboto, Open Sans, Lora, Raleway, Source Sans Pro, Merriweather
- **Custom fonts** — click **Import font from computer…** in a text or brand-kit font selector to upload TTF, OTF, WOFF or WOFF2 files (up to 10 MB). Fonts are saved with the app, load before the canvas renders, and travel with exported brand kits.
- **Text editing** — font family, size, weight, alignment, color, line height, letter spacing
- **Shapes** — rectangles, circles, triangles, lines with fill, stroke, border radius
- **Image uploads** — drag-and-drop or click to upload, place on canvas
- **Brand kits** — save a palette, a heading/body font pair and your logos, then apply them to any design in one click. Brand swatches appear wherever you pick a color. Kits export and import as plain JSON, so a kit moves between installs or over to a client instead of being stranded in one account
- **Backgrounds** — solid colors, gradients, uploaded images
- **Canvas sizes** — LinkedIn Square (1080x1080), LinkedIn Carousel (1080x1350), LinkedIn Landscape (1200x627), LinkedIn Portrait (1200x1500), Instagram Story (1080x1920)
- **Undo/Redo** — full history with keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z)
- **Carousel PDF export**: every page in one multi-page PDF, the only format LinkedIn accepts for a swipeable carousel
- **2x PNG export**: this page or every page, at exactly 2x the design size on any display
- **Auto-save** — designs persist to SQLite with debounced saves
- **Dual-mode UI** — human-optimized + AI-agent-optimized (`?agent=true`)

## Carousels

A swipeable carousel on LinkedIn is a **document post**. LinkedIn's own help pages
document the format (PDF, DOC/DOCX or PPT/PPTX, up to 300 pages and 100 MB), and the
short-lived native multi-image carousel it shipped in 2022 was removed in June 2023,
with existing carousel posts deleted that December. Uploading a document is the way.

OpenDesign builds one end to end: add a page per slide, then **Export → Carousel PDF**
writes them all into a single file, in canvas order, at the slide's own aspect ratio.
Upload that PDF to LinkedIn as a document.

Format and limits per [LinkedIn Help: upload and share documents](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a518909).
Note that *Carousel Ads* is a separate paid ads product, unrelated to this.

Use the **LinkedIn Carousel** canvas size (1080x1350, 4:5). It takes up the most room
on a phone screen. Exports are assembled in the browser, so nothing leaves the machine.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clawnify/OpenDesign.git
cd OpenDesign
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. Designs and uploads persist in the local D1 and R2 simulators under `.wrangler/`.

### Agent Mode (for OpenClaw / Claude Code)

Append `?agent=true` to the URL:

```
http://localhost:5178/?agent=true
```

This activates an agent-friendly UI with:
- Explicit buttons always visible (no hover-to-reveal)
- Large click targets for reliable browser automation
- All controls accessible without drag interactions
- Semantic labels for AI navigation

### Using with Claude Code

Claude Code can interact with the design editor through the REST API:

```bash
# Create a new design
curl -X POST http://localhost:3006/api/designs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Q1 Results", "width": 1080, "height": 1080}'

# Load a template
curl http://localhost:3006/api/templates/1

# Update design with canvas JSON
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3006/api/designs/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"canvas_json": "{...}"}'
```

OpenClaw agents can also use the browser tool to visually interact with the editor — navigate, click templates, edit text, and export PNGs.

templates (id, name, category, canvas_json, width, height, thumbnail_url, sort_order)
```

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/designs` | List all designs |
| POST | `/api/designs` | Create a design |
| GET | `/api/designs/:id` | Get a design |
| PUT | `/api/designs/:id` | Update a design |
| DELETE | `/api/designs/:id` | Delete a design |
| GET | `/api/designs/:id/fields` | List the design's fillable fields |
| POST | `/api/designs/:id/fill` | Fill those fields with values |
| GET | `/api/templates` | List all templates |
| GET | `/api/templates/:id` | Get a template |
| POST | `/api/uploads` | Upload an image file |
| GET | `/api/uploads/:filename` | Serve an uploaded image or font |
| GET | `/api/fonts` | List imported fonts |
| POST | `/api/fonts` | Import a font file (multipart `file`, up to 10 MB) |

## Template Fields

Design something once, then produce as many variants of it as you have rows of
data — without anything on the outside having to understand canvas JSON.

Select a text or image object in the editor and give it a **Field name** in the
properties panel. That object is now a fill slot:

```bash
curl localhost:8787/api/designs/$ID/fields
```

```json
[
  { "name": "headline", "type": "text",  "value": "Your inspiring quote goes here", "page_ids": ["p1"] },
  { "name": "logo",     "type": "image", "value": "https://.../old.png",            "page_ids": ["p1", "p2"] }
]
```

Fill it. Text fields take a string (numbers are accepted and stringified),
image fields take a URL:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8787/api/designs/$ID/fill \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"values": {"headline": "Q3 revenue up 40%", "logo": "https://.../new.png"}}'
```

The response carries the filled pages plus `filled` and `unmatched`, so a name
that matches nothing is reported rather than failing the request. The stored
design is left alone — add `"save": true` (and optionally `"name"`) to persist
the result as a new design instead.

### How far this scales today

`save: true` writes a **new editable design**, not a rendered image, because
there is no server-side rasterizer. That makes it the right tool for a handful
of variants — an agent fills a card, opens it, exports it — and the wrong one
for a spreadsheet:

- Each saved variant is a row in `designs`, and `GET /api/designs` returns every
  row with its full `canvas_json` and no pagination. A three-object card is
  ~2.5 KB serialised; a branded design with an image is 10-40 KB. A few hundred
  variants turn the gallery response into megabytes.
- So a few hundred saved variants give you a few hundred gallery entries, not a
  few hundred finished graphics.

For real bulk output, drive `fill` without `save` and rasterize in the browser —
the canvas is already there, and that loop is the missing piece rather than a
server-side renderer. Until it exists, treat `save: true` as a small-N
convenience.

Worth knowing:

- A field name may repeat. One `logo` across five pages fills all five, which is
  what you want for a carousel.
- What gets written depends on the object, not the declared type: text objects
  take `text`, image objects take `src`.
- A replacement image keeps the original object's box, so a different aspect
  ratio will be stretched. Size the slot for the images you intend to feed it.
- Only text and image objects can be fields. Naming a shape does nothing.
- Rendering to PNG still happens in the browser — there is no server-side
  rasterizer, because Workers have no canvas.
