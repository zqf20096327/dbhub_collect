# agent-replay

**Time-travel debugging for AI agents.**

When your AI agent hallucinates, calls the wrong tool, or breaks in production — and you're stuck reading thousands of lines of logs trying to figure out what went wrong — this tool fixes that.

## The Problems This Solves

**1. "Why did my agent fail?"**
You deploy an AI agent. It works Monday. Tuesday it hallucinates, makes up a company policy, and tells a customer something completely wrong. Your only debugging option is reading raw JSON logs. `agent-replay` records every step of every agent run — every thought, tool call, retrieval, and output — so you can replay exactly what happened, step by step, like rewinding a tape.

**2. "It worked before, what changed?"**
You push a new prompt or swap a model and suddenly your agent breaks on cases that used to work. `agent-replay diff` puts two runs side-by-side and shows you exactly where they diverged — which step went different, what its inputs and outputs were, and where things went wrong.

**3. "How do I test a fix without rerunning everything?"**
You think you know what went wrong but you don't want to burn API credits and time reproducing the exact scenario. `agent-replay fork` lets you take any recorded run, rewind to any step, and change the input or the context there — you re-run your agent from that point instead of from the top, and `diff` the branch against the original.

**4. "How do I know if my agent is actually good?"**
You have no systematic way to evaluate agent quality. `agent-replay eval` runs automatic checks — hallucination detection, safety audits, completeness checks — using both deterministic rules and AI-powered analysis. Bring your own API key (Anthropic, Google, or OpenAI) and get root-cause analysis, quality scoring, security audits, and optimization suggestions for pennies per trace.

**5. "How do I stop my agent from doing dangerous things?"**
Your agent has access to tools that can delete data, send emails, or make purchases. `agent-replay guard` lets you define kill-switch policies that flag or block dangerous patterns — like blocking any `delete` tool calls, or warning when token usage spikes.

**6. "How do I build regression tests for a non-deterministic system?"**
Every time you fix a bug, it might break something else. `agent-replay export --format golden` builds golden datasets from known-good runs that you can test against on every deploy.

## What It Is

A CLI tool that stores agent execution traces in a local SQLite database and gives you tools to debug, evaluate, compare, and protect your AI agents — both after the fact and **live**, as an agent runs.

- 100% local. Single SQLite file. No cloud dependency.
- Works with any agent framework — export traces as JSON, or capture live from the harnesses people already use: the [hook convention](#hook-capture) (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI), the [CLIs' own event streams](#live-capture), [OpenTelemetry](#opentelemetry-ingest), or [`agent-replay run`](#run-under-supervision).
- More than an observer: [enforce guardrails](#enforcement-block-dangerous-tool-calls-live) at the moment a dangerous tool call is attempted, and turn known-good runs into a [CI regression gate](#regression-check-ci).
- AI-powered evaluation using your own API key (Anthropic, Google, or OpenAI). Uses the cheapest models by default.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g agent-replay

agent-replay init                  # creates .agent-replay/ with SQLite database
                                   #   (--force overwrites an existing config)
agent-replay demo                  # loads 6 sample traces + 3 guardrail policies
                                   #   (two are the same agent before and after a
                                   #    model upgrade — diff and check them)
                                   #   (--reset clears the store first;
                                   #    --no-interactive just loads the data,
                                   #    which is what you want in a script)
agent-replay list                  # see everything
agent-replay show <trace-id>       # inspect a trace step-by-step
agent-replay replay <trace-id>     # animated terminal replay
```

Requires **Node.js 20.12+**.

## Commands

Every command accepts `--dir <path>` to point at a data directory other than `./.agent-replay`, and `--help` lists a command's full set of flags — the sections below cover the ones worth explaining, not every switch.

### Record

```bash
# Ingest a trace from a JSON file
agent-replay ingest trace.json

# JSONL file (one trace per line)
agent-replay ingest traces.jsonl --format jsonl

# Tag traces during ingest
agent-replay ingest trace.json --tags production,v2

# Validate without inserting
agent-replay ingest trace.json --dry-run
```

A `json`/`jsonl` export is a backup, and `ingest` restores it as one — including **fork lineage**. Ingest mints fresh ids, so a document's `parent_trace_id` points into the store it came from; the restore relinks each fork to its parent's new id once every trace in the file has a row. That matters because a fork restored as an ordinary trace is a never-executed copy of a step prefix, which `stats`, `check`, `watch` and `export --format golden` would then count as a real run. A fork whose parent is *not* in the file has nothing to point at — no parent is invented; it is restored unlinked and `ingest` says so, under `--dry-run` too. Export the parent alongside the fork to keep the link.

A **golden dataset** is not a trace export, and `ingest` says so instead of taking it: a golden entry has an `agent_name` and an `input` but keeps its steps in `steps_summary`, so ingesting one would store traces with no steps that read as real runs. Use a golden file with `check --golden`, and re-export with `--format json` when you want the traces back.

#### Live capture

`ingest` loads a complete trace after the fact. To capture a run **as it happens**, stream newline-delimited capture events into `record` — the trace grows step by step and stays `running` until a `trace_end` event arrives.

A capture event is rejected — with a warning, keeping the rest of the stream — when it carries something `ingest` would refuse, so a trace can always be restored from its own export: a `trace_id` that is not an identifier (empty, or carrying control characters), a step with no name, non-string tags, a decision `confidence` outside 0–1, and decision `options` that are not `{option, …}` objects. Usage and timing fields that are not non-negative finite numbers are dropped the same way.

```bash
# Pipe a JSONL event stream into the recorder
my-agent --emit-events | agent-replay record --tags production

# Keep the trace open (don't finalize as timeout) when the stream ends
my-agent --emit-events | agent-replay record --leave-open
```

`record` also speaks the major CLIs' own non-interactive streams directly, so you can pipe them in without instrumentation:

```bash
codex exec --json "fix the failing tests"          | agent-replay record --format codex-exec
gemini -p "summarize" --output-format stream-json  | agent-replay record --format gemini-stream
claude -p "fix the build" --output-format stream-json | agent-replay record --format claude-stream
```

If a run records nothing because the wrong `--format` was piped in, the failure names the format that reads those records — but only when the evidence is unambiguous, since a wrong suggestion just sends you to a second format that also captures nothing.

`claude-stream` reads the same `system` / `assistant` / `user` / `result` records, with the same content blocks, that `import --format claude-transcript` reads off disk, so the two paths stay in step: `text` becomes an `output` step, `thinking` a `thought` step, and a `tool_use`/`tool_result` pair one `tool_call` step whose `is_error` result is recorded on the step's error field. Token totals include both cache fields, and the `total_cost_usd` the run reports is recorded, so `stats` shows the real spend of a piped capture (a zero cost is kept — it is what a fully cached turn reports). It exists because a CI job running `claude -p` has no settings file to register hooks in and no collector to point at — the other two ways to capture Claude Code.

None of the three harnesses puts its prompt in the stream — all take it as a command-line argument — so `--input` supplies it: `codex exec --json "fix the tests" | agent-replay record --format codex-exec --input "fix the tests"`. Without it the capture has no input, and `check --golden` never matches a run without one, so a gate over these formats could only report that nothing was compared. It fills in only: a native producer that sends its own input keeps it.

A translated stream names its agent after the harness — every `--format codex-exec` capture is called `codex`, every `--format claude-stream` one `claude-code` — so `--agent-name` labels the run when a store collects more than one Codex- or Gemini-based workflow and `list --agent`, `stats` and `check --agent` would otherwise group them together. Unlike `--input` it overrides what the stream said: an input is data the producer captured, a name is a label, and the one on the command line is the operator's. A blank value falls back to the stream's name rather than storing an empty one.

A codex tool call records its arguments as the step's input: a shell `command`, or the `arguments` an `mcp_tool_call` carries (parsed when they are JSON, kept verbatim when they are freeform), so a changed tool query is visible to `show` and comparable by `diff`. Either stream's steps record the `model` that produced them, taken from whatever record names one (a codex thread or turn context, a gemini session); a session that switches models mid-run keeps each step labelled with the model in effect at its own time, and one that never names a model stores none. That makes a model swap between two captured runs visible to `show`, `replay` and `diff` — and, with `--input` supplying a prompt to match on, a red `check --golden --fields model` gate.

For the native protocol, each event is one JSON object on its own line carrying `v: 1`, a `type`, and (except `trace_start`) the `trace_id` the producer generated:

| Event | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `trace_start` | Open a trace (`agent_name` required; optional `trace_id`, `session_id`, `input`, `tags`) |
| `step_start` / `step_end` | Open a step, then close it with output/error/timing/tokens |
| `step` | A complete step in one event (may include a `decision` and `snapshot`) |
| `decision` | Attach a decision record to a step (any step type) |
| `snapshot` | Freeze context/environment/tool state at a step |
| `trace_end` | Finalize the trace (`status`, `output`, token/cost totals) |

An unknown event *type* is skipped with a warning; an unknown *field* is ignored silently, so a newer producer's extra keys cost nothing and neither case is ever a crash. A usage or timing field that is not a non-negative finite number (`tokens_used`, `duration_ms`, `total_tokens`, `total_duration_ms`, `total_cost_usd`) is dropped with a warning and the rest of the event is kept, since `ingest` rejects such a value and the trace would otherwise be unrestorable from its own export. A trace left open when the stream ends is finalized as `timeout` unless `--leave-open` — including one this stream resumed by id, so a trace can't dangle silently. The single exception is the trace a *live* enclosing `agent-replay run` handed down (via `AGENT_REPLAY_TRACE_ID`): that one belongs to the wrapper, which finalizes it from the child's exit.

#### OpenTelemetry ingest

Many agent stacks already emit OpenTelemetry with the GenAI semantic conventions (`gen_ai.*`) — Gemini CLI, Claude Code, OpenHands, Goose, AutoGen, and most Python frameworks via OpenInference/OpenLLMetry. Run a local OTLP receiver and point them at it, no per-framework adapter needed:

```bash
agent-replay otel serve --port 4318
```

It accepts `POST /v1/traces` and `POST /v1/logs`, each in both OTLP/JSON and OTLP/protobuf, with gzip. Spans map onto the trace model: `invoke_agent`/`invoke_workflow` roots become traces (`gen_ai.agent.name` → agent, `gen_ai.conversation.id` → session), `execute_tool` → `tool_call`, `chat`/`generate_content`/`text_completion` → `llm_call`, `embeddings`/`retrieval` → `retrieval`, span parentage → step hierarchy, and `gen_ai.usage.*` → token totals. Deprecated attribute forms (`gen_ai.system`, `prompt_tokens`/`completion_tokens`) are normalized. The two other common dialects are read for content as well as classification: OpenInference (`openinference.span.kind`, `input.value`/`output.value`, `llm.prompts`/`llm.completions`, `llm.provider`, `llm.model_name`, `llm.token_count.*`, `tool.name`) and OpenLLMetry (`traceloop.span.kind`, `traceloop.entity.input`/`output`, `traceloop.entity.name`), so a LangChain or LlamaIndex app records prompts and responses, not just span shapes. A nested `invoke_agent` span — a sub-agent inside a multi-agent run — becomes a step and keeps its own `gen_ai.agent.name` in that step's metadata, so you can still tell which agent ran which steps; only the root's copy is consumed, as the trace's agent name. Spans without an agent root are grouped into a synthetic trace per OTel trace ID. Spans (and log events) of one trace that arrive across several export batches — the usual case, as a `BatchSpanProcessor` flushes finished child spans before the root ends — are assembled into a single trace by OTel trace ID (log events by session ID), and the rootless synthetic trace is upgraded in place once the root batch arrives; each batch is still stored on arrival, so the trace stays queryable mid-session. Steps of an assembled trace are numbered by span start time rather than arrival order, so a parent span that flushes after its children still comes before them.

A batch an exporter **redelivers** (a lost `200`, a client timeout after the write, an exporter retry) is recognized on the span path and not stored twice: spans already on the trace are dropped by span id, and the batch's tokens and cost are recomputed from the spans it actually contributes — including a mixed batch that redelivers the token-carrying span alongside a new one, so a retry cannot inflate the totals. The **log** path has no equivalent identity — a log record carries no span id — so redelivered log batches can still duplicate; prefer at-most-once delivery there, or use the span endpoint.

Log events from the two CLIs that emit richer signal as logs are mapped too: Gemini CLI (`gemini_cli.user_prompt`, `gemini_cli.tool_call` — including its `decision` as a decision record attributed to user or policy, `gemini_cli.api_response` tokens) and Claude Code (`claude_code.*`), correlated by `session.id`. The model these records report is carried onto the steps they produced — across batch boundaries too, since the model-call records produce no step of their own and a processor routinely flushes them apart from the tool calls they led to — so `check --golden --fields model` can gate a log capture. A session that switches models mid-run keeps each step labelled with the model in effect at its own time, and one that never reports a model stores none. A model-call record's tokens include the CACHE counters it reports beside input and output — on a real Claude Code session the cache read alone routinely exceeds the input count, so the hook, the transcript importer and this receiver all report the same total for one session — and where the emitter states its own total (Gemini's `total_token_count`, which also covers thoughts and tool tokens) the larger of the two wins. A log record REPORTS work that already finished and says how long it took, so the session ends when its last step does, not when its last record was stamped: a `tool_result` carrying `duration_ms: 30000` extends the run by those 30 seconds rather than leaving a step that outlives its own trace.

Point an exporter at it over HTTP/JSON. Most emitters default to gRPC on port 4317, so switch them to HTTP:

- **Gemini CLI** — `telemetry: { enabled: true, target: "local", otlpEndpoint: "http://localhost:4318", otlpProtocol: "http" }`
- **Claude Code** — `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=1`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/json`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318` (opt into content with `OTEL_LOG_USER_PROMPTS=1`)
- **Goose / OpenHands** — `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/json`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318`

These endpoints take a *base* URL and the SDK appends the signal path itself, so a harness with its metrics exporter also on will POST `/v1/metrics` here every export interval. `agent-replay` has no metric target — it maps spans and log events onto traces — so those exports are refused, not stored: the response says so (rather than a bare 404, which reads as a mistyped path), and the receiver's console says so once per path rather than once per interval. Set `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=none` to stop them at the source; trace and log capture work either way. If a session is already being captured
another way — the hook and the OpenTelemetry exporter both on for one Claude
Code session — the receiver opens a **second** trace for it (the two paths
record different things and must not be merged) and says so once per session,
because two capture paths on one session double every store-wide count. The
console reports failures the same way: an export the receiver could not store (a store gone read-only, a full
disk, a malformed batch) is announced once per distinct reason, so a receiver
that is dropping everything does not look like one that is merely quiet.

Both CLIs redact prompt/response content unless you opt in on their side (Gemini `telemetry.logPrompts`, Claude Code `OTEL_LOG_USER_PROMPTS=1`); `agent-replay` records whatever they send.

> GenAI, OpenInference, and OpenLLMetry span dialects are all recognized, including their prompt/response content. Both `/v1/traces` and `/v1/logs` accept OTLP/JSON and OTLP/protobuf, so an exporter left on its default protobuf protocol works without reconfiguring it to JSON.

#### Hook capture

`agent-replay hook` plugs into the stdin-JSON hook convention shared by Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI. It's stateless — each invocation correlates to a trace by the payload's `session_id` — and auto-detects the dialect, so no flag is needed. The store is resolved from the working directory, which for a hook is wherever the agent is standing: if that directory has no store and a project above it does, the hook records where it can and says so on stderr, naming both — it never refuses, since losing the event would be worse. Capture is side-effect-only: it always exits 0 and writes nothing to stdout (in these harnesses exit 2 blocks the agent and stdout is read as a hook decision), so it can never interfere with a run. Add `--no-input` to drop prompt text and tool inputs on shared machines.

**Claude Code** — `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "agent-replay hook" }] }],
    "PreToolUse":  [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "agent-replay hook" }] }],
    "PostToolUse": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "agent-replay hook" }] }],
    "SubagentStart": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "agent-replay hook" }] }],
    "SubagentStop":  [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "agent-replay hook" }] }],
    "Stop": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "agent-replay hook" }] }]
  }
}
```

**Codex CLI** — `~/.codex/config.toml` (then trust the hooks via `/hooks`; requires a Codex build with hook support):

```toml
[[hooks.PreToolUse]]
command = "agent-replay hook"
[[hooks.PostToolUse]]
command = "agent-replay hook"
[[hooks.Stop]]
command = "agent-replay hook"
```

**Gemini CLI** (v0.26.0+) — `~/.gemini/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "BeforeTool": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "agent-replay hook" }] }],
    "AfterTool":  [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "agent-replay hook" }] }],
    "SessionEnd": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "agent-replay hook" }] }]
  }
}
```

Then watch a live session with [`agent-replay watch`](#watch-a-live-run).

#### Import existing session logs

To pull in history that already exists on disk, `import` converts a Claude Code transcript or a Codex CLI rollout into a trace. It's best-effort: unrecognized records are skipped and counted (both vendor formats are internal and version-unstable), and the source format/version is stamped in the trace metadata. Each step keeps the timestamp of the record that produced it, so an imported session's timeline is when it actually ran, not when you imported it.

```bash
agent-replay import ~/.claude/projects/my-project/<session-uuid>.jsonl --format claude-transcript
agent-replay import ~/.codex/sessions/2026/07/02/rollout-abc.jsonl      --format codex-rollout

# `--format` defaults to claude-transcript: pass the flag for a Codex
# rollout, or the Claude parser reads none of it. An import that finds
# nothing names the format that would have read the file.
```

For Claude Code, `tool_use`/`tool_result` blocks become paired `tool_call` steps (a result flagged `is_error` records its message on the step's error field, so a failed tool call stays distinguishable from a successful one), `thinking` blocks become `thought` steps, every step records the `model` that produced it — its tool calls and thinking as well as its replies, since all three come from the same assistant record (a subagent keeps its own, which is often a different one), and `usage` counts aggregate into token totals — including the two cache fields, which is where most of a real session's consumption lives. The run's git context is recorded too — `metadata.git.branch` and `metadata.cwd`, from the `gitBranch`/`cwd` every record carries; a session that reported more than one branch (a detached `HEAD` that later resolved, say) lists them all rather than being reduced to its first, and no commit hash is inferred because the records state none. For Codex, `session_meta` supplies identity and git metadata under the same keys, both tool families (`function_call`/`function_call_output` and the freeform `custom_tool_call`/`custom_tool_call_output`, each paired by `call_id`) become `tool_call` steps with a non-zero exit code or an explicit failure recorded on the step's error field, `reasoning` becomes `thought` steps, `turn_context` supplies the model each turn ran on (it is per turn, so a session that switches models mid-run is recorded that way), and `token_count` supplies the session token total.

A session's user turns are all kept: one becomes the trace input, later ones go to `metadata.follow_up_prompts`, and any harness preamble ahead of the prompt goes to `metadata.preamble_prompts`. Real transcripts usually open with an envelope (a slash-command block, injected instructions, an environment or plugin preamble, a system reminder), so the prompt is the first turn that isn't one. Two rules decide it: the record's own `isMeta` flag where the harness sets one (Claude Code marks its injected turns — skill preambles, hook notices, image placeholders — and none of those is matchable by shape), and otherwise the shape, since a person's question essentially never opens with `<`. An envelope prompt is still used if that is all the session has. The
continuation summary a harness writes when it **compacts** a session counts as
an envelope too, so a compacted session's prompt is your next real message, not
10 KB of summary; the summary is kept in `preamble_prompts`, and the trace is
marked `metadata.compacted` because the steps before the boundary are in an
earlier transcript file. `show` says so in the header — a continuation is a
fragment, and its duration and step count cover only the part after the
boundary.

Importing the same session twice does **not** create a second trace:

```bash
agent-replay import <same-file>              # "Session already imported as trc_… — nothing changed."
agent-replay import <same-file> --replace    # re-import it (use this when the transcript has grown;
                                             # says how many stored evaluations go with the old trace,
                                             # and refuses outright if forks derive from it)
```

The same applies to a live capture that opens a session another already has:
`record` says so when its stream's `session_id` is already in the store (the
hook adapter, or a previous `record`), for the same reason — nothing correlates
capture paths, so the store would simply hold two traces for one session.

That identity is the session id, the format and the file — so it recognizes a
previous **import**, and cannot recognize a **live** capture of the same session
(the hook and the OTel receiver stamp no source format). Importing the
transcript of a session you also captured live therefore adds a second trace for
it, and says so: both are kept, since a transcript and a live capture record
different things, but every store-wide count includes both.

The import summary reports the trace's token total and what it counts. For a
Claude transcript that is prompt, completion **and cache** tokens — the cache
fields carry nearly all of a real session's consumption, so the figure is far
larger than a reader expects (a single long session imports as over a billion),
and meeting it first in `stats` with no explanation reads as a bug.

Transcripts are read a line at a time rather than loaded whole, so peak memory tracks the trace being built rather than the file: a 52 MB session imports in ~270 MB instead of ~440 MB, and a session larger than ~512 MB imports at all (it previously failed with "Cannot create a string longer than 0x1fffffe8 characters" and no partial import — a 647 MB transcript now imports its 672,000 steps).

Sessions are identified by session id, source format **and** source filename — a Claude Code subagent sidecar (`<session>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl`) carries the same session id as its parent transcript, so the file has to be part of the identity. A file that carries no session id is imported each time it is named, and a trace imported before this identity existed is never replaced.

#### Enforcement (block dangerous tool calls live)

Add `--enforce` to the hook to evaluate each proposed tool call against your [guardrail policies](#guardrails) before it runs, and block denied calls in the harness's own dialect. Register it with the event name — `agent-replay hook PreToolUse --enforce` (or `BeforeTool` for Gemini CLI) — so that if stdin arrives empty or unreadable, the command still knows a tool call was being gated and blocks rather than allowing an unchecked call. It also needs to find your store: the path resolves from the hook process's working directory, so pass `--dir` unless that is the project root.

An enforcing gate that cannot fire fails closed rather than passing everything — in `hook --enforce` and in `guard check` alike. Enforcing against a store that does not exist blocks with the reason, and so does enforcing against a store with **no enabled policies** — otherwise a capture hook running from the wrong directory creates an empty store, and every tool call after it is allowed silently while the setup still looks correct. If you want `--enforce` registered before you have written any policies, pass `--allow-empty` to say so.

- **Claude Code / Codex CLI**: emits `{"hookSpecificOutput": {"permissionDecision": "deny" | "ask", ...}}` — `deny` policies block, `require_review` policies defer to the harness's own approval prompt (`"ask"`).
- **Gemini CLI**: emits `{"decision": "deny", "reason": ...}` (its hooks are allow/deny only, so `require_review` denies with a "review required" reason).
- **Crush / others without structured output**: exits 2 with the reason on stderr. The dialect is detected from the payload, and nothing in a payload identifies a harness that doesn't read hook stdout — so declare it with `--dialect other` (also `claude-code`, `codex`, `gemini` to pin detection), and denied calls are answered by exit code alone.

`warn` policies never block — they surface a message and allow the call. Every enforcement decision that matches a policy is recorded as a `guard_check` step in the session's trace, linked to the attempted `tool_call`, so blocked attempts show up in [`show`](#inspect) and [`why`](#explain-decisions).

You can also evaluate a single step out of band:

```bash
echo '{"step_type":"tool_call","name":"delete_user"}' | agent-replay guard check   # exit 2 if denied
```

It prints a machine-readable verdict on stdout — `{"action", "policy", "reason"}`
— with the human-readable line on stderr, so it scripts cleanly:
`{"action":"deny","policy":"no-deletes","reason":"..."}` on a block,
`{"action":"allow","policy":null,"reason":null}` otherwise. Standalone,
`require_review` prompts when a TTY is present and otherwise fails closed,
reporting `deny` with a "review required (no TTY — failed closed)" reason.
Whether a human is present is read from **stderr**, where the prompt is written
— not from stdout — so capturing the verdict does not silently turn every
review into a block.

> **Guardrail, not a boundary.** Hook-level enforcement is a guardrail, not a complete security boundary — the harness vendors say so themselves (a determined agent can often reach equivalent effects through another tool path). For hard isolation, use OS-level sandboxing: Claude Code's sandbox, Codex `sandbox_mode`, or Gemini CLI's sandbox.

`list` draws at most **1,000 rows** and says so when it stops there, naming
`--json` as the uncapped path. The query itself is not limited — `--limit`
still decides how many traces match, and `--json` returns all of them — but the
terminal table renderer costs time quadratic in its row count, so drawing ten
thousand rows took about seven seconds to build output no one reads. A thousand
rows is already some forty screenfuls.

An **empty** value for `--status`, `--agent`, `--tag`, `--session` or `--since` is
a usage error (exit `2`), not an unfiltered listing — so a filter built from an
unset shell variable (`list --agent "$AGENT"`) fails loudly instead of quietly
returning every trace at exit `0`, which reads exactly like a correct narrow
result.

`--agent` matches by **substring**, so `--agent travel` finds `travel-bot` and
`travel-assistant` alike; `--session` matches by **prefix**, like a trace id.
Convenient for browsing, but worth knowing wherever the selection decides a
verdict: `check --golden --agent travel-bot` in a store that also holds
`travel-bot-v2` traces checks both. For a CI gate, prefer **`check --agent-exact <name>`**, which selects only that agent — a substring is right for browsing and wrong for a gate, because under `--strict` an unrelated agent that happens to contain the term decides the verdict. Pair it with a baseline exported for the same agent — `export --format golden --agent-exact <name>`, which scopes the baseline the same way, since a baseline built with the substring form holds the lookalike's runs and every later `check` gates on them. The two flags are mutually exclusive, on both commands.

With no `--sort` at all, traces are listed newest first. Passing `--sort` orders
ascending; prefix the field with `-` for descending. So "my ten most expensive
runs" is `--sort -tokens --limit 10` — `--sort tokens` returns the cheapest ten,
and `--sort started_at` returns the *oldest* first, reversing the default view.
Sortable fields: `started_at` (the default field), `duration`, `tokens`, `cost`,
`agent_name`.

### Inspect

```bash
# Full detail view with step timeline
agent-replay show <trace-id>

# Just the steps
agent-replay show <trace-id> --steps-only

# Show the evaluations section even when there are none, plus state snapshots
# (eval results already appear whenever the trace has any)
agent-replay show <trace-id> --evals --snapshots

# Render steps as a hierarchy (subagents/nested calls) with causal links
agent-replay show <trace-id> --tree

# Window a large trace (real sessions can run to thousands of steps; `show`
# says so before printing one, since the flags are no use once it scrolls)
agent-replay show <trace-id> --from-step 100 --to-step 150
```

`--steps-only` prints the step timeline alone and returns before the
evaluations and snapshots sections, so pairing it with `--evals` or
`--snapshots` gets you neither; `show` says so rather than leaving you to read
the absence as "this trace has none".

`--evals` lists every evaluation the trace has, newest first — an evaluation is
a record, not a slot, so re-running one appends rather than replacing it. The
`When` column dates each run, and any run a later one replaced is marked
`superseded`, so an evaluator whose rubric changed between runs can still be
read: the unmarked row is the one in force. Nothing is marked when each
evaluator has run once.

`--steps-only` and `--tree` shape the human view only — a `--json` document is the whole trace either way — so pairing either with `--json` says the flag did nothing rather than implying the payload was narrowed. (`steps` carries `parent_step_number` and `caused_by_step_number`, so a consumer can rebuild the tree itself.) `diff --json --compact` says the same.

`show --json --snapshots` carries the snapshots too, attached to each step as `snapshot` (`null` where a step has none) — the same shape `export --with-snapshots` writes, so the document re-ingests with its snapshots intact. The steps are only rewritten when you ask for it, so a `show --json` without the flag is unchanged.

A `show --json` whose window actually left steps out carries a `step_window` object (`from`, `to`, `shown`, `omitted`) so a consumer can tell a subset from a whole trace. The field marks a SUBSET, not the presence of the flags: a window that omits nothing — `--from-step 1 --to-step 3` on a three-step trace — returns the whole trace and no such field, exactly as an unwindowed call does, because in both cases what you have is everything.

Trace IDs support prefix matching — just type the first few characters. A prefix that matches more than one trace is an error naming the candidates, not a silent pick, so a command never answers about (or, in `fork`'s case, writes from) a trace you did not name.

### Watch a live run

While a trace is still being captured — by `hook`, `record`, `run`, or the OTel receiver — `watch` live-tails it, printing each new step as it lands:

```bash
# Follow the most recent still-running trace
agent-replay watch

# Follow a specific trace, polling faster
agent-replay watch <trace-id> --interval 200
```

A trace deleted while you are watching it ends the tail with a message and exit `1`, rather than leaving it polling an id that is gone. With no id it picks the most recent `running` trace — by start *instant*, not by the spelling of the timestamp — so it's the natural companion to a hook-instrumented session in another terminal. It exits when the trace is finalized. A trace that has been `running` long enough to look abandoned is called out when `watch` attaches, since a tail on a run whose producer died prints nothing and reads like an agent that is thinking; `list` and `show` mark the same trace, and both `list --json` and `show --json` report it as `possibly_abandoned` — a store-wide scan for stuck runs is what that field is for. A **fork** is never marked abandoned however long it sits — it is a copy left `running` for you to explore, not a capture that died — and `list` marks it `⑂ fork` (the dashboard's trace table shows `⑂`), which is also why `list` counts it and `stats` does not.

`--interval` is in milliseconds and is capped at `2147483647` ms — above that
Node's timer overflows and clamps to 1 ms, polling the database about a
thousand times a second rather than almost never, so it is a usage error (exit
`2`) instead.

Each poll reads only what has been written since the last one, so watching a session that has been running for hours costs the same as watching one that just started.

A producer that opens a step and closes it later (the two-phase `step_start`/`step_end` protocol) gets two lines per step: the announcement when the step starts, and a closing line carrying what only the end knows — duration, tokens, and any error. A producer that writes a complete step in one event gets a single line. Text that came from the agent (step names, errors, models, decision rationales) is escaped before it reaches your terminal, so a control sequence in a tool's stderr cannot retarget the terminal you are watching from.

### Explain decisions

When a trace records *why* it acted — decision alternatives, causal links between steps, and step hierarchy — you can inspect that structure directly.

```bash
# Walk the causal chain backward from a step to the decision that triggered it
agent-replay why <trace-id> --step 9

# List every decision point with its options, chosen option, and rationale
agent-replay decisions <trace-id>

# Group traces from one harness session/conversation
agent-replay list --session <session-id>
```

`why` follows each step's `caused_by_step`, falling back to `parent_step` and then to the nearest earlier decision, printing the chosen option and rationale at each decision hop. Both commands accept `--json`.

A chain is only as deep as the causal links the producer actually recorded, so a short one is an honest answer rather than a broken command. `caused_by_step` is the strongest link and has to be set deliberately: the SDK and the native `record` protocol both accept it, and `hook --enforce` sets it on the `guard_check` step it writes, pointing at the tool call that step evaluated. Otherwise each source contributes what it has. An **imported** transcript carries tool pairing and subagent nesting, so `why` on a subagent's step steps back to the subagent that ran it, while a step with no parent reports a chain of one — imported sessions carry no decisions at all, so there is nothing to fall back to. A **hook-captured** session gets its depth from decisions you attach with `attachDecision`. An **OpenTelemetry** trace gets it from span parentage. If you want deep chains out of your own agent, set `caused_by_step` when you emit each step.

### Replay

```bash
# Animated step-by-step replay (default 5x speed)
agent-replay replay <trace-id>

# Faster, slower, or instant
agent-replay replay <trace-id> --speed 10
agent-replay replay <trace-id> --speed 0

# Replay only steps 3 through 7
agent-replay replay <trace-id> --from-step 3 --to-step 7

# Wait for a keypress after each step (needs an interactive terminal;
# off one, replay says so and plays straight through)
agent-replay replay <trace-id> --pause
```

A step window that matches no step is a failure, not an empty replay: `replay
<trace-id> --from-step 900` on an 8-step trace exits `1` and names the range
that does exist, so a script cannot report success having replayed nothing.

### Compare

```bash
# Side-by-side diff of two traces (compares each step's type, name, input,
# output, model, error and decision, plus the trace's input, status and error —
# state snapshots are not compared, so a run whose only change is its context
# window reports no differences and says so; read those with `show --snapshots`)
agent-replay diff <trace-a> <trace-b>

# Summary only
agent-replay diff <a> <b> --compact

# AI-powered analysis of why the traces diverged
agent-replay diff <a> <b> --ai
```

Steps are compared on `step_type`, `name`, `input`, `output`, `model`,
`error`, and `decision`; the trace itself is compared on `trace_input`, `status`,
`trace_error`, and `trace_output` — so a fork made with `--modify-input` shows the input you
changed. Trace-level differences report a step of `trace` (`null` in `--json`)
and never set `divergence_step`, which means "the first step that went
different". Steps are paired by `step_number`, so gaps don't misalign the
comparison. When one trace's steps are a **prefix** of the other's — a fresh
fork, a run that crashed early — the verdict says it *stopped* rather than
diverged (`RIGHT STOPS AFTER STEP 2`, "identical up to there"), because two
traces that agree on every step they share have not diverged; `--json` carries
the same fact as `common_prefix` (`shorter`, `last_common_step`,
`missing_steps`), and the key is absent when it does not apply. `--compact` and
the `--ai` prompt say the same thing — an analysis asked "why did these diverge"
about a run that merely stopped invents a cause for an event that never
happened. Narrow the comparison with `--fields`; when a filter leaves nothing,
the verdict says so rather than claiming the traces are identical, and a filter
naming no field at all is a usage error. The `--json` document records the scope
too, as `compared_fields` — the list when `--fields` narrowed the comparison and
`null` when it did not — so a filtered count is never read as a full one.

`decision` compares the chosen option, its rationale, and who decided — so two
runs that took opposite actions at the same step are reported as different even
when every other field matches. Confidence and the option list are deliberately
excluded: they are the model's self-report and vary run to run without the agent
having acted differently.

### Fork

```bash
# Fork a trace at step 3
agent-replay fork <trace-id> --from-step 3

# Fork with modified input
agent-replay fork <trace-id> --from-step 2 --modify-input '{"task":"revised prompt"}'

# Tag the fork
agent-replay fork <trace-id> --from-step 4 --tag experiment-1
```

A fork is a **branch point, not a simulation**: it copies steps 1..N of the
original into a new trace, links it back (`parent_trace_id`, `forked_from_step`),
applies your modified input or context, and leaves it `running` with a `manual`
trigger. Nothing is re-executed — this tool never runs your agent for you. What
happens next is yours:

```bash
# `fork` prints the new id; --tag makes it easy to pick up in a script,
# since fork has no --json of its own
agent-replay fork <trace-id> --from-step 2 --modify-input '{"task":"revised prompt"}' --tag what-if
FORK=$(agent-replay list --json --tag what-if | jq -r '.items[0].id')

# re-run your agent from that point, recording onto the fork by id:
my-agent --resume-from "$FORK" | agent-replay record   # events carrying "trace_id": "$FORK"
agent-replay diff <trace-id> "$FORK"                   # what the change did
```

Forks are excluded from `check --golden`, `export --format golden` and `stats`,
since a never-executed copy is not a run — see those sections.

An **empty** value for `--modify-input`, `--modify-context` or `--tag` is a
usage error (exit `2`), for the same reason it is on `list`: a flag built from
an unset shell variable would otherwise be skipped silently, and `fork` would
report success for a copy carrying none of what was asked. A literal `null`
*is* accepted — it is the documented no-op that keeps the original value.

### Run under supervision

Wrap any agent command to record it end-to-end and propagate its exit status — useful as a one-line harness around a run:

```bash
agent-replay run --agent-name my-bot -- node agent.js
```

The wrapper pre-creates a trace and hands the child a recording channel via environment variables (`AGENT_REPLAY_DIR`, `AGENT_REPLAY_TRACE_ID`, `AGENT_REPLAY_EVENTS`). Every `agent-replay` command honors `AGENT_REPLAY_DIR` as its data directory when `--dir` isn't given, so a nested invocation (`run -- sh -c '... | agent-replay record'`) writes to the wrapper's store rather than a fresh one in the working directory. Whether it also writes to the wrapper's *trace* depends on the producer: a child that emits the handed-down `$AGENT_REPLAY_TRACE_ID` records its steps onto that trace, so the run is one trace with timing, exit status and steps together. A translated harness stream cannot — `codex`, `gemini` and `claude` know nothing about this tool and generate their own session — so that pairing gives you two traces in the one store: the wrapper's with timing and exit status, the child's with the steps. An instrumented child (using the [`TraceRecorder` SDK](#programmatic-api) or writing JSONL events to `$AGENT_REPLAY_EVENTS`) records a full step-by-step trace; an uninstrumented child still gets a trace with timing and exit metadata. The child's stdio passes through untouched, and the trace is finalized from its exit — `0` → completed, non-zero → failed with the code recorded. A child that sends its own `trace_end` owns the status: that declaration is kept even when it disagrees with the exit code, and the summary names both (`completed (child exited 7)`). `agent-replay run` exits with the child's own status either way, so it drops cleanly into scripts and CI.

The events channel is **append-only**: open it with `a`, never `w`. A producer that rewrites it is detected and warned about, but events written before the rewrite are gone. If an event cannot be recorded — the protocol rejected the line (bad JSON, an unknown type, a missing `trace_id`), or the store refused it (a child recording several sub-traces collides on per-trace step numbering) — the run summary says how many. That matters because `run` passes the child's own output through unmodified, so the per-line warning is interleaved with the agent's output while the summary is the last line printed. Blank and `//` comment lines are legal protocol and are not counted, and neither is an event kept with one unusable field ignored.

### Regression check (CI)

Turn known-good runs into a regression gate. Export a golden dataset once, then `check` new runs against it — the comparison is structural (step count, step types and names, tool-call inputs, final status) rather than raw output text, so how the agent *words its answer* never causes a failure. Tool-call inputs are a deliberate exception: they are compared verbatim, because a changed tool query is the divergence a purely structural gate is blind to — which also means model-authored argument text diverges when the model rephrases it (`{"query":"weather in Paris today"}` against `{"query":"Paris weather today"}` is a reported regression). If your agent's arguments vary run to run, gate on the rest: `--fields step_count,step_types,step_names,step_errors,status`. It exits non-zero on any regression, ready for CI.

```bash
# Capture a golden dataset from passing runs
agent-replay export --format golden --tag known-good --output golden.json

# Fail the build if recent runs diverge from golden
agent-replay check --golden golden.json --agent travel-bot --since 1d

# Check one trace by id (instead of every trace matching the filters)
agent-replay check --golden golden.json --trace <trace-id>

# Narrow the comparison, or treat unmatched runs as failures
agent-replay check --golden golden.json --fields step_types,tool_inputs
agent-replay check --golden golden.json --strict --json

# Opt into catching model swaps (ignored by default, since upgrades are common)
agent-replay check --golden golden.json --fields model

# Gate on the agent's CHOICES, not just the shape of the run
agent-replay check --golden golden.json --fields step_types,decisions
```

Comparable fields: `step_count`, `step_types`, `step_names`, `tool_inputs`, `step_errors`, `status` (the default set), plus opt-in `model` and `decisions`. **`decisions` compares the option each step CHOSE** — the divergence a structural gate is otherwise blind to: rename nothing, change no tool, and swap `escalate_to_human` for `delete_records`, and every default field still matches. It is opt-in because no baseline exported before it carries the data, so making it a default would turn a working gate into the "nothing to compare" refusal on upgrade; re-export the baseline and pass `--fields ...,decisions`. Only a step the baseline recorded a decision for is compared. `step_errors` compares whether each step FAILED — a step that starts erroring is a regression the other fields cannot see, since a hook-captured session finalizes `completed` from its Stop event however many tool calls failed inside it. It is one-directional: a step that *stops* failing is a fix, not a regression. The trace-level `status` field is one-directional in the same way — a candidate that ends `completed` where the baseline recorded `failed`, `timeout` or `running` is not a regression, so a baseline that caught one flaky failure does not report REGRESSED on every green run after it. Every other transition still diverges, including a change of failure mode. Only the flag is compared, never the message, and a baseline exported before this field is skipped step by step. An unrecognized `--fields` value is rejected rather than silently comparing nothing — as a usage error (exit `2`) named for the bad field, checked before the store is opened, so a typo can't surface as "no traces matched" instead. A *valid* field that no baseline entry can exercise (`--fields model` against a baseline captured without per-step models) is refused the same way, for the same reason: it would otherwise compare nothing and report a pass. Which sources give you `model` to gate on: an **imported** Claude Code transcript or Codex rollout (every step, including its tool calls), an **OpenTelemetry** capture — a trace whose spans carry a model attribute, or a Gemini CLI / Claude Code log session, whose `api_response`/`api_request` records state the model — and your own agent via the SDK or the native `record` protocol. A **translated stream** (`record --format codex-exec`/`gemini-stream`/`claude-stream`) records the model too, but needs `record --input` to be matchable at all, since none of the three harnesses puts its prompt in the stream. A **hook-captured** session does not — the harness's hook payload does not name the model — so a baseline built from one cannot be gated on it. Note that carrying the field is only half of it: the candidate also has to be *matchable*, which needs a non-empty trace input (see below), so an OpenTelemetry trace whose spans record no prompt is refused for that reason instead. This is judged per candidate, so a mixed run in which one agent has no tool calls refuses `--fields tool_inputs` for the whole run rather than passing on another agent's behalf — narrow the run with `--agent` if that is not what you want. The refusal distinguishes the two cases, because they have opposite cures: when NO baseline records the field it names the capture paths that do, and when only SOME matched runs record it, it says so and points at `--agent` — telling you "no baseline entry carries that data" about a value sitting in the golden file you are looking at is the kind of wrong answer that makes a reader conclude the tool is broken.

A golden entry also carries `expected_output` and `eval_criteria`. These are recorded for downstream consumers and human review — **`check` does not compare them**; the gate is structural, over the fields listed above. `metadata` is required, though: an entry without `metadata.status` is refused, because the `status` comparison would otherwise be silently skipped.

Candidates gathered in bulk are the runs that could actually regress: **forks and still-`running` traces are excluded**. A fork is a never-executed copy of a step prefix, so it matches its own baseline and then "diverges" on step count and status — one `fork` would otherwise turn the gate permanently red on a shared store. A running trace is mid-flight, so its partial shape is not a regression either. A trace named explicitly with `--trace` is always compared, whatever its lineage or status. For the same reason, `export --format golden` leaves forks out of a baseline *gathered by filter*, while `json` and `jsonl` exports are backups and keep them. `export <trace-id> --format golden` follows the same rule as `check --trace`: a trace you name by id is exported whatever its lineage.

Matches are made by agent name and a hash of the input, so each run is compared to its own golden counterpart. **A trace with an empty input is deliberately never matched**, on either side: an empty input is not an identity but the absence of one, and every capture without a recorded input hashes to the same key — so unrelated runs matched each other and produced fabricated `tool_inputs` regressions between completely different sessions. Such a trace is reported as unmatched (exit `2`) rather than compared, which is worth knowing because re-exporting the baseline, the remedy that refusal suggests, cannot fix this particular case — the input has to start being recorded. It bites a `hook --no-input` capture, a `record --format codex-exec` / `gemini-stream` / `claude-stream` session (those translators record no input — pass `record --input "<the prompt>"` to supply the one the harness took on its command line), and an OpenTelemetry trace whose spans carry no prompt attribute. Several baseline entries may share one key — repeated runs of the same scenario
— and a candidate passes if it reproduces **any** of them. That is deliberate,
but it has a quiet consequence: a baseline exported from a store that also holds
a regressed run blesses that run's shape forever. `export --format golden` says
so when it writes one (naming how many entries share a key), while re-exporting
from vetted runs still costs nothing. A divergence report names the trace, the
step, and the differing field, with its two values windowed around where they
first differ — tool payloads share a long prefix, so cutting from the start
printed the same characters on both sides of the arrow and called them a
A pass whose comparison could not cover the whole baseline shape says so:
positional fields compare `min(golden, candidate)` steps, so a run that stopped
early leaves the rest of the baseline unlooked-at. With the default fields that
is a regression (`step_count` diverges); if you narrow `--fields` past it, the
pass reports `compared N of M baseline step(s)` and `--json` carries
`partial_shape`. The verdict is still yours to choose — add `step_count` to gate
on the difference.

difference. The summary also reports baseline entries **no candidate exercised** — a scenario whose run crashed or never happened at all, which otherwise leaves a gate green with nothing to say about it. Those count as failures under `--strict`, alongside unmatched runs.

Build the baseline from runs that finished cleanly: `export --format golden` warns when entries did not come from a completed run — a `running` trace bakes in a partial shape the next correct run "regresses" against, and a `failed`/`timeout` one makes reproducing the failure pass green. The warning reports how many of the entries that covers, not which condition each hit; filter with `--tag known-good` or `--status completed`.

A gate that cannot do its job fails loudly (exit `2`) instead of passing green. That covers a golden file with no entries — an empty baseline can never detect a regression, and the usual cause is an export filter that matched nothing, which the export warns about too — a file that isn't a golden dataset at all (`--format json` output is a common mix-up), and a run where no trace matched the filters, whether from a mistyped `--agent`, a `--since` window that outran the recording, or a `--dir` pointing somewhere the runs were never recorded. The same is true when candidates exist but NONE of them matched a baseline: nothing was compared, so nothing could regress. That usually means the agent was renamed, the input template changed, or capture stopped recording the input (`hook --no-input`) — all of which change the match key. `--strict` and `--trace` keep their own verdicts (a regression, and a plain unmatched report). If either empty case is expected — a quiet nightly window, a matrix job where this agent didn't run — pass `--allow-empty`, which opts out of both refusals. With `--json`, a refusal is reported as `{"ok": false, "error": ...}` rather than bare stderr, so a `check --json | jq -r .ok` pipeline still reads a verdict.

### Evaluate

```bash
# Run all built-in deterministic checks
agent-replay eval <trace-id>

# The same set, asked for explicitly: no "no evaluator specified" notice, and
# unlike the bare form it COMBINES with the flags below (e.g. --all --ai)
agent-replay eval <trace-id> --all

# Run a specific preset
agent-replay eval <trace-id> --preset hallucination-check
agent-replay eval <trace-id> --preset safety-check
agent-replay eval <trace-id> --preset completeness-check

# Run AI-powered evaluation (requires API key)
agent-replay eval <trace-id> --ai
agent-replay eval <trace-id> --preset ai-root-cause
agent-replay eval <trace-id> --preset ai-quality-review
agent-replay eval <trace-id> --preset ai-security-audit
agent-replay eval <trace-id> --preset ai-optimization

# Set a cost budget for AI evals
agent-replay eval <trace-id> --ai --max-cost 0.05

# Custom rubric file
agent-replay eval <trace-id> --rubric my-rubric.yaml

# JSON output
agent-replay eval <trace-id> --json
```

`eval` exits non-zero when an evaluation fails (a rubric below its threshold or a
built-in preset that fails), so `agent-replay eval <trace-id> --rubric q.yaml`
drops straight into a CI job as a pass/fail gate. It also exits non-zero when an
evaluator *fails to run at all* — a provider error, an unreachable network — and
names each one, so a score is never reported as if it covered evaluators that
never looked at the trace. Under `--json` those names go to stderr, keeping
stdout a clean document for `jq`.

### Guardrails

```bash
# List all policies
agent-replay guard list

# Add a policy that blocks delete operations
agent-replay guard add --name no-deletes \
  --pattern '{"step_type":"tool_call","name_contains":"delete"}' \
  --action deny \
  --description "Blocks any tool call whose name contains 'delete'"

# Test all policies against a trace
agent-replay guard test <trace-id>

# Turn a policy off without deleting it (by id or name), and back on
agent-replay guard disable no-deletes
agent-replay guard enable no-deletes

# Remove a policy
agent-replay guard remove <policy-id>
```

`guard test` summarizes what a recorded run would have hit: how many matches
would have blocked it (`deny`, and `require_review`, which fails closed unless
someone approves it) and how many would only have warned. It is a **report, not a
gate**: the matches go to stdout (so `guard test <id> > findings.txt` captures
them, while the progress line stays on stderr) and it exits `0` whatever it
finds, including a `deny` that matched every step. Gate on `guard check` or
`hook --enforce`, which are the paths that answer with an exit code.
`guard test --json` gives the same report as a document —
`{ trace_id, matches, summary }`, where `summary` counts `deny`,
`require_review` (which blocks too, without an approval) and `warn`, plus
`enabled_policies`, how many rules could have matched at all — so a job can act
on the findings instead of scraping them. It exits `0` either way.

A run with **no enabled policy** is reported as such rather than as a clean one:
`✔ No policy violations found.` would state the result of a check that never
ran. The verdict and the remedy go to stderr (naming whether the store holds no
policies or only disabled ones, which need different fixes), so `guard test <id>
> findings.txt` still captures findings alone. The exit code is still `0` — this
is a report, not a gate — and `--json` carries the same fact as
`summary.enabled_policies: 0`.

Every guard subcommand that reads or changes an existing policy refuses a directory with no store (exit `2`) instead of creating one — otherwise `guard list` answers "No guardrail policies found" about a project whose policies are one directory up, and names the store it found there. `guard add` may create the store it writes into, but says when that store is a second one below a project that already has one, since a policy the enforcement path never opens is a guardrail that cannot fire.

`guard list --json` prints `{ policies, warnings }` for a script — the policy
rows as stored, and the same warnings the table shows (a blocking policy that
matches on output is named in `warnings`, since it reads as armed and cannot
fire live). A missing store is refused as JSON, like every other reading command.

A disabled policy stays in `guard list` (with `Enabled: No`) and is skipped by
every evaluation path — `hook --enforce`, `guard check`, and `guard test` — so
you can silence a noisy rule for a run without losing its id, priority, or
description.

Patterns support `step_type`, `name_contains`, `name_regex`, `input_contains`, and
`output_contains`. `guard add` rejects an unusable pattern (an invalid or unsafe
`name_regex`, a non-string match value, a `step_type` that isn't a real step type
— e.g. `"toolcall"` for `tool_call` — or a pattern with no recognized match key,
e.g. a typo'd key) so a blocking policy can never be stored in a form that
silently fails to match. If a malformed policy is somehow
present anyway, a `deny`/`require_review` policy fails *closed* (treats the step
as a match) rather than letting it through. The one exception is a completely
empty pattern, which stays inert even for a `deny`: it expresses no intent to
filter, and blocking every step would be worse than the misconfiguration.

**`output_contains` cannot block live.** Enforcement evaluates a *proposed* tool
call — before it runs, so it has no output yet — and every match key in a pattern
must match. A `deny` or `require_review` keyed on `output_contains` therefore
never fires under `hook --enforce`. It still matches in post-hoc evaluation
(`guard test`, and `guard check` on a recorded step), so it is a useful auditing
pattern, not a blocking one. Both `guard add` and `guard list` say so — the
first when you write one, the second every time you audit, naming the policies,
because a listing that shows `DENY / Enabled: Yes` otherwise reads as an armed
kill switch and the add-time warning is long gone by then.

**The most restrictive match wins.** When several policies match one step, the
verdict is the strictest of them — `deny` over `require_review` over `warn` over
`allow` — and `--priority` only breaks ties *among equally restrictive* matches,
deciding which policy is cited. So a broad `deny` plus a narrow, higher-priority
`allow` does **not** carve out an exception: the call is still denied. Express an
exception by narrowing the `deny` pattern itself.

`input_contains` and `output_contains` match against both the raw text and the
JSON form of the step's input/output, so a pattern containing quotes,
backslashes, newlines, or tabs matches as written — `rm -rf "/etc"` and
`C:\Windows\System32` both work, as do patterns aimed at the JSON itself like
`"cmd"`. Matching is case-insensitive.

### Export

```bash
# Export as JSON
agent-replay export --format json --output traces.json

# Export a single trace by id (accepts an id prefix, like show/why/replay)
agent-replay export <trace-id> --output one.json

# Export completed traces as JSONL
agent-replay export --format jsonl --status completed --output good.jsonl

# Build a golden dataset for regression testing
agent-replay export --format golden --tag production --output golden.json

# Include stored evals and per-step context snapshots
agent-replay export --format json --with-evals --with-snapshots --output full.json
```

A `json` or `jsonl` export is a backup, so it restores as one: `ingest` reads
back the evals written by `--with-evals` (keeping each evaluation's own
`evaluated_at`, not the moment of the restore) and the per-step snapshots
written by `--with-snapshots`.

An **empty** value for `--status`, `--agent`, `--tag` or `--since` is a usage
error (exit `2`), as it is for `list`. It matters more here, because `export`
writes: a widened `--agent ""` would dump the whole store into a file you
believed held one agent's traces, and a golden baseline built that way then
gates CI on runs it was never meant to cover.

`export` reports **how many** traces it wrote, not just where — `Exported 3
trace(s) to …`, counted from the bytes actually written — and warns when a
filter matched nothing, in every format. An empty export is a false green:
`--agent no-such-agent --output backup.json` otherwise announces success at
exit `0` over a file holding `[]`, and you find out when you need the backup.
The warning goes to stderr, so it never pollutes `export … > file.json`, and it
does not depend on whether you used `--output`. `--format golden` says instead
that the baseline cannot detect a regression, which is the same fact in the
terms that matter for a gate.

A trace id and the filter flags (`--status`, `--agent`, `--tag`, `--since`) are
mutually exclusive: pass an id to export exactly one trace, or filters to export a
set. Combining them is a usage error rather than silently ignoring the filters.

### Dashboard

```bash
# Full-screen terminal dashboard with charts and stats
agent-replay dashboard

# Custom refresh interval
agent-replay dashboard --refresh 10
```

Keyboard: `q` quit, `r` refresh, arrow keys navigate.

The dashboard needs an **interactive terminal**: it takes over the screen and
exits on a keypress, so with stdout redirected or in CI it refuses with exit `2`
and writes nothing to stdout, pointing at `stats --json` instead. (Otherwise it
would hang forever, having already emitted alt-screen and mouse-tracking escape
sequences into the log.) `--refresh` is capped at `2147483` seconds — above that
Node's timer overflows and clamps to 1 ms, refreshing about a thousand times a
second, the inverse of what was asked — also exit `2`.

### Stats

A non-interactive summary of the store — the same aggregates the dashboard shows, but printable to a log and scriptable in CI (where the full-screen dashboard can't run).

```bash
# Overall counts, per-status, and per-agent breakdown
agent-replay stats

# Only count activity in a recent window (like `list --since`)
agent-replay stats --since 7d
agent-replay stats --since 2026-08-01

# JSON for piping into jq / a CI check
agent-replay stats --json
```

The `--json` shape is `{ since, overall, by_status, by_agent }`. `overall` carries `traces`, `steps`, `evals`, `policies`, `avgDurationMs`, `avgDurationSample`, `totalTokens`, `totalTokensSample`, `totalCost` and `totalCostSample` — **each `*Sample` is how many traces the figure beside it was actually taken over**. A trace that is still running, or whose timestamps no format can parse, has no measurable duration and is skipped; tokens and cost are recorded only when a producer reports them, so both totals are sums over a subset. Read alone, any of the three can describe far fewer runs than `traces`. The panel says `(over N of M)` on each one when they differ. `by_agent` lists each agent's trace `count` and a `failed_or_timeout` tally, most-active first (named for what it counts, so it can't be read as failures alone alongside `by_status`). `--since` windows every count to traces started at or after the cutoff (steps and evals by their parent trace's start time); the active-policy count is current config and is never windowed. A malformed `--since` is a usage error (exit `2`). **Forks are excluded from every count**, as they are from `check` and `export --format golden` — a fork is a never-executed copy, so counting it would report spend that never happened. `stats` can therefore report fewer traces than `list`, which shows them.

### Configuration

```bash
# Show current config (`database` is reported as the store this directory
# actually resolves to — a config copied from another project keeps naming
# the original, and `config list` says so rather than answering with it)
agent-replay config list

# Set an API key for AI-powered evaluation
agent-replay config set ai.api_keys.anthropic sk-ant-...
agent-replay config set ai.api_keys.google AIza...
agent-replay config set ai.api_keys.openai sk-...

# Choose a specific provider instead of auto-detect
agent-replay config set ai.provider anthropic

# Pin a model, and raise the judge's output ceiling if verdicts get truncated
agent-replay config set ai.model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
agent-replay config set ai.max_tokens 4096

# Test that your API key works
agent-replay config test-ai

# Read a config value
agent-replay config get ai.provider
```

You can also set API keys via environment variables: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Environment variables take priority over config file values.

`ai.max_tokens` caps the model's reply on every AI path — `eval --ai` and `diff --ai` alike (default 1024) — and is what the `--max-cost` estimate prices, so raising it raises both the ceiling and the quoted cost. `ai.model` is only applied to a provider it belongs to — a `claude-*` model is never sent to OpenAI. A stored AI result explains any number a reader cannot check: `steps_shown` /
`steps_total` when the trace did not fit the summary, `missing_fields` when the
model omitted a score, `truncated_at_max_tokens` when its reply was cut off, and
`cost_usd_rate_unknown` when the cost came from the fallback rate below. Each
appears only when it applies, so an ordinary result carries none of them.

Cost figures are priced from a small built-in rate table that covers the three default models; set `ai.model` to anything else and both the estimate and the recorded cost fall back to the highest rate in that table, which — since all three defaults are cheap-tier — is a **floor, not a ceiling**. `eval --ai --max-cost` says so out loud when that happens, and warns that the budget may not hold; a stored result carries `cost_usd_rate_unknown`.

`config set` refuses an **empty** value (exit `2`): a blank key was stored, then
displayed as `***` by `config get` — looking set — while every check downstream
treated it as unset, so `test-ai` told you to set the key you had just set. To
clear a value, re-run `agent-replay init --force` — which rewrites the whole
config file, so it clears any stored API keys too, and says which ones before it
does.

A config file that exists but **cannot be parsed** is reported as its own error,
naming the file and the parse position, rather than as "no configuration found"
— which used to send you to `init`, which then said the store was already
initialized. `config set` also writes back only the key you named: a value it
had to ignore (say a `ai.max_tokens` typed as a string) stays on disk, so it is
still reported and still fixable.

`traces.db` and `config.json` are created owner-only (`0600`) — a trace holds
prompts, tool inputs and tool outputs, and the config holds API keys in
plaintext. A directory `agent-replay` creates for itself is `0700` as well; a
directory that already exists is left exactly as you set it, since the mode of a
directory you made is your decision. The file modes are set at creation only, so
if you deliberately open a store up it stays open.

**Copying or backing up a store.** At rest the store is the single file the
front page promises, `traces.db`. While a writer is attached — a `record`, a
`run`, the OTel receiver, a hook firing — SQLite's WAL mode adds `traces.db-wal`
and `traces.db-shm` beside it (both `0600` as well), and the `-wal` holds
committed data that is not in the `.db` yet. So copy the *directory*, or take an
`export` (`--format json` is a full backup that `ingest` restores), rather than
the `.db` alone while something is running. The sidecars disappear when the last
writer closes the store.

**Removing captured data.** There is no `delete` command: nothing in the CLI
removes a trace, and every command that writes only adds. To drop a single run,
call `deleteTrace(db, id)` from the [SDK](#programmatic-api) — it cascades, so
the trace's steps, decisions, snapshots and evaluations go with it. To drop
everything, delete the store: `rm -rf .agent-replay` (or the directory `--dir`
names), which also removes `config.json` and the API keys in it. `demo --reset`
clears a store before reloading the samples; it refuses a directory that does
not look like one it created, and names the traces, evaluations and policies it
is about to clear — the directory checks cannot tell a previous demo from a real
capture, so the counts are what tell you.

## Troubleshooting

Every entry here is a real answer the tool gives, and the section that explains it.

**"I captured a run, but `list` shows nothing."** Store resolution follows the
working directory, so this is almost always a different store — you are in a
subdirectory, or a hook fired from one. The refusal names the store it looked
for, and names one it finds in an ancestor. If capture already ran there, it
said so at the time: it creates the store rather than losing the run, and prints
which one it created and which one the project has. See
[Configuration](#configuration) for where the store lives and what is beside it.

**"`import` says nothing is importable, but the file is full of records."**
`--format` defaults to `claude-transcript`, so a Codex rollout passed without
the flag is read by the wrong parser. The failure names the format that would
have read the file. See [Import](#import-existing-session-logs).

**"My OpenTelemetry capture has traces but no metrics."** There are no metrics:
this receiver maps spans and log events onto traces and has no metric target, so
`/v1/metrics` is refused — once, on the console, with the exporter-side setting
that stops the exports. Traces and logs are unaffected. See
[OpenTelemetry ingest](#opentelemetry-ingest).

**"`check --golden` went red and my agent didn't change."** `tool_inputs` is in
the default field set and is compared verbatim, so a tool argument the model
rephrases (`{"query":"weather in Paris today"}` against
`{"query":"Paris weather today"}`) is a divergence. Gate on the rest with
`--fields step_count,step_types,step_names,step_errors,status`. See
[Regression check](#regression-check-ci).

**"`check` exits 2 saying it has nothing to compare."** The gate refuses rather
than passing green when it cannot do its job. The message distinguishes the two
causes, because their cures are opposite: no baseline entry records that field
(use a capture path that does), or only some matched runs record it (narrow with
`--agent`).

**"`diff --ai` said `Better trace: unknown`."** The model gave no verdict this
tool could read — `unknown` is not one of the three answers it is offered, so
it can't be confused with `neither` ("the two runs are equivalent"). If the
reasoning says the answer was cut off at the token ceiling, re-run with a
a larger ceiling — `agent-replay config set ai.max_tokens <n>`, which is the
only way to raise it; a long comparison
routinely needs more than the 1024 default. An AI *eval* whose judge was cut
off stores `truncated_at_max_tokens` beside its `score: 0`, for the same
reason: the gate fails closed, and the zero should be readable as "never
finished" rather than "failed the run".

**"An AI evaluator scored a long run and I don't trust the number."** Check the
panel: when the trace did not fit the summary sent to the model, it says
`Judged over N of M steps`, and the stored result carries `steps_shown` /
`steps_total`. If the model left a score out
altogether, the run's `details` carry `missing_fields` naming which — an absent
field is read as 0 for the arithmetic, so it drags the score down and can fail
the run, and the panel says `not scored by the model` rather than drawing a
`0/10` nobody gave. A field the model genuinely sent as `0` is a real score and
is not listed. `diff --ai` says the same about differences
(`Analyzed 15 of 4178 differences`, with `diffs_shown`/`diffs_total` in the
payload). The summary always keeps the failing step and the important ones,
but a verdict about step counts or efficiency over a partial run is worth
reading with that in mind.

**"`eval --rubric` fails a run that did exactly what I asked."** A criterion's
`pattern` is a case-insensitive regular expression, not a literal string:
`"$5.00"` cannot match the text `$5.00`. Escape it — `\$5\.00`. See
[Custom rubrics](#custom-rubrics).

**"`watch` sits there printing nothing."** Either the run is finished but was
never finalized — `watch` says so at attach, and `list`/`show` mark it
`⚠ abandoned?` — or the trace is in another store (see the first entry).

**"`diff` says there are no differences, but the runs behave differently."** The
comparison covers each step's type, name, input, output, model, error and
decision, plus the trace's input, status and error. State snapshots are outside
it, so two runs whose only difference is the context window report none —
read those with `show <id> --snapshots`.

**"Which capture path produced this trace?"** `show` names it, and
`list --source <format>` lists the traces from one path (`hook`, `run`,
`record:codex-exec`, `claude-transcript`, `otel-genai`, `claude-code-logs`).
The match is exact — the names prefix one another — and a value that matches
nothing prints the paths the store actually holds — `Source: hook
(claude-code)`, `record:codex-exec`, `claude-transcript`, `otel-genai`,
`claude-code-logs` — because a store usually holds several, and the path
explains what a trace can and cannot carry (a hook capture records no model; an
OTLP span carries no prompt). A trace ingested from your own document says
nothing there unless the document did.

**"I see two traces for one session."** Two capture paths recorded it, and none
of them can see another's work: the hook adapter looks up only its own open
trace, the OpenTelemetry receiver merges only within its own signal, `import`
identifies a session by file, and `record` opens a trace when its stream says
to. Each says so at the time — the receiver on its console, `import` and
`record` on stderr — so keep one path per session, or expect `stats`, `list` and
a golden baseline to include both.

**"`guard test` found deny matches and still exited 0."** It is a report, not a
gate. `guard check` and `hook --enforce` are the paths that answer with an exit
code.

## Exit codes

Every command exits non-zero on failure, so it drops cleanly into scripts and CI:

| Code | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| `0`  | Success — including "no matches" for queries like `list` and empty exports. |
| `1`  | Runtime failure — trace not found, a malformed ingest, a `record` stream whose every event was rejected, an `import` that found nothing to import (no steps and no prompt), a step that doesn't exist in the trace (`fork --from-step`, or a `replay --from-step`/`--to-step` window matching no step), a `check --golden` regression, or an `eval` that fails (a rubric below its threshold or a built-in preset that fails). |
| `2`  | Usage error, or a command refusing an environment it cannot run in (`dashboard` without an interactive terminal; any read command pointed at a directory with **no trace store** — run `agent-replay init` there, or pass `--dir`; if the store is simply an ancestor of where you are standing, the refusal names it, since running `init` in a subdirectory would create a second store and split the project's traces) — an unknown flag, an unknown command, a missing, empty or bad argument value, or an unexpected extra argument (a typo'd second id or a bare word meant to be a flag is rejected, not silently ignored). "Empty" covers every flag that *names* something — a filter, a file, a preset, a sort field, a directory — so `--agent ""`, `--rubric ""`, `--output ""`, `--sort ""` and `--dir ""` are refused rather than quietly dropped. `--dir` matters most of the group, since it chooses *which store*: `--dir "$STORE"` with `STORE` unset does not mean "use the default", it means you named a store and would otherwise have silently got a different one — reads answering from it at exit `0`, writes landing in it. (A blank `AGENT_REPLAY_DIR` is still read as unset, which is the right reading for an environment variable that is blank by ordinary shell accident.) The one exemption is a capture-mode `hook`, which must never affect the host agent and would lose the event outright if it refused: it warns on stderr and records to the default store. `hook --enforce` is *not* exempt — a gate pointed at the wrong store finds no policies and would allow everything, so it fails closed. For the same reason — refusing would destroy work rather than a label — `run --agent-name ""` warns and falls back to the command name (the value an omitted flag gets) instead of declining to run the child. The exception is a numeric flag whose valid range includes zero, where an empty value deliberately means `0`: `guard add --priority ""` is priority 0, `eval --max-cost ""` is a $0 budget, and `replay --speed ""` is an instant replay. Also the **guard block** signal: `guard check` exits `2` when a policy denies a step (the harness "block" convention), as does `hook --enforce --dialect other`. `guard check` fails closed, so it also answers `2` — with a `deny` verdict on stdout — for a step it cannot evaluate at all: unreadable or malformed stdin, a payload that isn't a step object, a missing `step_type`, a store it cannot open, or a store holding no enabled policies (a gate that can never fire; pass `--allow-empty` if that is deliberate). For a detected harness dialect, `hook --enforce` answers with that harness's own JSON on stdout and exits `0` — the block is the JSON, not the code — so don't gate a script on `$?` there. |

Two commands instead propagate a child's own status: `run` exits with the wrapped command's exit code, and `hook` (capture mode) always exits `0` so it can never interfere with the host agent.

Under `--json`, a failure is still answered **as JSON on stdout** — `{"ok": false, "error": "...", "hints": [...]}` — so a `| jq` pipeline gets a document it can read on every outcome rather than a parse error. The exit code is unchanged by the output shape.

## Evaluation Presets

### Deterministic Presets

These run instantly with no API key required.

**hallucination-check** — Detects hallucination indicators:
- Flags excessive hedging language (30%)
- Checks if output is grounded in retrieval content (40%)
- Verifies no failed steps and no trace-level error (30%, **critical** only when the run itself ended badly — see below)
- Threshold: 0.7

**safety-check** — Detects safety concerns:
- Flags dangerous tool calls like delete/drop/destroy (40%)
- Checks for PII in output (SSN, credit card, email patterns) (30%)
- Detects prompt injection patterns (30%)
- Threshold: 0.8

**completeness-check** — Validates execution completeness:
- Ensures the run produced an answer — an output step, a trace-level output, or a final step that carried output (40%)
- Verifies all tool calls have output (30%, **critical**)
- Checks the trace didn't end with an unresolved error (30%, **critical**)
- Threshold: 0.7

A step counts as failed if its `step_type` is `error` **or** it carries an
`error` value. That matters because the live capture paths (`hook`, `record`,
`import`) record a failed tool as a `tool_call` step with `error` set rather
than as a separate `error` step. Both error criteria also fail on a trace-level
`error`, so a run that died before emitting a final step is caught.

A **critical** criterion fails its preset on its own when it scores 0, whatever
the weighted total says, and the report names which one forced the verdict in a
`failed_critical` list. The weights are 0.4/0.3/0.3 against a 0.7 threshold, so
a lone zeroed 0.3-weight criterion lands on exactly 0.7 and would otherwise
pass — meaning the criterion that detects a failed run could never fail the
preset by itself.

`hallucination-check`'s `no_error_steps` is critical *conditionally*: only when
the run itself ended badly (a trace-level `error`, or status `failed` or
`timeout`). A step error the run recovered from — one tool call that failed and
was retried successfully, on a trace that completed — still costs the criterion
its full 0.3 weight, but does not hard-fail the preset. Otherwise every imported
session containing a single failed shell command would fail outright, while
`completeness-check` called the same trace complete. So a recovered step failure
scores exactly 0.7 and **passes**; if you want any step failure to fail a gate,
use `check --golden` (whose `step_errors` field compares per-step outcomes) or a
custom rubric.

A custom rubric searches what each criterion is actually asserting about:
`expected: false` ("must not contain") sees the whole run — trace input, output
and error, plus every step's name, input, output and error — while
`expected: true` ("must contain") sees only what the run produced, the trace
output and the step outputs. Otherwise a criterion asserting the answer cites a
source is satisfied by the prompt that asked for one. A pattern that cannot be
used — an invalid regex, or one refused as a backtracking risk (a quantified
group containing alternation, or nested quantifiers) — is a usage error naming
the pattern, never a failing criterion: a rejected pattern must not read as a
quality problem with the trace.

### AI-Powered Presets

These require an API key. They use the cheapest models by default (see the provider table below for the current defaults) and typically cost less than $0.01 per evaluation.

**ai-root-cause** — For failed traces. Identifies what went wrong, which step caused it, contributing factors, and suggests a fix. Returns a confidence score.

**ai-quality-review** — Scores any trace on four dimensions: relevance, completeness, coherence, and accuracy (each 1-10). Returns an overall quality score.

**ai-security-audit** — Checks for prompt injection, data exfiltration, unauthorized access patterns, and privilege escalation. Returns a risk level (none/low/medium/high/critical) and specific findings.

**ai-optimization** — Analyzes token efficiency and identifies redundant steps, unnecessary tool calls, and wasted context. Returns an efficiency score and specific optimization suggestions.

### Custom Rubrics

Create a YAML or JSON file with pattern-based criteria. Each `pattern` is a
**case-insensitive regular expression**, not a literal string — so `hello|hi`
means either word, and a pattern meant literally has to escape the regex
metacharacters in it. `pattern: "$5.00"` never matches the text `$5.00`, because
`$` anchors and `.` matches anything: write `\$5\.00`. A pattern that cannot
compile is a usage error before anything is scored, rather than a criterion that
silently scores 0.

```yaml
name: my-custom-check
threshold: 0.8
criteria:
  - name: has_greeting
    pattern: "hello|hi|welcome"
    expected: true
    weight: 1
  - name: no_profanity
    pattern: "badword1|badword2"
    expected: false
    weight: 2
  - name: quotes_the_price      # a literal string, escaped
    pattern: "\\$5\\.00"
    expected: true
    weight: 1
```

```bash
agent-replay eval <trace-id> --rubric my-rubric.yaml
```

## Trace Format

To ingest your agent's execution data, export it as JSON matching this structure:

```json
{
  "agent_name": "my-agent",
  "agent_version": "1.0.0",
  "trigger": "user_message",
  "status": "completed",
  "input": { "task": "book a flight to Tokyo" },
  "output": { "result": "Flight booked: AA 1234" },
  "started_at": "2026-02-27T10:00:00.000Z",
  "ended_at": "2026-02-27T10:00:03.200Z",
  "total_duration_ms": 3200,
  "total_tokens": 4500,
  "total_cost_usd": 0.018,
  "error": null,
  "tags": ["production"],
  "steps": [
    {
      "step_number": 1,
      "step_type": "thought",
      "name": "analyze_request",
      "input": { "message": "book a flight to Tokyo" },
      "output": { "intent": "flight_booking" },
      "duration_ms": 120,
      "tokens_used": 400
    },
    {
      "step_number": 2,
      "step_type": "tool_call",
      "name": "search_flights",
      "input": { "destination": "TYO" },
      "output": { "flights": ["AA 1234", "UA 5678"] },
      "duration_ms": 800,
      "tokens_used": 200
    }
  ]
}
```

Only `agent_name` is required. Everything else is optional.

### Decision & structure fields

Traces and steps carry optional fields that record *why* an agent acted, not just *what* it did. All are backward compatible — omit them and a flat trace remains fully valid.

| Field | On | Meaning |
|-------|----|---------|
| `session_id` | trace | Correlation key grouping traces from one harness session/conversation (e.g. a Claude Code / Codex `session_id`, a Gemini `session.id`, or an app conversation ID) |
| `parent_step` | step | Step number of the parent — nests subagents and nested calls into a tree. Must reference an earlier step. (Stored and returned by `show --json` as `parent_step_number`.) |
| `caused_by_step` | step | Step number that triggered this step. Must reference a strictly earlier step (chains are acyclic). (Stored and returned by `show --json` as `caused_by_step_number`.) |
| `decision` | step | Structured decision record, valid on a step of any type (see below) |

A `decision` block:

```json
{
  "step_number": 4,
  "step_type": "decision",
  "name": "rank_options",
  "caused_by_step": 3,
  "decision": {
    "options": [
      { "option": "fl_1", "rationale": "nonstop, lowest price", "score": 0.92 },
      { "option": "fl_2", "rationale": "nonstop but pricier", "score": 0.74 }
    ],
    "chosen": "fl_1",
    "rationale": "Nonstop matches the user preference; lowest price among nonstops.",
    "confidence": 0.92,
    "decided_by": "agent"
  }
}
```

`decided_by` is one of `agent` (the model chose), `user` (a human at a permission prompt), or `policy` (a policy engine). `confidence` is between 0 and 1. Inspect these with [`show --tree`](#inspect), [`why`, and `decisions`](#explain-decisions).

> **Schema migration:** these fields arrived in schema v2; the current schema is v6 (v3 through v6 add indexes only, no columns). Databases created by earlier versions upgrade automatically the next time they are opened — every existing row is preserved with the new fields defaulting to null. The upgrade is one-way (there is no down-migration).

### Step Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `thought` | Agent reasoning or planning |
| `tool_call` | External tool invocation |
| `llm_call` | LLM API call |
| `retrieval` | RAG / document retrieval |
| `output` | Response delivery |
| `decision` | Decision point |
| `error` | Error occurred |
| `guard_check` | Guardrail policy check |

## Guardrail Policies

Policies match against trace steps and trigger actions.

### Match Pattern

```json
{
  "step_type": "tool_call",
  "name_contains": "delete",
  "name_regex": "drop|destroy",
  "input_contains": "production",
  "output_contains": "error"
}
```

Every field is optional individually, but a pattern must include at least one of
them — an empty pattern (or one with only unrecognized keys) is rejected, since it
would match nothing. When multiple fields are specified, all must match (AND logic). `name_contains` does a case-insensitive substring match; `name_regex` uses a regular expression.

Both sides of a match are **Unicode-folded** first (NFKC, with zero-width and soft-hyphen characters removed), so a policy matches the name an operator meant: `name_contains: "delete"` blocks `DELETE_USER`, the fullwidth `ｄｅｌｅｔｅ_user`, and `delete_user` with a zero-width space inside it. Folding can only make a policy match more — for a guard that is the safe direction, since an over-match is a blocked call you can see and amend, while an under-match runs the call you meant to stop. A `name_regex` is tested against the raw name and the folded one.

### Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `allow` | Explicitly allow matching steps |
| `deny` | Block matching steps |
| `warn` | Flag for review |
| `require_review` | Require human review before proceeding |

## AI Provider Setup

`agent-replay` auto-detects your API key. A configured `ai.model` naming a known family picks its own provider first (a `claude-*` model chooses Anthropic if that key is present); otherwise the order is:

1. **Anthropic** (default model: `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`)
2. **Google Gemini** (default model: `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`)
3. **OpenAI** (default model: `gpt-5.4-nano`)

Set a key via environment variable or config:

```bash
# Environment variable (recommended)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Or store in config
agent-replay config set ai.api_keys.anthropic sk-ant-...

# Verify it works
agent-replay config test-ai
```

All AI presets use the cheapest available model. A typical evaluation costs less than $0.01.

Every provider call has a **60-second deadline** and retries a transient failure **twice** with a doubling backoff (0.5s, then 1s), honoring a `Retry-After` header when the provider sends one. So a routine rate limit or a 503 no longer fails a whole `eval --ai` run, and a provider that accepts the connection and then stalls can no longer hang an unattended CI job — it fails with `Request timed out after 60000ms`. A bad key, a malformed request (4xx) and an unparseable reply are *not* retried; they cannot succeed on a second attempt. Failed attempts consume no tokens, so retries don't change what `--max-cost` prices.

## Programmatic API

You can also use `agent-replay` as a library. The package is **ESM** — `import` it as below; `require('agent-replay')` also works on Node 20.19+/22.12+, where Node loads an ES module from `require()`. TypeScript types ship with it and need nothing else installed.

```typescript
import { ensureDatabase, ingestTrace, getTrace } from 'agent-replay';

const db = ensureDatabase('.agent-replay/traces.db');
const trace = ingestTrace(db, {
  agent_name: 'my-agent',
  status: 'completed',
  steps: [{ step_number: 1, step_type: 'output', name: 'answer', output: { text: 'done' } }],
});
const full = getTrace(db, trace.id); // trace with its steps and evals
// A step's decision record, when it has one, is on the step itself: full.steps[0].decision
```

To record a run live from TypeScript, use the `TraceRecorder` SDK — the same incremental engine the `record` command uses, no files or subprocess required:

```typescript
import { ensureDatabase, TraceRecorder } from 'agent-replay';

const db = ensureDatabase('.agent-replay/traces.db');
// Or bring your own better-sqlite3 handle (e.g. in-memory) and init the schema:
//   import Database from 'better-sqlite3';
//   import { runMigrations } from 'agent-replay';
//   const db = new Database(':memory:'); runMigrations(db);
const rec = new TraceRecorder(db);

rec.startTrace({ agent_name: 'my-agent', session_id: conversationId, input: { task } });
rec.startStep({ step_number: 1, step_type: 'tool_call', name: 'search' });
rec.endStep(1, { output: results, tokens_used: 120 });
rec.endTrace({ status: 'completed', output: answer, total_tokens: 120 });
```

These functions validate their own arguments: an invalid `status` or `step_type` throws an error naming the value and the valid set, rather than surfacing a database constraint.

The two entry points differ on purpose, and in one direction only. `ingestTrace` is a **batch** import, so it refuses a malformed trace outright and names the field. `TraceRecorder` is **live capture**, where one bad field must never cost you the step: a decision `confidence` outside `[0, 1]` and an unrecognized `decided_by` are normalized away (to `null` and `agent`) and the decision is kept, exactly as an unusable `tokens_used` or a forward causal reference already are. Both rules exist for the same reason — **a trace written through the SDK can always be re-ingested from its own export**, which is what the golden-regression gate depends on.

## Development

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd agent-replay
npm install
npm run verify    # typecheck + build + test
npm run dev       # watch mode
```

CI runs `verify` on Node 20, 22, 24 and 26, and separately packs the tarball, installs it into an empty project, and uses it from there — the CLI through the `bin` npm links, both module entry points, and the published types with nothing else installed. Packaging breaks do not show up in a test run against the repo, where `dist/` is a relative path away and every dev dependency is present.
