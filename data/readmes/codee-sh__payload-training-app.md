# Training App

A coach-facing admin and client-facing training tracker built with Payload CMS and Next.js. Coaches build workout plans in the admin panel; clients log their sets through a mobile-friendly web interface.

## What it does

**Coach (admin panel)** — creates plans, assigns them to clients, defines workout structure down to individual exercise rows with target sets and tracking parameters.

**Client (web app)** — logs in, sees their active plan, works through workouts session by session, and logs each set (reps, weight, RIR, time, etc.).

## Data model & flow

The data splits into two layers. The **plan layer** is the template a coach authors (read-only for clients). The **log layer** is what a client records while training. The two never mix: logging never writes to the plan, so the same template can be reused and audited.

```
PLAN LAYER (authored by coach)              LOG LAYER (recorded by client)
─────────────────────────────              ──────────────────────────────
Plan                                        WorkoutLog ............ one training session
└─ Microcycle                               ├─ SetLog ............. one logged set       (N per exercise)
   └─ Workout                               ├─ ExerciseLog ........ one note per exercise (1 per exercise)
      ├─ sections[]   "Warm-up", "Main"     └─ RoundLog ........... one round of a group  (reserved)
      └─ WorkoutGroup    → in a section
         └─ WorkoutExerciseRow              Catalog:  Exercise, Media
            └─ Exercise  (catalog, opt.)    Accounts: User (coach), Client (athlete)
                                            Sharing:  ShareLink
```

> `sections[]` is **not a collection** — it's an array of named headings (`title`/`subtitle`) stored on the `Workout`. A `WorkoutGroup` attaches to one section via its `sectionRowId`. So the visible nesting in the app is **Workout → Section → Group → Exercise row**, while in the database a group points back to its section by id.

### How a log row points back to the plan

A `WorkoutLog` references the `Workout` it belongs to and the `Client` who owns it. Each `SetLog` / `ExerciseLog` references its `session` (the `WorkoutLog`) **and** the `exerciseRow` (`WorkoutExerciseRow`) it logs against — that `exerciseRow` link is the key that ties execution back to the exact line in the plan.

### Collections

#### Accounts

| Collection | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `users` | ✅ | Coaches / staff. The only accounts allowed into `/admin`. |
| `clients` | ✅ | Athletes. Log in to the client web app (never the admin). Holds `name`, a join to their `plans`, and admin-only `notes` (trainer notes, hidden from the client). 2h sessions, lockout after 5 failed logins. |

#### Catalog

| Collection | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `exercises` | Reusable exercise catalog (name, muscle group, equipment, video, description). `trackingType` decides **which metric fields** the client sees in the logging form (e.g. weight+reps vs distance+time). Readable by any authenticated user; only coaches edit. |
| `media` | Image uploads (public read). |

#### Training plan (template — coach writes, client reads)

| Collection | Belongs to | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `plans` | a `client` | Top-level program. Status (active/paused/completed), date range, title, description. Versioned (audit trail). Client can read only their own. |
| `microcycles` | `plan` | A block/week within the plan. Target `rpe`, `order`. |
| `workouts` | `microcycle` | A single training day. Has an `order`, optional `rpe`, and `sections[]` (named blocks like "Warm-up", "Main part"). Edited via a custom **Structure** admin tab. Cannot be deleted once it has logged sessions. |
| `workout-groups` | `workout` | A group of exercises sharing a `protocol` (Standard / EMOM / AMRAP / For Time / Tabata) and its parameters (rounds, durations, rest). Links to a workout section via `sectionRowId`. E.g. an "A1/A2 superset". Cannot be deleted if its rows have logged sets. |
| `workout-exercise-rows` | `workout-group` | One prescribed exercise line. Optional link to a catalog `exercise`, plus targets (`reps`, `kg`, `tut`, `rir`, `rest`, duration), a plan `note`, optional per-set `setParameters[]` (drop sets/pyramids), and an `override` of the group protocol. Cannot be deleted if it has logged sets. |

#### Training log (execution — client writes)

| Collection | Keyed by | Cardinality | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `workout-logs` | `client` + `workout` | one per session | A training session. Auto-titled, holds `startedAt` / `finishedAt` and general session `notes`. Creating the first set auto-creates the session. |
| `set-logs` | `session` + `exerciseRow` (+ `setNumber`) | **N per exercise** | One logged set: weight, reps, RIR, distance, duration, bodyweight flag, per-set `note`. A `beforeValidate` hook strips any metric not allowed by the exercise's `trackingType`. |
| `exercise-logs` | `session` + `exerciseRow` | **1 per exercise** | A single client note for the whole exercise in that session (vs. `set-logs`, which is per set). Same relations as `set-logs` so it can grow beyond a note later. Upserted from the tracker. |
| `round-logs` | `session` + `group` | one per round | Per-round execution of a group (round number, status, timing). **Reserved** — defined in the schema but not yet written by the app. |

For every log collection: a client may only create/read/update/delete **their own** rows (`adminOrOwnByClient`), and the owning `client` is always set server-side from the session — never trusted from the request.

#### Sharing

| Collection | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `share-links` | A tokenized, read-only link to a `plan`. `permissions` choose what is exposed (`plan` preview and/or `results` logs); `expiresAt` + `active` gate it. Only coaches manage links; the public access happens via the `share-token` cookie, which `canReadViaShareToken` validates to scope reads to that plan owner's data. |

### End-to-end flow

1. **Author** — coach creates a `Client`, then a `Plan` → `Microcycle` → `Workout`, and builds structure (`WorkoutGroup` → `WorkoutExerciseRow`) on the workout's **Structure** tab, linking each row to a catalog `Exercise`.
2. **Assign** — the plan is owned by the client; they log in and see only their own active plan.
3. **Train** — opening a workout creates a `WorkoutLog` on first save. The client logs each set as a `SetLog` (fields driven by the exercise's `trackingType`) and can attach one `ExerciseLog` note per exercise.
4. **Review** — coach reads the client's logs in the admin; deleting plan structure that already has logs is blocked to protect history.
5. **Share** (optional) — a `ShareLink` exposes a read-only plan and/or results to anyone with the link until it expires.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 24
- Yarn 4 (`corepack enable`)
- PostgreSQL database

### Setup

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd training-app
yarn install
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/training_app
PAYLOAD_SECRET=your-long-random-secret-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Apply existing migrations:

```bash
yarn payload migrate
```

Create a new migration only after changing the Payload schema:

```bash
yarn payload migrate:create
yarn payload migrate
```

Maintainers run migration commands manually. Agents do not generate or apply database migrations.

### Run

```bash
yarn dev
```

- App: `http://localhost:3000/pl`
- Admin panel: `http://localhost:3000/admin`

### First-time setup

1. Open `/admin` and create the first user account — this becomes the super-admin
2. (Optional) seed demo data: `yarn seed`
3. Create a **Client** record for each athlete
4. Build a **Plan**, link microcycles → workouts → exercise rows
5. The client logs in at `/pl` using their email and password set in the admin

### Module architecture

- A module represents a business capability, not a Payload collection.
- Closely related areas stay inside one module. `training` owns `exercises`, `plans`, and
  `logs`.
- `src/app` contains routing and page composition. Feature implementations live outside it.
- Domain-specific frontend components live in `src/modules/<module>/components`.
- Server queries and use cases use an explicit `server/` entry point with `server-only`.
- Payload Admin implementations live in `src/modules/<module>/admin`.
- Payload collection configuration, access control, hooks, and relationships remain in
  `src/collections`.
- Cross-module imports use public entry points and must remain one-directional.
- `src/lib` is reserved for technical, domain-agnostic functions and SDK clients.

## Development

### Adding a collection

Follow `.agents/skills/payload-build-collections` — each collection lives in
`src/collections/{kebab-case}/index.ts` and is registered in `src/collections/index.ts`.

After changing collection configs, regenerate types:

```bash
yarn generate:types
```

### Adding an admin view or custom field UI

Follow `.agents/skills/payload-build-modules`. Place the implementation in
`src/modules/<module>/admin/<feature>/`. After adding or changing a registered component
path, run:

```bash
yarn generate:importmap
```

### Adding a frontend component

Follow `.agents/skills/payload-frontend-build-components`.

- Generic primitives belong in `src/components/ui`.
- Cross-module application components belong in `src/components/common`.
- Domain-specific components belong in `src/modules/<module>/components/<feature>`.
- Routed pages remain in `src/app/[locale]/(frontend)`.

### AI skills

This project uses skill files for AI-assisted development. Skills are managed with [npx skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) and installed into `.claude/skills/` (Claude Code) and `.agents/skills/` (Codex).

To install skills from the source repository:

```bash
npx skills add <source-path-or-url> -a claude-code -a codex --copy
```

`.agents/skills/` is the local source of truth. After editing a skill, synchronize it with:

```bash
ags push-skill
```

Do not edit `.claude/skills/` manually; it is a generated copy.

Skills cover: Payload patterns, collection scaffolding, admin module structure, UI copy, and spec writing.
