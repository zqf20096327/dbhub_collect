Barrage is a load testing tool built to answer one question: **when an
application slows down, is the cause the application itself, or the database
and cache underneath it?**

It drives concurrent HTTP, database, and Redis load on a single clock, records
every layer's latencies into the same time buckets, and compares them bucket by
bucket. Instead of one latency curve that hides where the time went, you get a
correlated view of the API, the database, and the cache — and a report that
flags exactly which bucket a storage layer spiked in, and whether the
application was affected or not.

## Quickstart

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codetesla51/barrage/main/install.sh | bash
```

That grabs a prebuilt binary from GitHub releases — no Go toolchain needed.
Pin a version or change the target dir with
`bash -s -- --version v0.7.0 --dir ~/.local/bin`, or build from source with
`--from-source` (requires Go 1.25 or later). See `./install.sh --help` for all
flags. Or build from source directly:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/codetesla51/barrage && cd barrage
go build -o barrage ./cmd/barrage
# fallback without a checkout:
# go install github.com/codetesla51/barrage/cmd/barrage@latest
```

The DB runner supports **Postgres**, **MySQL**, and **SQLite** out of the box;
because it sits on `database/sql`, any other driver can be linked in by adding
a blank import and registering its name. HTTP-only runs require no backing
services.

Then point `config.yaml` at your targets (see [Configuration](#configuration))
and run:

```sh
barrage run                      # runs config.yaml, writes report.html
barrage run -o                   # ...and opens the report in your browser
barrage run --no-report --json results.json   # for CI, no browser needed
barrage compare --baseline base.json --current new.json   # diff two runs
```

The report is self-contained: Chart.js loads from a CDN, but all run data is
embedded in the page.

## Commands

```

Examples:

```sh
barrage run -c staging.yaml --duration 1m --ramp 10s --concurrency 50
barrage run --http-threshold 150ms --db-threshold 250ms --redis-threshold 80ms  # adjust spike thresholds
barrage run --no-report --json results.json                 # for CI pipelines
```

Every `--` flag overrides its config counterpart.

A scenario run looks like this: the `rates` line names each journey with its
step count and weight, the runner column carries the scenario name, and there
is no STATUS column content (scenarios record success as 2xx-per-step, not
status histograms) — the header still prints, the cells are empty.

### `barrage compare`

`barrage compare` diffs two runs produced by `barrage run --json`, so an earlier
baseline can be checked against a later run — the missing piece for CI gating
and regression checking across releases.

Runners present only in one side are labeled **NEW** (or counted as fixed) —
they never show as regressions just because the baseline didn't have them, so
renaming or adding scenarios mid-project doesn't produce false alarms. Spike
diffs match by ordinal position per runner rather than wall-clock timestamps,
since two runs never share a clock.

```
$ barrage compare --baseline base.json --current new.json --fail-on 100ms

comparing base.json -> new.json (fail-on 100ms)
RUNNER  BASELINE_P99  CURRENT_P99  CHANGE  VERDICT
DB      80ms          100ms        +25%    ok
HTTP    30ms          70ms         +133%   REGRESSION
Redis   20ms          22ms         +10%    ok
```

Flags:

```
      --baseline string      path to the baseline JSON report
      --current string       path to the current JSON report
      --fail-on duration     fail (exit non-zero) if a runner regresses above this latency budget (default 100ms)
  -o, --open                 open the report in a browser after comparing
      --report string        path for the HTML comparison report (default "compare.html", empty skips it)
```

How it works:

- **Per-runner diff.** Each runner's P99 is compared baseline→current with a
  percentage change. A runner is flagged **REGRESSION** when its current P99
  exceeds the `--fail-on` budget while its baseline was at or under it, so a
  runner that was already slow isn't re-flagged every run. Any regression makes
  `barrage compare` exit non-zero — the signal CI uses to gate a deployment.
- **Spike diff.** Each correlated spike in both runs is classified as **new**,
  **fixed**, **worsened**, **improved**, or **unchanged**, so you can see both
  newly-introduced storage bottlenecks and ones that were resolved.
- **Overlaid timeline.** Both runs' per-bucket P99 latencies are aligned onto
  one label axis in the HTML report (baseline dashed, current solid), so you can
  see *where* in the run latency drifted.
- **Exit code as CI gate.** Combined with `barrage run --no-report --json
  baseline.json` and `--fail-on`, you can make an unstaged regression fail a
  pipeline before it ships.

### Other commands

```sh
barrage version    # print the version (from the git tag; `go run` builds show the dev default)
barrage help run   # full flags for a subcommand; --help works on all of them
```

Shell completion (generated by cobra, nothing custom):

```sh
barrage completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/barrage
barrage completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_barrage"
```

### Capacity sweep

The capacity question, answered by experiment instead of guessing. A capacity
sweep raises concurrency level by level, running a short burst at each, until
latency breaks:

```yaml
concurrency: 5 # sweep start
capacity:
  max_concurrency: 160 # search cap
  step_duration: 10s # burst per level, not the full duration
```

```sh
barrage run -c examples/capacity-pg.yaml
barrage run -c config.yaml --capacity --capacity-max-concurrency 160 --capacity-step-duration 10s
```

How it works: coarse doubling finds the rough zone fast (5→10→20→40…),
then a fine linear fill pins it down between the last ok level and the first
broken one (80→160 becomes 100, 120, 140). Each level runs a short burst;
DB and Redis connections open once and stay warm across levels so early
buckets measure strain, not reconnect cost. Paced runners (`http`/`db`/
`redis`) scale their rate with concurrency so bigger crowds push more load;
scenario load comes from the VUs themselves. A level breaks when any runner's
P99 crosses its threshold or success drops under 95% — the verdict names the
culprit (`CAUSE db`, `http,redis`, …), and the report charts concurrency vs
P99 so you see a cliff or a slope, not just one number. `ramp:` and
`duration:` are ignored while a sweep runs (set them `0s`/anything; the
loader still requires the keys). The same mode is available as
`--capacity` / `--capacity-max-concurrency` / `--capacity-step-duration`
flags; the pre-0.6 names `auto_ramp:` and `--auto-ramp`/`--ramp-max-concurrency`/
`--ramp-step-duration` still load with a rename warning.

Same-machine caveat: running the generator on the same box as the app,
database, or Redis means all of them fight for the same CPU — the break
point you find is the machine's, not the system's. Good enough for
comparing configs and finding the culprit layer; not a production capacity
number. For a real one, generate load from a separate machine.

## The report

`report.html` contains:

- **Verdict** — one plain-words line (broke at N users / clean run), the
  bottleneck, and next steps. Always rendered; empty runs explain why.
- **Run summary** — requests, success %, P50/P95/P99/max/mean, rate, throughput,
  and the HTTP status-code histogram for each runner.
- **Correlated spikes** — a table of flagged buckets (runner, per-bucket P99
  values, bottleneck verdict) and an overall "bottleneck lean" readout.
- **Latency timeline** — every runner's per-bucket P99 on a shared x-axis so
  storage and HTTP latency can be compared directly.
- **Capacity sweep** (sweep runs only) — concurrency vs P99 with the break
  point, per-level verdicts, and the error buckets naming what failed.
- **Export JSON button** — in the top bar; downloads the run as the same JSON
  the `--json` flag writes, so a report opened in a browser can still feed a
  dashboard or a CI comparison.

![Correlated spikes table](./docs/todo-api-run-1.png)

*What those two screenshots show: a 3-minute heavy run against the TodoAPI stack (Gin + Postgres + Redis) — `GET /api/todos` over HTTP at 120/s, a weighted read/write query mix against Postgres at 80/s, and Redis commands at 300/s, with a 60s ramp and concurrency 50, generator and stack on the same machine. With the app's rate limiter at production settings it absorbed nearly the whole HTTP burst as 429s — the API stayed flat at ~5ms p50 while the real load landed on the data stores. With the limiter boosted, every request reached the backend: Postgres saturates and drags HTTP P99 to multi-second territory, while Redis stays under 100ms P99. One bottleneck, three correlated curves.*

The JSON export mirrors this structure: `generated_at`, `duration`, `ramp`,
`concurrency`, per-runner metrics (latencies in milliseconds), correlated spikes
(each with `runner`, `http_p99_ms`, `storage_p99_ms`, and `masked`), the
timeline, and — when the run was a capacity sweep — the `capacity_search`
curve (per-level concurrency/requests/p99/success, `break_at`, `last_ok`).
Capacity steps also carry an `errors` map when scenario steps failed at that
level (e.g. `{"dial_timeout": 5120, "5xx": 1800}`), so the breaking run's
story answers what failed, not just how much. In
the timeline's `p99_ms` series, `-1` marks a bucket where that runner had no
request (e.g. before the ramp produced its first hit); the report chart renders
these as gaps, not as a latency of -1ms.

## Concepts

### Spike correlation

1. All runners' buckets are aligned by their unix start time
   (`HTTPBucket.Start.Unix()` == storage `Bucket.Start`).
2. Each storage runner — DB and Redis — is checked independently against the
   HTTP run. A bucket is flagged when the storage runner's **P99 exceeds its
   threshold**, and the spike is either **correlated** (HTTP also crossed
   `http-threshold`, labeled with a bottleneck verdict) or **masked** (storage
   spiked while HTTP stayed under its own).
3. Masked spikes are still reported so a storage bottleneck that does not yet
   back up the application is surfaced. The CLI marks them `db-only` /
   `redis-only`, the HTML report tags them `DB (masked)` / `Redis (masked)`,
   and the JSON export sets `masked: true`. A bucket where both DB and Redis
   spike produces two rows.

Thresholds default to 100ms each and apply per runner (`--http-threshold`,
`--db-threshold`, `--redis-threshold`). In scenario mode the app-side
reference is synthesized from the worst per-bucket journey latency.

HTTP-only buckets are deliberately not flagged: a slow endpoint that leaves the
data stores idle is an application problem, not a storage problem.

### Scenarios vs plain HTTP

`scenario:` runs sequential HTTP steps per virtual user — it *is* your HTTP
load, in journey form instead of single shots. Each VU picks one scenario
once at launch (weighted by `weight`), then loops it until `duration`
expires. `extract` maps a var name to a JSON path (`$.token`,
`$.user.id` via gjson); the value is stored per VU and `{{var}}` is
interpolated into later step `url`, `body`, and `headers`. Missing vars stay
as `{{var}}` so misconfig is visible; non-JSON or missing paths leave the
var unset.

`scenario:` cannot be combined with `http:` — and that is deliberate, not a
limitation. Correlation needs exactly one app-side reference timeline per
bucket: either the `http` runner's P99, or the worst journey P99 synthesized
from scenarios. Two app curves would double-count rates, progress, and every
verdict. To mix plain hits with flows, model the plain hit as a one-step
scenario. Note `rate` also means different things per runner (`http`/`db`/
`redis` are paced per-second targets; scenario throughput emerges from VUs
looping). Scenarios can run alongside `db`/`redis` — buckets use the same
`Start.Unix()/bucket_width` scheme so timelines align.

### Rate, concurrency, and ramp

- `rate` is the *target* rate. If `concurrency` is too small to keep up, the
  pool backs up and throughput settles below target. This is intentional: a
  real load test should expose the target's limits rather than silently
  serializing requests.
- `concurrency` for HTTP maps to vegeta's `MaxWorkers`; unset (0) lets vegeta
  scale workers on its own. For DB and Redis it is the pool size; 0 selects the
  default of 10 workers. The run header reports which mode is in effect.
- `ramp` schedules hits so the rate grows linearly from 0 to full across the
  window (a 3s ramp at 2000/s fires roughly 3000 requests during the ramp, then
  holds 2000/s). With no `ramp`, the full rate applies from the first request.
- **Weighted mixed queries.** One query is picked per request, weighted, so a
  config can mix reads and writes the way real traffic does. The cumulative
  weight table is built once per run (v0.6.4+): building it per request cost
  O(n) alloc+scan each time, so a 10k-entry list at 2k req/s melted the
  generator and the timeouts were misread as database failures.
- **Read/write routing.** Each DB query's `type` field is authoritative
  (`read` runs through `Query`, `write` through `Exec`); untyped queries fall
  back to a heuristic on the SQL text.
- **Real parallelism.** Requests are submitted to a worker pool, so `rate` is
  not a serial request stream.

Engines per runner:

| Runner | Engine | Parallelism |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP | vegeta attacker | vegeta workers (bounded by `concurrency`) |
| DB | `database/sql` + [pond](https://github.com/alitto/pond) worker pool | `concurrency` workers |
| Redis | go-redis client + pond worker pool | `concurrency` workers |

The DB and Redis runners pace requests at `rate` per second, submitting each to
a pool capped at `concurrency` workers. Results carry the submission timestamp,
so buckets reflect when load was generated, not when responses completed.

A command still in flight when the run ends is aborted rather than counted
against the target: DB reads abort cleanly (no side effects) and are not
failures, while DB **write** errors still surface since the write may have
executed server-side. Redis commands aborted at shutdown before the server
answers (`context canceled`) are likewise not failures; any other Redis error
is a real failure.

### Live progress

Runs are no longer silent. Barrage prints one structured status line every 5s:

```
  00:45/03:00 │ http 3,900 · 0 err │ db 900 · 0 err │ redis 1,350 · 0 err
```

with thousands separators, an mm:ss clock, and semantic colors (amber counts,
red error counts). A totals line lands when the run completes. Pass
`--no-progress` for plain log lines (CI default in the reference workflows).

## Configuration

The default config file is `config.yaml`. Any subset of `http`, `db`, and
`redis` is valid; at least one section is required. Durations use Go's
`time.ParseDuration` format (`10s`, `1m30s`, `500ms`). Unknown keys are
rejected so a typo fails loudly instead of being silently ignored.

```yaml
duration: 15s        # how long to run

ramp: 3s             # ramp rate from 0 to full over this window (0 = no ramp)

```

### Field reference

- `type` on each DB query is authoritative for read/write routing: `read` runs
  through `Query`, `write` through `Exec`. If omitted, routing falls back to
  detecting the SQL text (SELECT / SHOW / EXPLAIN / WITH → read; any query
  containing a `RETURNING` clause → write). Prefer an explicit `type`; detection
  is a heuristic. The distinction also shapes shutdown accounting: when the run
  ends mid-query, a cancelled read counts as cleanly aborted (no side effects),
  while a write's error is surfaced — it may already have executed server-side.
- `args` (optional) is scoped per query, not global: it binds parameters for
  that query only. Omit it entirely when the query has no placeholders.
- `driver` selects the database backend: `postgres`, `mysql`, or `sqlite`
  (pure-Go, no CGO). Common aliases are normalized (`postgresql`/`pg` →
  `postgres`, `sqlite3` → `sqlite`), and an unsupported name fails loudly with
  the list of compiled-in drivers. Each driver expects its own connection DSN:
  Postgres `postgres://...`, MySQL `user:pass@tcp(host:3306)/db`, SQLite a file
  path such as `/tmp/test.db`.
- `max_open_conns`, `max_idle_conns`, `conn_max_lifetime`, `conn_max_idle_time`
  (all optional, under `db.target`) tune the `database/sql` connection pool.
  Unset counts default to the run's `concurrency` so the tool never holds more
  connections than it has workers; unset lifetimes leave the driver default.
  `max_open_conns: -1` removes the open-connection cap entirely
  (`database/sql` treats 0 as unlimited); with an unlimited cap an unset
  `max_idle_conns` defaults to `concurrency`, because `SetMaxIdleConns(0)`
  means *zero* idle connections, not unlimited. Values below `-1` are
  rejected. Otherwise, set `max_open_conns` at or below the database's
  `max_connections` or the errors you measure are the tool's, not the target's.
- `capacity:` replaces a single run with a search: `max_concurrency` caps it,
  `step_duration` (default 10s) sizes each level's burst. Start is the run's
  `concurrency`. While it runs, `ramp:` and `duration:` are ignored — bursts
  force the inner ramp off and use `step_duration` instead. `auto_ramp:` is
  accepted as a deprecated alias for `capacity:`.

## Chaos testing (Toxiproxy)

Barrage can inject network faults during a run — latency, outages, packet
loss — to answer "did correctness/performance degrade under load + failure."
Faults run through [Toxiproxy](https://github.com/Shopify/toxiproxy), which
relays raw TCP bytes regardless of protocol (Postgres wire, RESP, HTTP). The
only thing that changes per runner is which host:port it dials.

Toxiproxy is a separate process, not a Go import. If it is already running,
barrage uses it as-is. If not, barrage starts a managed `toxiproxy-server`
automatically (it must be in `PATH`) and stops it after the run — both are
announced on stderr:

```
[chaos] toxiproxy not running at localhost:8474, starting /usr/local/bin/toxiproxy-server ...
[chaos] using managed toxiproxy-server (pid 12345), will stop it after the run
[chaos] stopped managed toxiproxy-server
```

To run it yourself instead:

```sh
# binary from https://github.com/Shopify/toxiproxy/releases
toxiproxy-server &
```

Then point runners at the proxy listen address and schedule faults:

```yaml
redis:
  rate: 10
  target:
    addr: localhost:6379
    chaos_addr: localhost:26001   # dial proxy when chaos mode is on
    queries:
      - query: PING
        weight: 1

chaos:
  api: localhost:8474
  proxies:
    - name: redis-proxy
      listen: localhost:26001
      upstream: localhost:6379
  faults:
    - at: 5s
      duration: 5s
      proxy: redis-proxy
      type: latency
      attrs:
        latency: 300
```

```sh
barrage run -c examples/chaos-redis.yaml
```

How it works: barrage creates the proxies at run start, the scheduler fires
`AddToxic`/`RemoveToxic` at each fault's offset, and every injection/removal
is logged with a timestamp (`[chaos] add latency on redis-proxy at 5s`) so the
report can overlay fault windows on the latency timeline. The HTML report adds
a chaos faults table; the JSON export adds `chaos_events`.

Supported toxic types are exactly what Toxiproxy exposes — no custom fault
types. Each fault sets `type` plus its `attrs`:

| Type | What it does | Key `attrs` | Use it for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `latency` | delays every byte by N ms (± jitter) | `latency` (ms), `jitter` (ms) | slow dependency: does P99 climb, do timeouts fire? |
| `bandwidth` | caps throughput to N KB/s | `rate` (KB/s) | thin pipe: does the app back up or degrade gracefully? |
| `timeout` | stops all data, closes after N ms (`0` = hold open, drop forever) | `timeout` (ms) | hung dependency: do deadlines and circuit breakers trip? |
| `slow_close` | delays TCP close by N ms | `delay` (ms) | sloppy teardown: do pools leak or stall on close? |
| `reset_peer` | kills connections with TCP RST, now or after N ms | `timeout` (ms) | connection reset by peer: does retry logic hold? |
| `slicer` | chops TCP stream into tiny packets, optional delay between them | `average_size` (bytes), `size_variation` (bytes), `delay` (µs) | chatty/flaky network: does tail latency explode? |
| `limit_data` | closes once N bytes pass through | `bytes` | truncated responses: does the client detect short reads? |
| `down` | takes the whole proxy down (no connections pass) | none | full outage: does the app fail fast or hang? Implemented as proxy disable/enable, not a toxic. |

`stream` (default `downstream`) picks the direction: `downstream` faults the
server→client path (responses), `upstream` faults client→server (requests).
`toxicity` (default `1.0`) sets what fraction of connections is affected —
`0.5` faults half of them for partial-outage shapes.

Full example — every runner through its own proxy with staggered faults
(`examples/chaos-full.yaml`):

```yaml
duration: 20s
bucket_width: 1s
ramp: 0s
concurrency: 5

http:
  rate: 10
  target:
    method: GET
    url: http://localhost:8080/api/products
    chaos_url: http://localhost:26002/api/products

db:
  rate: 5
  target:
    driver: postgres
    conn: postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb?sslmode=disable
    chaos_conn: postgres://user:pass@localhost:26000/mydb?sslmode=disable
    queries:
      - query: SELECT id FROM orders LIMIT 10
        weight: 1
        type: read

redis:
  rate: 10
  target:
    addr: localhost:6379
    chaos_addr: localhost:26001
    queries:
      - query: PING
        weight: 1

chaos:
  api: localhost:8474
  proxies:
    - name: db-proxy
      listen: localhost:26000
      upstream: localhost:5432
    - name: redis-proxy
      listen: localhost:26001
      upstream: localhost:6379
    - name: http-proxy
      listen: localhost:26002
      upstream: localhost:8080
  faults:
    - at: 5s
      duration: 5s
      proxy: db-proxy
      type: latency
      attrs:
        latency: 500
    - at: 10s
      duration: 4s
      proxy: redis-proxy
      type: timeout
      attrs:
        timeout: 800
    - at: 14s
      duration: 3s
      proxy: http-proxy
      type: bandwidth
      attrs:
        rate: 100
```

```sh
barrage run -c examples/chaos-full.yaml
```

Smaller shapes: `examples/chaos-redis.yaml` is the same pattern with one
runner and one fault. `examples/chaos-app.yaml` flips it around: no
db:/redis: load runners at all, only scenario VUs driving the demo app while
the faults break the app's own Postgres and Redis (the app dials them through
proxies — see the header comment for the startup order).

Runner wiring is mechanical — the same override pattern everywhere:

| Runner | Real target | Chaos override | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| DB | `conn` | `chaos_conn` | Postgres/MySQL only; SQLite is a local file and is rejected with chaos faults |
| Redis | `addr` | `chaos_addr` | |
| HTTP | `url` | `chaos_url` | |
| Scenario step | `url` | `chaos_url` | per step, mirrors HTTP |

Chaos mode is strictly opt-in: a config without `chaos:` runs exactly as
before, with no proxy, no scheduler, and no event log. Chaos cannot be
combined with a `capacity:` sweep — fault offsets are relative to a single
run. Toxiproxy cleanup is automatic: toxics are removed after every run, and
a managed server is stopped; a server you started yourself is left running.

## Demo stack

A reference backend + load stack for exercising every runner on one clock
without touching a real service. Everything lives in this repo:

- `cmd/demoserver` — an HTTP app on `:8080` written to behave like a real
  backend:
  - `POST /api/login` — verifies a **bcrypt** password hash against a seeded
    `users` table and returns an HMAC-signed token (`AUTH_SECRET`, 15 min
    expiry); repeat logins **reuse the live session** (bcrypt once per
    session, then a fast HMAC password check — no recompute)
  - `GET /api/me` — validates the Bearer token (signature + expiry)
  - `GET /api/products` / `GET /api/orders` — read routes served from a
    short-TTL Redis cache (`REDIS_ADDR`) with an indexed Postgres fallback;
    the orders list scans only the primary key for the newest 20 rows — no
    full-table count over the seeded 1M rows
  - `POST /api/orders` — INSERTs one row, invalidates the cached list
  - `GET /api/checkout`, `GET /health`
- `cmd/seeddb` — bulk-seeds an `orders` table (COPY, 100k-row chunks), adds
  the indexes the read paths rely on (`customer, id DESC`, `created_at`), and
  seeds login users (`alice`/`bob`/`carol`, password `secret`) with real
  bcrypt hashes:

```sh
go run ./cmd/seeddb -conn "postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb?sslmode=disable" -n 1000000
```

- `docker-compose.yml` + `docker/configs/` — the whole stack containerized.
  `docker compose up --build` starts postgres + redis, seeds, brings up the
  app, then runs `docker/configs/demo.yaml`; results land in `./reports/`.
  Capacity profiles (`lifecycle.yaml`, `full-app.yaml`, `real-app.yaml`)
  sweep concurrency 5→200 with journeys, DB, and Redis all on one clock.
  The same stack runs on a GitHub runner via `.github/workflows/demo-stack.yml`
  (manual dispatch, `profile` input selects the config, `./reports/` uploaded
  as an artifact).

### Profiles

Ready-to-run profiles live in [`examples/`](examples/), all targeting the demo
server on `:8080`:

| File | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `light.yaml` | gentle baseline: HTTP + Redis at ~15 req/s |
| `heavy.yaml` | stress profile: HTTP + SQLite + Redis at ~4x light, higher concurrency |
| `scenario-login.yaml` | single journey: login, extract token, interpolate into later steps |
| `scenarios-weighted.yaml` | multiple journeys with weights (browse vs checkout traffic mix) |
| `scenario-full.yaml` | full stack: weighted journeys + SQLite (with pool caps) + Redis on one clock |
| `capacity-pg.yaml` | capacity sweep against Postgres |
| `docker/configs/demo.yaml` | containerized 15s flat run: HTTP + Postgres + Redis |
| `docker/configs/flat-full.yaml` | containerized 20s flat run: journeys + DB + Redis (per-runner tables) |
| `docker/configs/full-app.yaml` | containerized sweep: journeys + DB + Redis, 5→200 |
| `docker/configs/lifecycle.yaml` | containerized sweep: journeys + DB + Redis, lifecycle mix |
| `docker/configs/real-app.yaml` | containerized sweep: journeys only, zero synthetic load |
| `docker/configs/scenario.yaml` | containerized 15s flat run: journeys only |

Run any of them against the demo stack:

```sh
barrage run -c examples/scenarios-weighted.yaml
```

Flat profiles (`demo.yaml`, `flat-full.yaml`, `scenario.yaml`) produce
per-runner tables, correlated spikes, and the latency timeline. Sweep profiles
(`full-app.yaml`, `lifecycle.yaml`, `real-app.yaml`) produce the verdict plus
the concurrency-vs-P99 chart — no per-runner aggregates by design.

### Case studies: the demo-stack progression

Four progressive sweeps of the same journey mix (browse / account-check /
checkout-flow / login / health) against the same 2-vCPU GitHub runner. The
lesson is not the numbers — it is that each fix moved the boundary and
changed who was blamed:

| Stack state | Knee (users) | First victim | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| original (stub login, `SELECT count(*)` over 1M rows) | 0–1 | DB | the full-table scan parked DB P99 at the 100ms line doing nothing |
| + Redis cache on the read routes | 3 | DB | reads offloaded, but the synthetic DB runner still blasted the store |
| + real schema, indexes, real bcrypt login | 10 | app | the silly query is gone; the app's own CPU (bcrypt + writes) is now the wall |
| same, VUs only (zero synthetic db/redis load) | 7–8 | app | removes out-of-band load; the app is still the bottleneck |
| + session reuse on repeat logins (v0.6.0+) | 12–13 | app | bcrypt once per session, not per login; one observed run held 12, broke at 13 |

The tails at the last good level tell the same story in one line: **103ms →
75–89ms → 22–96ms → 41–64ms → 74ms**, with success held at 98–100% throughout —
every break was a latency crossing, never an error storm. The v0.6.1 error
buckets on the 12–13 run back that up: zero `dial_timeout`/`connection_refused`/
`conn_reset` on any level — the app stayed reachable from first level to last.

#### Read the verdicts, not the numbers

Every run above happened on a GitHub Actions runner: 2 vCPUs, the whole stack
(load generator + app + Postgres + Redis) sharing one box, on a VM whose
resource allocation is **not guaranteed between runs**. Consequences:

- **Knees wobble run to run** — the same profile measured 7 users one day and
  10 the next. Causes include transient VM allocation, cache-expiry timing
  (the 5s TTL thundering-herd collapses isolated levels), and bursty VU
  firehose throughput.
- **Absolute numbers are relative.** "~7K req/s ceiling" and "holds ~10 users"
  describe *that* box on *that* day. They are for comparing configs and
  finding the culprit layer — not a capacity spec.
- **"Slow" is a budget you set.** A P99 that crossed this run's 100ms bar
  might be perfectly acceptable under a 200ms SLO. The tool finds where
  *your* line gets crossed; it does not decree the line.
- **For a real capacity figure:** load from a separate machine on stable,
  pinned hardware, and repeat. Same-machine sweeps prove shape and culprit —
  not scale.

### Separated-box runs (cloudflared tunnel)

The single-box workflow proves shape and culprit; this removes the last
shared-box doubt. [`.github/workflows/demo-stack-separated.yml`](.github/workflows/demo-stack-separated.yml)
runs the stack on one runner VM and the load on a *second* runner VM, joined
by a free cloudflared quick tunnel (no account, no inbound port):

```sh
gh workflow run demo-stack-separated.yml -f profile=real-app.yaml
```

Read the `demo-reports` artifact exactly like the single-box runs — the
`capacity_search.steps[].errors` buckets name *what* broke each level. Two
caveats keep the numbers honest:

- **VM-level, not node-level, separation.** GitHub schedules the jobs on
  distinct runner VMs; the underlying hardware is still shared cloud
  capacity, so results stay relative.
- **The tunnel adds a latency floor** — every request round-trips through
  cloudflare's edge — that applies evenly to every level, so the sweep
  *shape* still reads. If the app job's hold window ever runs out mid-sweep,
  the errors buckets show the cut unmistakably: a `dial_timeout`/`conn_reset`
  flood instead of a `5xx`/latency story.

## When to use Barrage (and when not)

Use it for:

- Investigating why an API is slow (is it the app, the database, or the cache?).
- Testing database bottlenecks: missing indexes, connection-pool limits,
  query plans.
- Comparing infrastructure changes before/after a migration or tuning pass.
- Performance regression testing across releases: run a baseline, change the
  code or infra, run again, and `barrage compare` the two JSON exports — with
  `--fail-on`, a regression fails the pipeline.

Not the right tool for:

- **Browser/E2E testing** — no browser, no DOM, no UI assertions.
- **WebSocket / streaming traffic**.
- **Distributed cloud load** — it runs from one process; scale vertically, not
  across regions.

Those tools excel at **generating** load. Barrage is built around
**interpreting** it:

- **k6, JMeter, Locust** — script complex user journeys and report rich
  metrics, but each generator runs independently. Correlating an API slowdown
  with the database or cache behind it is left to you.
- **Vegeta** — a focused, high-performance HTTP load generator. It tells you
  how the endpoint behaved, not why.

Barrage is narrower on purpose: it generates HTTP, database, and Redis load in
one process and aligns every layer onto one timeline. Where a typical load
tester reports a single latency curve, Barrage reports three — and tells you
which layer spiked.

| Feature | Barrage | Typical Load Tester |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP load | Yes | Yes |
| DB load | Yes | Usually no |
| Redis load | Yes | Usually no |
| Scenario user journeys | Yes | Varies |
| Correlate latency | Yes | No |
| Compare runs / CI gate | Yes | No |
| HTML report | Yes | Varies |

## Development

```sh
go test ./...     # unit + integration (miniredis for Redis, httptest for HTTP)
go vet ./...
```

Tests cover the ramp schedule, pool pacing, read/write detection, config
parsing (including unknown-key rejection), correlation, report rendering, and
JSON export. `report.html` is a build artifact and is intentionally not
committed. The report template (`templates/report.html`) is embedded in the
binary via `go:embed`, so reports render from any working directory; a template
file at `templates/report.html` alongside the binary overrides the embedded one.

Cutting a release is one command — no hunting for the version string:

```sh
./scripts/release.sh v0.7.0
```

It bumps the version everywhere (the `internal/version` source of truth, the
install pin in `install.sh`, and the README/SKILL examples), runs the
build/vet/test/gofmt gate, commits as `chore(release)`, tags, and pushes. CI
then cross-compiles the platform binaries and publishes the GitHub release
with generated notes. The binary's embedded version always comes from the git
tag (ldflags), so the package-var default only shows for local `go run` builds.

## Agents

AI agents: read [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) first — bottleneck-hunting workflow
(inspect project, ask user, never assume), YAML construction, result
interpretation, and repo house rules. It is the single skill for barrage;
the landing page (`../barrage-landing`) points back here too.
