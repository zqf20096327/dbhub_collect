## Introduction

This project provides a simple API to interact with TiKV, a distributed transactional key-value database. Using this API, users can store, retrieve, update, and delete blobs of data in TiKV. The API is built with Go and utilizes the TiKV client to interact directly with a TiKV cluster.

## Requirements

- Go 1.21 or later
- Docker and Docker Compose
- TiKV client (referenced in the `go.mod` file)

## Installation

Make sure you have the necessary frameworks and tools required to run the project.

* [Go installation](https://go.dev/doc/install)
* [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) 

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codevalley/ti-kv-api.git

2. Navigate to the project directory, and execute docker build
    ```cd tikvapi
    cd ti-kv-api
    docker build -t tikvapi .
    ```

3. Use Docker Compose to build and start the services

    ```shell
    docker-compose up
    ```

4. Your application can now be accessed at `http://localhost:8080`

5. To stop all services and remove associated containers, you can run

    ```docker-compose up --build
    docker-compose down
    ```
