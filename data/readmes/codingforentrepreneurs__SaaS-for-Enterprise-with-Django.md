# SaaS for Enterprise with Django
Learn how to build an Enterprise SaaS project using Django, Neon Postgres, TailwindCSS, SaaS Starter Code, and more. Enterprise SaaS means we need a a way to isolate customer data by implementing multi-tenancy, subdomain-based auth, and much more. We start with an existing Django application and build on top of that.

> Note: [django-tenants](https://github.com/django-tenants/django-tenants) is not used in this course. While Django Tenants is a _very good tool_ it requires you to start with Django tenants for your SaaS projects. This tutorial does not. django-tenants was instrumental in designing this course. Once you finish the course, I encourage you to play around with django-tenants!


## Definitions

Read the course-specific definitions [on the GitHub discussions](https://github.com/codingforentrepreneurs/SaaS-for-Enterprise-with-Django/discussions/1). This course has a number of definitions that are specific to multi-tenant, enterprise-ready, Django SaaS projects _and_ specific to this course.
