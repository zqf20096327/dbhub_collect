# Inertia Rust Starter Kit

Inertia.js v3 + React 19 + Loco (Rust) starter kit: auth, organizations, live updates, generators
and agent skills included.

Clone it, rename it, and build a multi-tenant web app. The pages are React and shadcn/ui. The
server is one Rust binary with SQLite, a job queue and mail. There's no separate API: Inertia
renders the pages from the server.

**Try it:** [demo.inertia-rust.dev](https://demo.inertia-rust.dev) runs this kit as it ships.
Sign up there (the database resets now and then). Docs: [inertia-rust.dev](https://inertia-rust.dev).

**Accounts are built in.** Like most business software, data belongs to an account
(organization), not to a single user: everyone who signs up gets one (an invitation joins the
inviter's account instead), can create more, and invites others with roles. Routes live under `/{account_slug}/…`, every generated query is scoped to the
current account, and anyone who isn't a member gets a 404. Don't need teams?
[Flatten it](.claude/skills/starter-kit/recipes/accounts.md#single-user-apps).

A controller loads the data and renders a React page with it as props. The props are a Rust
struct, and the page's TypeScript type is generated from it:

```rust
// src/controllers/projects.rs
async fn index(
    current: CurrentAccount,
    State(ctx): State<AppContext>,
    inertia: Inertia,
) -> Result<Response> {
    let projects: Vec<ProjectProps> = projects::Model::list(&ctx.db, current.account.id)
        .await?
        .iter()
        .map(projects::Model::to_props)
        .collect();
    render(inertia, "projects/index", json!({ "projects": projects })).await
}

// src/models/projects.rs
#[derive(Serialize, TS)]
pub struct ProjectProps {
    pub id: i64,
    pub name: String,
}
```

```tsx
// frontend/pages/projects/index.tsx
import { Link } from "@inertiajs/react"

import { useCurrentAccount } from "@/hooks/use-current-account"
import { projects as routes } from "@/routes"
import type { ProjectProps } from "@/types/generated/ProjectProps"

export default function Projects({ projects }: { projects: ProjectProps[] }) {
  const { slug: accountSlug } = useCurrentAccount()

  return (
    <ul>
      {projects.map((project) => (
        <li key={project.id}>
          <Link href={routes.show({ accountSlug, id: project.id })}>
            {project.name}
          </Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

`cargo loco generate scaffold projects name:string!` writes both, plus the model, migration,
routes and tests. The generated page also has the app layout and buttons. Rename a field in
`ProjectProps`, run `cargo loco task types:generate`, and `npm run check` points at every page
still using the old name.

## Quick start

You need Rust ([rustup](https://rustup.rs); `rust-toolchain.toml` pins the version) and the Node
version in `.node-version` (22). mise doesn't read `.node-version` unless you turn that on, so run
`mise use node@$(cat .node-version)` in the app (or `nvm use`).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cole-robertson/inertia-rust-starter-kit.git myapp
cd myapp
bin/rename my_app "My App"   # optional, but do it before the first bin/setup (see below)
bin/setup                    # npm ci, cargo build, migrate, seed, then bin/dev
```

Rename before the first `bin/setup`: the development database is named after the app, so a
rename afterwards leaves the seeded one behind. If you already ran setup, run
`bin/setup --reset` after renaming to create and seed the new one.

Open http://localhost:5150 and sign in as `one@example.com` / `Secret1*3*5*`. You land in the
seeded account **Acme** at `/acme`. two@example.com is a member of Acme and owns **Globex**.

Daily commands:

```sh
bin/dev                           # app + job worker (:5150) and Vite with HMR (:5173)
cargo test                        # Rust tests
npx playwright test               # browser tests, client- and server-rendered
bin/ci                            # everything CI runs, stopping at the first failure
cargo loco routes                 # list routes
cargo loco task routes:generate   # after editing src/route_table.rs
cargo loco db migrate             # run migrations
cargo loco db seed --reset        # reload src/fixtures
```

Mail in development goes to SMTP on `localhost:1025`. Run
[Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org) (`docker run -p 1025:1025 -p 8025:8025 axllent/mailpit`)
and read it at http://localhost:8025.

## Features

**Accounts and auth**

- Sign up, sign in, sign out, a sessions list with remote sign-out, email verification,
  password reset, profile / email / password settings, account deletion, light/dark/system theme.
- Accounts (organizations), on by default: everyone who signs up gets a personal account (an
  invited sign-up joins the inviter's account instead); accounts have
  members with roles (`owner`, `admin`, `member`), email invitations and a switcher. Pages live
  under `/{account_slug}/…`, scaffolds and channels are account-scoped, and non-members get a
  404. One shared database; isolation is by `account_id` on every row and query.

**Server**

- [Loco](https://loco.rs) on axum, [SeaORM](https://www.sea-ql.org/SeaORM/) and SQLite.
- An Inertia v3 server adapter (`src/inertia/`): partial reloads, deferred / merge / once /
  scroll props, asset versioning, error bags, history encryption, Precognition, optional SSR.
- Typed routes: `src/route_table.rs` generates `frontend/routes/*.ts`.
- Background jobs on a SQLite queue (no Redis), scheduled tasks, mail.
- Live updates: channels, `broadcast_to`, presence and `perform` over Server-Sent Events
  (`src/live/`, `frontend/lib/live.ts`).

**Frontend**

- React 19 with the React Compiler, TypeScript, [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com),
  [Vite](https://vite.dev) 8, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) 4.

**Generators**, account-scoped by default:

- `generate scaffold`: migration, model, controller, routes, React pages, tests.
- `generate controller`: page actions, write actions, and nested controllers.
- `generate channel`: a live channel and its test.

**For coding agents**

- `AGENTS.md`, plus two skills in `.claude/skills/`: `loco` (the framework, with its full API
  index) and `starter-kit` (how to extend this app, one recipe per task).
- Budget test helpers: assert a page's exact props, its deferred props, its payload size and its
  SQL query count (`tests/requests/budget.rs`, `e2e/budget.ts`).

**Tests and deploy**

- `cargo test` (model, request and Inertia protocol tests) and Playwright against the release
  binary. An SMTP sink lets the browser tests follow mailed links (`e2e/mail-sink.ts`).
- `bin/ci` and GitHub Actions: fmt, clippy, ESLint, Prettier, `tsc`, `cargo deny`, `npm audit`,
  tests, builds, Playwright.
- Deploy with [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/) to your own server, or to Cloudflare
  Containers.

## Build your app

The full walkthrough is [docs/BUILDING_YOUR_APP.md](docs/BUILDING_YOUR_APP.md). Each step below
links its recipe in `.claude/skills/starter-kit/recipes/`.

**Rename.** The crate, binary, database files, Docker/Kamal/Cloudflare names and the display name:

```sh
bin/rename --dry-run acme_crm "Acme CRM"   # show what changes
bin/rename acme_crm "Acme CRM"
```

Renamed after `bin/setup`? Run `bin/setup --reset` once: the development database has a new name.

**Scaffold a resource.** It lives under `/{account_slug}/projects`, and every query is scoped to
the account (`--global` opts out). The generators need `cargo install --locked sea-orm-cli@2.0.4`.

```sh
cargo loco generate scaffold projects name:string! description:text due_on:date
cargo loco task scaffold:pages resource:projects
```

Restart `bin/dev` to pick up the new routes (Rust has no autoloading), then open
http://localhost:5150/acme/projects.

A `references` column becomes a select and a "must exist" check:
`cargo loco generate scaffold tasks title:string! project:references`.
[new-resource.md](.claude/skills/starter-kit/recipes/new-resource.md)

**Controllers that aren't CRUD.** Pages, write actions that redirect back, and nested
controllers (Rails' `Todos::CompletionsController`):

```sh
cargo loco generate controller reports summary         # GET pages; index is always there
cargo loco task scaffold:pages controller:reports
cargo loco generate controller notes create update destroy
cargo loco generate controller todos/completions create destroy
```

[inertia-page.md](.claude/skills/starter-kit/recipes/inertia-page.md)

**Live updates.** Generate a channel, broadcast after a write, and reload the page's props:

```sh
cargo loco generate channel projects
```

```rust
ProjectsChannel::broadcast_to(project.account_id, project.id, json!({ "type": "changed" }));
```

```tsx
useLiveReload("ProjectsChannel", { account: slug, id: project.id }, { only: ["todolists"] })
const here = usePresence("ProjectsChannel", { account: slug, id: project.id })
```

[live-updates.md](.claude/skills/starter-kit/recipes/live-updates.md)

**Jobs, mail, scheduled tasks:**

```sh
cargo loco generate worker report_export
cargo loco generate mailer project_mailer
cargo loco generate task prune_sessions
```

```rust
use crate::workers::report_export::{Worker, WorkerArgs};
Worker::perform_later(&ctx, WorkerArgs { account_id }).await?;
```

A scheduled task is a task plus an entry under `scheduler:` in `config/<env>.yaml`, run by
`cargo loco start --all`.
[background-job.md](.claude/skills/starter-kit/recipes/background-job.md),
[mailer.md](.claude/skills/starter-kit/recipes/mailer.md),
[scheduled-task.md](.claude/skills/starter-kit/recipes/scheduled-task.md)

**A budget test for every page:**

```rust
let res = visit(&server, &ctx, "/acme/reports").await;
assert_props_exactly(&res, &["filters"]);
assert_deferred(&res, "totals");
assert_payload_under(&res, 4_000);
assert_max_queries(6, || async { vec![visit(&server, &ctx, "/acme/reports").await] }).await;
```

## Project layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `src/route_table.rs` | every URL; generates `frontend/routes/*.ts` |
| `src/controllers/`, `src/models/` | handlers and models (domain logic lives on the model) |
| `src/inertia/` | the Inertia server adapter |
| `src/live/`, `src/channels/` | live updates and the app's channels |
| `src/workers/`, `src/mailers/`, `src/tasks/` | jobs, mail, `cargo loco task …` |
| `migration/`, `src/fixtures/` | migrations and seed data |
| `.loco-templates/` | the kit's generator templates |
| `frontend/` | React: `pages/`, `components/` (shadcn/ui in `ui/`), `layouts/`, `routes/` (generated) |
| `tests/`, `e2e/` | Rust tests, Playwright specs |
| `config/` | Loco config per environment; app settings are under `settings:` |
| `bin/` | `setup`, `dev`, `ci`, `rename`, `secret`, `e2e-server` |
| `site/` | the kit's website, [inertia-rust.dev](https://inertia-rust.dev) (VitePress, built from these docs); delete it in your app |

## Tests and CI

```sh
cargo test            # model, mailer, request and Inertia protocol tests
npx playwright test   # against the release binary (bin/e2e-server), client- and server-rendered
bin/ci                # the same steps as GitHub Actions
```

`bin/ci` needs `cargo install --locked cargo-deny`, `cargo install --locked sea-orm-cli@2.0.4`
and `npx playwright install chromium` once.
It also generates code in a copy of the app and checks that it builds and passes its own tests.
When Playwright fails in CI, the traces and the servers' logs are uploaded as an artifact.

Playwright specs import `test` from `e2e/fixtures.ts`: `page` is one@ and `two` is two@, each
signed in once per server. `lastMailTo(page, email, subject)` in `e2e/mail.ts` reads mail the
app sent.

## Deploy

Every container path uses the same `Dockerfile`: Vite assets, cargo-chef, and a slim non-root
runtime. SQLite lives in `/app/storage`, and migrations run on boot.

**Kamal, on your own server:**

1. Edit `config/deploy.yml`: servers, registry, `proxy.host`, `HOST` (the public URL for mail
   links) and the `MAILER_*` settings.
2. Set the secrets `.kamal/secrets` reads: `SECRET_KEY_BASE` (from `bin/secret`),
   `KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`, `MAILER_PASSWORD`.
3. `kamal setup` once, then `kamal deploy`.

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` deploys after CI passes on `main` once you swap its `if: false`
for the commented-out condition below it. With SQLite, run one web container per database; it also
processes the job queue.

**Cloudflare Containers:** `deploy/cloudflare/deploy.sh` (settings in a git-ignored `.env.local`;
`--dry-run` builds the config only). The container's disk is ephemeral, so this suits demos.
See [docs/DEPLOY_CLOUDFLARE.md](docs/DEPLOY_CLOUDFLARE.md).

**Docker Compose, on any server:** the app, a named volume for `/app/storage`, and optional
Caddy for HTTPS.

```sh
cp deploy/compose/.env.example deploy/compose/.env   # SECRET_KEY_BASE, HOST, MAILER_*, DOMAIN
docker compose -f deploy/compose/compose.yaml --profile tls up -d --build
```

**Single binary + systemd, no container:** one release binary plus `config/` and `public/`,
with the database in the unit's `StateDirectory` and a reverse proxy (Caddy) in front.

```sh
npm ci && npx vite build && cargo build --release --locked
sudo install -d /opt/inertia-rust-starter-kit /etc/inertia-rust-starter-kit
sudo install -m 755 target/release/inertia_rust_starter_kit-cli /opt/inertia-rust-starter-kit/
sudo cp -r config public /opt/inertia-rust-starter-kit/
sudo install -m 600 deploy/systemd/env.example /etc/inertia-rust-starter-kit/env   # then edit it
sudo cp deploy/systemd/inertia-rust-starter-kit.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable --now inertia-rust-starter-kit
```

**Fly.io and Render:** `deploy/fly/fly.toml` (a volume on `/app/storage`, one Machine) and
`deploy/render/render.yaml` (a persistent disk). These configs are provided but we haven't
deployed them.

Every target needs exactly one instance (SQLite), a persistent volume, `SECRET_KEY_BASE`,
`HOST` and the `MAILER_*` settings. Compose and systemd were verified end to end; steps and
details for each are in [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md).

**SSR** is off by default. Build with `--build-arg SSR_ENABLED=true` (in Kamal:
`builder.args.SSR_ENABLED: true`) to ship Node and the SSR bundle; the app then starts and
supervises `node ssr/ssr.js` itself. In development: `SSR_ENABLED=true bin/dev`.

**A demo login:** set `DEMO_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `DEMO_ADMIN_PASSWORD` on the container, and it creates
that verified user at boot (`task seed:demo`). Don't set them on a real deployment.

Recipe: [deploy.md](.claude/skills/starter-kit/recipes/deploy.md).

## Performance

Against the [Inertia Rails React Starter Kit](https://github.com/inertia-rails/react-starter-kit),
both as production Docker images on one host (a Ryzen 9 9955HX workstation), 4 pinned CPUs each, SQLite,
SSR off, Rails with YJIT and Puma 4×3. Medians of 5 runs, 2026-10-04. Method, ranges and caveats:
[docs/BENCHMARK.md](docs/BENCHMARK.md).

| | This kit | Rails kit | |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `GET /sign_in` HTML, req/s | 74,719 | 6,797 | **11×** |
| Signed-in page, Inertia visit, req/s ¹ | 26,435 | 5,928 | **4.5×** |
| Signed-in page p99 latency ¹ | 2.1 ms | 11.2 ms | **5.4× lower** |
| 100 ms outbound call, 512 clients, req/s | 5,021 | 117 (4×3); 1,233 (4×32) | **4×** vs Rails' best |
| SQLite inserts, 32 writers, req/s / p99 | 11,747 / 9 ms, **0.17% 500s** ² | 5,784 / 16 ms, no errors | 2× |
| SQLite inserts, 32 writers, 32 GB container ³ | 19,720 / 9 ms, no errors | 5,809 / 15 ms, no errors | **3.4×** |
| Reads while 500 writes/s run, req/s / p99 | 23,938 / 2.5 ms | 8,106 / 8.8 ms | **3×** |
| Memory, idle / after load | 42 / 65 MiB | 210 / 509 MiB | **5–8× less** |
| Boot to first response | 57 ms | 1.6 s | |
| Docker image, compressed / unpacked | 52 / 147 MB | 207 / 531 MB | |
| Image build, cold / after a one-file edit | 101 s / 24 s | 71 s / 8 s | Rails faster |

¹ Each kit's first page after sign-in: this kit's account overview `/{account_slug}`, the Rails
kit's `/dashboard`. Equivalent, not identical: ours also loads the account, the membership and
the account switcher.
² Pool acquire timeouts (500 ms) during multi-second write stalls caused by the benchmark
container's 4 GB memory limit (page-cache writeback throttling); with 32 GB there were none. See
[BENCHMARK.md](docs/BENCHMARK.md#2026-10-04-io-bound-rows).
³ Same case with `--memory 32g`, on the build with `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` write transactions and the
5 s pool timeout (009e230). Per-write latency is single-digit ms either way; the 4 GB stalls come
from the kernel throttling a container that writes ~2× Rails' rows into a capped page cache, not
from the app.

The Rails kit has far less code to read, reloads code instantly where Rust rebuilds, and builds
its image faster from cold.

## For Rails developers

This kit started as a port of the
[Inertia Rails React Starter Kit](https://github.com/inertia-rails/react-starter-kit). Its routes,
pages and flash messages still match that kit, with organizations added on top (see
[docs/PARITY.md](docs/PARITY.md)). [docs/RAILS_TO_LOCO.md](docs/RAILS_TO_LOCO.md) maps each
`rails` command to its equivalent here.

| | Rails kit | This kit |
|---|---|---|
| Server | Rails 8, Puma | Loco, axum, tokio |
| Database | SQLite, Active Record | SQLite, SeaORM (`migration/`, `src/models/`) |
| Jobs | Solid Queue | Loco's queue on SQLite |
| Live updates | Action Cable | `src/live/` (SSE, plus `POST /live/perform`) |
| Inertia | `inertia_rails` gem | `src/inertia/`, in this repo |
| Frontend | `app/javascript`, `rails-vite-plugin` | `frontend/`, plain Vite with a manifest |
| Tests | RSpec, Capybara | `cargo test`, Playwright |
| Tooling | RuboCop, Brakeman, bundler-audit | `cargo fmt`, clippy, `cargo deny` |

What differs:

- **No autoloading.** Routes are registered explicitly from `src/route_table.rs`; the generators
  write that wiring.
- **argon2id instead of bcrypt.** Password hashes from a Rails database won't verify.
- **Opaque session tokens.** The cookie holds a random token, not the signed row id, so
  `auth.session.id` is a string.
- **Own token format** for verification and reset links, so Rails-issued links aren't accepted.
- **SSR process:** the Rust binary supervises `node ssr/ssr.js`; Rails uses a Puma plugin.
- **Organizations:** sign-in lands on `/{account_slug}`, and `/dashboard` redirects there.

## Security notes

The code in each path is the source of truth.

- **Sessions** (`src/models/sessions.rs`): one row per sign-in. The HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax cookie
  (Secure in production) holds a random token. Deleting the row revokes that browser; a password
  change deletes the user's other sessions.
- **CSRF** (`src/inertia/csrf.rs`): double-submit `XSRF-TOKEN` / `X-XSRF-TOKEN`, HMAC-bound to the
  session, plus `Origin` and `Sec-Fetch-Site` checks.
- **Headers** (`src/inertia/`): a CSP with a per-request nonce, `frame-ancestors 'none'`,
  `nosniff`, a strict referrer policy, HSTS in production.
- **Tokens** (`src/models/tokens.rs`): stateless, HMAC-signed per purpose, expiring, and void once
  the email or password changes.
- **Passwords** (`src/models/users.rs`): argon2id. Sign-in with an unknown email still runs a
  verification, so timing doesn't reveal accounts.
- **Rate limits:** sign-in, sign-up and password-reset POSTs, per IP, in memory (per process).
- **User enumeration:** password reset sends the same reply for every email, and only verified
  accounts get mail. Sign-up still reports a taken email, as the Rails kit does.
- **Secrets and logs:** production refuses a weak `SECRET_KEY_BASE`; passwords and tokens are
  filtered from logs.
- **Supply chain:** `cargo deny` and `npm audit` in CI; Dependabot opens weekly updates.
