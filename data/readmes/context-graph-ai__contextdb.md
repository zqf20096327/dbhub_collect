# contextdb

An embedded database for agentic memory systems. Relational storage, graph traversal, and vector similarity search under unified MVCC transactions — in a single file, in a single process. Every agent, device, or service runs its own contextdb. They sync bidirectionally through a central server over WebSocket — knowledge learned by one becomes available to all, with per-table conflict resolution. No port forwarding, no VPN — WebSocket traverses NAT out of the box.

If you're building agent memory today, you're probably stitching together SQLite for state, a vector database for embeddings, and application code for graph traversal. contextdb replaces all three — and adds **enforceable policy constraints** (state machines, DAG enforcement, cascading propagation) that the database guarantees, not application code.

```
contextdb> UPDATE decisions SET status = 'draft' WHERE id = '550e8400...';
Error: invalid state transition: active -> draft
```

No triggers. No application-side validation. The database enforces it.

**Familiar conventions, nothing new to learn:** PostgreSQL-compatible SQL, [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) syntax for vector search (`<=>`), and [SQL/PGQ](https://www.iso.org/standard/76120.html)-style `GRAPH_TABLE ... MATCH` for graph queries — the subset that matters for bounded traversal, not the full standard.

**Language support:** contextdb is a Rust library and CLI today. Python and TypeScript bindings are on the roadmap — contributions welcome.

## Why Not SQLite + Extensions?

| Capability | SQLite + extensions | contextdb |
|---|---|---|
| Vector search | sqlite-vec (separate extension, no unified transactions with relational data) | Built-in, auto-HNSW at 1K vectors, pre-filtered search, same MVCC transaction as rows |
| Graph traversal | Recursive CTEs (unbounded, no cycle detection) | SQL/PGQ with bounded BFS, DAG enforcement, typed edges |
| State machines | CHECK constraints + triggers (bypassable) | `STATE MACHINE` in DDL, enforced by the database engine |
| Atomic cross-model updates | Application-level coordination | Single MVCC transaction across relational + graph + vector |
| Sync | Build your own | Bidirectional collaborative sync — each database syncs changesets with conflict resolution, not WAL pages |
| Immutable tables | Not enforceable (triggers are bypassable) | `IMMUTABLE` keyword, enforced by the database engine |
| Cascading invalidation | Application code | `PROPAGATE` in DDL — state changes cascade along edges and FKs |

## Use It As a Library

contextdb is an embedded database. The primary interface is the Rust API:

```rust
use contextdb_engine::Database;
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::sync::Arc;

let db = Database::open(std::path::Path::new("./my.db"))?;
// or: Database::open_memory() for ephemeral

let params = HashMap::new();

db.execute(
    "CREATE TABLE observations (
       id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
       data JSON,
       embedding VECTOR(384)
     ) IMMUTABLE",
    &params,
)?;

// Insert with parameters
let mut params = HashMap::new();
params.insert("id".into(), Value::Uuid(uuid::Uuid::new_v4()));
params.insert("data".into(), Value::Json(serde_json::json!({"type": "sensor"})));
params.insert("embedding".into(), Value::Vector(vec![0.1; 384]));

db.execute(
    "INSERT INTO observations (id, data, embedding) VALUES ($id, $data, $embedding)",
    &params,
)?;

// Vector similarity search
let mut query_params = HashMap::new();
query_params.insert("query".into(), Value::Vector(vec![0.1; 384]));

let result = db.execute(
    "SELECT id, data FROM observations ORDER BY embedding <=> $query LIMIT 10",
    &query_params,
)?;

// Graph traversal
let result = db.execute(
    "SELECT target_id FROM GRAPH_TABLE(
       edges MATCH (a)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->{1,3}(b)
       WHERE a.id = $start
       COLUMNS (b.id AS target_id)
     )",
    &params,
)?;

// Subscribe to commits
let rx = db.subscribe();
// rx is a std::sync::mpsc::Receiver<CommitEvent>
```

### One Query, Three Subsystems

Find semantically similar observations within a graph neighborhood, filtered by relational predicates — a query that would take ~40 lines of Python across SQLite, ChromaDB, and a hand-rolled BFS:

```sql
WITH neighborhood AS (
  SELECT b_id FROM GRAPH_TABLE(
    edges MATCH (start)-[:RELATES_TO]->{1,3}(related)
    WHERE start.id = $entity_id
    COLUMNS (related.id AS b_id)
  )
),
candidates AS (
  SELECT o.id, o.data, o.embedding
  FROM observations o
  INNER JOIN neighborhood n ON o.entity_id = n.b_id
  WHERE o.observation_type = 'config_change'
)
SELECT id, data FROM candidates
ORDER BY embedding <=> $query_embedding
LIMIT 5
```

One query. One transaction. One process.

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
contextdb-engine = "1.0.0"
contextdb-core = "1.0.0"
```

## Install

```bash
# Install the CLI
cargo install contextdb-cli

# Or run the server (no clone needed)
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/context-graph-ai/contextdb/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/context-graph-ai/contextdb/main/nats.conf
docker compose up
```

## Or Explore With the CLI

```bash
cargo build --release -p contextdb-cli
./target/release/contextdb-cli :memory:
```

```
contextdb> CREATE TABLE decisions (id UUID PRIMARY KEY, status TEXT NOT NULL)
           STATE MACHINE (status: draft -> [active, rejected], active -> [superseded]);
ok (rows_affected=0)

contextdb> INSERT INTO decisions VALUES ('550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000', 'draft');
ok (rows_affected=1)

contextdb> UPDATE decisions SET status = 'active' WHERE id = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000';
ok (rows_affected=1)

contextdb> UPDATE decisions SET status = 'draft' WHERE id = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000';
Error: invalid state transition: active -> draft

contextdb> .schema decisions
CREATE TABLE decisions (
  id UUID NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  status TEXT NOT NULL
)
STATE MACHINE (status: active -> [superseded], draft -> [active, rejected])
```

### Two-Vector Walkthrough

```sql
CREATE TABLE evidence (id UUID PRIMARY KEY, vector_text VECTOR(4), vector_vision VECTOR(8));
INSERT INTO evidence (id, vector_text, vector_vision) VALUES
  ('11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111', [1,0,0,0], [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]);
SHOW VECTOR_INDEXES;
SELECT id FROM evidence ORDER BY vector_text <=> '[1,0,0,0]' LIMIT 1;
```

Each `VECTOR(N)` column is its own index, keyed by `(table, column)`. Use
`VECTOR(N) WITH (quantization = 'F32'|'SQ8'|'SQ4')` to choose the per-column
storage footprint; omitted quantization defaults to `F32`.

### Upgrading From 0.3.x

Opening a legacy vector store without the named-index format marker returns
`LegacyVectorStoreDetected`. For teams upgrading from 0.3.x, recovery is
explicit: sync from a peer already on the named-index storage format, or
recreate the schema and reimport the data.

## What It Does

**Relational (PostgreSQL-compatible SQL)** — SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, JOINs (INNER/LEFT), CTEs, upsert (`ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`), DISTINCT, LIMIT, IN with subqueries, LIKE, BETWEEN, parameter binding (`$name`).

**Graph (SQL/PGQ-style)** — `GRAPH_TABLE(... MATCH ...)` following SQL/PGQ conventions for bounded BFS, typed edges, variable-length paths (`{1,3}`), and direction control. DAG constraint enforcement prevents cycles. State propagation cascades changes along graph edges.

**Vector (pgvector conventions)** — Cosine similarity search via `<=>`. Every `VECTOR(N)` column is a named index; `SHOW VECTOR_INDEXES` reports table, column, dimension, quantization, vector count, and bytes. Auto-switches between brute-force (< 1000 vectors) and HNSW indexing. Pre-filtered search narrows candidates before scoring.

**Unified transactions** — One transaction atomically updates relational rows, graph adjacency structures, and vector indexes. One read snapshot sees consistent state across all three. MVCC with consistent snapshots — readers never block writers.

**Enforceable policy constraints** — `IMMUTABLE` tables, `STATE MACHINE` column transitions, `DAG` cycle prevention, `RETAIN` with TTL expiry, `PROPAGATE` for cascading state changes along edges and foreign keys. Enforced by the database — no application code can bypass them.

**Collaborative sync** — Every contextdb instance is a full read-write database. Each runs a SyncClient that syncs bidirectionally with a central SyncServer over NATS (WebSocket for clients behind NAT, native protocol for server-to-server). Offline-first: each database works independently, syncing changesets when connected. Per-table conflict resolution (LatestWins, ServerWins, EdgeWins) and per-table sync direction (Push, Pull, Both, None) give you fine-grained control over what flows where. The server runs the same contextdb engine — self-host it, or point your databases at a hosted server.

**Persistence** — Single-file storage via redb. Crash-safe. Compute/storage separated via the `WriteSetApplicator` trait (local redb for open source, object store for enterprise).

**Plugin system** — `DatabasePlugin` trait with lifecycle hooks (`pre_commit`, `post_commit`, `on_open`, `on_close`, `on_ddl`, `on_query`, `post_query`, `health`, `describe`, `on_sync_push`, `on_sync_pull`). Applications inject plugins via `Database::open_with_plugin()`.

**Subscriptions** — `db.subscribe()` returns a broadcast channel of `CommitEvent`s for reactive downstream processing.

## Scale Envelope

contextdb is designed for agentic memory, not data warehousing:

- 10K-1M rows
- Sparse graphs with bounded traversal (depth <= 10)
- Append-heavy writes, small transactions
- Configurable memory budget via `SET MEMORY_LIMIT` (no hard-coded ceiling)
- Configurable file-growth budget via `SET DISK_LIMIT` / `SHOW DISK_LIMIT` or `--disk-limit` / `CONTEXTDB_DISK_LIMIT` for file-backed databases
- See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md#memory-limit-on-edge-devices) for memory-limit behavior on edge devices.
- Laptops, ARM64 devices (browser and mobile via Rust's WASM target are future directions)
