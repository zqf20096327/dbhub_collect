# Couchbase MCP Server

Couchbase MCP Server is a self-hosted [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/2026-07-28/getting-started/intro) server that connects AI agents and LLM-powered assistants — Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code Copilot, and other [MCP clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/2026-07-28/getting-started/intro) — to data in Couchbase clusters, whether hosted on [Capella](https://www.couchbase.com/products/capella/) or self-managed. MCP is an open standard for letting AI assistants call tools and query external data sources; this server implements that standard for Couchbase, so an AI agent can inspect your cluster, run SQL++ queries, read and write documents, and analyze query performance using natural language instead of hand-written code.

It provides tools across categories including Cluster Health, Data Schema, Key-Value, Query, and Performance — with safety controls via read-only mode (on by default) and fine-grained tool disabling, so you can let an AI agent explore and query your data without risking unintended writes. It supports both STDIO and Streamable HTTP transports.

Couchbase MCP server is distributed as a Python Package Index (PyPI) package and via Docker. Enterprise support for Couchbase MCP Server is available by licensing [Couchbase AI Data Plane](https://www.couchbase.com/downloads/?family=agent-memory), which also entitles use and enterprise support of Couchbase Agent Memory and Couchbase Agent Catalog.

## Why Couchbase MCP Server

- **Safe by default** — write operations (document upserts/inserts/deletes and data-modifying SQL++ queries) are blocked unless you explicitly set `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=false`, and individual tools can be disabled or gated behind user confirmation.
- **Works with Capella and self-managed clusters** — the same configuration connects to Couchbase Capella (fully managed) or a self-hosted Couchbase Server cluster.
- **RBAC-aware** — tool disabling is a convenience layer for guiding LLM behavior; the underlying Couchbase user's role-based access control remains the authoritative security boundary.
- **Production transports** — run over STDIO for local desktop clients, or Streamable HTTP with optional OAuth 2.1 (JWT/JWKS, provider-agnostic — Auth0, Okta, Keycloak, Entra, Cognito, etc.) for shared/remote deployments.
- **Any MCP client** — tested with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, and JetBrains AI Assistant/Junie; works with any client implementing the [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28).

## Example Prompts

Once the server is connected, you can talk to your Couchbase cluster in natural language through your AI assistant. For example:

- "What buckets, scopes, and collections do I have in this cluster, and what's the schema of the `orders` collection?"
- "Run a SQL++ query to find the 10 most recent documents in the `users` collection `where status = 'active'`."
- "What are the 5 slowest queries on this cluster in the last hour, and are any of them missing a covering index?"
- "Check whether this cluster is healthy and tell me which services are running."
- "Insert a new document into the `products` collection with these fields: ..." (requires `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=false`)


## Features/Tools

This distribution ships two servers: the **operational** server (default —
the tables immediately below) talks to a regular Couchbase cluster via the
`couchbase` SDK, and the **[Operational Insights](#operational-insights-server)**
server (its own table further down) talks to Operational Insights clusters via
the `couchbase-operational-insights` SDK.

### Cluster setup & health tools

| Tool Name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `get_server_configuration_status` | Get the server status and configuration without connecting to the cluster — reports read-only mode, disabled/confirmation-required tools, OAuth settings, and the resolved logging configuration |
| `test_cluster_connection` | Check the cluster credentials by connecting to the cluster |
| `get_cluster_health_and_services` | Get cluster health status and list of all running services, optionally filtered to specific services via `service_types` |
| `get_cluster_diagnostics_report` | Get the SDK's cached connection diagnostics — whether connections were already broken and for how long, without any active network probing |
| `get_cluster_metrics` | Get one or more cluster statistics over a historic time window via the Management REST API's stats-range endpoint. **Self-managed Couchbase Server 7.6+ only — not available on Capella.** |
| `discover_tool_input_values` | Look up the exact input values another tool needs, from reference data bundled with the server — currently every Couchbase Server metric name (type, unit, version added, description) for `get_cluster_metrics`. Browse by category or fuzzy-search by keyword. Works offline, without a cluster connection. |

### Data model & schema discovery tools

| Tool Name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `get_buckets_in_cluster` | Get a list of all the buckets in the cluster |
| `get_scopes_in_bucket` | Get a list of all the scopes in the specified bucket |
| `get_collections_in_scope` | Get a list of all the collections in a specified scope and bucket. Note that this tool requires the cluster to have Query service. |
| `get_scopes_and_collections_in_bucket` | Get a list of all the scopes and collections in the specified bucket |
| `get_schema_for_collection` | Get the structure for a collection |
| `create_scope` | Create a new scope in a bucket (Couchbase Server 7.6+ and Capella). **Disabled by default when `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=true`.** |
| `create_collection` | Create a new collection in an existing scope (Couchbase Server 7.6+ and Capella). **Disabled by default when `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=true`.** |
| `delete_scope` | Delete a scope and all its collections from a bucket — permanent. **Disabled by default when `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=true`.** |
| `delete_collection` | Delete a collection and all its documents from a scope — permanent. **Disabled by default when `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=true`.** |

### Document KV operations tools

| Tool Name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `get_document_by_id` | Get a document by ID from a specified scope and collection |
| `lookup_subdocument` | Look up parts of a document (specific fields, existence checks, or array/object counts) by path without fetching the whole document |
| `upsert_document_by_id` | Upsert a document by ID to a specified scope and collection. **Disabled by default when `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=true`.** |
| `insert_document_by_id` | Insert a new document by ID (fails if document exists). **Disabled by default when `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=true`.** |
| `replace_document_by_id` | Replace an existing document by ID (fails if document doesn't exist). **Disabled by default when `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=true`.** |
| `delete_document_by_id` | Delete a document by ID from a specified scope and collection. **Disabled by default when `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=true`.** |
| `mutate_subdocument` | Modify parts of an existing document (upsert, insert, replace, remove, array ops, counters) by path without rewriting the whole document. **Disabled by default when `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=true`.** |

### Query and indexing tools

| Tool Name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `list_indexes` | List all indexes in the cluster with their definitions, with optional filtering by bucket, scope, collection and index name. Set `return_raw_index_stats=true` to return the unprocessed index information. |
| `get_index_advisor_recommendations` | Get index recommendations from Couchbase Index Advisor for a given SQL++ query to optimize query performance |
| `create_index` | Create a scalar (non-vector) GSI secondary index on a collection. Deferred by default — call `build_index` afterward to build it. **Disabled by default when `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=true`.** |
| `build_index` | Trigger the build of all deferred indexes on a collection. **Disabled by default when `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=true`.** |
| `drop_index` | Drop a GSI index (scalar or vector) from a collection. **Disabled by default when `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=true`.** |
| `run_sql_plus_plus_query` | Run a [SQL++ query](https://www.couchbase.com/sqlplusplus/) on a specified scope.<br><br>Queries are automatically scoped to the specified bucket and scope, so use collection names directly (e.g., `SELECT * FROM users` instead of `SELECT * FROM bucket.scope.users`).<br><br>`CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE` is `true` by default, which means that **all write operations (KV, Query, scope/collection management, and index management)** are disabled. When enabled (i.e. `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=true`), write tools are not loaded and SQL++ queries that modify data are blocked. |
| `explain_sql_plus_plus_query` | Generate and evaluate an EXPLAIN plan for a SQL++ query. Returns query metadata, extracted plan, and plan evaluation findings. |

### Full-text search (FTS) tools

Requires Couchbase Server 7.6+ and the Search service. Vector search is not supported by these tools (see the separate vector search tooling).

| Tool Name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `list_fts_indexes` | List Search (FTS) indexes. With no filters, lists cluster-level (legacy) indexes; with `bucket_name`, lists scope-level (scoped) indexes across every scope in that bucket; with `bucket_name` and `scope_name`, lists scope-level indexes in that one scope. |
| `get_fts_index_definition` | Get the full definition of a single Search index (mappings, analyzers, plan params). Pass `bucket_name` and `scope_name` together for a scope-level index, or omit both for a cluster-level (legacy) index. |
| `run_fts_query` | Run an FTS query against a Search index, or fetch its execution plan. `query` is the raw FTS query JSON body, supporting any non-vector query type (match, match_phrase, term, conjuncts, disjuncts, geo, date/numeric range, query_string, ...). Pass `explain=true` to fetch the execution plan instead of results — this still executes the query (`limit` defaulting to 1) since the Search service only exposes the plan per matched hit, not as a separate dry-run call. |

### Query performance analysis tools

| Tool Name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `get_longest_running_queries` | Get longest running queries by average service time |
| `get_most_frequent_queries` | Get most frequently executed queries |
| `get_queries_with_largest_response_sizes` | Get queries with the largest response sizes |
| `get_queries_with_large_result_count` | Get queries with the largest result counts |
| `get_queries_using_primary_index` | Get queries that use a primary index (potential performance concern) |
| `get_queries_not_using_covering_index` | Get queries that don't use a covering index |
| `get_queries_not_selective` | Get queries that are not selective (index scans return many more documents than final result) |

### Operational Insights tools

Registered by the separate `operational-insights` server (see
[Operational Insights Server](#operational-insights-server) below), not the
default `operational` one.

| Tool Name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `get_server_configuration_status` | Get this server's status and configuration without connecting to a cluster — read-only mode, disabled/confirmation-required tools, OAuth settings, and the resolved logging configuration. Shared with the operational server: the same tool, registered by both. |
| `get_databases_in_cluster` | List all databases in the Operational Insights cluster. |
| `get_scopes_in_database` | List all scopes in a database. |
| `get_collections_in_scope` | List all collections (datasets) in a scope. Shares its name with the operational server's tool of the same name — see the note below. |
| `get_schema_for_collection` | Infer the JSON schema of a collection by sampling documents. Shares its name with the operational server's tool of the same name — see the note below. |
| `list_indexes` | List secondary indexes via the `System.Metadata.Index` catalog (the SDK has no index manager). Shares its name with the operational server's tool of the same name — see the note below. |
| `run_query_sync` | Run a SQL++ statement (SELECT, DML, or DDL) and return all result rows. Enforces read-only mode server-side via `QueryOptions(readonly=True)` — there is no client-side SQL++ parser here. |
| `explain_query` | Generate the query plan for a SQL++ statement via EXPLAIN, without executing it. |
| `create_index` | Create a secondary index via `CREATE INDEX` (the SDK has no index manager). **Disabled by default when `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=true`.** Shares its name with the operational server's tool of the same name — see the note below. |
| `run_query_async` | Start a SQL++ statement without waiting for it to finish, returning a `query_handle` token. Same read-only enforcement as `run_query_sync`. |
| `get_async_query_results` | Check whether an async query has finished and, if so, return its rows. Doubles as the status check — call again later if not yet ready. |
| `discard_async_query_results` | Free a finished async query's result buffers on the server. Normal cleanup step after `get_async_query_results`. |
| `cancel_async_query` | Stop an async query that is still running. **Disabled by default when `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=true`.** A finished query cannot be cancelled — discard its results instead. |

The Server Async Request API tools form a start → poll → discard-or-cancel
flow for long-running queries: `run_query_async` returns a `query_handle`,
`get_async_query_results` is polled until it reports readiness (and returns
the rows), then either `discard_async_query_results` frees the results or,
for a query still running, `cancel_async_query` stops it.

> **Note:** `get_collections_in_scope`, `get_schema_for_collection`,
> `create_index` and `list_indexes` exist, with different behavior, on both
> servers. (`get_server_configuration_status` also appears on both, but it is
> deliberately *one* shared tool — same implementation, same result shape —
> so it needs no disambiguation.) Each server is a separate process, so this is only a concern if a
> single MCP client registers both `operational` and `operational-insights`
> simultaneously — in that case, disambiguate at the client configuration
> layer (e.g. by giving the two server entries distinct names in the
> client's own config).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher.
- A running Couchbase cluster. The easiest way to get started is to use [Capella](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/get-started/create-account.html#getting-started) free tier, which is fully managed version of Couchbase server. You can follow [instructions](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/data-service/import-data-documents.html#import-sample-data) to import one of the sample datasets or import your own.
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed to run the server.
- An [MCP client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients) such as [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) installed to connect the server to Claude. The instructions are provided for Claude Desktop and Cursor. Other MCP clients could be used as well.

## Configuration

The MCP server can be run either from the prebuilt PyPI package or the source using uv.

### Running from PyPI

We publish a pre built [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/couchbase-mcp-server/) for the MCP server.

#### Server Configuration using Pre built Package for MCP Clients

#### Basic Authentication

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "couchbase": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["couchbase-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "CB_CONNECTION_STRING": "couchbases://connection-string",
        "CB_USERNAME": "username",
        "CB_PASSWORD": "password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

or

#### mTLS

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "couchbase": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["couchbase-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "CB_CONNECTION_STRING": "couchbases://connection-string",
        "CB_CLIENT_CERT_PATH": "/path/to/client-certificate.pem",
        "CB_CLIENT_KEY_PATH": "/path/to/client.key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Note: If you have other MCP servers in use in the client, you can add it to the existing `mcpServers` object.

### Running from Source

The MCP server can be run from the source using this repository.

#### Clone the repository to your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/couchbase/mcp-server-couchbase.git
```

#### Server Configuration using Source for MCP Clients

This is the common configuration for the MCP clients such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf Editor.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "couchbase": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "path/to/cloned/repo/mcp-server-couchbase/",
        "run",
        "src/mcp_server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CB_CONNECTION_STRING": "couchbases://connection-string",
        "CB_USERNAME": "username",
        "CB_PASSWORD": "password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Note: `path/to/cloned/repo/mcp-server-couchbase/` should be the path to the cloned repository on your local machine. Don't forget the trailing slash at the end!

> Note: If you have other MCP servers in use in the client, you can add it to the existing `mcpServers` object.

| `CB_MCP_LOG_RETENTION_BACKUP_COUNT` | `--log-retention-backup-count` | Rotated backup files kept per-level log file (excluding the live file), applied to every level unless overridden. `0` keeps only the live file (see [Logging](#logging)) | `1` |
| `CB_MCP_LOG_ERROR_RETENTION_BACKUP_COUNT` | `--log-error-retention-backup-count` | Rotated backups kept for the ERROR log file; overrides the global count for ERROR | Inherits `CB_MCP_LOG_RETENTION_BACKUP_COUNT` |
| `CB_MCP_LOG_WARNING_RETENTION_BACKUP_COUNT` | `--log-warning-retention-backup-count` | Rotated backups kept for the WARNING log file; overrides the global count for WARNING | Inherits `CB_MCP_LOG_RETENTION_BACKUP_COUNT` |
| `CB_MCP_LOG_INFO_RETENTION_BACKUP_COUNT` | `--log-info-retention-backup-count` | Rotated backups kept for the INFO log file; overrides the global count for INFO | Inherits `CB_MCP_LOG_RETENTION_BACKUP_COUNT` |
| `CB_MCP_LOG_DEBUG_RETENTION_BACKUP_COUNT` | `--log-debug-retention-backup-count` | Rotated backups kept for the DEBUG log file; overrides the global count for DEBUG | Inherits `CB_MCP_LOG_RETENTION_BACKUP_COUNT` |

| `CB_MCP_OAUTH_JWT_AUDIENCE` | `--oauth-audience` | Expected JWT `aud` claim. Required to enable OAuth | None |
| `CB_MCP_OAUTH_JWT_ALGORITHM` | `--oauth-algorithm` | JWT signing algorithm: one of `RS256/384/512`, `ES256/384/512`, `PS256/384/512` | `RS256` |
| `CB_MCP_OAUTH_MCP_BASE_URL` | `--oauth-mcp-base-url` | Public base URL of this server. When set, publishes RFC 9728 Protected Resource Metadata so PRM-aware clients can discover the IdP | None |
| `CB_MCP_OAUTH_SCOPE_READ_LABEL` | `--oauth-scope-read-label` | Override the OAuth scope label treated as 'read' access (advertised in PRM and matched against the token's `scope`/`scp` claim). Use when your IdP can't emit the canonical form | `couchbase-mcp:read` |
| `CB_MCP_OAUTH_SCOPE_WRITE_LABEL` | `--oauth-scope-write-label` | Override the OAuth scope label treated as 'write' access; same semantics as the read label | `couchbase-mcp:write` |

#### Read-Only Mode Configuration

**`CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE`** is the single switch controlling write operations:

- When `true` (default): All write operations (KV, Query, scope/collection management, and index management) are disabled. All write tools (KV: upsert, insert, replace, delete, sub-document mutate; scope/collection management: create_scope, create_collection, delete_scope, delete_collection; index management: create_index, build_index, drop_index) are **not loaded** and will not be available to the LLM, and SQL++ queries that modify data or structure are blocked.
- When `false`: All write tools are loaded and SQL++ data/structure modification queries are allowed.

This is the recommended safe default to prevent inadvertent data modifications by LLMs.

> Note: For authentication, you need either the Username and Password or the Client Certificate and key paths. Optionally, you can specify the CA root certificate path that will be used to validate the server certificates.
> If both the Client Certificate & key path and the username and password are specified, the client certificates will be used for authentication.

### Disabling Tools

You can disable specific tools to prevent them from being loaded and exposed to the MCP client. Disabled tools will not appear in the tool discovery and cannot be invoked by the LLM.

#### Supported Formats

**Comma-separated list:**

```bash
# Environment variable
CB_MCP_DISABLED_TOOLS="upsert_document_by_id, delete_document_by_id"

# Command line
uvx couchbase-mcp-server --disabled-tools upsert_document_by_id, delete_document_by_id
```

**File path (one tool name per line):**

```bash
# Environment variable
CB_MCP_DISABLED_TOOLS=disabled_tools.txt

# Command line
uvx couchbase-mcp-server --disabled-tools disabled_tools.txt
```

**File format (e.g., `disabled_tools.txt`):**

```text
# Write operations
upsert_document_by_id
delete_document_by_id

# Index advisor
get_index_advisor_recommendations
```

Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments and ignored.

#### MCP Client Configuration Examples

**Using comma-separated list:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "couchbase": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["couchbase-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "CB_CONNECTION_STRING": "couchbases://connection-string",
        "CB_USERNAME": "username",
        "CB_PASSWORD": "password",
        "CB_MCP_DISABLED_TOOLS": "upsert_document_by_id,delete_document_by_id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Using file path (recommended for many tools):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "couchbase": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["couchbase-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "CB_CONNECTION_STRING": "couchbases://connection-string",
        "CB_USERNAME": "username",
        "CB_PASSWORD": "password",
        "CB_MCP_DISABLED_TOOLS": "/path/to/disabled_tools.txt"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Important Security Note

> **Warning:** Disabling tools alone does not guarantee that certain operations cannot be performed. The underlying database user's RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) permissions are the authoritative security control.
>
> For example, even if you disable `upsert_document_by_id` and `delete_document_by_id`, data modifications can still occur via the `run_sql_plus_plus_query` tool using SQL++ DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE) unless:
>
> - The `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE` is set to `true` (default), OR
> - The database user lacks the necessary RBAC permissions for data modification
>
> **Best Practice:** Always configure appropriate RBAC permissions on your Couchbase user credentials as the primary security measure. Use tool disabling as an additional layer to guide LLM behavior and reduce the attack surface, not as the sole security control.

### Elicitation/Confirmation for Tool Calls

You can require explicit user confirmation for specific tools before execution (when the MCP client supports elicitation).

`CB_MCP_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED_TOOLS` / `--confirmation-required-tools` supports these formats:

- Comma-separated list
- File path (one tool name per line, `#` comments supported)

**Example:**

```bash
# Environment variable
CB_MCP_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED_TOOLS="delete_document_by_id,replace_document_by_id"

# Command line
uvx couchbase-mcp-server --confirmation-required-tools delete_document_by_id,replace_document_by_id
```

When a listed tool is invoked:

- If the client supports elicitation, the user is prompted to confirm.
- If the client does not support elicitation, the tool executes without confirmation for backward compatibility.

You can also check the version of the server using:

```bash
uvx couchbase-mcp-server --version
```

### Logging

The MCP server logs to `stderr` by default. Logging is configured with the `CB_MCP_LOG_*` variables listed in [Additional Configuration](#additional-configuration-for-mcp-server):

- **`CB_MCP_LOG_LEVEL`** — how much is logged: `info` (the default) logs lifecycle events and tool invocations, `debug` adds verbose internal detail, and `off` disables all logging.
- **`CB_MCP_LOG_SINKS`** — where logs go: `stderr` (the default), per-level rotating files (`file`), or both. With `file`, one file is written per level (for example `mcp_server.info.log` and `mcp_server.error.log`) at the path set by `CB_MCP_LOG_FILE`.
- **Rotation size** — `CB_MCP_LOG_ROTATION_MAX_SIZE_MB` is the global size (**in MB**) at which each per-level file rotates. Override individual levels with `CB_MCP_LOG_<LEVEL>_ROTATION_MAX_SIZE_MB` (`ERROR`/`WARNING`/`INFO`/`DEBUG`), also **in MB**, which inherit the global when unset. A size of `0` (global or per-level) is invalid and falls back to the default (1 MB) with a startup warning. `CB_MCP_LOG_MAX_BYTES` (bytes) is **deprecated** but still honored for backward compatibility; it is ignored when `CB_MCP_LOG_ROTATION_MAX_SIZE_MB` is also set, and prints a deprecation warning at startup.
- **Retention** — `CB_MCP_LOG_RETENTION_BACKUP_COUNT` sets how many rotated backups are kept per level (excluding the live file); the default of `1` preserves the previous behaviour. Override individual levels with `CB_MCP_LOG_<LEVEL>_RETENTION_BACKUP_COUNT` (`ERROR`/`WARNING`/`INFO`/`DEBUG`), which inherit the global value when unset. Set a count to `0` to keep only the live file for that level — it is still capped by the rotation size (reset on rollover rather than backed up).
- **Server-config snapshot** — when the `file` sink is active, a one-shot record (OS, Python, dependency versions, transport, resolved logging config, and redacted server config) is written as JSON to a dedicated `mcp_server_config.log.json` file (derived from the `CB_MCP_LOG_FILE` base). It is overwritten on each start, so support always has the current config and it never scrolls out of a rotating log.

```bash
# Enable debug logging to both stderr and rotating per-level files
uvx couchbase-mcp-server --log-level=debug --log-sinks=stderr,file

# Keep 30 rotated ERROR backups but only the live DEBUG file
uvx couchbase-mcp-server --log-level=debug --log-sinks=file \
  --log-error-retention-backup-count=30 --log-debug-retention-backup-count=0
```

## Operational Insights Server

Alongside the default `operational` server (the one every section above
describes), this distribution ships a second server for
[Operational Insights](https://docs.couchbase.com/enterprise-analytics/current/intro/intro.html)
clusters, using the separate
[`couchbase-operational-insights`](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/operational-insights-python-client)
SDK. It is a different product from a regular Couchbase cluster and runs as
an independent process on its own port.

Run it by passing `operational-insights` as the CLI subcommand (or appending
it as the container's command):

```bash
uvx couchbase-mcp-server operational-insights
# or, from source:
uv run src/mcp_server.py operational-insights
# or, via Docker:
docker run --rm -i \
  -e CB_OI_CONNECTION_STRING=http://localhost:8095 \
  -e CB_OI_USERNAME=Administrator \
  -e CB_OI_PASSWORD=password \
  couchbase/mcp-server:<version> operational-insights
```

**`--connection-string` is an HTTP(S) URL, not a `couchbase://` connection
string** — e.g. `http://localhost:8095` for a local Operational Insights
server, or `https://<host>:18095` for Capella. This is the single most
common misconfiguration when pointing this server at a cluster.

| CLI Argument | Environment Variable | Description | Default |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ------------ | ------- |
| `--connection-string` | `CB_OI_CONNECTION_STRING` | Operational Insights endpoint URL (HTTP/HTTPS, not `couchbase://`) | None |
| `--username` | `CB_OI_USERNAME` | Operational Insights username | None |
| `--password` | `CB_OI_PASSWORD` | Operational Insights password | None |
| `--ca-cert-path` | `CB_OI_CA_CERT_PATH` | Path to server root certificate (PEM), for verifying a self-signed/untrusted server certificate | None |
| `--client-cert-path` | `CB_OI_CLIENT_CERT_PATH` | Path to the client certificate for mTLS authentication — a PEM cert (paired with `--client-key-path`) or a PKCS#12 bundle (`.p12`/`.pfx`, `--client-key-path` left unset). Requires an `https://` `--connection-string`; overrides `--username`/`--password` when set | None |
| `--client-key-path` | `CB_OI_CLIENT_KEY_PATH` | Path to the client certificate's private key (PEM). Leave unset when `--client-cert-path` is a PKCS#12 bundle | None |
| `--client-cert-password` | `CB_OI_CLIENT_CERT_PASSWORD` | Decryption password for an encrypted client key or PKCS#12 bundle | None |

Every other flag (`--read-only-mode`, `--transport`, `--host`, `--port`,
`--disabled-tools`, `--confirmation-required-tools`, `--log-*`,
`--oauth-*`) is identical to the operational server's — see
[Additional Configuration for MCP Server](#additional-configuration-for-mcp-server) —
except the defaults for **port** (`8001`, not `8000`) and **log file**
(`mcp_server_operational_insights.log`, not `mcp_server.log`), since two
servers cannot share either. OAuth uses the same scope labels
(`couchbase-mcp:read` / `couchbase-mcp:write`) as the operational server, so
an existing IdP configuration works for both without changes.

Example MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "couchbase-operational-insights": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["couchbase-mcp-server", "operational-insights"],
      "env": {
        "CB_OI_CONNECTION_STRING": "http://localhost:8095",
        "CB_OI_USERNAME": "Administrator",
        "CB_OI_PASSWORD": "password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

See [Operational Insights tools](#operational-insights-tools) above for the
tool list, and the note there about the three tool names shared with the
operational server.

This server has its own [MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io)
listing, published from `operational_insights_server.json` — separate from
the operational server's `server.json` — so it's independently discoverable
in the registry rather than buried inside the operational server's entry.

## Streamable HTTP Transport Mode

The MCP Server can be run in [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#streamable-http) transport mode which allows multiple clients to connect to the same server instance via HTTP.
Check if your [MCP client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients) supports streamable http transport before attempting to connect to MCP server in this mode.

> Note: OAuth 2.1 authorization is supported on this transport. See [OAuth 2.1 Authorization](#oauth-21-authorization). Without OAuth configured, the HTTP endpoint is unauthenticated.

### Usage

By default, the MCP server will run on port 8000 but this can be configured using the `--port` or `CB_MCP_PORT` environment variable.

```bash
uvx couchbase-mcp-server \
  --connection-string='<couchbase_connection_string>' \
  --username='<database_username>' \
  --password='<database_password>' \
  --read-only-mode=true \
  --transport=http
```

The server will be available on <http://localhost:8000/mcp>. This can be used in MCP clients supporting streamable http transport mode such as Cursor.

### MCP Client Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "couchbase-http": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## SSE Transport Mode

There is an option to run the MCP server in [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports#http-with-sse) transport mode.

> Note: SSE mode has been [deprecated](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#server-sent-events-sse-deprecated) by MCP. We have support for [Streamable HTTP](#streamable-http-transport-mode).

### SSE: Usage

By default, the MCP server will run on port 8000 but this can be configured using the `--port` or `CB_MCP_PORT` environment variable.

```bash
uvx couchbase-mcp-server \
  --connection-string='<couchbase_connection_string>' \
  --username='<database_username>' \
  --password='<database_password>' \
  --read-only-mode=true \
  --transport=sse
```

The server will be available on <http://localhost:8000/sse>. This can be used in MCP clients supporting SSE transport mode such as Cursor.

### SSE: MCP Client Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "couchbase-sse": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

## OAuth 2.1 Authorization

When running with `--transport=http`, the MCP server can act as an **OAuth 2.1 resource server**: it validates incoming bearer JWTs against your identity provider's JWKS. It is provider-agnostic (any OAuth 2.1 / OIDC provider that publishes a JWKS — Auth0, Okta, Keycloak, AWS Cognito, Microsoft Entra, etc.) and does **not** issue tokens or manage users. OAuth settings are ignored on `stdio`.

OAuth is configured with the `CB_MCP_OAUTH_*` variables listed in [Additional Configuration](#additional-configuration-for-mcp-server):

- OAuth activates only when all three of `CB_MCP_OAUTH_JWT_JWKS_URI`, `CB_MCP_OAUTH_JWT_ISSUER`, and `CB_MCP_OAUTH_JWT_AUDIENCE` are set; setting only some of them fails at startup.
- Setting `CB_MCP_OAUTH_MCP_BASE_URL` additionally publishes RFC 9728 Protected Resource Metadata so PRM-aware clients can discover the authorization server.
- Access is gated by two scopes read from the token's `scope`/`scp` claim: `couchbase-mcp:read` (read tools, including SQL++) and `couchbase-mcp:write` (write tools: KV mutations, scope/collection management, and index management). Full access requires both. If your IdP can't emit those canonical labels, override them with `CB_MCP_OAUTH_SCOPE_READ_LABEL` / `CB_MCP_OAUTH_SCOPE_WRITE_LABEL`.

```bash
uvx couchbase-mcp-server \
  --connection-string='<couchbase_connection_string>' \
  --username='<database_username>' \
  --password='<database_password>' \
  --transport=http \
  --oauth-jwks-uri='https://auth.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json' \
  --oauth-issuer='https://auth.example.com/' \
  --oauth-audience='couchbase-mcp-server' \
  --oauth-mcp-base-url='<public_base_url_of_this_server>'
```

For full details, see the [documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/mcp-server/configuration/oauth-overview.html).

## Docker Image

The MCP server can also be built and run as a Docker container. Prebuilt images can be found on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/couchbase/mcp-server) or pulled via `docker pull docker.io/couchbase/mcp-server:latest`.

Alternatively, we are part of the [Docker MCP Catalog](https://hub.docker.com/mcp/server/couchbase/overview).

### Building Image

```bash
docker build -t mcp/couchbase-src .
```

<details>
<summary>Building with Arguments</summary>
If you want to build with the build arguments for commit hash and the build time, you can build using:

```bash
docker build --build-arg GIT_COMMIT_HASH=$(git rev-parse HEAD) \
  --build-arg BUILD_DATE=$(date -u +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ') \
  -t mcp/couchbase-src .
```

**Alternatively, use the provided build script:**

```bash
# Build with default image name (mcp/couchbase-src)
./build.sh

# Build with custom image name
./build.sh my-custom/image-name
```

This script automatically:

- Accepts an optional image name parameter (defaults to `mcp/couchbase-src`)
- Generates git commit hash and build timestamp
- Creates multiple useful tags (`latest`, `<short-commit>`)
- Shows build information and results
- Uses the same arguments as CI/CD builds

**Verify image labels:**

```bash
# View git commit hash in image

### Running

The MCP server can be run with the environment variables being used to configure the Couchbase settings. The environment variables are the same as described in the [Additional Configuration section](#additional-configuration-for-mcp-server).

#### Independent Docker Container

```bash
docker run --rm -i \
  -e CB_CONNECTION_STRING='<couchbase_connection_string>' \
  -e CB_USERNAME='<database_user>' \
  -e CB_PASSWORD='<database_password>' \
  -e CB_MCP_TRANSPORT='<http|sse|stdio>' \
  -e CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE='<true|false>' \
  -e CB_MCP_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED_TOOLS='delete_document_by_id' \
  -e CB_MCP_PORT=9001 \
  -e CB_MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -p 9001:9001 \
  mcp/couchbase-src
```

The `CB_MCP_PORT` and `CB_MCP_HOST` environment variables are only applicable in the case of HTTP transport modes like http and sse.

#### Docker: MCP Client Configuration

The Docker image can be used in `stdio` transport mode with the following configuration.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "couchbase-mcp-docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-e",
        "CB_CONNECTION_STRING=<couchbase_connection_string>",
        "-e",
        "CB_USERNAME=<database_user>",
        "-e",
        "CB_PASSWORD=<database_password>",
        "mcp/couchbase-src"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Notes

- The `couchbase_connection_string` value depends on whether the Couchbase server is running on the same host machine, in another Docker container, or on a remote host. If your Couchbase server is running on your host machine, your connection string would likely be of the form `couchbase://host.docker.internal`. For details refer to the [docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/networking/#i-want-to-connect-from-a-container-to-a-service-on-the-host).
- You can specify the container's networking using the `--network=<your_network>` option. The network you choose depends on your environment; the default is `bridge`. For details, refer to [network drivers in docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/).

### Risks Associated with LLMs

- The use of large language models and similar technology involves risks, including the potential for inaccurate or harmful outputs.
- Couchbase does not review or evaluate the quality or accuracy of such outputs, and such outputs may not reflect Couchbase's views.
- You are solely responsible for determining whether to use large language models and related technology, and for complying with any license terms, terms of use, and your organization's policies governing your use of the same.

## Usage Data Collection

This product automatically collects usage and performance data (such as product name and version) and browser information (such as IP address) (collectively, "Usage Data"). Couchbase uses Usage Data, along with other data you may provide to Couchbase (such as your user name or email address), to develop and improve our products as well as inform our sales and marketing programs. We do not access or collect any data you store in Couchbase products. We use Usage Data to understand aggregate usage patterns and make our products more useful to you.  For more information on how Couchbase collects, protects, and processes information, please refer to the Couchbase Privacy Policy viewable at https://www.couchbase.com/privacy-policy.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure the path to your MCP server repository is correct in the configuration if running from source.
- Verify that your Couchbase connection string, database username, password or the path to the certificates are correct.
- If using Couchbase Capella, ensure that the cluster is [accessible](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/allow-ip-address.html) from the machine where the MCP server is running.
- Check that the database user has proper permissions to access at least one bucket.
- Confirm that the `uv` package manager is properly installed and accessible. You may need to provide absolute path to `uv`/`uvx` in the `command` field in the configuration.
- Check the logs for any errors or warnings that may indicate issues with the MCP server. The location of the logs depend on your MCP client.
- If you are observing issues running your MCP server from source after updating your local MCP server repository, try running `uv sync` to update the [dependencies](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/sync/#syncing-the-environment).

## Integration testing

We provide high-level MCP integration tests to verify that the server exposes the expected tools and that they can be invoked against a demo Couchbase cluster.

1. Export demo cluster credentials:
   - `CB_CONNECTION_STRING`
   - `CB_USERNAME`
   - `CB_PASSWORD`
   - Optional: `CB_MCP_TEST_BUCKET` (a bucket to probe during the tests)
   - Optional, for the [Operational Insights server](#operational-insights-server)'s
     own tests: `CB_OI_CONNECTION_STRING` / `CB_OI_USERNAME` / `CB_OI_PASSWORD`.
     Those tests skip automatically (not fail) when unset.
2. Run the tests:

```bash
uv run --extra dev pytest tests/integration -v
```

## FAQ

**What is the Couchbase MCP Server?** It's a self-hosted implementation of the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/2026-07-28/getting-started/intro) that lets AI assistants and agents (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code Copilot, JetBrains AI Assistant/Junie, and any other MCP client) query and, optionally, modify data in a Couchbase cluster using natural language.

**How do I connect Claude Desktop to Couchbase?** Install the server with `uvx couchbase-mcp-server` (or run it from source or Docker), then add its configuration to Claude Desktop's `claude_desktop_config.json` as shown in [Configuration](#configuration). Restart Claude Desktop and it will pick up the new tools.

**Can I use this with Couchbase Capella?** Yes. The same `CB_CONNECTION_STRING/CB_USERNAME/CB_PASSWORD` (or mTLS certificate) configuration works for both Couchbase Capella and self-managed Couchbase Server clusters.

**Is it safe to let an AI agent write to my database?** By default, `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE` is true, so all write operations — document upserts/inserts/replaces/deletes and data-modifying SQL++ statements — are disabled and the write tools aren't even loaded. You can also disable individual tools (see [Disabling Tools](#disabling-tools)) or require explicit user confirmation before specific tools run (see [Elicitation/Confirmation](#elicitationconfirmation-for-tool-calls)). Tool-level controls guide LLM behavior; your Couchbase user's RBAC permissions remain the real security boundary.

**Can I run natural-language queries against my data without writing SQL++ myself?** Yes — ask your AI assistant a question in plain English (e.g. "show me the 10 most recent orders over $100") and it can translate that into a [SQL++](https://www.couchbase.com/sqlplusplus/) query using the `run_sql_plus_plus_query` tool. You can also ask the assistant to `explain_sql_plus_plus_query` a query or ask the index advisor for recommendations.

**What's the difference between STDIO, Streamable HTTP, and SSE transport?** STDIO is for a single local MCP client (e.g. Claude Desktop) launching the server as a subprocess. Streamable HTTP lets multiple clients share one running server instance over HTTP, and supports OAuth 2.1. SSE is the older HTTP transport, now deprecated by the MCP spec in favor of Streamable HTTP — see [Streamable HTTP Transport Mode](#streamable-http-transport-mode).

**Is this officially supported by Couchbase?** This project is Couchbase community-maintained — see [Support Policy](#-support-policy). Enterprise support is available separately through [Couchbase AI Data Plane](https://www.couchbase.com/downloads/?family=agent-memory).
