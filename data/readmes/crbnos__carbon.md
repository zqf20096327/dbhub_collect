## Why Carbon

We built Carbon after years of building end-to-end manufacturing systems with off-the-shelf solutions. We realized that:

- Modern, API-first tooling didn't exist
- Vendor lock-in bordered on extortion
- There is no "perfect ERP" because each company is unique

We built Carbon to solve these problems ☝️

<br />

## Monorepo

The monorepo follows the Turborepo convention of grouping packages into two folders:

```
carbon
├── apps         # applications
└── packages     # shared code
```

### `/apps`

| App         | Description                                                    | How to run                                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `erp`       | ERP application                                                 | `pnpm dev` (boots stack + ERP via `crbn up` picker) |
| `mes`       | MES — shop floor                                                | `pnpm dev` (select MES in picker, or both)          |
| `academy`   | Training                                                        | `pnpm dev:academy`                                  |
| `starter`   | Example app built on the API                                    | `pnpm dev:starter`                                  |
| `assembler` | Geometry service (Rust): STEP → GLB + assembly motion planning | spawned by `crbn up` (needs a release binary — see [Optional: assembler](#optional-the-assembler-geometry-service)) |

`pnpm dev` runs the per-worktree dev CLI (`crbn up`). ERP and MES are first-class — the CLI boots the docker stack, applies migrations, regenerates types/swagger, and spawns the selected apps behind portless. The `assembler` geometry service is spawned too when its release binary is present. Academy and starter are standalone Turborepo entries.

### `/packages`

| Package             | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@carbon/database`  | Database schema, migrations and types                                       |
| `@carbon/documents` | Transactional PDFs and email templates                                      |
| `@carbon/ee`        | Integration definitions and configurations                                  |
| `@carbon/config`    | Shared configuration (vitest, tsconfig, tailwind) across apps and packages  |
| `@carbon/jobs`      | Background jobs and workers                                                 |
| `@carbon/logger`    | Shared logger used across apps                                              |
| `@carbon/react`     | Shared web-based UI components                                              |
| `@carbon/kv`        | Redis cache client                                                          |
| `@carbon/lib`       | Third-party client libraries (slack, resend)                                |
| `@carbon/stripe`    | Stripe integration                                                          |
| `@carbon/utils`     | Shared utility functions used across apps and packages                      |

<br />

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) — the monorepo uses Docker for local development
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v22 (via `nvm`)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) (via Corepack — see below; never `npm`)

You'll also want accounts with the following external services:

| Service                                              | Purpose                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| [Posthog](https://us.posthog.com/signup)             | Product analytics platform |
| [Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login)         | Payments service           |
| An SMTP provider (e.g. [Resend](https://resend.com)) | Email service              |

Posthog has a free tier which should be plenty to support local development. If you're self hosting and you don't want to use Posthog, it's pretty easy to remove the analytics.

### Clone

Clone the repo, or fork it at https://github.com/crbnos/carbon/fork. Carbon is licensed under AGPLv3. If you'd rather not share your changes with your users, as AGPLv3 requires, or if you want the Enterprise features in packages/ee, you'll need a [commercial license](https://carbon.ms/sales).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crbnos/carbon.git
cd carbon
```

### Install

This repo uses **pnpm** as its package manager. Enable Corepack so the correct pnpm version (pinned via `packageManager` in `package.json`) is used automatically:

```bash
corepack enable    # one-time: activates pnpm shim from packageManager field
nvm use            # use node v22
pnpm install       # install dependencies
```

The dev stack (Postgres, GoTrue, Kong, Storage, Inngest, Inbucket, Studio, Realtime) is booted later by `crbn up` — see [Local Dev CLI](#local-dev-cli-crbn) below. There is no separate "start the database" step.

<details>
<summary><h3>Optional: the <code>assembler</code> geometry service</h3></summary>

`assembler` is a Rust service (STEP → GLB + assembly motion planning) over C++ FCL and OpenCASCADE. ERP/MES run fine without it — set it up only if you need the 3D `/convert` and `/plan` endpoints.

1. **Toolchain + native build deps** (macOS):

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh   # Rust, if not already installed
   brew install fcl cmake ninja draco                               # collision libs (+ libccd/eigen/octomap), build tools, Draco mesh compression
   ```

   On Linux, install the equivalents from your package manager: `libfcl-dev libccd-dev libeigen3-dev liboctomap-dev libdraco-dev cmake ninja-build` plus a C/C++ toolchain.

   `./setup.sh` already installs Draco on macOS. If yours lives outside the Homebrew keg (`/opt/homebrew/opt/draco` on arm64), point `draco-bridge`'s build at it with `DRACO_PREFIX=/path/to/draco cargo build`.

2. **Build OCCT once** — a patched static OpenCASCADE, cached in `~/.cache/carbon-occt`. Slow (~15–30 min) but one-time per machine; re-running is a no-op once cached:

   ```bash
   ./apps/assembler/scripts/build-occt.sh
   ```

3. **Build the service** — seconds once OCCT is cached (`build.rs` finds it automatically):

   ```bash
   cargo build --release -p assembler
   ```

`crbn up` spawns the binary when it's present. Verify it's up with `curl -sf "$ASSEMBLER_SERVICE_URL/health"` (the URL is in your worktree's `.env.local`) or by watching the `asm |` lines in the `crbn up` output. Without the binary the rest of the stack still runs — only `/convert` and `/plan` are unavailable.

</details>

<br />

## Local Dev CLI (`crbn`)

[![](https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/690e6a4ec1c24216b56a22aa2667ba51-ee9275cabb59a0aa-full-play.gif#t=0.1)](https://www.loom.com/embed/690e6a4ec1c24216b56a22aa2667ba51)

`crbn` is a small CLI at `packages/dev/bin/crbn` that wraps two things:

- **Git worktrees** — every feature branch can live in its own checkout dir, so you can switch branches without stashing.
- **Per-worktree docker compose stack** — each worktree gets its own Postgres / Supabase services on dynamic ports, isolated under a `carbon-<slug>` compose project. Routing is handled by [portless](https://github.com/portless-dev/portless) (a local HTTPS reverse proxy that serves `*.dev` hostnames on `:443` with locally-trusted certs — installed automatically on first `crbn up`).

> **Windows users:** the dev CLI (`crbn`, `setup.sh`) is POSIX-only and expects **WSL or Git Bash**. Native cmd.exe / PowerShell shells are not supported. From a WSL/Git Bash prompt, the standard flow (`./setup.sh`, `pnpm dev`, `crbn checkout …`) works the same as on macOS/Linux.

Run `setup.sh` once to put `crbn` on your `$PATH` and install the `crbn` shell function (so `crbn checkout` can change cwd):

```bash
./setup.sh                   # writes a sentinel block to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
source ~/.zshrc              # or open a new shell
crbn                         # shows commands
```

Common flows:

```bash
crbn checkout sid/cool-thing       # cd into worktree (creates if missing,
                                   # auto-fetches from origin if needed)
crbn checkout -b feat/new-thing    # new branch off origin/main + worktree
crbn checkout sid/cool-thing --up  # …and boot the stack inside it
crbn checkout 760                  # fetch GitHub PR #760 into a `pr-760`
                                   # branch + worktree (fork PRs work too)
crbn copy                          # re-sync .env from main checkout
crbn up | down | reset | status    # per-worktree compose stack
crbn new | list | remove           # interactive worktree management
```

`crbn up` flags:

- `--no-migrate` — skip `supabase migration up` (use when schema is already current and you just want to re-boot containers fast)
- `--no-regen` — skip regenerating `packages/database/src/types.ts` + `swagger-docs-schema.ts` (auto-skipped when `--no-migrate` is set, since no schema change implies no type drift)

Files synced by `crbn copy` are listed under `package.json#crbn.copy` (defaults to `[".env"]`). To uninstall the rc block: `./setup.sh --uninstall`.

<br />

## Environment Variables

Create an `.env` file and copy the contents of `.env.example` into it:

```bash
cp ./.env.example ./.env
```

Then configure each service:

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Social Sign In</strong></summary>

Signing in requires you to set up one of two methods:

- Email requires SMTP credentials (you'll set this up later on)
- Sign-in with Google requires a Google auth client with these variables. [See the Supabase docs for instructions on how to set this up](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google):
  - Set `Authorized JavaScript origins` to `https://api.carbon.dev`
  - Set `Authorized redirect URIs` to `https://api.carbon.dev/auth/v1/callback`
  - **About the two API URLs you'll see:** each worktree has its own scoped Supabase URL (`https://<worktree>.api.dev`) for app traffic, **and** there is one stable alias `https://api.carbon.dev` registered on whichever worktree is currently `up`. The stable alias exists only so OAuth callbacks have a single registered redirect URI — one Google Console entry covers every worktree. Day-to-day, your app talks to its worktree-scoped URL; only the OAuth callback hits the stable alias.
- You should set environment variables like the following:
  - `SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="******.apps.googleusercontent.com"`
  - `SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="GOCSPX-****************"`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Supabase</strong></summary>

Backend services run inside the per-worktree docker stack — `crbn up` boots them and writes everything you need into `.env.local` automatically:

- `SUPABASE_URL` — portless alias (e.g. `https://local-dev.api.dev`)
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — keys minted per-worktree from a random `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`
- `SUPABASE_DB_URL` — direct Postgres URL on a dynamic port

`.env.local` is generated; do not commit it or hand-edit values that came from `crbn up` (they are re-derived on each boot). Put genuine secrets (OAuth client IDs, Stripe keys, SMTP credentials) in `.env` only.

Run `crbn status` at any time to see the live port assignment and the URLs portless is serving.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. Redis (caching)</strong></summary>

No setup needed for local dev — `crbn up` boots a shared Redis container and writes `REDIS_URL` into `.env.local` automatically (each worktree gets its own logical Redis DB). For self-hosted production, set `REDIS_URL` to any Redis-compatible endpoint (Upstash, AWS ElastiCache, etc.) in your prod environment.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4. Posthog (analytics)</strong></summary>

In Posthog go to `https://[region].posthog.com/project/[project-id]/settings/project-details` to find your Project ID and Project API key:

- `POSTHOG_API_HOST=[https://[region].posthog.com]`
- `POSTHOG_PROJECT_PUBLIC_KEY=[Project API Key starting 'phc*']`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5. Stripe (payments)</strong></summary>

[Create a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login), add a `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` from the Stripe `Settings > Developers` interface:

- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_*************"`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>6. SMTP (email)</strong></summary>

Transactional email (user invitations, email verification, onboarding) is sent over SMTP. Any provider works — Resend, Amazon SES, or your own relay:

- `SMTP_HOST="smtp.example.com"`
- `SMTP_PORT="587"` (465 uses implicit TLS, 587 uses STARTTLS)
- `SMTP_USER="********"`
- `SMTP_PASSWORD="********"`
- `SMTP_FROM="Carbon <no-reply@example.com>"`

Leave them unset to disable email entirely — the apps boot and run fine without it.

- `RESEND_API_KEY="re_**********"` (Optional — Resend marketing contacts; also a legacy SMTP fallback when `SMTP_*` is unset)
- `RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID="*****"` (Optional — required for contact management in `packages/jobs`)

</details>

<br />

Finally, boot the stack and the apps:

```bash
pnpm dev                # equivalent to `crbn up` — picker lets you choose ERP/MES
```

`crbn up` prints a summary box with the live URLs once the stack is healthy. Defaults look like:

| Surface         | URL                                                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ERP             | `https://<worktree>.erp.dev`                                   |
| MES             | `https://<worktree>.mes.dev`                                   |
| Supabase API    | `https://<worktree>.api.dev`                                   |
| Supabase Studio | `https://<worktree>.studio.dev`                                |
| Inngest         | `https://<worktree>.inngest.dev`                               |
| Mail (Inbucket) | `https://<worktree>.mail.dev`                                  |
| Postgres        | `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:<PORT_DB>/postgres`  |

`<worktree>` is derived from the branch name (e.g. `sid-local-dev` → `local-dev`). The main checkout drops the prefix and just uses `erp.dev`, `mes.dev`, etc. Ports for raw TCP services (Postgres, Inbucket, Inngest) are dynamic per-worktree — `crbn status` is the source of truth.

Academy and starter still run on classic localhost ports via `pnpm dev:academy` / `pnpm dev:starter` (they are not part of the per-worktree stack).

<br />

## Logging In

For local development you don't need email or OAuth configured. `crbn up` seeds a smoke-test user (`test@carbon.ms`) and writes `DEV_BYPASS_EMAIL=test@carbon.ms` into `.env.local` for you. When that bypass email is set, signing in with it skips the magic link and logs you straight into the ERP:

1. Open the ERP at the URL from the `crbn up` summary (e.g. `https://<worktree>.erp.dev/login`).
2. Type `test@carbon.ms` into the email field.
3. Click **Sign in with Email**.

You'll land on the authenticated dashboard (`/x`) — no inbox check required. The same session cookie works for the MES app at `https://<worktree>.mes.dev`.

> The bypass only applies to the exact address in `DEV_BYPASS_EMAIL` and only when that user is active — it's a dev convenience, not present in production. Any other email falls back to the normal magic-link / verification flow (which needs SMTP configured). To sign in as your own account instead, use the magic link and read it from the local mail catcher at `https://<worktree>.mail.dev`.

### Restoring a production snapshot

To restore a production database snapshot locally, use `crbn restore`. It handles both plain-text `.backup` and custom-format `.dump` archives, drops and rebuilds the public schema, realigns internal sequences, resets storage metadata, then applies any migrations the backup predates and regenerates types.

1. Export a backup from your production Supabase project (`pg_dump` or Supabase Dashboard → Database → Backups).
2. Run it from your worktree root:

   ```bash
   crbn restore /path/to/db_cluster.backup
   # …or for .dump archives:
   crbn restore /path/to/postgres_YYYYMMDD.dump
   ```

   It prompts before replacing the database. The stack must already be running (`crbn up`) — a restore rewrites the `auth` and `storage` schemas, which GoTrue and Storage build through their own migrations when those containers boot, so `crbn restore` refuses rather than restore into an uninitialized stack.

   To also get local admin access, pass your production email — your account is upgraded to Admin in the companies it already belongs to and the password is reset locally:

   ```bash
   crbn restore /path/to/backup.backup --admin-email you@example.com
   # Optional: set a custom local password (default: localpass)
   crbn restore /path/to/backup.backup --admin-email you@example.com --admin-password mypass
   ```

   Useful flags: `--no-scrub-emails` keeps real addresses (see the warning below), `--mode prod` restores exactly as-is without localizing config/webhooks/integrations, `--no-migrate` / `--no-regen` skip the trailing steps, `--yes` skips the prompt.

   > **Emails are scrubbed by default** — every address is rewritten to `@example.test` (your `--admin-email` is preserved so you can still log in). If you pass `--no-scrub-emails`, real production addresses will be present in the local DB; ensure local email sending is disabled or pointed at a sandbox (e.g. Mailpit) before triggering any email flows.
   >
   > **Note:** `storage.objects` is truncated by default, so a restore does not populate local file storage — kept rows would reference files that only exist in the source environment's backend. Pass `--keep-storage-objects` to retain the metadata (and the backup's buckets) anyway; downloads will still 404, but the rows are there for work that needs realistic storage volume.

The underlying script, `scripts/restore-database.sh`, can still be invoked directly — it takes the same options as environment variables (`SCRUB_EMAILS`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `RESTORE_MODE`), but note it defaults to **not** scrubbing emails and leaves the trailing `pnpm db:migrate` / `pnpm db:types` to you.

## API

The API documentation is located in the ERP app at `${ERP}/x/api/js/intro`. It is auto-generated based on changes to the database.

There are two ways to use the API:

1. From another codebase using a supabase client library — [JavaScript](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/introduction), [Flutter](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/introduction), [Python](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/python/introduction), [C#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/csharp/introduction), [Swift](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/swift/introduction), [Kotlin](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/kotlin/introduction)
2. From within the codebase using our packages

### From another codebase

First, set up the necessary credentials in environment variables. For the example below:

1. Navigate to settings in the ERP to generate an API key. Set this in `CARBON_API_KEY`.
2. Get the Supabase URL to call (this is `SUPABASE_URL` in your `.env` if hosting locally, e.g. http://localhost:54321). Set this as `CARBON_API_URL`.
3. Get the `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` e.g. from your `.env` file. Set this as `CARBON_PUBLIC_KEY`.

If you're self-hosting you can also use the supabase service key instead of the public key for root access. In that case you don't need to include the `carbon-key` header.

```ts
import { Database } from "@carbon/database";
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

const apiKey = process.env.CARBON_API_KEY;
const apiUrl = process.env.CARBON_API_URL;
const publicKey = process.env.CARBON_PUBLIC_KEY;

const carbon = createClient<Database>(apiUrl, publicKey, {
  global: {
    headers: {
      "carbon-key": apiKey,
    },
  },
});

// returns items from the company associated with the api key
const { data, error } = await carbon.from("item").select("*");
```

### From the monorepo

```tsx
import { getCarbonServiceRole } from "@carbon/auth/client.server";
const carbon = getCarbonServiceRole();

// returns all items across companies
const { data, error } = await carbon.from("item").select("*");

// returns items from a specific company
const companyId = "xyz";
const { data, error } = await carbon
  .from("item")
  .select("*")
  .eq("companyId", companyId);
```

## Migration Notes

<details>
<summary><strong>Trigger.dev → Inngest</strong></summary>

Background jobs have been migrated from [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev) to [Inngest](https://inngest.com). Key changes:

- **Job definitions** moved from `packages/jobs/trigger/` to `packages/jobs/src/inngest/functions/`
- **Triggering jobs** from app code uses `trigger()` and `batchTrigger()` from `@carbon/jobs` instead of `tasks.trigger()` from `@trigger.dev/sdk`
- **Inngest dev server** runs via `npx inngest-cli@latest dev -u http://localhost:3000/api/inngest`
- **Environment variables**: `TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY`, `TRIGGER_API_URL`, and `TRIGGER_PROJECT_ID` are no longer needed. Set `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY` and `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` instead (not required for local dev).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Upstash → Local Redis</strong></summary>

The caching layer (`@carbon/kv`) no longer depends on Upstash. A standard Redis instance is used instead. The `REDIS_URL` environment variable still applies, but you can point it at any Redis-compatible server (including a local Docker container).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Supabase CLI → docker compose (<code>crbn</code>)</strong></summary>

Local dev no longer relies on `supabase start` / `supabase stop`. The full backend stack (Postgres 15, GoTrue, Kong, Storage, Realtime, Studio, Inngest, Inbucket, edge-runtime) runs from `packages/dev/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml` under a per-worktree compose project (`carbon-<slug>`), managed by `crbn up` / `down` / `reset`. Ports are allocated dynamically per worktree so multiple branches can run side-by-side. Key changes:

- `pnpm db:start` / `db:stop` / `db:kill` / `db:build` are removed — use `crbn up` / `down` / `reset`.
- `.env.local` is generated by `crbn up` (worktree-specific URLs, ports, JWT secret, anon/service keys). Genuine secrets stay in `.env`.
- `pnpm db:migrate` now drives `supabase migration up --db-url $SUPABASE_DB_URL`; it falls back to the CLI's linked-project mode when `SUPABASE_DB_URL` is unset.
- `pnpm db:types` generates types directly from `$SUPABASE_DB_URL` (no `supabase gen types --local`).
