Backups for Rails apps deployed with Kamal should not become a separate ops project.

`kamal-backup` is one Kamal accessory that runs encrypted backups for your Rails database and file-backed Active Storage files on a schedule. It also gives you restore drills and redacted evidence for security reviews like CASA.

Run `kamal-backup init`, fill in one config file, add the accessory, then boot it. If you already deploy with Kamal, backups should feel like adding one more accessory.

## Why Rails teams use it

Most self-hosted Rails apps need the same things:

- scheduled backups for PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, or SQLite
- file-backed Active Storage backups from mounted volumes
- local restores for inspecting production data safely
- restore drills that do not touch the live production database
- evidence that says more than "the backup ran"

`kamal-backup` wraps that workflow in a small Ruby gem and a production accessory image backed by a restic repository.

## Quick start

Add the gem:

```rb
group :development do
  gem "kamal-backup"
end
```

Generate the config file and accessory snippet:

```sh
bundle install
bundle exec kamal-backup init
```

Add the accessory to `config/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
accessories:
  backup:
    image: ghcr.io/crmne/kamal-backup:latest
    host: chatwithwork.com
    files:
      - config/kamal-backup.yml:/app/config/kamal-backup.yml:ro
    env:
      secret:
        - DATABASE_PASSWORD
        - RESTIC_PASSWORD
        - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    volumes:
      - "chatwithwork_storage:/data/storage"
      - "chatwithwork_backup_state:/var/lib/kamal-backup"
```

The storage volume is writable so `restore production` can replace its contents safely without replacing the mount
point. Writable access is also required for SQLite databases stored on that volume. For a backup-only accessory,
you can append `:ro`; remove it and reboot the accessory before a production file restore.
When the configured SQLite database file lives under a configured file backup path, `kamal-backup` excludes the raw database, WAL, and shared-memory files from the restic file snapshot automatically.

Put the backup settings in `config/kamal-backup.yml`:

```yaml
app: chatwithwork
accessory: backup
databases:
  - name: app
    adapter: postgres
    url: postgres://chatwithwork@chatwithwork-db:5432/chatwithwork_production
    password:
      secret: DATABASE_PASSWORD
paths:
  - /data/storage
restic:
  repository: s3:https://s3.example.com/chatwithwork-backups
  password:
    secret: RESTIC_PASSWORD
  init_if_missing: true
backup:
  schedule: 1d
```

Only paths explicitly listed under `paths` are included in file snapshots. Omit `paths` for a database-only backup; `kamal-backup` never infers `storage` from Rails.

Boot it. The container runs `kamal-backup schedule` by default:

```sh
bundle exec kamal-backup validate
bin/kamal accessory boot backup
bin/kamal accessory logs backup
```

Run the first backup, check the repository, and print evidence. From an app checkout with `config/deploy.yml`, these commands shell out through Kamal to the backup accessory:

```sh
bundle exec kamal-backup backup
bundle exec kamal-backup list
bundle exec kamal-backup check
bundle exec kamal-backup unlock
bundle exec kamal-backup evidence
```

`backup` respects `backup.schedule` and skips when the latest backup is still current. Use `bundle exec kamal-backup backup --force` when you deliberately want an immediate snapshot.

## What you get

- **Scheduled backups:** the accessory runs continuously and backs up on `backup.schedule`.
- **Database and Active Storage coverage:** database dumps plus file-backed Active Storage files from mounted volumes.
- **Restic underneath:** encrypted, deduplicated snapshots in native restic backends or any rclone remote; the accessory includes both rclone and an SSH client.
- **Local restores:** inspect production data safely in your local Rails app.
- **Restore drills:** restore into scratch production-side targets, run verification commands, and record the result.
- **Security review evidence:** `kamal-backup evidence` prints redacted JSON with latest snapshots, `kamal-backup check` results, drills, retention, and tool versions.

## Releasing

Run the release helper from a clean `master` checkout:

```sh
bin/release 1.0.1
```

It updates `lib/kamal_backup/version.rb`, syncs `Gemfile.lock`, commits the release, and pushes `master`. CI runs the test suite and docs build, publishes the RubyGem and Docker image tags, then creates the version tag, GitHub release, and docs deployment from the release commit.

Add `--no-push` to prepare the release commit locally without publishing.
