**xNet is a local-first workspace — documents, databases, and canvases that
live on your device, sync everywhere, and belong to you.** There is no account
to create and no server in the middle: data is stored locally, synced
peer-to-peer or through a hub you control, and signed with your own keys.

## Try it

- **[Connect your coding agent](https://xnet.fyi/agents)** — one command,
  no install:

  ```bash
  npx @xnetjs/cli connect claude-code   # or: connect codex
  ```

  Claude Code or Codex can then read, search, query, and edit your
  workspace — read-only until you say otherwise.

- **[Open the demo](https://xnet.fyi/app)** — no signup; sign in with your
  device's passkey (Touch ID, Face ID, Windows Hello). Demo data lives in your
  browser, with encrypted backups on our demo hub (10MB, expires after 24
  hours of inactivity).
- **[Download the desktop app](https://xnet.fyi/download)** for permanent
  backups and reliable cross-device sync.
- **[Deploy your own hub](https://railway.com/deploy/xnet-hub)** — an
  always-on relay and backup node that you run.

> **Alpha software.** The `@xnetjs/*` packages, desktop app, and hub image all
> ship today — but APIs, schemas, and wire formats can still change between
> releases, sometimes without a migration path. Pin your versions, read the
> [changelog](https://xnet.fyi/changelog) before upgrading, and keep a backup
> you control (`.xnetpack` export is built in). Package version numbers are
> not a maturity signal; what is and isn't stable is written down in
> [STABILITY.md](./STABILITY.md).

## Your agent, your workspace

Coding agents are first-class users of an xNet workspace — through the
filesystem they already know, not a wall of tool definitions. `xnet connect`
installs a ~500-token skill and gives the agent three lanes, cheapest first:
the `xnet` CLI (plain stdout), a scoped **vault checkout** (Markdown/JSONL
files whose edits become schema-validated mutation plans), and a slim MCP
server as the no-shell fallback. On a 15-task benchmark the files+CLI surface
uses [~0.11x the tokens of a traditional MCP
toolset](https://xnet.fyi/docs/guides/agent-interfaces/#benchmark-methodology)
at equal success.

Safety is structural: the server registers **read-only by default**, writes
require an enrolled agent passport or an explicit key, and every change an
agent makes lands in the workspace's signed, hash-chained change log — so you
can verify what your agent did without trusting it.

## Build with it

Everything in xNet is a **node**, and a **schema** describes what a node is:

```typescript
import { defineSchema, text, number, select } from '@xnetjs/data'

const InvoiceSchema = defineSchema({
  name: 'Invoice',
  namespace: 'xnet://myapp/',
  document: 'yjs',
  properties: {
    title: text({ required: true }),
    amount: number(),
    status: select({
      options: [
        { id: 'draft', name: 'Draft' },
        { id: 'sent', name: 'Sent' },
        { id: 'paid', name: 'Paid' }
      ] as const
    })
  }
})
```

React hooks give you live queries, mutations, collaborative rich text, and
permissions:

```tsx
import { useQuery, useMutate, useNode, useIdentity, useCan, useGrants } from '@xnetjs/react'

// Structured data — live queries and writes
function TaskList() {
  const { data: tasks, loading } = useQuery(TaskSchema)
  const { create, update, remove } = useMutate()

  return (
    <ul>
      {tasks.map((task) => (
        <li key={task.id}>{task.title}</li>
      ))}
      <button onClick={() => create(TaskSchema, { title: 'New', status: 'todo' })}>Add</button>
    </ul>
  )
}

// Rich text — a synced Y.Doc per node
function PageEditor({ nodeId }: { nodeId: string }) {
  const { data: page, doc, syncStatus, peerCount } = useNode(PageSchema, nodeId)
  if (!doc) return null
  return <RichTextEditor ydoc={doc} />
}

// Identity and sharing — DIDs, permission checks, delegated grants
function SharingPanel({ nodeId }: { nodeId: string }) {
  const { did } = useIdentity()
  const { allowed: canShare } = useCan(nodeId, 'share')
  const { grant } = useGrants(nodeId)

  return (
    <button
      disabled={!canShare}
      onClick={() =>
        canShare && grant({ to: 'did:key:z6MkRecipient...', actions: ['read', 'write'] })
      }
    >
      Share as {did.slice(0, 16)}...
    </button>
  )
}
```

Under the hood: SQLite for storage (OPFS in the browser, native on desktop),
Yjs CRDTs for rich text, an event-sourced change log for structured data,
libp2p + WebRTC for peer-to-peer sync, and DID:key + UCAN for identity and
sharing. The deep dives live in the [docs](https://xnet.fyi/docs).

## An open protocol

This repository is one implementation of xNet. The protocol itself is an open
standard you can re-implement in any language, over any database, and
interoperate: see the [normative spec](./docs/specs/protocol/), the
[conformance suite](./conformance) (golden vectors plus a second-language
kernel), and [xnet.fyi/docs/protocol](https://xnet.fyi/docs/protocol/overview/).
Independent implementations that pass conformance may call themselves
**"xNet-compatible"** ([how](./docs/COMPATIBILITY.md)).

## Develop

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter xnet-web dev    # run the web app
pnpm dev:stories              # Storybook component catalog
pnpm build                    # build all packages
pnpm test                     # unit tests
pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint
```
