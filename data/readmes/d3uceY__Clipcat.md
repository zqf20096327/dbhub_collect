A stylish clipboard manager that automatically saves everything you copy - text and images - so you can find it, reuse it, and manage it.

### First-Run Notes

Clipcat is not code-signed, so each platform may warn you on first launch. The app is safe and fully open source - you can read every line of code here.

**Windows - SmartScreen**

1. Click **More info**
2. Click **Run anyway**

Or right-click the `.exe` -> **Properties** -> check **Unblock** -> **Apply**.

**macOS - Gatekeeper**

Right-click the `.dmg` -> **Open** -> click **Open** again in the dialog. Alternatively, go to System Settings -> Privacy & Security and click **Open Anyway** after the first blocked attempt.

Clipcat also requires **Accessibility** permission to simulate paste (Cmd+V). Grant it under System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility.

**Linux**

Make the binary executable before running:

```bash
chmod +x Clipcat-linux-amd64
./Clipcat-linux-amd64
```

If you're running the standalone binary, install these two libraries first - without them Clipcat won't open:

```bash
sudo apt install libgtk-4-1 libwebkitgtk-6.0-4
```

(Package names may look slightly different outside Debian/Ubuntu - search your distro's package manager for `gtk4` and `webkitgtk-6.0`.) The `.deb` package below installs these for you automatically.

Requires `xdotool` at runtime for window focus and paste simulation:

```bash
sudo apt install xdotool
```

Clipcat bundles its own clipboard monitoring - XFixes extension on X11 (event-driven) and wl-clipboard on Wayland (polling).

If you're on **Wayland** (e.g. COSMIC, GNOME on Wayland), also install:
```bash
sudo apt install wl-clipboard
```

## Features

- **Automatic Capture** - Saves everything you copy (text and images) the moment it hits your clipboard, with no setup needed

- **Pin Important Clips** - Keep your most-used clips at the top, protected from being pushed out when the storage limit is reached
- **Fast Search** - Filter everything instantly with `Ctrl+F`
- **Command Palette** - Press `Ctrl+K` or `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open a searchable list of quick actions, so you can toggle features without reaching for the mouse
- <img width="1911" height="1016" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41338104-c3a3-4c1d-9db6-42dd7901f35f" />

- **Paste Into Any Window** - Click the paste button on any clip and it fires directly into whatever window you were using before opening Clipcat. No manual Ctrl+V needed
- **Quick Paste Mode** - Hide Clipcat to the tray, press `Ctrl+Shift+V` from anywhere to summon it, pick a clip, and it pastes straight in - then vanishes. Enabling Quick Paste also automatically turns on Mini Clip mode
- **Edit Clips** - Fix typos or update content in any saved clip without re-copying
- **Manual Clip Creation** - Add clips directly from the app, optionally pinned from the start
- <img width="1917" height="1017" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/311f03f6-5e77-4a29-b3cd-73e6b85be890" />

- **Privacy Mode** - Instantly blur all clip content for screen sharing or shoulder-surfing situations; toggle with `Alt+H`
- <img width="1918" height="1017" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7989e737-d9b9-4b1d-a008-9fd2ad3fd079" />

- **Blocked Apps** - Add any app's process name to a blocklist so its clipboard activity is never captured. Clipcat ships with common password managers pre-blocked (1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass, KeePass/KeePassXC, Dashlane, NordPass, Enpass, RoboForm). Any default can be removed from Settings - Privacy -> Blocked Apps if you'd prefer Clipcat to capture from that app
- **Pause Capture** - Temporarily stop recording clipboard changes without closing the app
- **Bulk Delete** - Clear all clips, only pinned, or only unpinned in one click - always with a confirmation prompt
- **Mini Clip Mode** - Compact window that stays out of your way and stays always on top; toggle with `Alt+M`. State persists between sessions. Enables Always on Top automatically.
- **Quick Paste Toolbar Button** - A Quick Paste button lives in the toolbar next to Search and Sensitive, so you can toggle it in one click from any mode.
- **Smart Position** - When Quick Paste summons the window, it pops up right next to your cursor so you never have to hunt for it. Always stays fully on-screen, even on multi-monitor setups. Toggle in Settings -> Window (on by default)
- **System Tray** - Lives in your tray. Click the icon once to show or hide Clipcat, or right-click it for Quick Paste, Pause Capture, and Quit
- **LAN Sync** - Sync your clipboard to other devices on the same local network with end-to-end encryption; configure in Settings -> Network
- **Startup Support** - Optionally launch Clipcat on system startup
- **Clickable Links** - URLs in clips are automatically detected and open in your browser with a click
- <img width="1912" height="1011" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/531f4334-b857-437c-99e5-5907c495fb48" />

- **Relative Timestamps** - Clips show live-updating times like "2 minutes ago" or "yesterday"
- **Sound Effects** - Plays a short sound for each action; toggle with `Alt+S`
- **Configurable Storage Limit** - Choose how many clips to keep (100-500); pinned clips are always preserved
- **Labels** - Tag any clip with a custom label to categorize and organize your history
- **Label Filters** - Filter your clipboard history by label with one click using the filter bar above your clips
- <img width="1918" height="1012" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cacae71-6e17-4062-9a2a-725ee3307ab7" />

- **Auto-hide Sensitive Clips** - Automatically detects and hides clips that look like passwords, API keys, tokens, JWTs, private keys, and other credentials, using pattern matching and entropy analysis. A **Sensitive** button appears in the toolbar while anything is hidden, and the shield button on a card marks that clip safe. Toggle this on or off in Settings

- **Unique Paper Aesthetic** - Hand-drawn notebook-style UI with GSAP animations and a paper curtain reveal on launch

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut              | Action                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl + Shift + V`    | Summon Clipcat from any application (system-wide) |
| `⌘ + Shift + V`       | Summon Clipcat on macOS                           |
| `Ctrl + F`            | Focus the search bar (opens the bar in Mini Clip mode) |
| `Ctrl + K`            | Open the command palette                          |
| `↓` / `↑`             | Move through clips (Mini Clip / Quick Paste)      |
| `Enter`               | Paste the selected clip (Mini Clip / Quick Paste) |
| `Esc`                 | Close the search bar, or clear the selection      |
| `Alt + M`             | Toggle Mini Clip mode                             |
| `Alt + H`             | Toggle Privacy Mode                               |
| `Alt + S`             | Toggle sound effects                              |

On macOS the search shortcut is `Ctrl + F` rather than `⌘ + F`. The command palette accepts either, so `⌘ + K` works too.
