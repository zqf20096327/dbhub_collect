**Invite-only 3D print requests for a small office.** One person owns the
printer. Everyone else uploads a model, says what they are hoping for, and
follows it through the print stages on a board — instead of asking in a
corridor and then wondering.

Self-hosted, Docker Compose, no accounts anywhere but your own machine. Five
people and one printer is the size it is built for, and it is honest about
that: there is no multi-tenancy, no billing, and no queue theory.

## What it looks like

| The rail — every request as a ticket, scoped to who may see it |
| :-- |
| ![The backlog board](docs/screenshots/board.png) |

| A ticket, with the actual uploaded geometry | The printer owner's queue |
| :-- | :-- |
| ![Story detail with the 3D viewer](docs/screenshots/story.png) | ![The admin queue](docs/screenshots/queue.png) |

## What it does

- **Invite-only.** There is no public sign-up. A `User` row cannot come into
  existence without a pending invitation, enforced in a single hook that every
  authentication method goes through.
- **Upload a model** — `.stl` or `.3mf`, validated against its actual bytes
  rather than its filename, measured for its bounding box, stored in object
  storage and never in the web root.
- **Follow it on a board** — Requested → Accepted → Printing → Delivery, one
  step at a time, forwards only. Or Declined, with a reason. Marking it **Done**
  takes it off the board while keeping it in *My orders*, so the rail carries
  only what is still moving.
- **Withdraw your own request** any time before it reaches the bed — while it
  is Requested, Accepted or Declined, but not once it is Printing. The ticket,
  the conversation and the uploaded file go with it. Plans change; unwanted
  prints waste filament.
- **Print an old request again** — re-queue any past ticket of yours (a test
  print that worked, a declined one you have fixed) as a fresh request, without
  hunting down and re-uploading the file. The model is copied server-side, so
  the two tickets own independent files.
- **Note print settings** — an optional free-text field on a request for the
  slicer specifics that come with some files (layer height, infill, supports,
  temperatures). The printer owner sees them on the ticket, so they do not
  become a back-and-forth, and a re-print keeps them.
- **Browse your history** — a dedicated `/history` view of the prints that have
  left the rail (delivered, done, declined), filterable by status, material and
  when, with **Print again** on every row. It is where you go to re-run an old
  job.
- **Talk on the ticket** — a conversation thread per request, so "can you do it
  in teal" lives with the model rather than in a chat app.
- **Owner-managed benefits** — the "what's in it for you" tips are the printer
  owner's to define at `/admin/benefits`, and the ones they mark *preferred* are
  starred on the upload form so people know what the owner actually wants. Editing
  or retiring a benefit never rewrites a past request's tip.
- **Revoke access when someone leaves** — suspends the account, signs them out
  everywhere and refuses new sign-ins, while keeping their tickets, comments
  and history. Reversible, and audited.
- **See the actual geometry** — the uploaded mesh rendered in the browser,
  auto-framed, drag to rotate.
- **An audit trail** of everything that changes who can get in or what happens
  to someone's model, readable at `/admin/audit`, never edited or deleted.
- **Ask for features, triaged like the backlog** — a parallel "frr" board at
  `/frr` where anyone files a feature request (title, priority, category) and
  the owner moves it through the same stages, conversation, notifications and
  audit trail a print goes through. Its own tables; the print flow is untouched.
  See **[Feature requests](docs/feature-requests.md)**.
- **Drive it over HTTP** — every ticket, transition, comment and notification
  is a JSON endpoint, described by an OpenAPI 3.1 document and callable from a
  Swagger console at `/docs`. Same session, same scope, same audit trail as the
  UI; the rules live in one place, so the API cannot enforce less than the
  board does. See **[the API](docs/api.md)**.
- **Open a model straight in PrusaSlicer** — one click on a ticket hands the
  model to a slicer running on your own machine. A small helper the printer
  owner installs once does the fetch, because PrusaSlicer's own deep link
  refuses any host but Printables. The link carries its own short-lived
  credential, so nothing secret sits in the helper's config.
  See **[Open in PrusaSlicer](docs/prusaslicer.md)**.
- **Or just take the file** — a plain download on every ticket, for a machine
  without the helper, a phone, or a slicer that is not PrusaSlicer. Same
  permissions as the ticket, and recorded when the bytes go to somebody other
  than the person who uploaded them.

## Requirements

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Host | anything that runs Docker Compose — a NAS, a Pi 5, a VPS, a spare laptop |
| Memory | ~1 GB for the whole stack (app, Postgres, MinIO) |
| Disk | small — the database is megabytes; uploads are capped at 250 MB each |
| TLS | **required.** The app refuses to start on plain `http://` in production, and passkeys need a secure context |
| Mail | **optional.** Nothing needs it — see [Mail is optional](docs/authentication.md#mail-is-optional--genuinely) |

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danileau/prettypleaseprint.git && cd prettypleaseprint
cp .env.docker.example .env.docker
```

Edit `.env.docker` — at minimum generate the three secrets and set your
hostname and admin:

```bash
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
DB_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -hex 24)"
S3_SECRET_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 24)"
APP_URL="https://print.example.org"
PASSKEY_RP_ID="print.example.org"
ADMIN_EMAIL="you@example.org"
ADMIN_NAME="Your Name"
```

Then bring it up. This build-from-source variant publishes ports and catches
mail locally, which is what you want for a first look:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.docker \
  -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml \
  -f docker-compose.test.yml --profile mailcatcher up -d --build
```

The migrator prints a **one-use link** for the admin to choose a username and
a password. Read it, and open it within thirty minutes:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.docker -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs migrate
```

Then invite the office from `/admin/invites`. For a real deployment behind a
reverse proxy, see **[docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md)**.

> There is deliberately no `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. A password in an env file is also
> in `docker inspect`, in the shell history that wrote it, and in every backup
> of the host — still valid months later. A link that expires in half an hour
> is a smaller thing to leak.

## Configuration

Everything is environment variables, read from `.env.docker`. The full file
with commentary is [`.env.docker.example`](.env.docker.example).

| Variable | Required | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | **yes** | Signs session cookies. `openssl rand -base64 32`. Losing it invalidates every session. |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | **yes** | Postgres password. Baked into the data directory on first start — see [Restore](#restore). |
| `S3_SECRET_KEY` | **yes** | MinIO root password. |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY` | | MinIO root user. Default `ppp`. |
| `S3_BUCKET` | | Default `ppp-models`. |
| `APP_URL` | **yes** | The origin the browser sees, including scheme. Cookies, invitation links and the WebAuthn relying party derive from it. Must be `https://` in production. |
| `PASSKEY_RP_ID` | **yes** | Registrable domain, no scheme or port. **Permanent** — changing it kills every enrolled passkey. |
| `PASSKEY_RP_NAME` | | Shown in the browser's passkey prompt. |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_NAME` | **yes** | The single admin, created on first start. |
| `DATA_ROOT` | | Where the database and uploads live on disk. Default `./data`. |
| `SMTP_URL` | | SMTP transport. **Leave unset and the app still works** — links are shown to the admin to hand over. |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | | Alternative to `SMTP_URL`; takes precedence. |
| `MAIL_FROM` | | Envelope sender. |
| `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` | | Which header carries the client address: `false` (trust nothing, the default), `true` (left-most `X-Forwarded-For`), or `cloudflare` (`CF-Connecting-IP`). See [the reasoning](docs/deployment.md#why-trust_proxy_headers-is-a-separate-switch). |
| `HIBP_DISABLED` | | `true` disables the breach check. Only for a host with no outbound internet — it fails closed, so without it nobody could register. |
| `SOURCE_URL` | | Where this instance's source lives, shown in the footer. **Change it if you modify the code** — see [Licence](#licence). Defaults to the upstream repository. |
| `PPP_REGISTRY` / `PPP_TAG` | | Which published image to run. Pin `PPP_TAG` to a release (`v0.1.0`) or a commit SHA; either is also how you roll back. |

## Deploying

The short version: pull a published image, put a reverse proxy in front, point
`DATA_ROOT` at real storage.

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.docker \
  -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f docker-compose.proxy.yml up -d
```

`docker-compose.prod.yml` **consumes** images rather than building them, so a
deployment needs no source tree and no toolchain, and what runs there is
byte-for-byte what CI tested and signed. It publishes **no host ports at all** —
each overlay adds only what its context needs.

Every merge to `main` publishes images tagged with the commit SHA and `latest`;
every `v*` tag publishes that same commit under its version. Pin `PPP_TAG` to a
release if you want to move deliberately, or to a SHA if you want to follow
`main` closely.

The images are named `ppp-app` and `ppp-migrate` — after the project's old
short name, kept deliberately because they are a deployment interface. Renaming
them would break every pinned `PPP_TAG` in exchange for nothing.

The images are **public**, so a deployment needs no registry credential at all.
`scripts/deploy-wizard.sh` reflects that: run it without a token and it lists
releases, which is the right menu for most deployments; give it a
`read:packages` token and it lists every published image including SHA builds.
That token is optional, is never stored, and is only needed because GitHub
gates the package *listing* API even for public packages.

`scripts/deploy-wizard.sh` is the way to move between versions: it lists what is
published, cosign-verifies before swapping, health-checks after, and rolls back
on its own if the new image does not come good. See
**[docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md)**.

## Backup and restore

### Back up

Everything that matters is under `DATA_ROOT` plus one file:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `$DATA_ROOT/db/` | Postgres — accounts, tickets, comments, the audit trail |
| `$DATA_ROOT/models/` | the uploaded `.stl` / `.3mf` files |
| `.env.docker` | the secrets. **Not** under `DATA_ROOT`, and not in the repo. |

On ZFS, one recursive snapshot of the parent dataset captures all three:

```bash
zfs snapshot -r storage/applications/ppp@$(date +%F)
```

That snapshot is *crash-consistent*, not clean — Postgres replays its WAL on
start and recovers, which is fine and is what it is designed for.

**Without ZFS, do the file copy from inside a container.** The Postgres data
directory is mode `700` owned by uid `70`, so a `tar` or `cp -a` as your own
user cannot even read it, and one run with `sudo` that loses ownership produces
an archive Postgres will refuse to start from:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.docker -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
docker run --rm -v "$DATA_ROOT:/data:ro" -v "$PWD:/backup" alpine \
  tar czf /backup/ppp-$(date +%F).tgz -C /data .
```

Either way, take a logical dump alongside it — it restores into *any* Postgres,
not only back onto this data directory, and it needs no root:

```bash
docker exec ppp-db pg_dump -U ppp -Fc ppp > ppp-$(date +%F).dump
```

### Restore

```bash
# 1. stop the stack — never restore under a running Postgres
docker compose --env-file .env.docker -f docker-compose.prod.yml down

# 2. put the data back (ZFS rollback, or extract the archive)
zfs rollback storage/applications/ppp/data/db@2026-08-23
zfs rollback storage/applications/ppp/data/models@2026-08-23
#   without ZFS, from the container-made archive:
#   docker run --rm -v "$DATA_ROOT:/data" -v "$PWD:/backup:ro" alpine \
#     sh -c 'rm -rf /data/db /data/models && tar xzf /backup/ppp-2026-08-23.tgz -C /data'

# 3. bring it up; the migrator applies any pending migrations
docker compose --env-file .env.docker -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
docker compose --env-file .env.docker -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
```

Restoring from a logical dump instead, onto a running stack:

```bash
docker exec -i ppp-db pg_restore -U ppp -d ppp --clean --if-exists < ppp-2026-08-23.dump
```

### When it goes wrong

Both of these were confirmed by actually doing it, not by reasoning about it.

**`DB_PASSWORD` must be the one the restored data was created with.** Postgres
stores the password inside the data directory and ignores `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
once that directory exists. Get it wrong and the symptoms point everywhere
except the cause:

| what you see | |
| --- | --- |
| `ppp-db` | **healthy** — this is the misleading part |
| `ppp-app` | never starts, so it logs nothing at all |
| `ppp-migrate` | `Error: P1000: Authentication failed against database server` |

So look in the **migrator's** logs, which is the one place nobody thinks to
check because it is the container that is supposed to exit:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.docker -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs migrate
```

Nothing is damaged by getting this wrong — the wrong password is refused, not
destructive. Put the right one back and everything returns. This is the main
reason `.env.docker` belongs in the backup.

**`BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` is not recoverable, and costs one sign-in.** Restore
without it and every existing session cookie stops validating — a held cookie
goes from `200` to a `307` back to the sign-in page. Nobody is locked out:
passwords and passkeys are untouched, and everyone simply signs in again.

## Troubleshooting

**502 from the reverse proxy, nothing in the app's logs.**
The proxy cannot reach the container. If you route by container name over a
shared Docker network, check both are still on it — updating a proxy that is
itself a managed app recreates its container and silently drops the
attachment:

```bash
docker network inspect npm-proxy --format '{{range .Containers}}{{.Name}} {{end}}'
docker run --rm --network npm-proxy curlimages/curl -sS -m 5 http://ppp-app:3000/api/health
```

**`unauthorized` when pulling the images.**
The published images are public, so this should not happen — check the tag
exists before assuming it is an auth problem:

```bash
docker manifest inspect ghcr.io/danileau/ppp-app:v0.1.0
```

On a **fork** with private packages you do need a credential, and it must be a
*classic* token with **`read:packages`** and nothing else — that scope is
nested under `write:packages` in the checkbox list, which is easy to scroll
past. Fine-grained tokens do not work with ghcr.io at all. Check what yours
carries:

```bash
curl -sSI -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user | grep -i x-oauth-scopes
```

**The certificate will not issue.**
ACME HTTP-01 validation goes to whatever the public DNS record points at. If
that is still your web host rather than your proxy, the challenge is answered
by the wrong machine and nothing you change locally will help. Check where the
name actually resolves, and what answers there:

```bash
dig +short your.host.example
curl -sS -D - "http://your.host.example/.well-known/acme-challenge/probe" | head -5
```

Behind Cloudflare's proxy, visitors see Cloudflare's certificate regardless, so
an **Origin Certificate** plus SSL mode *Full (strict)* removes ACME from the
picture entirely.

**Audit rows have no IP address.**
`TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` is unset or `false`, so nothing is trusted. Behind
Cloudflare set it to `cloudflare` — not `true`, because Cloudflare *appends* to
`X-Forwarded-For` and the left-most entry there is whatever the client sent.
Behind a proxy that replaces the header, `true`. Set either only if the app
cannot be reached without going through that proxy.

**The bootstrap link expired.**
Re-run the migrator; it prints a fresh one, and keeps doing so until a password
is actually set. It never resets an existing password.

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.docker -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d migrate
docker compose --env-file .env.docker -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs migrate
```

**Nobody can register, and the error mentions a breach check.**
The password check calls `api.pwnedpasswords.com` and fails closed. If the host
has no outbound internet, set `HIBP_DISABLED=true` — and only then.

## Security

Invite-only enforced in one hook across every authentication method. Passwords
are ≥10 characters and refused if they appear in a known breach corpus.
Authorisation answers **404, not 403**, for a resource you may not see — a 403
confirms it exists. CSP carries a per-request nonce. Every access and content
change is audited.

Session cookies are `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` and `__Secure-` prefixed, with
cookie caching deliberately off so sign-out is immediate. A session is worth
**twenty idle minutes**, not a month: the window used to renew itself on every
visit, which meant a captured cookie on a shared desk was good more or less
indefinitely. Twenty minutes is only humane because passkeys are here, and
signing back in is a touch.

Shortening it limits how long a stolen cookie is useful but not whether it is
useful *now*, so the four actions that outlive a session — inviting somebody,
re-sending an invitation, minting a password-reset link, revoking or restoring
access — ask for the passkey or the password again if the current sign-in is
more than five minutes old. That is the one control on the list a copied cookie
cannot satisfy.

The full assessment, including what was found and fixed and what is knowingly
accepted, is in [docs/security-audit.md](docs/security-audit.md). To report
something, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. The eight verification suites in
`scripts/` are the contract — `npm run verify:auth`, `verify:upload`,
`verify:queue`, `verify:models`, `verify:passkey` and `probe:security` all run
in CI against the built container image, not a dev server. If a change makes
one fail, that is the change talking.

See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) to get set up.

## Licence

[AGPL-3.0-or-later](LICENSE). Self-host it, fork it, change it, run it for your
office — all of that is yes, and free.

The app carries a **Source · AGPL-3.0** link in its footer. That is section 13
made real: if you modify the code, point `SOURCE_URL` at your own repository.
Leaving it aimed at upstream is worse than removing it, because it looks like
compliance while offering source that is not what is running.

The one condition is the point of the licence: **if you modify it and let people
use your version over a network, you have to offer them your source.** Not a
courtesy, a term. It covers the case a plain GPL misses — running a modified
version as a service without ever distributing a copy — which is exactly how
web software gets taken private.

What that does and does not mean:

- **Running it unmodified obliges you to nothing.** Deploy it for your office,
  never touch the code, and there is nothing to publish and nobody to tell.
- **Modify it and let others use it, and those users can ask for your source.**
  Note *others* includes your own colleagues — §13 counts anyone interacting
  over a network, not just paying customers. In practice that is easy: point
  them at your fork.
- **Selling it is allowed.** No open source licence forbids commercial use, and
  this one does not either. Sell support, sell hosting, sell it outright — your
  users just get the source too.
- **Modification nobody else touches is unconstrained.** Hack on it locally, on
  your own, forever, and the clause never bites.

The asymmetry is deliberate: the licence asks for reciprocity from those who
benefit publicly, and nothing from those who merely use it.

If your organisation's policy forbids AGPL software — some do, blanket-style —
you are welcome to ask about other terms.

Built from the design handoff in `Pretty Please Print/`, which is why story refs
read `PPP-104` and the copy sounds like a diner.
