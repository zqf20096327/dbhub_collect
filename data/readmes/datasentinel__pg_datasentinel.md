# pg_datasentinel

`pg_datasentinel` is a PostgreSQL extension that adds observability views.  

It enriches `pg_stat_activity` with per-backend memory and temporary file usage (linux only), captures vacuum, analyze, temporary file, and checkpoint events into shared-memory ring buffers, estimates XID and MXID wraparound risk with rate-based ETAs, and reports container CPU and memory limits via cgroups.  

It must be loaded via `shared_preload_libraries`.

---

## Features

- **`ds_stat_activity`** — extends `pg_stat_activity` with real-time memory usage (resident set size from `/proc`), live temporary file bytes, and (PostgreSQL 18+) the current plan ID for each backend.
- **`ds_container_resources`** — single-row view that reports cgroup v1/v2 CPU quota, memory hard limit, current memory usage, and CPU pressure (PSI avg60, cgroup v2 only) for the PostgreSQL process. Useful when PostgreSQL runs inside a container (Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift) where resource limits are enforced via cgroups.
- **`ds_wraparound_risk`** — single-row view that samples XID and MXID at each checkpoint (at most once per hour) and provides live distances to the aggressive-vacuum and wraparound limits for both XID and MXID, plus rate-based ETAs that reflect whichever counter is closer to danger.
- **`ds_vacuum_activity`** — captures autovacuum `LOG` messages and manual `VACUUM INFO` messages in a shared-memory ring buffer; parses page/tuple counters, CPU timings, whether the run was aggressive, and whether it was triggered manually.
- **`ds_analyze_activity`** — captures autoanalyze `LOG` messages and manual `ANALYZE INFO` messages in a shared-memory ring buffer; parses sample block and extended-statistics counters, and whether the run was triggered automatically.
- **`ds_tempfile_activity`** — captures every `log_temp_files` `LOG` message with file size and role information in a shared-memory ring buffer.
- **`ds_checkpoint_activity`** — captures every checkpoint and restartpoint completion with detailed I/O and sync timings, reading metrics directly from PostgreSQL shared memory rather than parsing log text.
- **`ds_xid_snapshots`** — raw hourly XID/MXID snapshot ring buffer used to compute rates in `ds_wraparound_risk`; available for custom trending or external alerting.
- **`ds_activity_summary`** — single-row dashboard view with entry count, oldest timestamp, and latest timestamp for each of the four ring buffers (vacuum, analyze, temp files, checkpoints).

## Requirements

- PostgreSQL 15 or later
- `pg_config` accessible on `PATH`

---

## Build and Install

```bash
make
sudo make install
```

---

## Configuration

### `postgresql.conf`

Add the extension to `shared_preload_libraries` — this is **required**:

```
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_datasentinel'
```

To capture Autovacuum and autoanalyze events

```
# Log every autovacuum and autoanalyze operation.
# Set to 0 to log all runs, or to a positive value to log only operations exceeding the specified threshold.
log_autovacuum_min_duration = 0   
```

To capture temporary file events:

```
log_temp_files = 0                # log every temporary file creation
```

Log checkpoints (default is on) 
```
log_checkpoints = on
```

### GUC parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pg_datasentinel.enabled` | bool | on | Enable or disable log message capture at runtime. |
| `pg_datasentinel.max_entries` | int | 1000 | Capacity of each ring buffer (vacuum, analyze, temp files, checkpoints). When full, the oldest entry is overwritten. Requires a server restart. The XID snapshot buffer is fixed at 504 entries (~21 days at one snapshot per hour). |
| `pg_datasentinel.maintenance_force_verbose` | bool | off | When `on`, automatically adds `VERBOSE` to every manual `VACUUM` and `ANALYZE` command so that their output is captured in the ring buffers alongside autovacuum/autoanalyze entries. |
| `pg_datasentinel.ignore_system_schemas` | bool | on | When `on`, silently skips vacuum and analyze log entries for `pg_catalog` and `information_schema`. Reduces noise in the ring buffers from system-table maintenance. |
| `pg_datasentinel.enable_pss_memory` | bool | off | When `on`, also computes PSS (Proportional Set Size) memory per backend by reading /proc//smaps_rollup once per backend. More accurate than RSS, but can be expensive if hundreds of backends. Displayed in the `ds_stat_activity` view. |

### postgresql.conf example

```
# Load the extension
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_datasentinel'

# Capture every autovacuum and autoanalyze run
log_autovacuum_min_duration = 0

# Capture every temporary file creation
log_temp_files = 0

# Checkpoints
log_checkpoints = on

# pg_datasentinel settings
pg_datasentinel.enabled                   = on
pg_datasentinel.max_entries               = 1000
pg_datasentinel.maintenance_force_verbose = off
pg_datasentinel.ignore_system_schemas     = on
pg_datasentinel.enable_pss_memory        = off
```

## Create the Extension

After loading the library and restarting PostgreSQL, create the extension in `postgres` database:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_datasentinel;
```

---

## Views

### ds_stat_activity

Extends `pg_stat_activity` with additional columns populated from `/proc/<pid>/statm`, `/proc/<pid>/smaps_rollup`, and `/proc/<pid>/fd/`.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| *(all pg_stat_activity columns)* | | |
| `rss_memory_bytes` | int8 | Resident set size of the backend process in bytes. `NULL` if `/proc` is not accessible. |
| `pss_memory_bytes` | int8 | Proportional set size of the backend process in bytes. Only populated when `pg_datasentinel.enable_pss_memory = on`. `NULL` otherwise or if `/proc` is not accessible. |
| `temp_bytes` | int8 | Total bytes used by PostgreSQL temporary files currently open by the backend. `NULL` if `/proc` is not accessible. |
| `plan_id` | int8 | Current plan identifier (PostgreSQL 18+ only; `NULL` on earlier versions). |

```sql
SELECT pid, usename, state, rss_memory_bytes, pss_memory_bytes, temp_bytes
FROM ds_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'active';
```

**PostgreSQL 18+** 

When used alongside the [`pg_store_plans extension (fork)`](https://github.com/datasentinel/pg_store_plans) , `plan_id` makes it straightforward to display the execution plan currently running in each active backend. Join on `dbid`, `userid`, and `planid`:

```sql
SELECT
    a.pid,
    a.usename,
    a.state,
    a.query,
    p.plan
FROM ds_stat_activity a
JOIN pg_store_plans p
    ON p.dbid   = a.datid
   AND p.userid = a.usesysid
   AND p.planid = a.plan_id
WHERE a.state = 'active'
  AND a.plan_id IS NOT NULL;
```

---

### ds_container_resources

A single-row view that reports cgroup resource limits and current usage for the PostgreSQL process. Useful when PostgreSQL runs inside a container (Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift) where CPU and memory limits are enforced via cgroups. Columns are `NULL` when the corresponding limit is not set, the cgroup file is absent, or the system is not running under cgroups. Supports both cgroup v1 and cgroup v2.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `cpu_limit` | float8 | Hard CPU quota in fractional CPUs (e.g. `2.0` = 2 vCPUs). `NULL` if unlimited. |
| `cpu_pressure_pct_60s` | float8 | CPU pressure (PSI `some avg60`, 0–100%). `NULL` on cgroup v1 or kernels without PSI support. |
| `mem_limit_bytes` | int8 | Hard memory limit in bytes. `NULL` if unlimited. |
| `mem_used_bytes` | int8 | Current memory usage in bytes (`memory.current` on cgroup v2, `memory.usage_in_bytes` on cgroup v1). |
| `cgroup_version` | int4 | Cgroup version in use (`1` or `2`). `NULL` if not running under cgroups. |

```sql
SELECT
    cgroup_version,
    cpu_limit,
    cpu_pressure_pct_60s,
    pg_size_pretty(mem_limit_bytes) AS memory_limit,
    pg_size_pretty(mem_used_bytes)  AS memory_used
FROM ds_container_resources;
```

---

### ds_wraparound_risk

Always returns **one row**. Estimates XID and MXID wraparound risk by combining live distances to the aggressive-vacuum and wraparound limits (read from PostgreSQL shared memory) with consumption rates derived from hourly snapshots stored in `ds_xid_snapshots`.

Snapshots are taken at each checkpoint, but no more than once per hour. The `eta_*` columns reflect the minimum across XID and MXID, so a single value always signals the nearest danger regardless of which counter is the bottleneck.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `eta_aggressive_vacuum_fmt` | text | Human-readable ETA until aggressive vacuuming begins (e.g. `"2d 3h 15m 0s"`). `NULL` if fewer than 2 snapshots. |
| `eta_wraparound_fmt` | text | Human-readable ETA until wraparound. `NULL` if fewer than 2 snapshots. |
| `datname` | text | Name of the database closest to the wraparound limit (whichever of XID or MXID is nearer). |
| `txid_rate_per_sec` | float8 | Estimated XID consumption rate (XIDs/second). `NULL` if fewer than 2 snapshots. |
| `mxid_rate_per_sec` | float8 | Estimated MXID consumption rate (MXIDs/second). `NULL` if fewer than 2 snapshots. |
| `snapshot_count` | int4 | Number of XID/MXID snapshots currently stored. |
| `oldest_snapshot_at` | timestamptz | Timestamp of the oldest stored snapshot. |
| `newest_snapshot_at` | timestamptz | Timestamp of the most recent stored snapshot. |
| `snapshot_interval` | text | Human-readable time span between the oldest and newest snapshot (e.g. `"21d 4h 0m 0s"`). `NULL` if fewer than 2 snapshots. |
| `xids_to_aggressive_vacuum` | int8 | XIDs remaining before autovacuum starts aggressive freezing. Live. |
| `xids_to_wraparound` | int8 | XIDs remaining before XID wraparound. Live. |
| `mxids_to_aggressive_vacuum` | int8 | MXIDs remaining before autovacuum starts aggressive MXID freezing. Live. |
| `mxids_to_wraparound` | int8 | MXIDs remaining before MXID wraparound. Live. |
| `eta_aggressive_vacuum` | interval | Raw interval ETA until aggressive vacuuming — minimum of XID and MXID ETAs. `NULL` if fewer than 2 snapshots. |
| `eta_wraparound` | interval | Raw interval ETA until wraparound — minimum of XID and MXID ETAs. `NULL` if fewer than 2 snapshots. |

```sql
SELECT
    eta_aggressive_vacuum_fmt,
    eta_wraparound_fmt,
    datname,
    snapshot_count,
    snapshot_interval,
    xids_to_aggressive_vacuum, xids_to_wraparound,
    mxids_to_aggressive_vacuum, mxids_to_wraparound
FROM ds_wraparound_risk;
```

### ds_xid_snapshots

Ring buffer of up to 504 hourly XID/MXID snapshots (approximately 21 days of history at one snapshot per hour) used to compute the rates shown in `ds_wraparound_risk`. Available directly for custom trending or external alerting.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `seq` | int4 | Ordinal position in the buffer (1 = oldest). |
| `logged_at` | timestamptz | Wall-clock time the snapshot was taken. |
| `next_xid` | int8 | Next full transaction ID (epoch-aware) at the time of the snapshot. |
| `next_mxid` | int8 | Next multixact ID at the time of the snapshot. |
| `oldest_xid_db` | oid | OID of the database holding the oldest unfrozen XID. |
| `txid_rate_per_sec` | float8 | XID consumption rate since the previous snapshot (XIDs/second). `NULL` for the first snapshot. |
| `mxid_rate_per_sec` | float8 | MXID consumption rate since the previous snapshot (MXIDs/second). `NULL` for the first snapshot. |

```sql
SELECT seq, logged_at, next_xid, next_mxid, txid_rate_per_sec, mxid_rate_per_sec
FROM ds_xid_snapshots
ORDER BY seq;
```

---

### ds_vacuum_activity

| `is_automatic` | bool | `true` if triggered by autovacuum; `false` if triggered by a manual `VACUUM` command. |
| `message` | text | Full raw log message text. |

```sql
-- Recent vacuum runs, slowest first
SELECT logged_at, schemaname, relname, elapsed, tuples_removed, is_aggressive, is_automatic

SELECT ds_vacuum_activity_reset();
```

---

### ds_analyze_activity

A ring buffer of the last `pg_datasentinel.max_entries` analyze messages (both autoanalyze LOG messages and manual ANALYZE INFO messages). Parsing relies on English keywords and does not work if the server runs with a translated message locale.

SELECT logged_at, schemaname, relname, elapsed, is_automatic
FROM ds_analyze_activity
ORDER BY logged_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

SELECT ds_analyze_activity_reset();
```

---

### ds_tempfile_activity

A ring buffer of the last `pg_datasentinel.max_entries` temporary-file LOG messages (emitted by PostgreSQL when `log_temp_files` is set).

| `seq` | int4 | Ordinal position in the buffer (1 = oldest). |
| `logged_at` | timestamptz | Wall-clock time the checkpoint completed. |
| `is_restartpoint` | bool | `true` for a restartpoint, `false` for a regular checkpoint. |

## Utility Functions

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `ds_vacuum_activity_reset()` | Clear the vacuum ring buffer. |
| `ds_analyze_activity_reset()` | Clear the analyze ring buffer. |
| `ds_tempfile_activity_reset()` | Clear the temporary-file ring buffer. |
| `ds_checkpoint_activity_reset()` | Clear the checkpoint ring buffer. |
| `ds_xid_snapshots_reset()` | Clear the XID snapshot ring buffer. |
| `ds_activity_reset_all()` | Clear all ring buffers at once (vacuum, analyze, temp files, checkpoints, XID snapshots). |

```sql
-- Clear all buffers
SELECT ds_activity_reset_all();
```

---

## Access Control

The extension creates a `ds_reader` role at install time (if it does not already exist) and grants `SELECT` on all views to it:

```sql
GRANT ds_reader TO monitoring_user;
```

This lets non-superuser accounts query all observability views without requiring additional `GRANT` statements.

---

## Testing

```bash
make installcheck
```

The `regress.conf` file used for the test cluster sets:

```
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_datasentinel'
log_autovacuum_min_duration = 0
autovacuum_naptime = 1s
```

The regression test sequence is: `init`, `vacuum`, `analyze`, `tempfiles`, `checkpoints`, `wraparound`, `manualanalyze`, `excludeInternalSchemas`, `fakelog`.

- `manualanalyze` — tests manual `ANALYZE VERBOSE` capture and the `maintenance_force_verbose` GUC.
- `excludeInternalSchemas` — tests that `ignore_system_schemas = on` suppresses `pg_catalog` entries from the ring buffers.
- `fakelog` — tests capture of synthetic log messages injected directly into the ring buffers.

### Unit tests for internal parsing functions

A test module exercises the C-level message-parsing functions (`pgds_parse_table_from_message`, `pgds_parse_vacuum_stats`, `pgds_parse_cpu_stats`) without requiring a live PostgreSQL cluster:

```bash
cd test
make
make installcheck
```

                                                                    (at most 1/hour)
                                                                          |
                                                                   XID snapshots
                                                                   ring buffer
```

Each ring buffer is a fixed-size circular array stored in PostgreSQL shared memory, protected by a dedicated LWLock. When the buffer is full, the oldest entry is silently overwritten so that the most recent `pg_datasentinel.max_entries` events are always retained.

No background worker is required.

### Memory overhead

The shared memory footprint scales linearly with `pg_datasentinel.max_entries`. The XID snapshot buffer is fixed at 504 entries (~21 days at one snapshot per hour) and does not scale with `max_entries`.

Measured with `SELECT name, pg_size_pretty(size) FROM pg_shmem_allocations WHERE name ~* 'pgds'`:

| max_entries | pgds_vacuum | pgds_analyze | pgds_tempfile | pgds_checkpoint | pgds_xid_snapshot | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 100 | 328 kB | 123 kB | 65 kB | 59 kB | 24 kB | ~600 kB |
| 1000 | 3.2 MB | 1.2 MB | 648 kB | 594 kB | 24 kB | ~5.6 MB |
