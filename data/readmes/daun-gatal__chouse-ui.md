## Overview

CHouse UI is the team operator's console for on-prem ClickHouse. Most tools nail one piece — a query workspace, a dashboard, an AI assistant, a cluster monitor; this is the **combination**: a team access layer (app-level **RBAC**, audit logging, and encrypted server-side credentials so the browser never sees a password), **multi-cluster fleet monitoring** with Slack/email alerts, and **Chouse AI** — an autonomous, read-only SRE that runs root-cause scans, optimizes queries and diagnoses errors right in the monitoring tabs, writes fixes with before→after `EXPLAIN` proof, and delivers RCA to Slack on a breach. Open-source and Apache 2.0 — so you never copy-paste an error into a chatbot or hunt for a rewrite; the diagnosis and the fix live next to the problem.

### Why CHouse UI?

CHouse UI provides security and access control features for teams that need:

| Feature | CHouse UI |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Credential Management** | Encrypted server-side storage (never in browser) |
| **Architecture** | Secure backend proxy (no direct browser-to-ClickHouse) |
| **Access Control** | Full RBAC with granular permissions |
| **Multi-Connection** | Manage multiple ClickHouse servers |
| **Audit Trail** | Audit logging |
| **Monitoring** | ClickHouse-native observability — query logs, memory breakdown, top-resource queries, replica lag, parts/merges, schema lints — no exporter required |
| **Fleet view** | Watch every cluster at once — one pane, per-card polling, status / memory / lag / exceptions, drill into any node |
| **Chouse AI (SRE)** | Autonomous read-only diagnostics — root-cause fleet scans with history + auto-RCA to Slack/email, plus in-tab query optimization (before→after `EXPLAIN`) and error/parts diagnosis |

---

- **Overview Dashboard** - System stats, recent queries, and quick actions (admin only)

### 🔬 Monitoring & Observability
- **Query logs** with five sub-views over `system.query_log`:
  - **Queries** — every execution as a dense table with sortable columns, SQL-keyword tooltip preview, memory-pressure flag (Flame ≥ 25 % / AlertTriangle ≥ 10 % cluster RAM), row checkboxes for side-by-side **Compare**, expanded-row drill-downs for **Profile events** and **Views triggered** (`system.query_views_log`)
  - **Patterns** — `normalizeQuery()` rollup with cumulative cost (Runs / Avg dur / **Total dur** / Max mem / Read rows / Read bytes), default sort Total dur DESC — finds the patterns hogging the most wall-clock time across all repetitions
  - **By table** — `arrayJoin(tables)` per-table rollup with `arrayFilter` push-down so busy clusters return in ~1 s
  - **By Redash** — groups every Redash-originated query by the `query_id` embedded in its leading SQL comment (`/* … query_id: NNNN … */`), so you can map cluster load back to the saved dashboard query. Runs / Min·Avg·Max·Total duration / Min·Max memory / read rows / read bytes, all sortable
  - **Histogram** — distribution of duration / memory / read rows / read bytes across the active window, with **p50 / p95 / p99** chips (p99 amber-tinted to flag the tail)
- **Query timeline chart** — stacked bar / stacked area / line variants, per `query_kind`
- **Custom time range** — 15 m / 1 h / 6 h / 24 h presets + a Grafana-style drill-down calendar (day → month → year) in one popover
- **Parts** — `system.part_log` stacked area chart of merges, mutations, downloads, removals + paginated event table
- **Schema advisor** — Nullable column + oversized integer linter over `system.parts_columns`, ranked by on-disk bytes (renamed from "Schema doctor" to disambiguate from the AI Fleet Doctor)
- **Cluster activity** — `system.mutations` + `system.replication_queue` with status chips, a blocked-task indicator strip (long queries / long merges / open mutations / max replica lag), and a per-replica status panel (`system.replicas` lag + queue depth)
- **Live queries** — running queries with **CPU time + thread count**, sortable by duration / memory / rows / CPU, and kill support. A server-memory pressure strip puts the per-query totals in context (resident / total %)
- **Metrics** — Overview / Performance / Storage / Merges / Errors / **Memory** / **CPU** / **ZooKeeper** / Network tabs:
  - **Memory** — server RAM breakdown (RSS attributed to active queries / caches / merges / primary keys / index, vs total), allocator history, and a top-memory-queries table
  - **CPU** — load avg / threads / pools, CPU mode-split + concurrency charts, and a top-CPU-queries table
  - **ZooKeeper** — Keeper transactions, traffic, and system-load time-series

### 🛰️ Fleet & Chouse AI
- **Fleet view** (`/fleet`) — every configured connection side by side, grid or row layout. Each card polls its own connection independently, so a slow/down cluster never blocks the grid. Status (healthy / degraded / down), memory %, active queries, longest-running, exceptions feed, inventory strip, per-node trend sparklines. Drill into any card → that cluster's monitoring.
- **Fleet poller** — a backend worker caches per-cluster metric snapshots to SQLite on a schedule (`FLEET_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`), so the fleet page reads one fast endpoint instead of every browser hammering every cluster. HA-safe via a single-instance advisory lease. Toggle with `FLEET_POLLER_ENABLED`.
- **Threshold alerts** — node memory %, per-query memory, and long-running-query rules with hysteresis to avoid flapping. Delivered as Slack Block Kit cards + email (SMTP), configured per install.
- **Chouse AI — Fleet Doctor** (`/doctor`) — an autonomous, **read-only** AI SRE. Scans the fleet with a guarded `query_node` tool (single `SELECT`, `system.*` only, ClickHouse `readonly=1`), pins root causes, and writes a structured report: per-node verdict, recommendations, evidence, and a heavy-query deep-dive. Reports persist with a history rail; scope (node subset) + time-window selectable. On an alert breach it can auto-run RCA and deliver the analysis to Slack/email. Advisory only — the AI never mutates the cluster.
- **Chouse AI in the monitoring tabs** — the same read-only engine surfaced where you're already looking, so you fix a problem without leaving the tab. **Optimize with Chouse AI** on a Query Logs row → an optimized rewrite with the same result, a before→after `EXPLAIN` estimate, and one click to **Open in Explorer**. **Fix** on a `system.errors` row → cause / impact / ordered solutions. **Diagnose** on a part-log row → part-health read (merge pressure, too many parts, partition key). Gated by `ai:optimize`; advisory only — review before running.
- **Errors** (`/errors`) — a viewer over `system.errors` + the crash log, searchable and paginated, so recurring server-side errors surface without ad-hoc SQL.

### 🎨 User Experience
- **Editorial design system** — ClickHouse-yellow accent, Geist Sans + Geist Mono typography, hairline borders
- **Light + dark themes** — full light theme with a warm-stone palette and amber-shifted brand, plus an **Auto** mode that switches by local time of day (light 06:00–18:00, dark otherwise). Every chart, table, and pill is theme-aware
- **Command palette** — ⌘/Ctrl+K opens RBAC-gated quick switcher (recent queries, pages, databases, tables, saved queries, actions, help)
- **Responsive** — works on desktop and tablet; container-query layouts adapt per component, not just per viewport
- **Connection Selector** - Quick server switching
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Power user support

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) v1.0+ (or Node.js 18+)
- A ClickHouse server (or use Docker Compose)

### Tested Compatibility

Successfully tested with:
- **ClickHouse**: Version 24.11 and 25 (monitoring suite verified end-to-end against a production 24.11 cluster)
- **PostgreSQL**: Version 18 (for RBAC database)
- **SQLite**: Version 3.51.0 (via Bun, for RBAC database)

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/daun-gatal/chouse-ui.git
cd chouse-ui

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development servers
bun run dev
```

This starts:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend**: http://localhost:5521

### Default Login

On first run, an admin user is created:
- **Email**: `admin@localhost`
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123!`

> ⚠️ **Change this password immediately in production!**

---

### Deployment (Docker)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/daun-gatal/chouse-ui.git
cd chouse-ui

# Run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

Access at http://localhost:5521

#### Production Deployment

For production, we recommend using an external highly-available PostgreSQL database for RBAC storage. See the [Configuration](#configuration) section for details on how to configure `RBAC_POSTGRES_URL`.

### Deployment (Kubernetes / Helm)

The production Helm chart is published to GHCR as a signed OCI artifact:

```bash
helm install chouse-ui oci://ghcr.io/daun-gatal/charts/chouse-ui \
  --set secrets.jwtSecret="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
  --set secrets.encryptionKey="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  --set secrets.encryptionSalt="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
```

The default install is single-replica SQLite on a PersistentVolumeClaim. For
HA, point the chart at PostgreSQL (`database.type=postgres`) and scale
`replicaCount` — the chart enforces the topology rules (SQLite cannot span
pods) at render time and sets `CHOUSE_HA` for you. See
[`charts/chouse-ui/README.md`](charts/chouse-ui/README.md) for all values,
the topology guide, SSO/config examples, and ingress notes.

### Deployment (MCP for AI agents)

AI agents can operate CHouse UI without the browser through an MCP endpoint on
a dedicated port (8752), authenticated with a personal access token. Disabled
by default; enable with `MCP_ENABLED=true` (Docker) or `mcp.enabled: true`
(Helm). Read-only unless the operator opts into writes; destructive tools
require in-host human approval. See [`docs/mcp.md`](docs/mcp.md) and
[ADR 0013](docs/adr/0013-chouse-mcp.md).

---

## Configuration

CHouse UI can be configured using environment variables (`.env` file) or through a grouped YAML configuration file.

### YAML Configuration (Recommended)

You can set all configuration options via a hierarchical YAML file. To use this, set the `CHOUSE_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable pointing to your YAML file:

```bash
CHOUSE_CONFIG_PATH=./config.yaml bun run packages/server/src/index.ts
```

Example (mirrors `.config.example.yaml`):
```yaml
port: 5521
node_env: production
rbac:
  db_type: sqlite           # or postgres
  sqlite_path: ./data/rbac.db
  encryption:
    key: ""                 # openssl rand -hex 32  (required)
    salt: ""                # openssl rand -hex 32  (required)
  admin:
    email: admin@localhost
    username: admin
    password: admin123!
jwt:
  secret: ""                # openssl rand -base64 32  (required)
  access_expiry: 4h
  refresh_expiry: 7d
```

### Environment Variables

All configuration options are documented in [`.env.example`](.env.example). Key required variables:

- `JWT_SECRET` — JWT signing secret (min 32 bytes) **Required**
- `RBAC_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — AES-256 key for passwords (32-byte hex) **Required**
- `RBAC_ENCRYPTION_SALT` — Salt for key derivation (32-byte hex) **Required**
- `RBAC_DB_TYPE` — `sqlite` (default) or `postgres`
- `RBAC_POSTGRES_URL` — PostgreSQL connection URL (for multi-instance deployments)

### Generating Secrets

```bash
# Generate JWT secret
openssl rand -base64 32

# Generate encryption key
openssl rand -hex 32

# Generate strong password
openssl rand -base64 16
```

## RBAC System

### How RBAC Works

CHouse UI has its **own permission system** that controls access to the web interface.

**Two separate things:**

1. **CHouse UI RBAC** (for the web interface):
   - Controls who can use CHouse UI and what they can do
   - Stored in CHouse UI's own database
   - All queries are checked against these permissions before reaching ClickHouse

2. **ClickHouse User Management** (optional feature):
   - CHouse UI can create ClickHouse users with native grants
   - These are actual ClickHouse users (not CHouse UI users)
   - Useful if you want to manage ClickHouse users through the web interface

**In simple terms:** CHouse UI's RBAC controls access to the web interface. It can also optionally create ClickHouse users, but that's a separate feature.

### Role Hierarchy

| Role | Description | Key Permissions |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Super Admin** | Full system access | All permissions |
| **Admin** | Server management | Users, roles, connections |
| **Developer** | Write access | Insert, update, DDL |
| **Analyst** | Read access | Select, export |
| **Viewer** | Read-only | Select only |
| **Guest** | Read-only access | View all tabs, read-only queries, system tables access |

### Data Access Rules

Control access to specific databases and tables:

```
Rule: Allow "analyst" role to access "analytics.*"
Rule: Deny "viewer" role from "system.*"
Rule: Allow user "john" to access "sales.orders"
```

Features:
- **Wildcards**: `*` matches any database/table
- **Patterns**: Regex support for complex rules
- **Deny Rules**: Explicit denials take precedence
- **Priority**: Higher priority rules evaluated first

### Permission Categories

- **User Management**: Create, update, delete users
- **Role Management**: Manage roles and permissions
- **Connection Management**: Add/edit ClickHouse connections
- **Query Operations**: Execute queries, DML, DDL; `ai:optimize` (in-tab AI query optimization + error/parts diagnosis)
- **Table Operations**: Select, insert, update, delete
- **Metrics & Monitoring**: Per-tab view grants — `logs:view`, `parts:view`, `schema_advisor:view`, `cluster:view`, `errors:view`
- **Fleet Monitoring**: `fleet:view`, `doctor:view` (read reports), `doctor:run` (generate scans + schedules)
- **System**: Audit logs, settings

---

## Architecture

CHouse UI is a monorepo with two main packages:

- **Frontend** (`src/`) — React 19 + Vite SPA with Zustand stores, TanStack Query, and shadcn/ui
- **Backend** (`packages/server/`) — Bun + Hono API server with RBAC, ClickHouse proxy, and AI optimizer
