OpenXiv is an AT Protocol App View for science. Papers, threads, endorsements,
disclosures, and reviews are real `app.openxiv.*` records that live in each
author's PDS (Bluesky's or their own) and federate to the wider AT Protocol
network. The server publishes to Bluesky, exposes OAI-PMH 2.0 for
library indexers, and runs its own custom Bluesky feeds.

Open to independent researchers without institutional backing. Sign in with
ORCID, Google, or did:plc through Bluesky. No endorsement gate. No
"must be affiliated" filter.

AI use is welcome under structured disclosure (`none`, `assistant`,
`coauthor`, `primary`, recorded as an `app.openxiv.disclosure` record).
Unverified output is refused with a public refusal packet that names the
failure mode. Work returns for revision instead of triggering an author ban.

The instance at [openxiv.net](https://openxiv.net) is the single live
deployment. It is also indexed by [BASE](https://www.base-search.net/),
[CORE](https://core.ac.uk/), and the [Bluesky directory of custom feeds](https://bsky.app/profile/openxiv.bsky.social).

## Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript strict, Node 22.
- **API**: [Fastify 5](https://fastify.dev/) with `fastify-type-provider-zod` for end-to-end typed routes.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector via Drizzle ORM. Migrations live in `packages/db/drizzle`.
- **Queues**: BullMQ on Redis 7. Heavy work (compile, embed, explain, figure extraction, Bluesky bridge, jetstream relay) runs in a separate worker process.
- **Storage**: S3 compatible. MinIO locally, Hetzner Object Storage in production, accessed through `@aws-sdk/client-s3`.
- **LaTeX to PDF**: `tectonic` running in a sandboxed Docker container (mockable).
- **LaTeX to HTML**: `latexml` (mockable). PDF and HTML are served side by side on the paper page.
- **Metadata extraction**: GROBID over its HTTP API for affiliations, references, abstracts.
- **Figure extraction**: `pdf-lib` plus a custom raster pass; each figure lands at `/api/papers/{id}/figures/{n}`.
- **LLM**: DeepSeek V4 Flash for explainer tier generation; Gemini `gemini-embedding-001` for semantic similarity.
- **Undisclosed AI detector**: ensemble (perplexity burst + Binoculars-style ratio + stylometric) producing a score in `[0, 100]`. The MVP ships a heuristic; swap in GPT-2-medium scoring when the model directory is populated.
- **Auth**: OAuth via ORCID (primary, verifies researchers), Google, and Bluesky, all resolving to an AT Protocol DID. Mastodon link-only for cross-posting.
- **Web**: Astro 5 server-rendered with React 19 islands for the submission wizard, the explainer tabs, the publish action, and the discussion thread.
- **Lexicons**: `app.openxiv.*` records in `packages/lexicons` with JSON schemas and matching zod validators.
- **Errors**: `neverthrow` Result types end to end. No silent catches.
- **Resilience**: opossum circuit breakers wrap every external (LLM, GROBID, tectonic, S3, ORCID, Bluesky PDS, jetstream). A single dependency going down does not take the system out.
- **Edge**: Caddy 2 in front of every service. Automatic HTTPS, HTTP/3, on-the-fly compression.
- **Observability**: Sentry SDK with `SENTRY_DSN` opt in; pino logs with `pino-pretty` in dev.

## Lexicons (`app.openxiv.*`)

| Lexicon | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `app.openxiv.paper` | A preprint record. Authors, categories, abstract, license, blobs (PDF, source, HTML). |
| `app.openxiv.summary` | Plain-language summary at `school` / `undergrad` / `expert` tier. Required on submission. |
| `app.openxiv.disclosure` | Structured AI-use disclosure (`level`, `aiUsed`, `models`, attestation). |
| `app.openxiv.post` | Short post or thread reply. Shape-compatible with `app.bsky.feed.post` so Bluesky clients render it. |
| `app.openxiv.review` | Open review with verdict + confidence. |
| `app.openxiv.endorsement` | Typed verb endorsement: `verified-derivation`, `reproduced-result`, `checked-references`, `useful-background`, `important-but-flawed`, `needs-correction`. |
| `app.openxiv.citation` | Directed citation, builds the citation graph. |
| `app.openxiv.preprint` | Lighter-weight record used for the federated preprint timeline. |
| `app.openxiv.prereg` | Pre-registered hypothesis (research question, prediction, analysis plan, frozen at timestamp). |

JSON schemas live in `packages/lexicons/schemas/`. Zod validators live in `packages/lexicons/src/`.

## Submit saga (6 stages)

The submit wizard hands off to a BullMQ saga. Each stage is idempotent and
persists its outcome in `submission_sagas`. A per-stage retry endpoint is
available to the submitter and to admins.

1. `S1 ops_created`: compile (tectonic), upload PDF + HTML to S3, run GROBID for metadata, extract keywords with the KeyBERT-style client, run the undisclosed-AI detector when `level=none`.
2. `S2 ops_approved`: transition status to `pending_review` (single-instance MVP auto-approves; replace with a moderator gate once the instance opens up).
3. `S3 id_assigned`: atomic allocation of `openxiv:{primary_category}.{year}.{NNNNN}`.
4. `S4 pds_paper`: `com.atproto.repo.putRecord` of `app.openxiv.paper` into the author's PDS, status flips to `published`.
5. `S5 pds_summary_disclosure`: `app.openxiv.summary` + `app.openxiv.disclosure` records into the author's PDS.
6. `S6 bluesky_bridge`: `app.openxiv.post` referencing the paper, persisted locally so it shows in the OpenXiv feed and is mirrored to the author's `app.bsky.feed.post` bridge record.

## OAI-PMH and library indexing

The OAI-PMH 2.0 endpoint is at [`https://openxiv.net/oai-pmh`](https://openxiv.net/oai-pmh).

Supported verbs: `Identify`, `ListMetadataFormats`, `ListSets`, `ListIdentifiers`, `ListRecords`, `GetRecord`. Metadata format: `oai_dc`. Deleted-record strategy: `transient`. Resumption tokens are stateless and embed `until`, `from`, `set`, and `metadataPrefix` so harvesters can resume mid-page without server state.

The endpoint is validated by [BASE OVAL](https://oval.base-search.net/) and indexed by:

- [BASE](https://www.base-search.net/), Bielefeld Academic Search Engine.
- [CORE](https://core.ac.uk/), Open Access aggregator.
- Bluesky directory of custom feeds.
- [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q139860032), preprint server entry with ISSN, language, country, headquarters, Bluesky handle.

OpenDOAR submission is in progress.

## Bluesky feed generator

`apps/feed-generator/` is a standalone Fastify service that serves the
Bluesky feed-generator XRPC surface:

```
GET /.well-known/did.json                              did:web document
GET /xrpc/app.bsky.feed.describeFeedGenerator          lists feeds
GET /xrpc/app.bsky.feed.getFeedSkeleton?feed=at://...  returns skeleton
```

Six feeds are published under `did:web:openxiv.net`:

- `openxiv-latest`: every new paper as it lands.
- `openxiv-featured`: editor picks.
- `openxiv-questions`: open questions from researcher threads.
- `openxiv-disclosed`: papers with explicit AI disclosure (`assistant` and above).
- `openxiv-beginner`: papers with the strongest "school tier" explainer score.
- `openxiv-claims`: papers with at least one typed `verified-derivation` or `reproduced-result` endorsement.

The skeleton references the bridged `app.bsky.feed.post` URIs
(`paper_versions.bsky_post_uri`) so the Bluesky App View hydrates embed
cards natively.

## arXiv overlay browser extension

`apps/extension/` is an MV3 content script for Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.
On any `https://arxiv.org/abs/*` page it injects a sidebar with the
matching OpenXiv paper's Trust Passport lane badges, or a "submit to
OpenXiv" CTA if there is no match.

Install in developer mode:

1. Open `chrome://extensions` or the browser equivalent.
2. Enable Developer mode.
3. Load unpacked, point at `apps/extension`.
4. Open the extension's Options page and set the API base URL (default `http://localhost:4000` for dev).
5. Visit any `arxiv.org/abs/{id}` page.

Icons (`icon-16.png`, `icon-48.png`, `icon-128.png`) are placeholders;
swap before publishing to the Web Store.

## Quick start (Docker)

```bash
cp .env.example .env       # the defaults already match docker-compose
docker compose up --build  # first build ~3 min, subsequent starts ~10s
```

After the stack is healthy:

- **Web**: <http://localhost:4321>
- **API + OpenAPI docs**: <http://localhost:4000/docs>
- **OAI-PMH**: <http://localhost:4000/oai-pmh?verb=Identify>
- **Feed generator**: <http://localhost:4400/.well-known/did.json>
- **MinIO console**: <http://localhost:9001> (`minioadmin` / `minioadmin`)
- **GROBID**: <http://localhost:8070>
- **Postgres**: `postgres://openxiv:openxiv@localhost:5432/openxiv`
- **Redis**: `redis://localhost:6379`

Drizzle migrations run automatically on first start
(`packages/db/drizzle/0000_init.sql` and later).

Mock clients are on by default (`USE_MOCK_CLIENTS=true`) so the full
submit pipeline works without Gemini, ORCID, or a real tectonic image.
Switch them off individually as you wire real providers.

### Happy path, end to end

1. Visit <http://localhost:4321/auth/sign-in> and pick **Continue with ORCID** (mock; instantly logs you in as a seeded test author).
2. Go to **/submit** and walk through the 6-step wizard. Drop any `.tex`, `.pdf`, or `.tar.gz` as the source.
3. The API stores source to MinIO, creates a `papers` row in `compiling` state, writes the disclosure + summary, ensures a `submission_sagas` row, and enqueues a BullMQ saga job.
4. The worker runs the 6-stage saga, marking each stage done in `submission_sagas`.
5. Paper page is at `/abs/{openxiv-id}` (for example `/abs/cs.AI.2026.00001`). The page shows the AI-disclosure badge, the three explainer tabs (school, undergrad, expert), the Trust Passport, the Provenance Timeline, and per-stage retry buttons for the submitter and admins.
6. Owner profile lives at `/@{handle}` with unified All / Papers / Posts tabs, ORCID and moderator badges.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev                # API only (port 4000)
pnpm dev:web            # Web only (port 4321)
pnpm dev:workers        # Worker only
pnpm dev:all            # All apps in parallel

pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test               # unit + property tests across the workspace
pnpm test:e2e           # Playwright happy path (requires docker compose up)
pnpm build              # build all packages then all apps
pnpm format             # prettier
```

Run migrations against a local Postgres without containers:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://openxiv:openxiv@localhost:5432/openxiv \
  pnpm db:migrate
```

Regenerate a new migration after editing the Drizzle schema:

```bash
pnpm db:generate
```

For a first-day setup checklist, see [`docs/dev/ONBOARDING.md`](docs/dev/ONBOARDING.md).
For production restart, secret rotation, and restore steps, see
[`docs/ops/RUNBOOK.md`](docs/ops/RUNBOOK.md).

## Configuration

All config is validated by `packages/shared/src/env.ts` (zod) on startup.
In production the app fails fast on unsafe mock flags, wildcard CORS,
localhost public bases, missing required provider credentials, and
default MinIO credentials. See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the
full list. Highlights:

- `USE_MOCK_CLIENTS=true` flips every external to its in-process mock.
- `USE_MOCK_LLM`, `USE_MOCK_GROBID`, `USE_MOCK_TECTONIC`, `USE_MOCK_LATEXML`, `USE_MOCK_DETECTOR`, `USE_MOCK_ORCID`, `USE_MOCK_BLUESKY` toggle individual services.
- `DETECTOR_*_WEIGHT` re-weights the undisclosed-AI ensemble.
- `ADMIN_DIDS` and `SUBMIT_ALLOW_DIDS` are comma-separated DID lists for admin and submit gates.
- `JETSTREAM_URL` points at the public Bluesky jetstream relay for the firehose subscriber.
- `OPENXIV_FLAG_LEGACY_UNPREFIXED_MOUNT=0` retires the legacy unprefixed API surface (default 1 during the migration window).

## Tests

- **Unit (vitest)**: every package and app has a `test` script. Run all with `pnpm test`.
- **Property-based (fast-check)**: invariants on the disclosure lexicon (`packages/lexicons/src/disclosure.property.test.ts`). Non-`none` levels must populate `aiUsed` and `models`. `none` must leave them empty. Cross-listing rules on the paper lexicon are property tested in `paper.crossListings.test.ts`.
- **Contract**: JSON lexicons are validated against the corresponding zod schemas via the validator tests in `packages/lexicons`.
- **Integration**: route-level tests under `apps/api/src/routes/*.test.ts` cover the OAI-PMH verbs, the Bluesky starter pack, the moderation flow, account linking, profile assembly, and the events log.
- **E2E (Playwright)**: `e2e/tests/happy-path.spec.ts` drives the full flow. Sign-in, submit, poll for worker completion, publish, see on home feed.

CI runs the unit job on Node 22 and 24, then the E2E job through
`docker compose up`. See [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Production deployment

The single live instance runs on a Contabo Cloud VPS with Caddy 2 in
front of `docker-compose.production.yml`. The compose file pins the API
to the multi-stage image built from `apps/api/Dockerfile` and the web
to `apps/web/Dockerfile`; workers reuse the API image with a different
entrypoint (`worker.ts`). The feed generator runs as its own service so
it can be put behind its own subdomain.

Backups: nightly `pg_dump` to an off-site S3, snapshot retention 30
days. Object storage in production is Hetzner Object Storage,
S3-compatible, region `eu-central`.

Observability is opt-in. Set `SENTRY_DSN` to ship server errors.
Logs are JSON via pino in production; dev uses `pino-pretty`.

## Single-owner mode

OpenXiv MVP is a single-instance deployment with one owner who is also
the only moderator. Wire it via env:

```
ADMIN_DIDS=did:plc:zxyourblueskydid000000001
SUBMIT_ALLOW_DIDS=did:plc:zxyourblueskydid000000001
```

On first sign-in the owner's DID is auto-promoted to `moderator` and
shown with a badge in the header. With `SUBMIT_ALLOW_DIDS` set, only
listed DIDs can hit `POST /api/submissions` and random visitors get a
403. Leave it empty for open submissions.

## Auth flows

- **Mock** (default in dev): the OAuth `authorize` endpoint returns a relative URL with a base64-encoded test profile in `code`. The Astro app proxies `/api-proxy/auth/dev/mock-callback` to the API so cookies land on the web origin. Logging in instantly creates `A. Author` and starts a session.
- **ORCID** (real): register at <https://orcid.org/developer-tools> or <https://sandbox.orcid.org/developer-tools> for testing. Set `ORCID_CLIENT_ID`, `ORCID_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ORCID_USE_SANDBOX=true` for sandbox, and flip `USE_MOCK_ORCID=false`. Callback URL must match the public web base, for example `https://openxiv.net/api-proxy/auth/orcid/callback`.
- **Google** (real): register at <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials>. Set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`. Callback `${PUBLIC_WEB_BASE}/api-proxy/auth/google/callback`.
- **Bluesky** (real): AT Protocol OAuth (client metadata URL or pre-registered client id). The wire format sits in `packages/clients/src/oauth/bluesky.ts`; production should adopt `@atproto/oauth-client-node` for DPoP, PAR, and refresh rotation.
- **Mastodon** (cross-post link only): the `auth-mastodon` route lets an authenticated OpenXiv user link a Mastodon account so the optional cross-post worker can mirror new paper posts to a Mastodon instance.
