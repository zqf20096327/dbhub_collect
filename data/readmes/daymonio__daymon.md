## Why Daymon?

Sleep. Daymon doesn't. It runs Claude tasks on schedule, remembers context across conversations, watches files for changes, and works in the background — all while you sleep, commute, or focus on other things.

No API keys. No token costs. No cloud. Just your existing Claude subscription, finally working 24/7.

---

## Requirements

- **macOS 12 (Monterey) or later** (Apple Silicon & Intel), **Windows 10+** (x64), or **Linux x64** (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc.)
- **[Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)** or **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)** (you need at least one)
- A Claude subscription (Pro, Max, or Team) — Daymon uses your existing subscription, no API keys needed

## Installation

### macOS — Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew install daymonio/daymon/daymon
```

### macOS — Download

Download the latest `.dmg` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/daymonio/daymon/releases/latest).

### Windows — Download

Download the latest `.exe` installer from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/daymonio/daymon/releases/latest).

### Linux — Download

Download the `.deb` or `.AppImage` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/daymonio/daymon/releases/latest).

```bash
# .deb (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo dpkg -i daymon_*.deb

# AppImage (any distro)
chmod +x Daymon-*.AppImage && ./Daymon-*.AppImage
```

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daymonio/daymon.git
cd daymon
npm install
npm run dev      # Development mode
npm run build    # Production build
```

## Quick Start

### Claude Desktop

Install Daymon and open it. That's it — Daymon auto-configures Claude Desktop on first launch.

Open Claude Desktop and try:

> "Remember that I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript"

> "Every weekday at 9am, check HackerNews for AI news and summarize the top 5 stories"

> "Watch my Downloads folder and organize new files into subfolders by type"

### Claude Code

Install Daymon and open it. Daymon auto-configures Claude Code on first launch (if `~/.claude.json` exists).

Then try:

> "Remember this project uses PostgreSQL 16 and runs on port 5432"

> "Schedule a daily code review of this repo every morning at 8am"

## What is Daymon?

Daymon is a desktop app for macOS, Windows, and Linux that lives in your menu bar (system tray on Windows). It gives Claude persistent memory, scheduled tasks, workers, and file watchers — all running locally on your machine.

Your Claude subscription only works when you do. Daymon puts it to work 24/7.

## Features

**Scheduled Tasks** — "Every weekday at 9am, check HackerNews for AI news." Just tell Claude what you want. Daymon handles the scheduling.

**Persistent Memory** — "Remember I'm fundraising Series A." Say it once, it sticks forever. Knowledge graph with semantic search, no API keys.

**Workers** — Named agent personalities with system prompts. Assign a Researcher, Chief of Staff, or Code Reviewer to any task. 9 templates included.

**Self-Improving Tasks** — Tasks get smarter every time they run. Daymon learns what works and skips the guesswork on future runs — faster results, no configuration needed.

**Auto-Nudge** — When a background task finishes, Daymon shows results in your active Claude Code chat automatically. Per-task control: always, failures only, or never. Quiet hours keep nudges out of your way.

**Session Continuity** — Tasks resume where they left off. "Compare today's results to yesterday's" just works.

**File Watchers** — "When a new file appears in Downloads, organize it." Daymon watches folders and acts automatically.

**100% Local** — No cloud. No account. Your data is a SQLite file you can inspect anytime.

## Workers

Workers are named agent profiles with system prompts. Each worker defines a personality, values, and anti-patterns that shape how tasks execute.

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Chief of Staff | Proactive business ops — triages, anticipates needs, proposes actions |
| Researcher | Deep research with strong opinions — synthesis over summarization |
| Code Reviewer | Catches what linters miss — leads with blockers, no bikeshedding |
| Writer | Sharp writing — cuts fluff, clarity over everything |
| Email Assistant | 3-tier triage, drafts replies, never sends |
| Tech Trend Analyst | Tech-only trends + tweet drafts with real takes |
| Competitor Tracker | Reports signal, not noise — silence is a valid report |
| DevOps | Reliability over novelty — boring infrastructure that works |
| Data Analyst | Analysis that drives decisions, not dashboards |

Create workers in the Daymon UI or via Claude: "Create a worker called 'My Analyst' with this system prompt..."
