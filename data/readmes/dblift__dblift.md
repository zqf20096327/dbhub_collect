DBLift applies versioned `.sql` files to your database and remembers what ran. Same file convention as Flyway (`V1__create_users.sql`), installed with `pip`, usable as a CLI or as a Python library. Preview, undo, checksums and locking are part of the open-source package. Apache 2.0.

## Try it in 60 seconds

No database server needed — this runs against a local SQLite file.

```bash
pip install dblift

mkdir migrations
echo "CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE);" > migrations/V1__create_users.sql
echo "DROP TABLE users;" > migrations/U1__create_users.sql

export DBLIFT_DB_URL="sqlite:///app.db"

dblift migrate --dry-run --show-sql   # prints the SQL, applies nothing
dblift migrate                        # applies V1
dblift info                           # what ran, when, by whom, and whether it can be undone
dblift undo                           # runs U1, rolls the last migration back
```

For a real database, install the driver extra and point the URL at it:

```bash
pip install "dblift[postgresql]"
export DBLIFT_DB_URL="postgresql+psycopg://user@localhost:5432/mydb"
export DBLIFT_DB_PASSWORD="..."
```

## Is this for you?

**You run Flyway from a Python project.** A JVM, a Docker image or a downloaded tarball, kept patched only to apply SQL files. DBLift reads the same `V` / `R` / `U` file names, and `dblift import-flyway` copies your `flyway_schema_history` so every environment keeps its history. What changes is the install line. [Move from Flyway →](https://docs.dblift.com/move-from-flyway/)

**You apply SQL with a `migrate.sh` or a home-made `migrate.py`.** It works until two files share a number, someone edits an applied file, a replica starts at the same time, or production turns out to be two migrations behind staging. That script is a migration tool you maintain by accident. Rename the files, run `dblift baseline` once per existing database, and delete it. [Adopt an existing database →](https://docs.dblift.com/adopt-existing-database/) · [Naming conventions →](https://docs.dblift.com/naming-conventions/)

**You want migrations you can read in a pull request.** Not revisions generated from an ORM — the SQL you wrote, reviewed as SQL, run as written. Works next to SQLAlchemy, Django, FastAPI and Flask, or with none of them.

## What you get

Everything below ships in the open-source package.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Preview** | `migrate --dry-run --show-sql` prints every statement that would run. Same for `undo`. |
| **Undo** | Pair `V3__x.sql` with `U3__x.sql`; `dblift undo` rolls back one step or to a target version. [Undo model →](https://docs.dblift.com/undo-model/) |
| **Checksums** | `dblift validate` fails when an applied file was edited, a recorded file is missing, or two files claim the same version. |
| **Baseline** | Adopt a database that already exists: declare "this one is at version N" and carry on from there. |
| **Repeatable migrations** | `R__views.sql` re-runs when its content changes — a home for views, functions, grants and seed data. |
| **Locking** | A lock table serialises concurrent runs; a second runner waits, then skips what the first one applied. |
| **Python migrations** | `V4__backfill.py` when a change needs logic. [Python migrations →](https://docs.dblift.com/python-migrations/) |
| **A Python API** | Sync and async clients, events and callbacks — run migrations from your app or your tests, not only from a shell. |
| **Transactions** | A migration that fails part-way is rolled back where the engine supports transactional DDL. |
| **No lock-in** | Your migrations stay plain `.sql` files in your repository. |

> **Ordering:** DBLift applies out-of-order migrations by default — if `V3` is applied and a teammate's `V2` merges later, `V2` still runs. This is the opposite of Flyway's default. Use `--strict` or `strict_mode: true` to enforce version order. [Versioning →](https://docs.dblift.com/migrations-versioning/)

## Use it from Python

Run migrations when your app starts:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from dblift.api import DBLiftClient

engine = create_engine("postgresql+psycopg://user:pass@localhost/app")
with DBLiftClient.from_sqlalchemy(engine, migrations_dir="migrations") as client:
    client.migrate()
```

`AsyncDBLiftClient` (`from dblift.api.async_client import AsyncDBLiftClient`) does the same without blocking an event loop. [API →](https://docs.dblift.com/api/) · [Async client →](https://docs.dblift.com/async-client/)

Give your tests a migrated database:

```bash
pip install pytest-dblift
```

```python
def test_schema_is_current(dblift_migrated_db, dblift_client):
    assert dblift_client.info().pending_count == 0
```

## How it compares

| | DBLift | Flyway Community | Alembic | Your own script |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Migrations are plain `.sql` files | ✅ | ✅ | Python revision files | ✅ |
| Runs without a JVM | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Undo | ✅ | paid editions | ✅ `downgrade()` in Python | if you wrote it |
| Preview the SQL before applying | ✅ | paid editions | ✅ offline `--sql` mode | if you wrote it |
| Detects edited or duplicated migrations | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | rarely |
| Importable as a Python library | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | — |
| pytest fixtures | ✅ | ❌ | third-party plugin | — |
| Adopts an existing Flyway history | ✅ | — | ❌ | ❌ |

Alembic is the right choice when your schema is driven by SQLAlchemy models and you want autogenerated revisions. DBLift is for teams who write the SQL themselves.

## Databases

20 engines. SQLite works with a bare `pip install dblift`; every other engine has its own install extra, e.g. `pip install "dblift[postgresql]"`.

PostgreSQL · MySQL · MariaDB · SQL Server · Oracle · DB2 · SQLite · DuckDB · CockroachDB · Redshift · Snowflake · Neon · Supabase · Aurora PostgreSQL · AlloyDB · YugabyteDB · TimescaleDB · Citus · Azure Cosmos DB · MongoDB

What each engine supports is in the [capability matrix](https://docs.dblift.com/capability-matrix/); connection details are under [Engines](https://docs.dblift.com/choosing-an-engine/).

## What Pro adds

The OSS tier covers the full migration lifecycle: apply, preview, validate state,
roll back, and import from Flyway. When review risk grows, the Pro tier adds:

| Feature | Command | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Static SQL analysis | `dblift validate-sql` | Lints migration files with rule-based checks — catches issues before they reach the database. Built-in rule profiles (core, enterprise, strict). CI-friendly output formats (GitHub Actions, SARIF, GitLab). |
| Schema drift detection | `dblift diff` | Compares live database state with what your migrations define. Surfaces objects that have drifted. |
| Schema export | `dblift export-schema` | Exports the current schema to SQL migration files. Useful for brownfield onboarding. |
