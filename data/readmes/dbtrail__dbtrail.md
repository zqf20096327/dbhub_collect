**DBTrail keeps every change on your MySQL server, before and after, and writes the SQL that undoes the ones you didn't want.**

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id = 123 AS OF '2026-05-20 14:00:00'
```

*That query runs against production MySQL or Postgres. DBTrail makes it work.*

## What you get

Point-in-time recovery restores the whole database and replays every log to
reach one change. DBTrail keeps the changes themselves — it tails the MySQL
binary log or the Postgres WAL and stores every row change, with full before and
after images, in a searchable index:

- **See every change.** What changed and when, for every row, with before/after diffs.
- **Undo precisely.** Generate exact reversal SQL for just the damaged rows.
- **Undo foreign-key cascades.** Rebuild the child rows an `ON DELETE CASCADE` wiped out. Restore the foreign keys an `ON DELETE SET NULL` cleared, or an `ON UPDATE CASCADE`/`SET NULL` re-pointed when a parent's key changed. InnoDB applies all of these below the binlog, where most tools cannot see them. See [Query & Recovery](docs/query-and-recovery.md).
- **Time-travel.** Query any row or table as it was at any moment, from the web console or the `reconstruct` CLI. The live SQL `AS OF` interface also needs ProxySQL. See [Time-Travel SQL](docs/time-travel-sql.md).
- **Who changed this?** Session attribution (the database user, host, and client program behind a change) ships in the commercial distribution, DBTrail EE.
- **Prove the safety net holds.** `bintrail verify` checks offline, without touching the source, that a recovery would reproduce it. `bintrail status` flags any gap in the captured stream. You find out before you need it. See [Verify](docs/verify.md).
- **Web console.** Browse, recover, and add servers to monitor, all in the UI.
- **Ask it in plain English.** Connect Claude Desktop to your console in one click with an `.mcpb` bundle or a copy-paste URL ([5-minute guide](docs/connect-ai.md)). Any MCP client works; see the [MCP server](docs/mcp-server.md) reference.

Works with **MySQL**, **Percona Server for MySQL**, **Amazon RDS for MySQL**,
and **Amazon Aurora MySQL** (verified). **Google Cloud SQL for MySQL** should
work too; please report issues. DBTrail connects over the replication protocol
and never needs the binlog files on disk, which is why managed cloud databases
work. It requires MySQL 8.0+ with `binlog_format=ROW` and
`binlog_row_image=FULL`; `bintrail doctor` checks both and prints the exact fix.

## Try it in 30 seconds

One container, zero setup, time-travel SQL:

```sh
docker run --rm -p 6033:6033 ghcr.io/dbtrail/bintrail-demo
```

See [the demo image](docs/demo.md).

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbtrail/dbtrail/main/install.sh | sh
```

This downloads the Docker Compose stack, starts it, waits until DBTrail answers,
and prints the next steps. They are the same four steps as the
[start page](https://www.dbtrail.com/docs/quickstart/):

1. **Sign in.** Open **http://127.0.0.1:8090** and create a username and password.
2. **Connect.** Click **+ Add server**, give the server a name, and fill in the host and port of your MySQL server. The form suggests a user and password for DBTrail and shows the SQL that creates that user; run it on your MySQL with a login that can create users and grant them privileges, then press **Save**.
3. **First change.** Change a row on your MySQL. It shows on the Overview within a minute, with an **Undo** that writes the SQL to reverse it.
4. **First snapshot.** With one, DBTrail can rebuild a whole table as it was at a past moment. Today it takes a folder created first, then on the **Snapshots** page: type it in **Backup dir**, **Save**, and press **Create backup**. The start page has the command that creates the folder.

Prefer the command line? See the [command-line quickstart](docs/quickstart.md).

### PostgreSQL & MariaDB (alpha) sources

The same one-line install captures **PostgreSQL** and **MariaDB** sources too,
not just MySQL. In **+ Add server**, choose the source type; PostgreSQL reveals
fields for the database, replication slot, and publication. PostgreSQL needs a
one-time setup on the source first (`wal_level = logical`,
`REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`, and a publication). DBTrail validates these and never
runs DDL on your source. The full walkthrough, including managed RDS, Aurora,
and Cloud SQL: **[PostgreSQL source](docs/postgres.md)** ·
**[MariaDB source (alpha)](docs/mariadb.md)**.

## Privacy

bintrail runs entirely in your infrastructure. **Your database data never
leaves it**: not your rows, schemas, table names, queries, hostnames, DSNs, or
file paths.

Official release builds do report **metadata-only usage statistics**: which
command ran, whether it succeeded, a coarse error class, and your version and
platform. It is on by default and turns off in one line:

```sh
bintrail telemetry off      # or: DO_NOT_TRACK=1, BINTRAIL_TELEMETRY=off
bintrail telemetry show     # prints what would be sent; sends nothing
```

No identifier of any kind is stored or transmitted, so nothing ties those
statistics to you or your machine. A binary you build yourself has no reporting
address compiled in and cannot send anything. [TELEMETRY.md](docs/TELEMETRY.md)
documents every field, every control, and the CI tests that enforce both.

The [privacy policy](PRIVACY.md) covers the Claude Desktop extension (`.mcpb`),
which reports nothing at all, and how data moves when an AI client queries
your deployment.
