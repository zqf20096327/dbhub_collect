DbUnit is a mature, proven JUnit extension, founded in 2002,
targeted at database-driven projects that, among other things,
puts the database into a known state between test runs.
This is an excellent way to avoid the myriad of problems that can occur when one test case corrupts the data and causes subsequent tests to fail or exacerbate the damage.

dbUnit hooks into JUnit 5/6 (Jupiter; JUnit 4 support was dropped in 3.0.0)
either by composing an `IDatabaseTester` into your test class (the preferred style)
or by extending `DBTestCase`.

* Reads and writes multiple link:https://dbunit.github.io/dbunit-extension/datasets.html[dataset formats], built from files, code, or a live query.
* On JUnit 5/6, link:https://dbunit.github.io/dbunit-extension/testcases/annotations.html[configure a test declaratively with annotations] — `@DbUnitPrep`, `@DbUnitExpected`, `@DbUnitSetup`, `@DbUnitTearDown` — instead of hand-written lifecycle code, including an opt-in `@DbUnitRowCountCheck` that catches a table teardown forgot to clean, or wrongly cleaned.
* `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `REFRESH` (upsert), `CLEAN_INSERT`, and other composable database operations.
* link:https://dbunit.github.io/dbunit-extension/datacomparisons/valuecomparer.html[ValueComparer] assertions beyond strict equality — tolerance (numeric and timestamp), greater-than/less-than, null checks, string containment, and ignore-millis timestamps.
* Vendor-specific support for many link:https://dbunit.github.io/dbunit-extension/databases.html[databases].
* Usable outside of tests too, via its https://dbunit.github.io/dbunit-extension/anttask.html[Ant Integration] task or the companion dbunit-maven-plugin, for data import/export.
