dbwarden is a declarative schema compiler for SQLAlchemy. You declare the schema you want in your SQLAlchemy models, and dbwarden compiles everything else: migration SQL, rollbacks, snapshots, and safety checks.

There are no migration scripts to write or maintain. There is no migration runtime. Your models are the contract. The database is kept in sync with them.

> **Status: Stable Alpha.** dbwarden is pre-1.0 but production-ready. No breaking changes will ship without a 3-month deprecation window.

## At a glance

- Migrations generated from your models, not written by hand
- Plain SQL output: reviewable, committable, executable anywhere
- Strict rollback contract with placeholder rollback refused by default
- Pre-deploy impact analysis: know what breaks before it ships
- Offline migration generation for CI pipelines without a live database
- Schema snapshots for deterministic diffs and rename detection
- Typed `class Meta` system with import-time validation
- Registry-driven PostgreSQL diff and SQL emission pipeline
- Typed multi-database configuration with inheritance-friendly declarations
- Multi-database support: PostgreSQL, MySQL, ClickHouse, MariaDB, SQLite
- Extensible plugin system with official plugins for seeds, RBAC, FastAPI, sandbox testing, and PostgreSQL/ClickHouse extensions
- Reverse-engineer live databases into models with `generate-models` (supports `--base` for custom imports)

## Features and limits

- **Migration authoring:** SQLAlchemy models, backend metadata, rename detection,
  reverse engineering, explicit SQL files, and rollback generation.
- **Safety:** operation classification, expand-contract type changes, severity
  splits, execution ceilings, pending-plan checks, and impact reports.
- **State and history:** offline model-state JSON, schema snapshots, checksums,
  repeatable migrations, merge reconciliation, and rebase support.
- **Operation:** multiple database configurations, optional database skipping,
  locks, sandbox providers, SQLite dev translation, JSON output, and tracing.
- **Extensions:** plugin configuration, handlers, hooks, CLI commands, and named
  migration groups. FastAPI, seed extensions, and backend object plugins have
  separate installation and compatibility requirements.

Use the [feature map](https://docs.dbwarden.org/reference/feature-map/) to find each workflow and
its implementation boundary. The [CLI inventory](https://docs.dbwarden.org/reference/cli-options/)
lists every built-in option; the [Python inventory](https://docs.dbwarden.org/reference/python-api/)
lists exports, signatures, declared fields, and methods.

## Why dbwarden

Schema management tools fall into two camps. Imperative tools have you author *changes*: revision scripts that describe how to get from one schema version to the next. Declarative tools have you author the *desired state* and derive the changes for you. dbwarden is declarative: your SQLAlchemy models are the single definition of what the schema should be.

Most imperative tools ask you to maintain two representations of your schema: your ORM models and your migration files. When they drift, you find out at deploy time.

dbwarden eliminates the second representation. Your SQLAlchemy models are the schema definition. dbwarden reads them, diffs them against the current database state, and generates the SQL to close the gap (including rollback) without you writing a line of migration code.

This also means:

- No migration runtime to install or version
- No generated Python scripts that quietly do the wrong thing
- No schema drift discovered in production: drift is caught at `make-migrations` time
- Migrations that can be generated in CI without a database connection

dbwarden is not a wrapper around Alembic. It is a different approach to the same problem. Alembic asks you to describe *how* to change the database; dbwarden asks you to describe *what* the schema should be. Alembic can autogenerate revisions, but each one becomes an imperative Python artifact you own, edit, and chain, the revision history is the source of truth. With dbwarden the models stay the source of truth, and the output is plain SQL.

Unlike tools that apply declarative diffs directly to the database, dbwarden still produces versioned, reviewable migration files with explicit rollbacks: declarative authoring without giving up auditable deploy artifacts.

## From zero to production

Typical adoption path in an existing project:

1. Point dbwarden at your existing SQLAlchemy models
2. Run initial `make-migrations` to generate a baseline schema
3. Commit generated migrations as your source of truth
4. Replace your current migration workflow with the dbwarden CLI
5. Optionally enable:
   - Migration impact analysis for safer deploys
   - Offline mode for CI pipelines without a database service

## Installation

```bash
uv add dbwarden
```

Requirements: Python 3.12+, SQLAlchemy 2.0+.

Optional dependency groups:

| Group        | Default | Provides                             |
|--------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| `[postgres]` |         | `psycopg2-binary`                    |
| `[mysql]`    |         | `pymysql`                            |
| `[clickhouse]` |       | `clickhouse-connect`, `aiohttp`      |
| `[dev]`      |         | `pytest`, `zensical`, `seoslug`, `httpx2` |

## Quickstart

### 1. Configure

Create a file named `dbwarden.py` in your project root:

```python
from dbwarden import DbwardenDatabase

class Primary(DbwardenDatabase):
    database_name = "primary"
    database_type = "postgresql"
    database_url_sync = "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/myapp"
    database_url_async = "postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@localhost:5432/myapp"
    default = True
```

Concrete subclasses register automatically. `Primary.handle` is the same
`DatabaseHandle` returned by the function alternative, `database_config(...)`.
That function API remains fully supported, and some plugins use it in examples
or integration code.

### 2. Define your models

```python
from datetime import datetime
from sqlalchemy import DateTime, ForeignKey, Integer, String, Text
from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase, Mapped, mapped_column
from dbwarden.databases import TableMeta, IndexSpec


class Base(DeclarativeBase):
    pass

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"

    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    email: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(255), unique=True, nullable=False)
    bio: Mapped[str | None] = mapped_column(Text, nullable=True)

    class Meta(TableMeta):
        comment = "Core user accounts"


class Post(Base):
    __tablename__ = "posts"

    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    title: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(255), nullable=False)
    body: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(Text, nullable=False)
    user_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("users.id"), nullable=False)
    created_at: Mapped[datetime] = mapped_column(DateTime, nullable=False)

    class Meta(TableMeta):
        indexes = [
            IndexSpec(name="ix_posts_created_at", columns=["created_at"]),
        ]
```

### 3. Generate a migration

```bash
dbwarden init
dbwarden make-migrations "create initial tables"
```

Output: both upgrade and rollback in the same file.

```sql
-- upgrade
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    bio TEXT
);
COMMENT ON TABLE users IS 'Core user accounts';

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS posts (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    body TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS ix_posts_created_at ON posts (created_at);

-- rollback
DROP TABLE posts;
DROP TABLE users;
```

### 4. Apply

```bash
dbwarden migrate
```

### 5. Check status

```bash
dbwarden status
```

## Typical workflow

1. Define or update your SQLAlchemy models with `class Meta` annotations
2. Run `dbwarden make-migrations` to generate SQL
3. Review the generated `.sql` file and its rollback section
4. Run `dbwarden migrate` to apply
5. Verify with `dbwarden status`

---

## Migration engine

**Model-driven generation**: dbwarden reads your SQLAlchemy models directly. When you change a model, it diffs the new state against the last snapshot and generates the SQL to reconcile them.

**Plain SQL output**: Generated migrations are `.sql` files. No migration runtime, no generated Python. Review them, commit them, execute them directly against any environment.

**Rollback contract**: Generated migrations carry both upgrade and rollback sections. dbwarden emits executable rollback when it is safe, refuses placeholder rollback by default, and requires an explicit irreversible declaration when rollback cannot be produced.

**Schema snapshots**: After every migration, a checksummed JSON snapshot is written to `.dbwarden/schemas/`. Snapshots power rename detection, offline diffing, and column-level comparisons without querying the live database.

**Column-level diffing**: Type, nullability, default, and comment changes generate precise `ALTER COLUMN` statements.

**Typed `class Meta`**: The `_MetaValidator` metaclass validates every attribute on `class Meta` at import time. Typos that would have silently produced wrong DDL now raise `DBWardenConfigError` immediately.

```python
class Meta(MyTableMeta):
    my_engin = "InnoDB"  # DBWardenConfigError: unknown attr 'my_engin'
```

Supported index features:

- Partial indexes (`WHERE` clause)
- Covering indexes (`INCLUDE` columns)
- `USING` access methods
- `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` (PostgreSQL 15+)
- Per-column sort order
- Storage parameters (`WITH (fillfactor=...)`)
- ClickHouse skip indexes via `ChIndexSpec`

---

## Pre-deploy impact analysis

Before applying schema changes, dbwarden can scan your codebase to identify what will be affected. It uses AST analysis with a grep fallback, so results reflect actual code structure rather than text matches.

```bash
dbwarden check-impact 0042 --database primary
```

Output:

```
drop_column on users.username
  References: 2
    app/routes/users.py:34  attribute_access
      .username
    app/templates/profile.jinja2:12  grep
      user.username
```

Run this before any destructive deploy to surface breaking changes before they reach production.

---

## Offline migrations

Export model state once, then generate migrations on any machine without a database connection. Designed for CI pipelines and local development without a running database.

```bash
dbwarden export-models --database primary
git add .dbwarden/model_state.json
```

Then on any machine, with no database required:

```bash
dbwarden make-migrations "add bio column" --offline
```

The model state file is updated in place after each migration.

> **Important:** The model state file (`.dbwarden/model_state.*.json`) is used for offline migration generation. It is auto-generated and committed to version control. If accidentally deleted, restore it from git (`git checkout .dbwarden/model_state.*.json`) or regenerate it by running `dbwarden export-models --database <db>` against a live database. Without it, offline commands like `make-migrations --offline` will not work, but online operations are unaffected.

---

## Reverse-engineer models

Generate SQLAlchemy models from a live database with round-trip support (PostgreSQL, MySQL, ClickHouse, SQLite):

```bash
dbwarden generate-models --database primary --tables users,posts
dbwarden generate-models --database primary --base app.database:Base
```

By default each generated file declares its own `Base = declarative_base()`. Use `--base` to import a custom Base class from your project instead (e.g. `--base app.database:Base` or `--base app.database:DeclarativeBase`). The generated output includes `class Meta` blocks with all detected backend-specific metadata.

## Supported databases

| Database   | Round-trip | Notes                                       |
|------------|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| PostgreSQL | Full       | Primary backend, full schema fidelity       |
| MySQL      | Full       | DDL parity focus                            |
| ClickHouse | Full       | Analytics backend, MergeTree engine family  |
| SQLite     | Full       | Table rebuilds, WITHOUT ROWID/STRICT, generated columns |
| MariaDB    | No         | Schema layer complete; snapshot gaps remain |

### PostgreSQL

First-class support with full round-trip schema fidelity. Supported features include identity and generated columns, partitioning, table inheritance, exclusion constraints, deferrable constraints, advanced indexes via `PgIndexSpec`, per-column storage and collation, enum type creation, and full type normalization (SERIAL, TIMESTAMPTZ, NUMERIC, JSONB, UUID, ARRAY, TSTZRANGE).

### MySQL

Full round-trip support with `MyTableMeta` / `MyColumnMeta` and `my.field()` spec objects. Engine-level options (`my_engine`, `my_charset`, `my_collate`, `my_row_format`), column-level options (`unsigned`, `charset`, `collate`, `on_update`), and model reverse-engineering via `generate-models`.

```bash
uv add "dbwarden[mysql]"
```

### ClickHouse

First-class analytics backend support. MergeTree engine family via `ChEngineSpec`, replicated engines, projections, dictionaries, materialized views, skip indexes via `ChIndexSpec`, column codecs, `LowCardinality` and `Nullable` type wrappers.

```bash
uv add "dbwarden[clickhouse]"
```

### SQLite

Full round-trip support with `SqTableMeta` / `SqColumnMeta` and `sq.field()` spec objects. `WITHOUT ROWID` and `STRICT` tables, generated columns (`STORED` / `VIRTUAL`), per-column collation, and model reverse-engineering via `generate-models`. Changes SQLite's `ALTER TABLE` cannot express - column types, nullability, defaults, table constraints - are emitted as a table rebuild with a rebuild in the other direction as the rollback.

### MariaDB

Schema layer is complete with `MdbTableMeta` / `MdbColumnMeta` and `mdb.field()` spec objects including MariaDB-specific features (`page_compressed`, `invisible`, `without_overlaps`). Snapshot capture and reverse-engineering of MariaDB-specific features are not yet complete.

---

## Developer experience

**Dev mode**: Run SQLite locally against a PostgreSQL production schema with automatic SQL translation.

**Multi-database**: One project, multiple databases, full isolation between them. Use `model_tables` to assign table ownership per database when sharing model paths.

**Generate models**: Reverse-engineer a live database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, ClickHouse) into SQLAlchemy models with `dbwarden generate-models`.

**`dbwarden diff`**: Read-only comparison tool. Outputs as Rich table, JSON, or raw SQL. Supports `--offline` mode.

**Graceful disconnection**: Automatic retry logic and clear error messages when a database is unreachable.

**CLI automation**: Global `--json`, `--debug`, `--debug-level trace`, and `--perf` flags provide structured output and diagnostics. Configure optional databases with `skip_if_missing=True`; use `--disable-skip` to force connection failures, and treat exit code `3` as partial success.
