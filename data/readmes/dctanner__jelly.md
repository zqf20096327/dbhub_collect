# Jelly

**Jelly is a local multi-bot agent system**

The target user is someone building an running there whole business from a single VM (inspired by https://x.com/levelsio).

</p>

Real mobile UI with demonstration data and an original soundtrack; sudo execution and website sign-in are simulated.

- Run it on your on hardware: a Mac, Linux box or VM.
- Create as many agents as you want. Group into project directories.
- Access the web UI locally, or setup Tailscale and use from your laptop or phone (add it to your iPhone home screen and it feels like a native app).
- Use your existing ChatGPT subscription or API key.
- Agents can use your local Chrome browser. If the agent needs to login somewhere, you can take control of the browser anytime (using VNC in the web UI).
- If an agent needs sudo access, it can securely request it from you.
- Includes all the features you'd expect from an agent: shell tools, subagents, and MCP connections, file uploads, inline images, downloadable artifacts etc.
- Built with Bun, React, SQLite, and the [Pi agent harness](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi).

## Subagent progress

Delegated work appears in live, expandable cards in the conversation. Open a
card to inspect its task, activity, available thinking summaries, messages and
tool calls/results. Completed cards remain in history.

Jelly keeps the parent interactive while async children work and gives its model
a compact status checkpoint approximately every five minutes. Supervisor requests
and completion notifications use Pi's native delivery. Explicit foreground calls
remain supported, but a checkpoint cannot interrupt an open tool.

Transcripts show finalized, provider-exposed content—not hidden reasoning.
Expired artifacts and forked sessions without a safe inherited-context boundary
are explicitly unavailable. See [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#subagent-observability).

## Browser and patch tools

Agents can inspect bounded visible browser text and element references, click/fill non-secret fields, manage session-local tabs, scroll, wait for text/readiness, and read redacted error diagnostics. These share the existing per-agent isolation and private-control gate. References expire on new observations/navigation/handoff; snapshots cover the top-level DOM only. Reference actions use synthetic events, and secret-field detection is heuristic—always use private browser sign-in for credentials.

`apply_patch` adds Codex-style multi-file add/update/delete/move patches on both OpenAI API and ChatGPT, alongside unchanged Pi `edit`/`write`. It requires exact unique context and rejects symlinks, hardlinked sources and unsupported text. Paths are not sandboxed. Preflight checks the whole patch, but filesystem writes are **not transactional**: failures can leave partial changes, reported in a mutation ledger. Limits are 1 MiB per patch/file, 64 operations and 16 MiB combined working set.

See [tool APIs and limitations](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#structured-browser-tools). `bun run check` includes structured-browser Chromium tests, patch filesystem tests and local provider-transport tests; `bun run test:desktop` additionally requires the Linux desktop runtime.

## Quick start

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) **1.3.9+** and **Node.js 24+** (for subagent runners and CLI dependencies). Linux is required for the managed browser desktop and sudo handoffs.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dctanner/jelly.git
cd jelly
bun install
bun run dev
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:5173**. **A ChatGPT subscription or OpenAI API key is required to run agents.** Connect your account or add a key in Settings before sending a message. Automatic mode prefers ChatGPT, then an API key; there is no no-key demo mode. Model availability depends on your account.

Select **GPT-6 Astra Ultrafast** in Settings → Model or the composer's model menu
for eligible ChatGPT subscriptions (Pro 500 or Enterprise) or OpenAI API access.
This requests Astra with `service_tier: "ultrafast"`; standard Astra remains the
default. [Ultrafast has higher API pricing and separate limits](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/ultrafast-mode).
Account-access errors are surfaced rather than silently falling back to standard.
The selection covers chat turns, tool continuations, naming, and compaction;
Pi subagents still use their own service-tier settings (they inherit Astra and effort,
not Jelly's Ultrafast selection).

Optional environment settings are documented in [`.env.example`](.env.example). Put local values in `.env.local`, which is ignored by Git. Set `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` to enable web search and fetching.

### Production

```sh
bun run build
bun start
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:3100**. Stop development first; both modes use API port 3100 by default. Production has no hot reload—restart after code changes when agents are idle. Development backend reloads interrupt active runs; set `JELLY_WATCH_API=0` to disable them.

Development serves only frontend source and assets; instance data, server source, and other repository files are not downloadable through Vite. Keep credentials and private files out of `public/`, `src/client/`, `src/shared/`, and `node_modules/`.

ChatGPT sign-in uses a one-time device code. Open the approval link shown in Settings, enter the code, and Jelly connects automatically. This works over Tailscale without a localhost redirect. If needed, enable device-code login in your ChatGPT security settings or ask your workspace admin.

### Optional browser desktop

On Debian/Ubuntu x86-64, with Google Chrome or Chromium already installed:

```sh
bun run setup:desktop
```

Set `JELLY_BROWSER_PATH` if the browser is outside its usual system location.

If browser control is stuck after a session expires or cookies are lost, open **Agent computer → Recover lost control…**. Confirming recovery disconnects the old controller, discards private tabs and the remote clipboard, and gives you a blank desktop. Website sign-ins remain stored. Agents stay paused until you explicitly return control.

### Administrator commands

Agents can use `request_sudo` to run commands with root privileges—for example, to install packages or manage system services. If your sudo policy permits, the command runs immediately. Otherwise, Jelly shows the command for review and asks for your password in a private authentication card, never in chat. The password is not sent to the model or saved by Jelly.

Requires Linux, `sudo` with askpass support, and `/usr/bin/python3`.

## Security and local data

**Jelly is a trusted-user tool, not a sandbox.** Agents can execute shell commands and access files with your OS user's permissions, without per-tool approval. Sudo commands run immediately when your policy permits; otherwise Jelly requests private authentication.

Keep Jelly on loopback or a trusted Tailscale network. Do not expose it directly to the public internet. Anyone with network access to the app may gain control of its tools. `bun run dev:tailscale` enables private tailnet access.

Conversations, credentials, browser profiles, and artifacts live in `.jelly/` by default. User-wide MCP configuration and OAuth caches live in `~/.jelly/`. Neither belongs in source control. Stop Jelly before backing up its instance data. Model conversations are sent to your chosen provider; local storage does not mean local inference.

## Development

```sh
bun run check   # TypeScript, tests, and production build
```

Tests use temporary data and deterministic fixtures; no paid model calls are required. See [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [design](docs/DESIGN.md), and the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

### Clipboard during browser control

In **Agent computer**, choose **Take control**. Once connected, **Paste to remote**
reads this device's text clipboard and pastes into the focused remote field.
**Copy from remote** copies the remote clipboard back to this device; first select
and copy text inside the remote browser. If browser permissions or HTTP prevent
clipboard access, Jelly provides a private manual paste/select-and-copy form.

Clipboard transfers are text-only, limited to 12,000 characters, and available
only to the controlling window. They are not sent to agents, chat history, or logs.
Returning control clears the remote clipboard; it does not clear this device's
clipboard. The desktop runtime now requires `xclip`; run `bun run setup:desktop`
to update an older installation if it is not already installed on the host.

## Automatic agent names

The top-left **+** immediately creates and opens **New Agent**, without a form.
It inherits the current project (or gets a private workspace outside a project).
Before the first message, click the centered name or avatar to edit it in place.
Name edits save with Enter or on blur (Escape cancels); avatar changes save when selected.
After the first message, the pill moves to the header and opens the profile edit form
directly. The separate options button still exposes workspace and agent actions.
When its first message is sent, Jelly makes
one small, tool-free OpenAI request through the selected ChatGPT subscription or
API connection to suggest a sea-themed name related to that message. The new name
appears in the agent list and conversation header before the agent begins work.

Editing and saving the name before sending the first message opts out—even if you
change it back to **New Agent**. Editing only instructions or the avatar does not.
Existing agents retain their names. Naming failures/timeouts keep **New Agent** and
do not stop the task or retry the naming request on subsequent messages.

### Independent agent browsers

Each agent opens its own browser window, profile, and private desktop on demand.
Normal runs reuse that agent's browser; other agents have separate tabs, focus,
clipboard and human-control state. The Computer panel follows the selected agent;
a login handoff opens the requesting agent's browser. Switching agents disconnects
the old viewer and clears the panel's private clipboard text, but does not return
human control. Return control explicitly when finished signing in.

At most eight browser sessions can be allocated at once. **Close browser session**
releases an agent's desktop resources (return human control first); opening it again
reuses its profile. Server shutdown also closes all desktops. New isolated profiles
live under `browser-sessions/<hashed-agent-id>/`; existing `browser-profile` and
`browser-home` data is retained untouched, not copied. You may need to sign in again.

Stop prevents queued browser actions from executing and discards cancelled results.
An action already sent to Chromium may still finish; Stop cannot undo navigation,
clicks, typing, or their website side effects.
