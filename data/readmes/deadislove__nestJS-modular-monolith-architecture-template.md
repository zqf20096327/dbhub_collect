## 📌 Project Overview
A modular, scalable, and enterprise-ready backend architecture built with NestJS.

This project is designed to accelerate backend development, especially for rapid Proof-of-Concept (PoC) efforts, new system bootstrapping, or as a clean foundation for evolving from a monolith to microservices. It embraces the modular monolith pattern—intentionally excluding Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to reduce complexity and promote faster iteration.

Ideal for enterprises and startups, this template helps teams progress from PoC to Product-Market Fit (PMC) by offering:

- A structured yet flexible modular architecture
- Integrated logger mechanism for operational insight
- A database factory pattern supporting multiple databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)

If you're looking for a reliable and pragmatic backend starter—whether for demos, PoC trials, or real-world product foundations—this project can help you move fast with confidence.

## 🏗 Project Structure & Architecture
This project follows a modular monolith architecture, emphasizing clear separation of concerns while maintaining the simplicity of a monolithic deployment. The folder layout encourages scalable, testable, and maintainable codebases.

## 🧩 Modular Breakdown

- common/: Cross-cutting concerns such as custom exception filters, response interceptors, and centralized logging.
- config/: Modular database configuration with support for SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL, using a database factory pattern.
- modules/: Business logic split into independently maintainable feature modules (e.g., user, product), each with:

  - controllers/: Handle HTTP requests
  - services/: Core business logic
  - repositories/: Database access logic
  - dto/, entities/, facades/: Well-structured data handling

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ Modular Monolith Structure – Clear, maintainable boundaries between features while remaining deployable as a single unit.
- 🧪 Built-in e2e Testing – Includes Jest test setup to validate end-to-end functionality.
- 📦 Multi-Database Support – Easily switch between SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL via plug-and-play configuration.
- 🪵 Advanced Logging – Centralized file-based logging system with daily rotation (e.g., logs/application-YYYY-MM-DD.log).
- 📁 Feature-Based Modular Design – Each domain (e.g., user/product) is fully encapsulated with its own logic.
- ⚙️ Docker & Compose Ready – Start instantly with docker-compose setups for PostgreSQL and SQLite.

## 💡 Design Principles and Benefits

### 🔄 Simplicity Over Complexity
Avoids over-engineering by not enforcing Clean Architecture or full DDD. Ideal for fast-moving projects, PoCs, or early-stage product validation.

### 📦 Modular Without Microservices
All domain modules are logically isolated, enabling easier future migration to microservices when scale demands it—without premature complexity.

### 🌱 Startup & Enterprise Friendly
Whether you're a lean startup or an enterprise team, this template provides a solid base to:

- Quickly prototype ideas with real APIs
- Gradually scale into a production-grade product
- Demo to stakeholders using different DB engines

### ⚡ PoC to PMC Ready
Designed to support the lifecycle from Proof-of-Concept (PoC) to Product-Market Fit (PMC), offering balance between agility and structure.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps to get your modular monolith project up and running in minutes.

1. Clone the Template

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/modular-monolith-architecture.git
cd modular-monolith-architecture
```

2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the sample environment file and customize it if needed:

```bash
cp sample.env .env
```

4. Run the Application (Development Mode)

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

By default, the API will be available at:
👉 http://localhost:3000

5. Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

6. Use Docker (Optional)

- Run with SQLite (default)

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.sqlite.yml up
```

- Run with PostgreSQL

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.postgresql.yml up
