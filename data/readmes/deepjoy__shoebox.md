A local S3-compatible server for your files. Find duplicates, verify integrity, zero config.

## Install

**Prerequisites:** [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) must be installed for the recommended method. Check with `docker --version`.

```bash
# Docker (recommended)
docker pull ghcr.io/deepjoy/shoebox:latest

# Or via Cargo (no Docker needed)
cargo install shoebox
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Point Shoebox at a directory
shoebox ~/Photos

# Or with Docker
docker run -it --rm -p 9000:9000 -v ~/Photos:/photos ghcr.io/deepjoy/shoebox /photos

# Output:
# Serving 1 bucket on http://localhost:9000
#   photos → /home/user/Photos
```

Files already on disk appear in S3 immediately — no uploading required. Credentials are generated on first run and printed in the output. To enable browser access (CORS), follow the on-screen instructions — or use the AWS CLI:

```bash
# Configure credentials (printed on first run)
aws configure --profile shoebox

# List objects
aws --profile shoebox --endpoint-url http://localhost:9000 s3 ls s3://photos/
```

## Features

- **S3-compatible API** — works with AWS CLI, rclone, and any S3 SDK out of the box
- **Zero-config startup** — just point at directories, no cloud account or configuration needed
- **Duplicate detection** — find and merge duplicate files and directories via content hashing
- **Integrity verification** — scheduled checks to detect bit rot and data corruption
- **Filesystem sync** — background scanning with move detection, real-time file watching
- **Authentication** — AWS Signature V4, per-bucket credentials, pre-signed URLs
- **Multipart uploads** — full support for large file uploads
- **CORS** — browser-based clients work out of the box
- **Webhook notifications** — get notified on object events (put, delete, copy)
- **Single binary, ~18MB** — no runtime dependencies

## Duplicate Detection

Shoebox hashes every file (SHA-256) in the background. Finding duplicates is a query:

```bash
$ shoebox duplicates ~/Photos --format table

Duplicate groups (2 groups, 5 files, 3 duplicates):

  Hash (SHA-256)       Size   Files
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  a]3f…c8d1            32 B   3 copies
    originals/sunset.txt
    backup/sunset.txt        ← duplicate
    edited/sunset-copy.txt   ← duplicate

  7b2e…f104            26 B   2 copies
    originals/mountain.txt
    backup/mountain.txt      ← duplicate
```

## Webapp

A companion browser UI is available at **https://deepjoy.github.io/shoebox-webapp/**.

Browse buckets, view objects, and see duplicate groups visually — no CLI needed. The webapp talks directly to your local Shoebox server via the S3 API.

**CORS setup** (required for browser access) — Shoebox prints this command on startup, just copy and run it:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='<from startup output>'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='<from startup output>'
export BUCKET='photos'

curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9000/${BUCKET}?cors" \
  --aws-sigv4 "aws:amz:us-east-1:s3" \
  --user "$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"allowed_origins":["*"],"allowed_methods":["GET","PUT","POST","DELETE","HEAD"],"allowed_headers":["*"],"expose_headers":["ETag","x-amz-request-id"],"max_age_seconds":3600}]'
```

## Who It's For

- **Developers** — test S3 integrations without cloud dependencies, work offline
- **Home users** — expose NAS storage to S3-compatible backup tools, find duplicates with a single query
- **Archivists** — verify file integrity with content hashes, detect bit rot
- **Privacy-conscious users** — keep files local, no account required, no telemetry

## When Not to Use Shoebox

See [docs/when-not-to-use-shoebox.md](docs/when-not-to-use-shoebox.md) for an honest assessment of limitations, including:

- Strong consistency requirements
- Distributed / multi-node storage
- \>10TB of data
- Enterprise S3 features (object lock, lifecycle policies, versioning)
- High-throughput ingestion (thousands of files/second)

## Disclaimer

Shoebox operates directly on your existing files — it does **not** copy data into a separate storage directory. S3 operations like `DeleteObject` and `PutObject` will modify or remove real files on disk. **Back up anything irreplaceable before use.** This is pre-1.0 software provided "as is" with no warranty. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details. The authors are not liable for any data loss.

## Background

I had 2TB of photos across 3 drives — backups of backups, originals I was afraid to delete. I set out to find duplicate photos and accidentally designed a local S3 server. If an object store knows the content hash of every file, duplicates are just a query. This is a personal project built in public — expect breaking changes before 1.0. If you have thoughts on the approach, [open an issue](https://github.com/deepjoy/shoebox/issues) or start a discussion.
