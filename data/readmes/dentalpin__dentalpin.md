## Why DentalPin?

Dental clinics around the world share the same fundamental needs: managing patients, scheduling appointments, tracking treatments, and running their practice efficiently. Yet the software landscape is fragmented into dozens of localized, closed-source solutions that lock clinics into expensive contracts and outdated technology.

**We believe it's time for a change.**

DentalPin is built on a simple premise: **one open platform for dental clinics everywhere**. Not another regional solution, but a global foundation that any clinic can adopt, any developer can extend, and any community can localize.

### Why now?

AI has fundamentally changed what small teams can build. Features that once required large development departments can now be implemented in days. This is our window to create the source-available dental software (BSL 1.1, converting to Apache 2.0 four years after publication) that should have existed years ago—before clinics got locked into legacy systems they can't escape.

### Our principles

- **Source-Available (BSL 1.1)** — Your clinic data belongs to you. Your software should too.
- **Modular** — Start simple, add what you need. Don't pay for features you'll never use.
- **Global by Design** — Built for localization from day one. Same core, any language, any country.
- **API-First** — Every feature is an API. Integrate with anything, automate everything.
- **AI-Ready** — Structured for the AI era. Ready for intelligent scheduling, clinical decision support, and workflow automation.

### The vision

We're not just building software—we're building the foundation for an ecosystem. A platform where developers contribute modules, clinics share improvements, and the entire dental community benefits from collective innovation.

Clinics deserve better than closed, expensive software from the last decade. DentalPin is the open alternative.

## ✨ AI Copilot

DentalPin ships with a built-in **agentic AI assistant** that turns the whole clinic into something you can simply talk to. Ask it to find a patient, free up a slot, chase an unanswered budget, or brief you on the day ahead — in plain Spanish or English — and it acts on your real data.

![AI Copilot](docs/screenshots/ia.png)

This isn't a chatbot bolted on top. The Copilot is a true agent that **plans and executes multi-step tasks** by calling the same operations the UI does, across patients, schedule, recalls, budgets, payments, and reports.

- **It does, not just answers.** The agent runs real tools — search patients, book or reschedule appointments, record a payment, pull this month's collections — and chains them to complete a task end to end.
- **It can never overstep your role.** Every tool call is re-checked against the calling user's RBAC permissions at the execution chokepoint. The Copilot can see and do *exactly* what that user could do through the UI — nothing more, scoped to their clinic.
- **Your data is protected.** PHI is redacted before anything leaves for the LLM provider: patient names, phones, emails, and IDs are swapped for deterministic tokens, and free-text clinical tools are excluded from the cloud path entirely. Redaction is on by default.
- **Writes ask first.** Any action that changes data (booking, payments, edits) pauses mid-conversation for your explicit confirmation before it runs.
- **Guided workflows.** Ready-made playbooks — *Daily briefing*, *Prepare a visit*, *Fill a gap*, *Due recalls*, *Unanswered budgets* — kick off common multi-step jobs in one tap.
- **Proactive briefings.** Opt in to a deterministic morning digest emailed to your team, summarizing the day's schedule, due recalls, and open budgets — no LLM, no PHI off-site.
- **Modular by design.** The Copilot consumes tools published by each module through a shared registry; every module contributes its own capabilities, so the agent grows automatically as new modules are installed.

Vendor-agnostic under the hood (an LLM-provider abstraction), with provider, model, and per-clinic token budgets configurable per deployment. Architecture: [docs/technical/copilot-agentic-architecture.md](docs/technical/copilot-agentic-architecture.md).

## Install

Prebuilt images, no clone, no build. On any server with Docker:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dentalpin/dentalpin/main/docker-compose.prod.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dentalpin/dentalpin/main/Caddyfile
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dentalpin/dentalpin/main/.env.prod.example

# Set PUBLIC_URL, POSTGRES_PASSWORD and SECRET_KEY in .env, then:
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Point a domain at the server, set `PUBLIC_URL=https://your-domain`, and TLS is
provisioned on first boot — Caddy fronts both services on a single origin, so
there is no CORS and no certificate to renew. Set `SEED_ON_STARTUP=1` to load
the demo clinic and look around before going live.

## Features

### AI Copilot
- **Agentic Assistant** — Conversational agent that plans and executes multi-step tasks across patients, schedule, recalls, budgets, payments, and reports by calling real operations
- **RBAC Parity** — Every action re-checked against the user's permissions; the agent can only do what that user could through the UI, scoped to their clinic
- **PHI Redaction** — Patient identifiers tokenized before reaching the LLM; free-text clinical data stays off the cloud path. On by default
- **Confirmed Writes** — Data-changing actions pause for explicit user confirmation mid-conversation
- **Workflows & Digest** — One-tap playbooks (daily briefing, prepare a visit, fill a gap) plus an opt-in proactive morning email digest
- **Multilingual & Vendor-Agnostic** — Talks to you in the language of your UI; configurable LLM provider, model, and per-clinic token budget

### Clinical Management
- **Patient Records** — Complete patient profiles with personal data, contact info, medical history, and notes
- **Dental Chart (Odontogram)** — Interactive tooth diagram with treatment tracking per tooth/surface
- **Appointment Calendar** — Weekly and daily views with drag & drop, professional columns, conflict detection
- **Treatment Catalog** — Customizable catalog with codes, prices, VAT types, and categories

### Financial Management

- **Professional Management** — Assign appointments to specific dentists/hygienists

### User Experience
- **Visual Selectors** — Smart dropdowns showing recent patients and popular treatments
- **Ten-Language Interface** — English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Tamil, German, Hungarian, Polish, Italian and Arabic — core app and every module
- **Dark Mode** — System-aware theme switching
- **Responsive Design** — Works on desktop and tablet

### Technical Features
- **Modular Architecture** — Plugin-based system for easy extensibility

## Languages

The interface ships in **ten languages** — English, Español, Français, Português,
தமிழ் (Tamil), Deutsch, Magyar, Polski, Italiano and العربية (Arabic) — covering the core app **and
every module layer**, with a CI-enforced key-parity test so locales can't silently
drift. Polish uses its full three-form plural rules.

Patient-facing communications (email templates, PDFs) currently render in
**five languages** (es, en, fr, pt, ta); each clinic picks its communication
language independently of the staff UI language.

Want your language? Adding one is a translation-only contribution — see the
[i18n issues](https://github.com/dentalpin/dentalpin/issues?q=label%3Ai18n) or
open a new one.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose (4GB RAM is enough for the dev stack; building
  the production frontend image from `Dockerfile.prod` needs 6GB+ — see the
  `NODE_OPTIONS` note there)
- Python 3.11+ (for local backend development)
- Node.js 18+ (for local frontend development)

### Running locally

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up

# Or run backend separately
cd backend
pip install -e ".[dev]"
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Or run frontend separately
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Database Management

```bash
# Reset database and run migrations
./scripts/reset-db.sh

# Seed demo data (English - default)
./scripts/seed-demo.sh

# Seed demo data (Spanish)
./scripts/seed-demo.sh --lang es

# Full setup (reset + seed in one command)
./scripts/setup-demo.sh
```

### Running tests

```bash
# Backend unit + integration (in Docker)
docker-compose exec backend python -m pytest -v

# Slow Alembic round-trip (opt-in, see docs/technical/creating-modules.md)
docker-compose exec backend python -m pytest -v -m alembic_roundtrip

# Frontend unit (vitest)
cd frontend
npm run test
```

**Browser E2E (Playwright)** lives in `frontend/tests/e2e/` and drives
the full stack at `localhost:3000` → `:8000`. Runs on the host because
the Alpine frontend container can't launch Chromium.

```bash
# One-time setup
(cd frontend && npm install && npx playwright install chromium)

# Make sure the stack is up + seeded first
docker-compose up -d
./scripts/seed-demo.sh

# Full E2E suite (nav + RBAC + patient detail smoke)
./scripts/e2e.sh

# Single file
./scripts/e2e.sh rbac

# Interactive UI
./scripts/e2e.sh --ui
```

Full runbook + fixture reference: [docs/technical/e2e-testing.md](docs/technical/e2e-testing.md).

## Architecture

DentalPin uses a modular plugin architecture. Each feature is a self-contained module that:
- Declares its SQLAlchemy models
- Provides a FastAPI router
- Can subscribe to events from other modules

See [ADR 0001 — modular plugin architecture](docs/adr/0001-modular-plugin-architecture.md) and [docs/technical/creating-modules.md](docs/technical/creating-modules.md) for details.
