[![MCP Toplist](https://mcptoplist.com/badge/io.github.devopam%2Fmcpg.svg)](https://mcptoplist.com/server/io.github.devopam%2Fmcpg)

**A production-grade [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
server for PostgreSQL.** It lets AI agents safely inspect, query, operate, and
tune a Postgres database — 254 tools spanning catalog introspection,
query intelligence, natural-language SQL, structural diffs, hybrid search,
graph queries, data movement, live ops, and more.

> **Try it live:** point an MCP client — or the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) — at the hosted, read-only demo endpoint `https://devopam-mcpg-demo.hf.space/mcp`. It serves read tools against throwaway demo data; for real use, run MCPg next to your own database (see [Quick start](#quick-start)).

| Aspect              | MCPg                              |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Safety              | Read-only default + AST validation |
| Transport           | stdio + HTTP/SSE                  |
| Install             | `pip install mcpg`                |
| Postgres Versions   | 14–19                             |
| Key Differentiator  | Production observability + multi-tenancy |

## Why MCPg

- **Safe by default.** Read-only access mode. Every user-supplied SQL
  statement parses through a validated AST allowlist before execution.
  Names that reach PostgreSQL as SQL identifiers are encoded with
  delimited-identifier quoting (see [Identifier policy](docs/identifier-policy.md)),
  not rejected merely for containing hyphens or other legal characters.
  Capabilities like DDL, shell, and `LISTEN/NOTIFY` are off until you
  opt in. Every tool publishes MCP `ToolAnnotations` (`readOnlyHint`,
  `openWorldHint`) derived from those same gates, so clients can
  auto-approve reads and gate writes without guessing.
- **One server, broad surface.** Application data access (queries, search,
  cursors, NL→SQL) *and* DBA-grade operations (health checks, index tuning,
  EXPLAIN analysis, locks, vacuum, dumps, replicas, migrations) in a
  single MCP server. Agents don't have to switch tools to switch tasks.
- **PostgreSQL-native everything.** No ORM, no abstraction tax — uses
  `psycopg3` directly, speaks every `pg_*` system view, integrates with
  TimescaleDB, pgvector, PostGIS, Apache AGE, and `pg_stat_statements`
  where they're available, and degrades gracefully when they aren't.
- **Production-shaped, not demo-shaped.** Connection pooling, per-request
  `SET ROLE` multi-tenancy, read-replica routing with degraded-host
  detection, server-side cursors with dedicated connections,
  rate-limiting, audit trail with regex redaction, PG TLS enforcement
  on startup, OIDC JWT bearer auth, per-session statement / lock
  timeouts.
- **Observability built in.** Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint on the
  HTTP transport surfaces `mcpg_tool_calls_total{tool,status}` +
  `mcpg_tool_duration_seconds`. Every tool call records a structured
  audit event with credential-redacted arguments.
- **Test-driven, multi-version.** 2,500+ unit tests plus an integration
  suite that runs against a real PostgreSQL container in CI — matrix
  covers PG **14, 15, 16, 17, 18** on every push, plus PG **19 (beta)**
  as an experimental (non-blocking) entry tracked under issue #120.

## Install

### From PyPI (recommended)

```bash
pip install mcpg
# or, in an isolated venv exposed globally:
uv tool install mcpg
```

Verify:

```bash
mcpg --version
```

### Docker

Pull the pre-built image from the GitHub Container Registry (published
on every tagged release — `:latest` tracks the newest, or pin a version
like `:0.6.5`):

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/devopam/mcpg:latest
docker run --rm --name mcpg -p 8000:8000 \
    -e MCPG_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db \
    -e MCPG_ACCESS_MODE=read-only \
    ghcr.io/devopam/mcpg:latest
```

On **Windows PowerShell** replace the trailing `\` with a backtick `` ` ``
(or put the command on one line); the [installation
guide](docs/installation.md#option-2--docker) has ready-to-copy
Linux/macOS, PowerShell, and Command Prompt blocks.

Or build it yourself from source:

```bash
docker build -t mcpg https://github.com/devopam/MCPg.git
```

Multi-stage image: runtime stage drops the build toolchain, runs as
`uid=10001 / gid=10001` with `nologin` shell, application files
root-owned and read-only to the runtime user.

### From source (developers)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devopam/MCPg && cd MCPg
uv sync
```

`uv sync` creates a venv with all runtime + dev dependencies and exposes
the `mcpg` console script.

More detail in the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/devopam/MCPg/blob/main/docs/installation.md).

[![Claude Desktop](https://img.shields.io/badge/Claude_Desktop-.mcpb-D97757?logo=claude)](https://github.com/devopam/MCPg/releases/latest)
— setup for Windsurf, JetBrains, Zed, Cline, Antigravity, Qwen Code, Perplexity,
ChatGPT, Copilot Studio, Continue, and HTTP
clients in the [integrations guide](docs/integrations.md).

### One-click install in Claude Desktop (.mcpb)

Download `mcpg-<version>.mcpb` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/devopam/MCPg/releases/latest) and
double-click it (or drag it into Claude Desktop's Settings →
Extensions). You'll be prompted for your PostgreSQL connection URL —
stored in the OS keychain — and an access mode (defaults to
read-only). That's the whole install: the bundle is ~2 kB and the
host resolves the pinned `mcpg` release from PyPI for your platform.

### Or wire it up manually (stdio transport)

Drop this into your `claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS:
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`;
Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcpg": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcpg"],
      "env": {
        "MCPG_DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. The MCPg toolset is now available to the model.
You can ask Claude things like:

> *"What schemas exist in this database? For each one, summarise the
> three biggest tables."*

> *"Why is this query slow?
> `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 42 ORDER BY created_at DESC`"*

### No interesting data yet? Seed the demo dataset

```bash
MCPG_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... mcpg --demo
```

One command seeds a small, curated e-commerce dataset (3,000 orders,
900 product reviews, deliberately planted flaws) into an `mcpg_demo`
schema — engineered so the index advisor, query-plan analysis,
full-text search, PII audit, and graph projection all have something
real to find on your first try. See the
[guided tour](docs/demo.md) for a captured walkthrough, and remove it
any time with `mcpg --demo-drop`.

### Run as an HTTP server (for IDE integrations, web apps, etc.)

```bash
MCPG_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb \
MCPG_TRANSPORT=streamable-http \
MCPG_HTTP_PORT=8000 \
mcpg
```

Then point any MCP-aware client at `http://localhost:8000/mcp` (or
`/sse` for the SSE transport). The HTTP transport refuses to start
unless it's authenticated — set `MCPG_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN=...` for a static
bearer, or `MCPG_AUTH_MODE=oidc` for full JWT validation against an
OIDC issuer. To deliberately run without auth (not recommended), set
`MCPG_HTTP_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=true`.

---

## Configuration

MCPg is configured **entirely through environment variables** — no
config file, no flags (the CLI's `--version` / `--demo` / `--demo-drop`
are one-shot commands, not configuration). The only required one is
`MCPG_DATABASE_URL`; everything else has a safe default.

### Common scenarios

| Scenario | Set |
|---|---|
| Local exploration, read-only | `MCPG_DATABASE_URL` |
| Read-write app data access | `MCPG_ACCESS_MODE=restricted` |
| DBA toolkit (DDL, vacuum, etc.) | `MCPG_ACCESS_MODE=unrestricted` + `MCPG_ALLOW_DDL=true` |
| HTTP transport with bearer auth | `MCPG_TRANSPORT=streamable-http` + `MCPG_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN=…` |
| Multi-tenant SaaS | `MCPG_DEFAULT_ROLE=tenant_a` + `MCPG_ALLOWED_ROLES=tenant_a,tenant_b,…` |
| Read-replica fan-out | `MCPG_REPLICA_URLS=postgresql://…?sslmode=require,postgresql://…?sslmode=require` |
| NL→SQL — single provider | Set any one vendor key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `HF_TOKEN`, … — 22 built-in providers). MCPg auto-picks the default. |
| NL→SQL — multiple providers, caller picks | Set all vendor keys you want active. Each call to `translate_nl_to_sql` can pass `provider="…"` (any configured built-in or custom). |

### Full reference

#### Core

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MCPG_DATABASE_URL` | **required** | Primary PostgreSQL DSN. Supports URI (`postgresql://…`) and keyword (`host=… user=…`) forms. Remote hosts require `sslmode=require` (or stronger). |
| `MCPG_ACCESS_MODE` | `read-only` | `read-only` \| `restricted` (allows write tools) \| `unrestricted` (also unlocks DBA tools when paired with the gate vars). |
| `MCPG_TRANSPORT` | `stdio` | `stdio` (default, for Claude Desktop) \| `streamable-http` \| `sse`. |
| `MCPG_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | `DEBUG` \| `INFO` \| `WARNING` \| `ERROR` \| `CRITICAL`. |
| `MCPG_HTTP_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address for HTTP transports. Set to `0.0.0.0` inside containers. |
| `MCPG_HTTP_PORT` | `8000` | Listen port for HTTP transports (1–65535). |

#### Capability gates (opt-in for higher-blast-radius tools)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MCPG_ALLOW_DDL` | `false` | Expose DDL tools (`run_ddl`, `create_graph`, `drop_graph`, hypertable tools, migration tools). Requires `MCPG_ACCESS_MODE=unrestricted`. |
| `MCPG_ALLOW_SHELL` | `false` | Expose subprocess-backed tools (`dump_database`, `restore_database`, `run_pg_binary`). Required PG client binaries must be on `PATH`. |
| `MCPG_ALLOW_LISTEN` | `false` | Expose `LISTEN/NOTIFY` tools (`subscribe_channel`, `poll_notifications`, `unsubscribe_channel`, `list_notification_subscriptions`). |

#### Authentication (HTTP transports only)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MCPG_AUTH_MODE` | `static` | `static` (compare bearer to `MCPG_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN`) \| `oidc` (full JWT validation). |
| `MCPG_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN` | — | Required bearer token when `MCPG_AUTH_MODE=static`. Constant-time compare. The HTTP transport refuses to start (`ConfigError`) unless this, `MCPG_AUTH_MODE=oidc`, or `MCPG_HTTP_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=true` is set. |
| `MCPG_HTTP_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED` | `false` | Explicit opt-out of the HTTP transport's fail-closed auth check. Loudly logged on every startup when set; not recommended. |
| `MCPG_OIDC_ISSUER` | — | OIDC issuer URL (required when `MCPG_AUTH_MODE=oidc`). |
| `MCPG_OIDC_AUDIENCE` | — | Expected `aud` claim (required when `MCPG_AUTH_MODE=oidc`). |
| `MCPG_OIDC_JWKS_URL` | discovered | Override JWKS endpoint (auto-discovered from issuer's `.well-known` otherwise). |
| `MCPG_OIDC_ROLE_CLAIM` | — | JWT claim whose value becomes the per-request PG role (`SET LOCAL ROLE`). Composes with the tenancy driver. |

#### HTTP hardening (HTTP transports only)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MCPG_HTTP_MAX_BODY_BYTES` | `1048576` | (1 MiB) Request bodies above this get a `413`. Counts streamed bytes, so a missing/lying `Content-Length` can't bypass it. |
| `MCPG_HTTP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | — | Comma-separated CORS allowlist. Unset = no CORS middleware (no cross-origin headers emitted). |
| `MCPG_HTTP_HSTS_MAX_AGE` | `63072000` | `Strict-Transport-Security` max-age (2 years, OWASP's current recommendation). `0` disables the HSTS header. Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy) are always added unless the app already set them. |
| `MCPG_HTTP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `0` | Per-request wall-clock cap (`504` on expiry). `0` = disabled. Leave off if you rely on long-lived SSE / streamable-http streams — a hard cap also severs those. |
| `MCPG_HTTP_TRUSTED_HOSTS` | — | Comma-separated list of allowed `Host` header values (wildcards like `*.example.com` supported). Unset = no host-header validation (current behaviour). When set, requests with a non-matching Host get a `400` via Starlette's `TrustedHostMiddleware`. |

#### Multi-tenancy (`SET ROLE`)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MCPG_DEFAULT_ROLE` | — | Static PG role applied to every query. Identifier-validated. |
| `MCPG_ALLOWED_ROLES` | — | Comma-separated allowlist. When set, the `X-MCPG-Role` header / OIDC role claim must be in this list. |

#### Read replicas

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MCPG_REPLICA_URLS` | — | Comma-separated replica DSNs. `force_readonly` queries round-robin across healthy replicas; primary fallback on failure; 30 s degraded-replica retry window. |

#### Multiple databases (read-only secondaries)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MCPG_SECONDARY_DATABASE_URLS` | — | Comma- or newline-separated `name=dsn` entries naming additional **read-only** databases this one server can serve (e.g. `analytics=postgresql://…?sslmode=require,reporting=postgresql://…?sslmode=require`). Read-capable tools accept an optional `database` argument selecting a secondary by name; omit it for the primary. Secondaries are read-only — **PostgreSQL-enforced** (every query runs in a `READ ONLY` transaction), so writes / DDL / shell / migrate always target the primary. Names must be simple identifiers (`[a-z0-9_]+`), unique, and not `primary` (the reserved id of `MCPG_DATABASE_URL`). Same TLS rules as the primary DSN. Call `list_databases` to discover the configured ids and their reachability. |

#### Pool / timeouts / TLS

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MCPG_POOL_MIN_SIZE` | `1` | Minimum pool connections. |
| `MCPG_POOL_MAX_SIZE` | `5` | Maximum pool connections. Must be ≥ `MCPG_POOL_MIN_SIZE`. |
| `MCPG_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | Per-session `statement_timeout` set on connection checkout. Runaway queries self-terminate. |
| `MCPG_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS` | `5000` | Per-session `lock_timeout`. Hanging lock waits self-terminate. |
| `MCPG_ENABLE_ANALYTICAL_QUERIES` | `true` | Expose `run_analytical_query` (long-running reads on an isolated pool). Set `false` to withdraw the tool. |
| `MCPG_ANALYTICAL_TIMEOUT_MS` | `120000` | Default per-call budget for `run_analytical_query` (2 min). |
| `MCPG_ANALYTICAL_MAX_TIMEOUT_MS` | `600000` | Hard ceiling for `run_analytical_query`; a per-call `timeout_ms` is clamped to this (10 min). Must be ≥ `MCPG_ANALYTICAL_TIMEOUT_MS`. |
| `MCPG_ANALYTICAL_MAX_CONCURRENCY` | `2` | Size of the isolated analytical pool — max simultaneous `run_analytical_query` calls. |
| `MCPG_ALLOW_INSECURE_TLS` | `false` | Bypass the startup TLS check that refuses remote DSNs without `sslmode=require` (or stronger). Loopback hosts are always exempt. |
| `MCPG_SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_SECONDS` | `30` | On SIGTERM, wait up to this long for in-flight tool calls to finish before closing the pool and cursors. |

#### Subprocess tools (`MCPG_ALLOW_SHELL=true` only)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MCPG_SHELL_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `60` | Max wall-clock for `pg_dump` / `pg_restore` / `psql` invocations. |
| `MCPG_SHELL_MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES` | `67108864` | (64 MiB) Cap on captured stdout per subprocess call. |
| `MCPG_SUBPROCESS_BIN_ALLOWLIST` | — | Comma-separated absolute dirs the resolved `pg_dump` / `pg_restore` / `psql` must live under. Empty = trust `PATH`. Defeats a PATH-shim of these binaries. |
| `MCPG_SUBPROCESS_CPU_SECONDS` | — | Per-child `RLIMIT_CPU` (seconds). POSIX only; unset = inherit. |
| `MCPG_SUBPROCESS_MEMORY_MB` | — | Per-child `RLIMIT_AS` (MiB). POSIX only; unset = inherit. |

#### LISTEN/NOTIFY (`MCPG_ALLOW_LISTEN=true` only)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MCPG_LISTEN_QUEUE_MAX` | `1000` | Per-channel buffer; oldest notifications dropped on overflow. |

#### Audit

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MCPG_AUDIT_PERSIST` | `false` | When true, every `run_write` / `run_ddl` call persists to a `mcpg_audit.events` table (auto-created idempotently). |
| `MCPG_AUDIT_REDACT_KEYS` | — | Comma-separated regex fragments added to the secret-name pattern (defaults already cover `password`, `passwd`, `secret`, `token`, `api[_-]?key`, `bearer`, `authorization`, `database_url`, `dsn`, `conninfo`). |
| `MCPG_AUDIT_INTEGRITY` | `false` | When true, each persisted event is signed with an HMAC chained over the previous event; the `verify_audit_chain` tool walks the chain and reports the first break. Requires `MCPG_AUDIT_HMAC_KEY`. |
| `MCPG_AUDIT_HMAC_KEY` | — | Secret key for the audit HMAC chain. Required when `MCPG_AUDIT_INTEGRITY=true`. Never appears in `repr`/logs. |

#### Secrets backend

By default every secret is read straight from the environment. Set
`MCPG_SECRETS_BACKEND=file` to instead load API keys / bearer token /
HMAC key from a mounted file — a name in the file wins; anything absent
falls back to the env var, so partial files work.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MCPG_SECRETS_BACKEND` | `env` | `env` (read every secret from the environment) \| `file` (overlay a secrets file on top of the environment). |
| `MCPG_SECRETS_FILE_PATH` | — | Required when `MCPG_SECRETS_BACKEND=file`. Path to a flat `name → value` map: JSON always, or YAML (`.yaml`/`.yml`) when PyYAML is installed. Covers `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_API_KEY` / `MCPG_NL2SQL_API_KEY`, `MCPG_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `MCPG_AUDIT_HMAC_KEY`. |

#### Rate limiting

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MCPG_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` | `true` | Token-bucket per-tool rate limiting. Set to `false` to restore the pre-breaking-change unlimited behavior. |
| `MCPG_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS` | `60` | Global cap per window across all tools. |
| `MCPG_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS` | `60` | Window length for the global quota. |
| `MCPG_RATE_LIMIT_HEAVY_MAX` | `5` | Cap for heavy tools (`run_write`, `run_ddl`, `dump_database`, etc.). |
| `MCPG_RATE_LIMIT_HEAVY_WINDOW` | `60` | Window length for the heavy-tool quota. |

#### Caching & Feature flags

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MCPG_CACHE_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable or disable the adaptive cache layer. |
| `MCPG_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | `300` | Default cache Time-To-Live in seconds. |
| `MCPG_CACHE_MAXSIZE` | `1024` | Maximum LRU capacity bound for the memory cache. |
| `MCPG_REDIS_URL` | — | Optional Redis backend connection string for external, multi-node caching. |
| `MCPG_ENABLE_HEAVY_DIAGNOSTICS` | `true` | Toggle computationally heavy diagnostic, diagram, and advisor tools. |
| `MCPG_ELICIT_CONFIRM_WRITES` | `false` | When true, every write/DDL/shell/listen/migrate-tier tool call (any tool whose `readOnlyHint` annotation isn't true) requires an accepted interactive confirmation (`ctx.elicit()`) before running. **Best-effort, not an enforcement boundary**: it only engages for clients that both pass a request `context` and declare the `elicitation` capability during `initialize` — a client that omits either silently bypasses the gate and the tool runs as normal. |

#### Natural-language SQL

MCPg auto-discovers every configured provider from the environment at
startup — set as many vendor keys as you have and each becomes callable.
**Nineteen providers ship built in.** Three are first-party (Anthropic,
OpenAI, Gemini); the other sixteen speak the OpenAI-compatible API with
vendor-preset endpoints: **DeepSeek, Qwen, OpenRouter, Perplexity, xAI
(Grok), Groq, Mistral, Together, Fireworks, DeepInfra, Cerebras, Nebius,
Hugging Face, GitHub Models, SambaNova, and Moonshot (Kimi)**. Every
built-in is plug-and-play — set the vendor's conventional API-key env
var and it's auto-discovered — and **any *other* OpenAI-compatible
vendor or local model server (Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio) is still
pluggable through configuration alone** via `MCPG_NL2SQL_CUSTOM_PROVIDERS`.
The whole built-in list is one declarative registry in `nl2sql.py`, so
adding a vendor or refreshing a retired default model is a one-line data
change.

When `MCPG_NL2SQL_PROVIDER` is unset, MCPg auto-picks the default in
registry order — **anthropic → openai → gemini** stay first so existing
deployments are unaffected. `translate_nl_to_sql` accepts an optional
`provider="…"` argument to route per call; `get_server_info` reports
which are configured.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `<VENDOR>_API_KEY` | — | Setting a vendor's conventional key enables that provider. Standard slugs: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `MISTRAL_API_KEY`, `TOGETHER_API_KEY`, `FIREWORKS_API_KEY`, `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`, `NEBIUS_API_KEY`, `SAMBANOVA_API_KEY`, `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`. |
| *(keys that deviate)* | — | A few vendors don't follow `<VENDOR>_API_KEY`: **Gemini** → `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`; **Qwen** → `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` or `QWEN_API_KEY`; **Hugging Face** → `HF_TOKEN`; **GitHub Models** → `GITHUB_TOKEN`; **DeepInfra** → `DEEPINFRA_TOKEN`. |
| `MCPG_NL2SQL_PROVIDER` | auto-picked | Any built-in slug (listed above) or a custom name. Pins the default provider used when the tool is called without `provider=`. Unset + any vendor key present → MCPg auto-picks in registry order. |
| `MCPG_NL2SQL_API_KEY` | — | Explicit key for the configured `MCPG_NL2SQL_PROVIDER`. Overrides the vendor-conventional env var for that provider only. Requires `MCPG_NL2SQL_PROVIDER` to be set. |
| `MCPG_NL2SQL_MODEL` | provider default | Override the default model (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `grok-3-mini`). Applies only to the default provider. |
| `MCPG_NL2SQL_BASE_URL` | — | Endpoint override for the default provider (private gateways / regional endpoints). |
| `MCPG_NL2SQL_CUSTOM_PROVIDERS` | — | **Bring your own provider — no code change.** Comma/newline-separated `name=base_url\|model` entries declaring *extra* OpenAI-compatible providers beyond the built-ins (local Ollama / vLLM / LM Studio, or any niche vendor). Key from `<NAME>_API_KEY` by convention, or append `\|KEY_ENV_VAR` for ones that deviate; keyless allowed for loopback endpoints. Each name becomes callable via `provider=`. |
| `MCPG_NL2SQL_MAX_TOKENS` | `2048` | Cap on generated tokens (hard limit: 16384). |

## Usage examples

The MCP tools are invoked by the agent (Claude, Cursor, Continue, …)
in response to your natural-language instructions. A handful of
illustrative round-trips:

### Inspect the schema

> **You:** What tables live in the `public` schema, and which ones are
> the biggest by row count?

> **Agent (using `list_tables` + `summarize_table` × N):**
> Six tables: `customers` (1.2M rows), `orders` (4.7M), `line_items`
> (18.3M), `products` (340), `addresses` (1.4M), `audit_log`
> (45.8M — the largest, accumulates without retention).

### Diagnose a slow query

> **You:** Why does
> `SELECT * FROM orders o JOIN line_items l ON o.id = l.order_id WHERE o.created_at > now() - interval '7 days'`
> take 8 seconds?

> **Agent (using `why_is_this_slow` + `recommend_indexes`):**
> `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` shows a sequential scan over `orders` (4.7M rows)
> filtered by `created_at`. There's no index on `orders.created_at`.
> Recommended:
> `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY orders_created_at_idx ON orders (created_at DESC);`
> Expected improvement: ~95% reduction (index scan touches ~33K rows
> instead of full table). Run `validate_migration` on it before applying
> to confirm there's no locking surprise.

### Translate plain English to SQL

> **You:** Find customers who placed an order this month but never
> in the previous three months — show me their email and current
> lifetime spend.

> **Agent (using `translate_nl_to_sql`):**
> ```sql
> SELECT c.email, SUM(l.price * l.quantity) AS lifetime_spend
> FROM customers c
> JOIN orders o ON o.customer_id = c.id
> JOIN line_items l ON l.order_id = o.id
> WHERE EXISTS (
>   SELECT 1 FROM orders o2 WHERE o2.customer_id = c.id
>     AND o2.created_at >= date_trunc('month', now()))
>   AND NOT EXISTS (
>   SELECT 1 FROM orders o3 WHERE o3.customer_id = c.id
>     AND o3.created_at >= date_trunc('month', now()) - interval '3 months'
>     AND o3.created_at <  date_trunc('month', now()))
> GROUP BY c.email;
> ```

### Picture the schema

> **You:** Draw me an ER diagram of the `public` schema.

> **Agent (using `generate_schema_diagram`):** *Returns a Mermaid
> diagram you can paste straight into GitHub / Notion / Obsidian.*

### Audit the database

> **You:** How healthy is this database right now?

> **Agent (using `audit_database`):** Returns a graded report:
> *Memory & I/O score 92 (GOOD), Transaction & Connection 78 (WARNING:
> rollback rate 0.4%, look at app logs), Concurrency & Locks 60
> (CRITICAL: 14 backends waiting), Cleanliness & Bloat 88 (GOOD), Slow
> queries 70 (WARNING: top query template runs 5000×, mean 90 ms —
> see `optimize_query`).*

### Run a guarded write

> **You:** Soft-delete every order older than 5 years.

> **Agent (using `run_write` with `MCPG_AUDIT_PERSIST=true`):** Validates
> the statement through the safe-SQL kernel, runs it inside a transaction,
> returns affected row count, persists the call (sql + arguments —
> with secrets regex-redacted — + status) to `mcpg_audit.events` for
> after-the-fact review.

## Privacy Policy

MCPg is self-hosted: your database contents never leave your
infrastructure, and there is no telemetry or phone-home of any kind.
The one documented exception is the opt-in `translate_nl_to_sql` tool,
which sends your question plus schema context (names, not row data) to
the LLM provider *you* configure. Full policy — data collection,
usage, storage, third-party sharing, retention, and contact — is in
[`PRIVACY.md`](https://github.com/devopam/MCPg/blob/main/PRIVACY.md).

## License

MIT — see [`LICENSE`](https://github.com/devopam/MCPg/blob/main/LICENSE). The SQL-safety kernel

`crystaldba/postgres-mcp`; see [`NOTICE`](https://github.com/devopam/MCPg/blob/main/NOTICE) for the lineage.

### Wrapped extensions — licenses you should know about

MCPg's source is MIT, but the PostgreSQL extensions it wraps each carry
their own license. The wrappers themselves are at arm's length (SQL-level
calls, no static or dynamic linking into MCPg's Python process), so
MCPg-the-project is not a derivative work of any of them. **Operators
deploying a service built on MCPg + a given extension take on whatever
obligations that extension's license imposes** — same as installing the
extension directly. The matrix below names the license per wrapped
extension so you can make an informed choice.

| Extension | License | Notes for operators |
|---|---|---|
| pgvector | PostgreSQL License (BSD-style) | Permissive; no special obligations. |
| pg_partman | PostgreSQL License | Permissive. |
| pg_cron | PostgreSQL License | Permissive. |
| pg_turboquant | MIT | Permissive. |
| pg_buffercache / pg_walinspect / pgstattuple | PostgreSQL contrib | Permissive. |
| TimescaleDB | Apache 2.0 (community) + Timescale License (TSL, source-available) for some features | Mixed — see Timescale's docs for which features are TSL-gated. |
| Apache AGE | Apache 2.0 | Permissive. |
| pg_search (ParadeDB) | **AGPL-3.0** | **Operators running a network service that lets users interact with `pg_search` are subject to AGPL's network clause** — typically the obligation to offer the source of `pg_search` (and any modifications) to those users. MCPg's wrappers don't extend that obligation to MCPg itself; you take on the obligation when you deploy and "convey" the extension over a network. If your service redistribution model is incompatible with AGPL's network clause, pick a different BM25 implementation (the [BM25 plan](docs/plans/bm25-integration.md) lists alternatives). |

This matrix is a starting point — for the binding answer on your specific
deployment, consult the extension's upstream LICENSE file and (if it
matters legally) your own counsel.

> **Disclaimer.** Best efforts have been made to bring MCPg to
> production grade, but it remains an actively developed project and
> may contain issues. See the License terms for indemnity details.
