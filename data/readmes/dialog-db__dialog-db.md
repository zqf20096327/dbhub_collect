**Dialog** is an embeddable database designed for local-first software.

It has (or aims to have) the following properties:

- Schema-on-read via an expressive [Datalog]-esque query API
- Efficient synchronization across replicas
- Support for both [Web Assembly] and native runtime environments
- Emphasis on data privacy and user-centered authority

## Status: Experimental

**Dialog** is in active development and should be considered experimental in nature.

Expect fundamental details to break over time (binary encoding, index construction etc.). At this stage, we cannot offer any promise of a path to migrate old versions of the database forward as breaking changes are landed.

## Project Layout

- **[`./guide`](/guide)**: _How Dialog Works_, a guided tour of the design from facts to sync, published at <https://dialog.foundation/guide/>.
- **[`./site`](/site)**: the <https://dialog.foundation> landing page.
- **[`./rust`](/rust)**: the core implementation of Dialog.
- **[`./typescript`](/typescript)**: packages for using Dialog in TypeScript and/or React.
- **[`./adr`](/adr)**: architectural design records
- **[`./notes`](/notes)**: informal notes about Dialog or adjacent topics

## Getting Started

This project encodes a comprehensive development environment via [Nix flakes]. If you have Nix installed, you can drop into a shell with all the tools you need to build and modify Dialog using the following command:

```sh
nix develop
```

From a suitable development environment, you can build using standard Rust and Node.js tooling. For example: `cargo test` will run the full Rust test suite for your native target.
