# The Pragmatic Papers

The website for [pragmaticpapers.com](https://pragmaticpapers.com/).

Read about our current initiatives on the wiki: [Pragmatic Papers Developement Wiki](https://github.com/digitalgroundgame/pragmatic-papers/wiki)

## Requirements

```Bash
docker
Node.js version 24.15.0+
pnpm
```

## Utilities

This repo uses some additional tools:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the web framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Quick Start

> [!NOTE]
> If you run into issues onboarding please open a pull request

1. [Clone the repo](https://github.com/digitalgroundgame/pragmatic-papers.git) and `cd` into it.
2. _(Optional)_ Set up the private display font — see [Private Font Setup](#private-font-setup) below. Don't worry you can come back to this later.
3. Create `.env` from `.env.example` if it does not exist:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Install dependencies and start dev:

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Private Font Setup

The `@digitalgroundgame/fonts` package contains the proprietary display font. It is optional — the site works without it, falling back to system fonts. If you don't have access, skip this section.

If you do have access, create a **Classic GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)** at [GitHub Settings → Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with the `read:packages` scope.

The project `.npmrc` references `GH_FONT_READ` — you just need that variable set before running `pnpm install`. Choose whichever method suits you:

- **Mac/Linux — shell profile** (applies to every terminal automatically):

  ```bash
  # ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
  export GH_FONT_READ=ghp_your_token_here
  ```

- **Windows (PowerShell)** — set permanently for your user:

  ```powershell
  [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("GH_FONT_READ", "ghp_your_token_here", "User")
  ```

  Alternatively, open **System Properties → Advanced → Environment Variables** (search "environment variables" in the Start menu) and add `GH_FONT_READ` under "User variables".

Restart your terminal after setting the variable, then re-run `pnpm install`. You should see `✓ Fonts copied to public/fonts` in the output.

> [!TIP]
> Font Caching & Env Variables
>
> The Situation: This font gets cached twice—once as a package in the >pnpm store and once in the /public/fonts/ directory.
>
> The Workaround: You don't need to pollute your global environment. Just use a temporary export in your terminal session for local builds.

## Seeding the Database

In order to see some basic content and website functionality it is key to seed your development database with mock content.

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/admin`
2. Create a new user. The credentials don't matter here as its local.
3. When you land on the dashboard click the `Seed your database` link.
4. Wait a few moments and now your website will have some example content when returning to browsing `http://localhost:8000`

Or seed from the terminal, without the browser, while `pnpm dev` is stopped:

```bash
pnpm dev:db-seed
```

It seeds the same content as the button, and works on an empty database too (e.g. right after `pnpm dev:db-nuke`). Like the button, it first deletes every article, volume, page and media file in the database, not just seeded ones. It only runs against a local database with local media storage.

> [!TIP]
> If your docker database ever gets into a unrecoverable state, or you are switch branches that have different database schemas, be sure to run `pnpm dev:db-nuke` to blow away your database and start fresh.

## Helpful Commands

Here are the most important scripts available in the root `package.json`:

- `pnpm dev`: Start the application in development mode.
- `pnpm dev:db-nuke`: Drop the database schema and re-run migrations (equivalent to a fresh database).
- `pnpm dev:db-seed`: Seed the development database with mock content from the terminal (stop `pnpm dev` first).
- `pnpm lint`: Lint files with `eslint`.
- `pnpm format`: Format files with `prettier`.
- `pnpm check-types`: Runs typescript compiler in no emit mode to check for type errors.
- `pnpm migrate:create "name_of_migration"`: Create the necessary migrations for your Pull Request, if the underlying data has changed. This is necessary in order to deploy your Pull Request on to our staging environment.

> [!NOTE]
> **Development Migrations**
>
> You do not need to run migrations against your development database, because Drizzle will have already pushed any changes to the docker container for you.
>
> Payload uses Drizzle ORM's powerful push mode to automatically sync data changes to your database for you while in development mode. By default, this is enabled and is the suggested workflow to using Postgres and Payload while doing local development.

### Production Migrations

Migrations will be required for non-development database environments.
