### The problem

AI coding agents reconstruct project context from scratch every session. They re-read files they've already read, re-derive architecture they've already derived, and lose decisions made yesterday. Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode — they all forget.

### The solution

A **SQLite-backed knowledge graph** that lives in your project at `.agents/graph_memory.sqlite`. It ingests your codebase's AST (functions, classes, call graphs, imports), records agent decisions in an append-only ledger, detects when agents contradict each other, and produces deterministic snapshots that inject directly into agent system prompts — with byte-stable caching so prompt caches stay hot.

All 20 MCP tools, a 30-command CLI, lifecycle hooks for 9 agent harnesses, and a streamable HTTP endpoint for remote agents.

---

## What it actually does

**Code understanding.** Parses Python, TypeScript, JS/JSX, Go, and Rust via Tree-sitter. Extracts signatures, docstrings, line ranges, call graphs, and inheritance. Cross-file call resolution wires stubs to real definitions across your entire repo. Batch ingestion processes this repo's 37 files in 0.45 seconds; unchanged re-ingests take 0.06 seconds (hash-skip).

**Agent memory.** Every decision an agent makes — what it changed, why, when — goes into an append-only `Decision_Ledger`. A reflection engine digests the last 30 days of real decisions into structured memory cards. When two agents disagree about a fact (different values for the same field), the contradiction is recorded and surfaced — no silent overwrites.

**Trust decay.** Facts decay over time with `effective = base × 0.5^(days/30)`. Re-verifying a fact resets it to 100%. Derived facts re-verify themselves: if the source file is byte-identical to the hash recorded at ingest, the signature and call edges extracted from it are still true, so the lifecycle hooks refresh those nodes with no agent effort — and a node that owns no file (call stub, import target, MOC, project root) is refreshed only when everything feeding it is fresh, so an edited file correctly keeps its dependents decayed. Stale, unreferenced nodes get garbage-collected. This means the graph self-maintains — old assumptions fade, recent verifications stay sharp.

**Prompt injection.** `graph-memory snapshot` produces a deterministic, content-fingerprinted Markdown snapshot. If nothing changed, you get the exact same bytes — so Claude's prompt cache, Cursor's context cache, whatever — stays warm. Zero wasted tokens on unchanged context.

**Transport.** Runs over stdio MCP (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Codex) and streamable HTTP MCP (OpenCode, Docker, remote agents). One binary, both transports. Health check at `/health`.

**Import / export.** Migrating from mem0? `graph-memory import-mem0 export.json`. Have a CLAUDE.md? `graph-memory import-md CLAUDE.md`. Want a browsable Obsidian vault with `[[wikilinks]]` for every graph edge? `graph-memory export-obsidian ~/vault`.

---

## Setup

```bash
python -m pip install 'epistemic-graph-memory[all]'
```

The core package is **stdlib-only** (SQLite, JSON, regex) and installs everywhere with zero compiled dependencies. Two optional extras add the heavy features:

| Extra | Adds |
|---|---|
| *(none)* | Core graph, search, snapshot, Markdown/mem0 import, Obsidian export, reflection, hooks — **stdlib only** |
| `[ast]` | Tree-sitter AST ingestion (Code understanding) |
| `[mcp]` | MCP stdio transport |
| `[http]` | MCP stdio + streamable HTTP transport (uvicorn + starlette) |
| `[all]` | Everything |

```bash
pip install epistemic-graph-memory                # core only, stdlib
pip install 'epistemic-graph-memory[ast]'         # + code ingestion
pip install 'epistemic-graph-memory[mcp]'         # + MCP stdio
pip install 'epistemic-graph-memory[http]'        # + MCP over HTTP
pip install 'epistemic-graph-memory[all]'         # + everything
```

> **Android / Termux**: `[mcp]` pulls `pydantic` → `pydantic-core`, which has no Android wheel and tries to build Rust for a target rustup doesn't support — a multi-minute stall that ends in failure. `pip install epistemic-graph-memory` (core) finishes in seconds and gives you the graph, search, and Markdown import. AST and MCP need their extras and full toolchain support.

### MCP configuration

Add to your agent's MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "graph-memory": {
      "command": "graph-memory-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

For remote-only agents (OpenCode, Docker):

```bash
graph-memory-mcp-http                    # http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp
```

Then point your agent at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp`.

**Security (v3.8.0):** The HTTP server defaults to localhost (127.0.0.1) and includes DNS rebinding protection. For remote deployment:

- Set `GRAPH_MEMORY_API_KEY` environment variable to require authentication
- Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) with TLS
- Bind to `0.0.0.0` only behind a firewall/VPN
- Never expose the server directly to the public internet (it provides full filesystem and database access)

```bash
GRAPH_MEMORY_API_KEY=your-secret-key graph-memory-mcp-http
```

### One-command agent hooks

```bash
graph-memory hook install                 # auto-detect and configure all frameworks
graph-memory hook install --framework cursor
graph-memory hook status
```

This wires lifecycle capture into Claude Code, ZCode, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, Antigravity, Qoder, and Hermes — PostToolUse triggers incremental AST ingest of edited files (<5ms), session-end distills transcripts into graph facts, and session-start refreshes all snapshots.

---

## CLI

```bash
# Ingest entire codebase (polyglot AST + call graphs)
graph-memory ingest-code .

# Re-parse a single changed file (<5ms, skips if unchanged)
graph-memory ingest-file src/engine.py

# Generate prompt-cache-stable snapshot
graph-memory snapshot --max-tokens 600 --min-trust 0.7

# Search nodes (FTS5 + identifier substring fallback)
graph-memory search "effective_tr"
graph-memory search "trust decay"

# Decision audit trail
graph-memory query-history --agent Hermes --days 7

# Contradiction detection
graph-memory contradictions

# Stale-node garbage collection
graph-memory prune --days 60

# Mechanical re-verification (hash-stable AST facts; curated nodes via test suite)
graph-memory verify
graph-memory verify --tests

# Scheduled verification (launchd / systemd / Task Scheduler, no daemon)
graph-memory schedule install --interval 1d

# Import existing memories
graph-memory import-md CLAUDE.md
graph-memory import-mem0 memories.json

# Export to Obsidian vault
graph-memory export-obsidian ~/vaults/my-project

# HTML / 3D visualization
graph-memory export-html graph.html
graph-memory export-3d graph_3d.html
```

**Storage**: Single SQLite file per project at `.agents/graph_memory.sqlite`. WAL mode for concurrent safety. FTS5 for full-text search. No external databases, no servers, no cloud — the only network call anywhere is the opt-in `summarize-mocs` command, which uses Gemini via `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

**Node types**: `Fact_Node` (deterministic ground truth from AST/Git), `Knowledge_Node` (architecture, design decisions), `Episode_Node` (completed task sequences), `Release_Node` (published versions).

**Trust model**: Query-time decay — `effective = base × 0.5^(Δdays/half_life)`. Re-verification resets to 100%. Stale, unreferenced nodes get soft-deleted by the prune command.
