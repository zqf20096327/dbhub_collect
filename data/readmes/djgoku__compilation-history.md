#+TITLE: Compilation History
#+STARTUP: inlineimages

This package provides automatic tracking of compilation history in Emacs.
It captures compilation commands, timing, results, and metadata to help
analyze build patterns and debug compilation issues.

[[file:images/compilation-history-view.png]]

* Features

- Automatic tracking of all compilations in a SQLite database
- Captures output, exit codes, timing, UTC offset, and git context (branch, commit, remotes)
- Timestamps displayed in local timezone at time of compilation
- Searchable history view with FTS5 full-text search
- ANSI color preservation — reopened compilations display original colors
- Incremental output saving for crash resilience
- Unique buffer names per compilation for easy identification
- Recompile support from history buffers

* Requirements

- Emacs 29.1+ (built-in SQLite support required)

* Usage

Enable the mode:

#+begin_src elisp
(compilation-history-mode 1)
#+end_src

Once enabled, every =M-x compile= invocation is automatically tracked. The database is created automatically on first compile. Use =M-x compilation-history-view= to browse your compilation history.

To disable:

#+begin_src elisp
(compilation-history-mode -1)
#+end_src

* Recommended Setup

A complete compilation stack using =use-package=. These three blocks work together but are independent — adopt all three or pick what you need.

** compile

Built-in settings for =M-x compile= buffers.

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package compile
  :ensure nil
  :custom
  ;; Auto-scroll compilation output to follow progress
  (compilation-scroll-output t)
  ;; Tell subprocesses they can emit color/escape codes
  (compilation-environment '("TERM=xterm-256color"))
  :hook
  ;; Render ANSI color codes in compilation buffers (built-in, no external dep)
  (compilation-filter . ansi-color-compilation-filter))
#+end_src

** comint

Comint settings enhance interactive compilations via =C-u M-x compile=, which runs the compilation in =comint-mode=. This is useful for commands that prompt for input (e.g., login scripts, interactive installers) — and compilation-history captures the full session.

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package comint
  :ensure nil
  :custom
  ;; Store up to 10,000 input history entries (default is 500)
  (comint-input-ring-size 10000)
  ;; Skip duplicate consecutive inputs in history
  (comint-input-ignoredups t)
  ;; Use isearch-style history navigation (dwim = up/down + C-r both work)
  (comint-history-isearch 'dwim)
  ;; Expand history references (e.g. !!, !$) on input
  (comint-input-autoexpand t)
  ;; Yank previous arguments from the end (like bash M-.)
  (comint-insert-previous-argument-from-end t)
  ;; Announce terminal as xterm-256color for proper color support
  (comint-terminfo-terminal "xterm-256color")
  ;; Cap buffer size to prevent memory issues with long-running sessions
  (comint-buffer-maximum-size 20000)
  ;; Auto-scroll to bottom when you type input
  (comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-input t)
  ;; Don't force point to follow output (lets you read earlier output while new output arrives)
  (comint-move-point-for-output nil)
  ;; Don't force-scroll to bottom on every output
  (comint-scroll-show-maximum-output nil)
  ;; Use cat as pager so output stays in the buffer instead of spawning less/more
  ;; (comint-pager "cat") ;; Emacs 30+ only
  ;; If using zsh and you see every command echoed back, uncomment this:
  ;; (comint-process-echoes t)
  )
#+end_src

** compilation-history

The database is created automatically on first compile — no manual initialization needed. Comint buffers (=C-u compile=) are automatically made read-only when the process finishes, with =q= bound to =quit-window=.

#+begin_src elisp
;; Elpaca (recommended)
(use-package compilation-history
  :ensure (:host github :repo "djgoku/compilation-history")
  :after compile
  ;; Bind C-c c as the prefix for compilation-history commands
  ;; C-c c c → compile, C-c c v → view history
  :bind-keymap ("C-c c" . compilation-history-map)
  :config
  ;; Enable automatic tracking of all compilations
  (compilation-history-mode 1))

;; Alternative install methods for compilation-history:
;;
;; straight.el:
;;   :straight (:host github :repo "djgoku/compilation-history")
;;
;; vc-use-package (Emacs 30+):
;;   :vc (:url "https://github.com/djgoku/compilation-history")
;;
;; Local checkout:
;;   :load-path "~/path/to/compilation-history"
#+end_src

* Customization

All customization variables are in the =compilation-history= group. Use =M-x customize-group RET compilation-history RET= to browse them interactively.

** =compilation-history-db-file=

Path to the SQLite database file.

#+begin_src elisp
;; Default: ~/.emacs.d/compilation-history.db
(setq compilation-history-db-file
      (expand-file-name "compilation-history.db" user-emacs-directory))
#+end_src

** =compilation-history-command-truncate-length=

Maximum length of the sanitized command in buffer names.

#+begin_src elisp
;; Default: 25
(setq compilation-history-command-truncate-length 25)
#+end_src

** =compilation-history-save-interval=

Seconds between periodic saves of compilation output to the database. Provides crash resilience — if Emacs crashes mid-compilation, at most this many seconds of output is lost.

#+begin_src elisp
;; Default: 10 (nil to disable timer-based saving)
(setq compilation-history-save-interval 10)
#+end_src

** =compilation-history-save-line-threshold=

Number of new output lines that trigger an immediate save to the database, without waiting for the timer.

#+begin_src elisp
;; Default: 100 (nil to disable line-based saving)
(setq compilation-history-save-line-threshold 100)
#+end_src

Setting both =compilation-history-save-interval= and =compilation-history-save-line-threshold= to =nil= disables incremental saving entirely.

** =compilation-history-recompile-switch-behavior=

Controls whether recompiling from a compilation-history buffer automatically switches to the new compilation buffer.

#+begin_src elisp
;; Default: 'switch (select the window showing the new buffer)
;; Options: 'switch, 'pop (respect display-buffer-alist), nil (disabled)
(setq compilation-history-recompile-switch-behavior 'switch)
#+end_src

** =compilation-history-view-split-direction=

How to split the window when opening or previewing a compilation from the history view.

#+begin_src elisp
;; Default: 'horizontal (above/below)
;; Options: 'horizontal, 'vertical (side-by-side)
(setq compilation-history-view-split-direction 'horizontal)
#+end_src

** =compilation-history-view-columns=

Column definitions for the history view table. Each entry is a plist with =:name=, =:key=, and optional =:formatter=, =:min-width=, =:max-width=, =:align=. Columns can be reordered, removed, or modified.

#+begin_src elisp
;; Default columns in order:
;; #, Start Time, Duration, Status, Exit, Commit, Branch, Directory, Command
(setq compilation-history-view-columns
      '((:name "#" :key :row-number)
        (:name "Start Time" :key :start-time)
        (:name "Duration" :key :duration :min-width 8)
        (:name "Status" :key :status)
        (:name "Exit" :key :exit-code :min-width 5)
        (:name "Commit" :key :commit :formatter compilation-history-view--format-commit)
        (:name "Branch" :key :branch)
        (:name "Directory" :key :directory :formatter compilation-history-view--format-directory)
        (:name "Command" :key :command
               :formatter compilation-history-view--format-command)))
#+end_src

The Command column includes a default formatter that collapses newlines, tabs, and multiple spaces into single spaces for cleaner display. For example, a multi-line shell command like:

#+begin_example
cd build &&
  cmake .. &&
  make -j8
#+end_example

displays as: =cd build && cmake .. && make -j8=

To show raw commands instead, remove the =:formatter= entry from the Command column.

| =q=       | Quit view                                  |

* Searching

Press =s= in the history view to search. The search uses SQLite FTS5 with trigram tokenization, which means it supports substring matching out of the box.

** Searchable Fields

| Column              | Description                          |
|---------------------+--------------------------------------|
| =compile_command=   | The compilation command               |
| =default_directory= | Directory where compilation was run   |
| =git_branch=        | Git branch at time of compilation     |
| =output=            | Full compilation output               |

** Search Syntax

*** Plain search (searches all indexed fields)

| Example          | Matches                                      |
|------------------+----------------------------------------------|
| =make=           | Any record where command, directory, branch, or output contains "make" |
| =test=           | Compilations involving "test" anywhere        |
| =error=          | Compilations whose output contains "error"    |
| =FAIL=           | Find failed test runs by output content       |

*** Column-specific search (=column:value=)

| Example                        | Matches                                     |
|--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------|
| =compile_command:pytest=       | Only compilations where the command contains "pytest" |
| =git_branch:main=             | Only compilations run on the main branch     |
| =default_directory:frontend=  | Only compilations run from a directory containing "frontend" |
| =output:undefined reference=  | Only compilations whose output contains "undefined reference" |

*** Short terms (< 3 characters)

FTS5 trigram tokenization requires at least 3 characters. For shorter terms, the search automatically falls back to SQL =LIKE= queries. This is transparent — just type your search term.

| Example              | Behavior                              |
|----------------------+---------------------------------------|
| =go=                 | Falls back to LIKE (2 chars)          |
| =compile_command:cc= | Falls back to LIKE for the value "cc" |
| =make=               | Uses FTS5 (4 chars)                   |

** Tab Completion

Column names are completed with =TAB= in the search minibuffer. Type a few characters and press =TAB= to complete to a valid column name.

** Clearing Search

Press =s= and submit an empty string to clear the current search and show all records.

* Hooks

There are currently no user-facing hooks. The package uses Emacs built-in hooks internally (=compilation-finish-functions=, =compilation-filter-hook=, =kill-buffer-hook=, =kill-emacs-hook=).

* Buffer Naming

Each compilation gets a unique buffer name:

=*compilation-history-<identifier>==<path>__<command>*=

- =<identifier>=: Timestamp in =YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSffffff= format (also the database ID)
- =<path>=: Project name, with subdirectory parts joined by =--=
- =<command>=: Sanitized compile command, truncated to configured length

Examples:

- At project root: =*compilation-history-20250812T153000123456==my-project__make-all*=
- In subdirectory: =*compilation-history-20250812T153000123456==my-project--src--app__make-all*=

* Database Schema

Records include:
- Compile command, directory, buffer name
- Start time (with UTC offset for local timezone display), end time, exit code, killed status
- Full compilation output
- Git metadata: repo, branch, commit, commit message, remote URLs
- System info: OS, OS version, Emacs version

Full-text search is supported via FTS5 on command, directory, branch, and output fields.

* Modules

| File                         | Description                            |
|------------------------------+----------------------------------------|
| =compilation-history.el=     | Core tracking, hooks, and lifecycle    |
| =compilation-history-view.el= | Searchable vtable-based history browser |
