# 📝 AI Resume Creator

![AI-RESUME-CREATOR](Assets/AI-RESUME-CREATOR.png)

This is a **full-stack web application** developed as part of a university project for the course **Fundamentals of Cloud Technologies**. The application parses data from a given `GitHub profile` (with planned support for `LinkedIn` in the future) and uses an **AI-powered** system to generate a personalized **PDF resume** based on the provided information and the user's custom query.

## 🎯 Project Objective
As part of the assignment, our team was required to:
- Build a web application with both **frontend** and **backend** components;
- Deploy the application to the **cloud** using different providers for hosting and additional services;
- Integrate at least one **external cloud service** provided by a different vendor than the one hosting the app;
- Include **AI or IoT** functionality within the application;
- Use a **cloud-based database** for data storage;
- Document the architecture and technical choices made during the development;
- Collaborate effectively via **GitHub**, with clear task distribution and version control.

> According to the requirements, the frontend and backend are hosted on different cloud environments. The AI module runs as a separate microservice deployed on a different provider, ensuring the usage of multiple cloud platforms.

## 🚀 Key Features

1. 🖥️ **Frontend**  
   A user-friendly interface where users can:
   - Input their GitHub profile link  
   - Write a custom query  
   - Generate a personalized resume based on the provided data  
   - View the resume in real-time  
   - Download the final version as a **PDF**

2. 🔗 **GitHub Integration**  
   A mechanism that allows users to input a GitHub link. The application then fetches relevant profile data — such as repositories, technologies used, and programming languages — via the **GitHub API**.

3. 🧾 **Parsing Service**  
   Responsible for processing and transforming raw GitHub data into a structured format. This includes extracting and organizing details about the user's profile, projects, and skills for further use in resume generation.

4. 💬 **AI Chat Service**  
   Leverages **AI models** to process both GitHub data and the user's custom text input. The service generates a **LaTeX-formatted** resume based on this information, ensuring the final document is tailored and professional.

5. 🔙 **Backend API**  
   The server-side engine of the application. It handles:
   - Routing and logic  
   - Data processing  
   - LaTeX-to-PDF conversion  
   - Communication between microservices (e.g., between the parsing service and the AI chat service)

6. 🗂️ **Database**  
   Stores user-related data such as name, email, and password — with passwords securely stored using **hashing** to ensure privacy and security.

# 🌐 Deployment
The system is deployed using a **multi-cloud** and **hybrid infrastructure** that distributes services across [Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com/), [Neon.tech](https://neon.tech), and a **university-hosted server** ([TUKE](https://www.tuke.sk/)). Each component is containerized with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), allowing consistent deployment and seamless cross-platform integration.

## 🎨 Frontend
- 🎨 **Design** — the user interface was designed using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), while the logo and documentation visuals were created with [Canva](https://www.canva.com/ru_ru/).  
- ⚛️ **React.js** — served as the main framework for building the client-side of the application. External libraries like [pdfjsLib](https://pdf-lib.js.org/) were used to render PDF resumes directly on the website.  
- 💨 **Tailwind CSS** — used for fast and flexible UI styling, enabling a responsive and modern minimalist design.  
- 📦 **Docker** — used to containerize the frontend application, simplifying deployment and ensuring portability across environments.

---

## 🛠️ Backend & Database
- ⚙️ **C# with ASP.NET Core** — provides a robust, high-performance, object-oriented framework for building scalable and secure web APIs.  
- 🧩 **Entity Framework Core** — used for ORM and database migrations; it integrates seamlessly with C# and supports code-first development.  
- 🐘 **PostgreSQL** — chosen for its reliability and because it can be hosted for free on [Neon](https://neon.tech).  
- 📄 **OpenAPI (Swagger)** — enables automatic API documentation and testing tools.  
- 🧾 **Pdflatex** — used as a LaTeX compiler to generate PDF files from LaTeX templates.

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Parser
- 🐍 **Python** — chosen for its simplicity, rapid development capabilities, and rich ecosystem of libraries.  
- 🧴 **Flask** — lightweight web framework used to build the REST API.  
- 🍾 **Flask-RESTX** — used for route management and automatic API documentation.  
- 📄 **OpenAPI** — integrated for API visualization and testing.  
- 📦 **Docker** — used to containerize the parser service for portability and ease of deployment.  
- ☁️ **GitHub API** — utilized to fetch user and repository data.  
- 🔗 **Requests** — Python HTTP library used for making external API calls.

---

## 🧠 AI API
- ⚡ **FastAPI** — asynchronous Python framework with built-in support for automatic documentation via [Swagger](https://swagger.io/).  
- 🧠 **Ollama** — used to interface with large language models; offers a wide range of models and flexible configuration options.  
- 🌐 **Nginx** — acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer; selected for its speed, popularity, and seamless Docker integration.  

> This setup was deployed using `docker-compose`.  
> Nginx was particularly necessary because the GPU server was hosted within a university VPN.  
> An external server was configured to handle incoming requests and forward them to the internal GPU server, enabling remote access through the VPN network.
