# AKB — Agent Knowledge Base

## Works with

Any agent client that speaks **MCP (Streamable HTTP or stdio)**:

- **Claude Code** — CLI / VS Code / JetBrains
- **Claude Desktop** — macOS / Windows
- **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, **Cline**, **Continue** — via the
  [`akb-mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/akb-mcp) stdio proxy
- Custom agents — direct HTTP `POST /mcp/` with a Bearer token

The default flow uses a Personal Access Token. Deployments with the
optional **MCP OAuth Resource Server** path turned on (via Keycloak as
the AS — see [`docs/mcp-clients/web-connectors.md`](./docs/mcp-clients/web-connectors.md))
also accept Claude Code's `mcp add --transport http` + `mcp login` flow
end-to-end, without a PAT.

## MCP protocol compatibility

AKB keeps one tool and authorization core behind two protocol adapters:

| Surface | Modern | Legacy |
|---|---|---|
| Direct HTTP `/mcp/` | `2026-07-28` stateless `server/discover` and per-request `_meta` with `Mcp-Protocol-Version` / `Mcp-Method` (and `Mcp-Name` for named calls) | `2024-11-05`, `2025-03-26`, `2025-06-18`, `2025-11-25` initialize + `Mcp-Session-Id` lifecycle |
| `akb-mcp` stdio proxy | `2026-07-28` discovery and per-request metadata | `2025-06-18` initialize |

The proxy answers either handshake locally and normalizes backend calls to the
modern stateless contract when available. Legacy backend sessions are used
only during a rolling upgrade when modern discovery is unavailable. A process
cannot mix generations, and unsupported revisions or conflicting protocol
evidence fail closed before a tool or local-file operation runs.

## Plugins

Beyond raw MCP access, AKB ships ready-made **agent plugins** for **Claude Code**
and **Codex** that wrap common vault workflows:

- **akb-wiki** — ingest a source (local file, web URL, GitHub PR / release /
  commit, Confluence page, or Jira issue) into the vault as a structured
  document, and answer questions from the vault with grounded, cited synthesis
  (read-only).
- **akb-sessions** — capture a coding session as structured notes: a session
  report plus follow-up tasks, learnings, ideas, and decisions.
- **akb-claude-code** — a Claude Code lifecycle bridge: hooks anchor each
  session to your AKB memory vault, injecting preferences and recent learnings
  at the start and writing a recap at the end.

```
/plugin marketplace add dnotitia/akb        # Claude Code
codex plugin marketplace add dnotitia/akb   # Codex
```

## Try it live

A public demo runs at **[akb-demo.agent.seahorse.dnotitia.ai](https://akb-demo.agent.seahorse.dnotitia.ai)**.
Browse and search a small fictional-organization knowledge base — product docs,
a company handbook, agent session notes, and an engineering wiki, cross-linked
by the URI graph — right in your browser, no signup. To wire it into your own
agent, sign up with any email (a throwaway address is fine) and point the
[`akb-mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/akb-mcp) proxy at
`https://akb-demo.agent.seahorse.dnotitia.ai/mcp/`.

> ⚠️ **Throwaway demo.** It is public, wiped and re-seeded weekly, and runs on
> minimal resources with **no uptime, privacy, or data guarantees**. Don't put
> anything real or sensitive in it — treat every write as public and ephemeral.
> For real use, [self-host](#quick-start) with Docker Compose or Kubernetes.

## Why AKB

Most knowledge tools are built for humans clicking through a UI. Agents need a
different shape: structured documents, semantic + keyword search in one call,
explicit relations, and full version history. AKB gives agents a single set of
tools (`akb_put`, `akb_search`, `akb_browse`, `akb_relations`, …) over a
PostgreSQL-native revision store and hybrid index. Explicit Bare Git installations
remain supported for existing deployments.

## Retrieval quality

Memory is only useful if the right note comes back. AKB's hybrid retrieval
(dense + BM25, source-level dedup) was benchmarked on
[LongMemEval](https://github.com/xiaowu0162/LongMemEval)-S — 500 long-context
questions, ~50 chat sessions per question. **Recall@5 = 98.4%**, with no
reranker in the loop.

| System | R@5 | n | Reranker | Source |
|---|---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| **AKB hybrid** | **98.4%** | 500 | no | this repo |
| MemPalace hybrid + rerank | 98.4% | 450 | yes | [MemPalace](https://github.com/mempalace/mempalace) |
| gbrain hybrid | 97.6% | 500 | no | [gbrain-evals](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain-evals) |
| gbrain vector | 97.4% | 500 | no | gbrain-evals |

Methodology, per-category breakdown, and a one-command reproducible harness
live in [`eval/longmemeval/`](eval/longmemeval/). The embedding model differs
across systems (AKB: `bge-m3@1024`), so read this as a stack-level comparison.

## Design philosophy

**Core stays small; flexibility comes from extension, not built-in
automation.** AKB does not ship its own consolidator, summariser, or
"knowledge gardener" — instead every write records a structured event in the
PostgreSQL outbox. When `redis_url` is configured, the publisher fans those
events out to a Redis Stream (`akb:events`). Operators wire any external
consumer (periodic synthesis bot, doc-rot reaper, weekly-digest agent, audit
trail, …) on top, with no patches to the core. The base contract is a
read/write store; opinions about *what to do with* the knowledge live outside.

## Architecture

```

PostgreSQL is the source of truth — chunk text + metadata + BM25 vocab.
The vector store is a driver-pluggable derived index holding dense
embeddings and corpus-side sparse vectors. Full vector-store loss is
recoverable from PG by setting `chunks.vector_indexed_at = NULL` and
letting the indexing worker re-populate.

## Key Concepts

- **Vault** — The unit of access control and knowledge organization. Native
  revisions live in PostgreSQL; the legacy backend uses one bare Git repo per vault.
- **Collection** — A directory inside a vault. Topical grouping of documents.
- **Document** — Markdown + YAML frontmatter, optimised for agent read/write.
- **Hybrid Search** — Dense (semantic) + BM25 (lexical) fused via RRF in one call.
- **Relations** — `depends_on`, `related_to`, `implements` in frontmatter form an explicit knowledge graph.
- **Vault isolation in `akb_sql`** — Enforced by PostgreSQL ACL. Each
  AKB user has a corresponding PG role (`akb_user_<uid>`) and each
  vault has three group roles (`akb_vault_<vid>_{reader,writer,admin}`).
  `akb_sql` runs the user's SQL inside a transaction with
  `SET LOCAL ROLE`; cross-vault references return PG `42501`
  directly. No application-side regex inspects user SQL for forbidden
  identifiers. See `docs/designs/pg-native-rbac/`.

## MCP Tools (selection)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `akb_list_vaults` / `akb_create_vault` | Vault management |
| `akb_put` / `akb_get` / `akb_update` / `akb_delete` | Document CRUD (revision + indexing) |
| `akb_put_file` / `akb_get_file` / `akb_update_file` / `akb_delete_file` | File attachments — proxy-side (requires local filesystem) |
| `akb_put_image` / `akb_discard_image` | Validated inline Markdown images — proxy-side in `akb-mcp` 2.2+ |
| `akb_create_table` / `akb_alter_table` / `akb_drop_table` / `akb_sql` | Tabular content — per-doc tables + SQL |
| `akb_browse` | Tree traversal (collection → docs) |
| `akb_search` / `akb_grep` | Hybrid search (dense + BM25) / literal grep |
| `akb_drill_down` | Section-level retrieval |
| `akb_relations` / `akb_link` / `akb_unlink` / `akb_graph` | Knowledge graph |
| `akb_edit` / `akb_diff` / `akb_history` | In-place edit, diff, revision history |
| `akb_grant` / `akb_revoke` / `akb_set_public` | Permission boundaries — per-user, per-org, public |
| `akb_publish` / `akb_unpublish` | Public publication |

Agent memory and session lifecycle are not MCP tools — they live on
the dedicated `/api/v1/agent-sessions` REST surface, driven by AKB
lifecycle plugins (`akb-claude-code`, `akb-cursor`, …) that hook into
the agent's own SessionStart / PreCompact / SessionEnd events. As an
agent, your own memory vault (`agent-memory-{username}`) is browsable
through the standard `akb_search` / `akb_browse` / `akb_get` tools
exactly like any other vault.

The full tool catalogue is exposed via `akb_help()` from any MCP client.

### Inline document images from MCP

Inline images are hidden document attachments, not browsable Files. Upload a
local PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP (maximum 10 MiB), then insert the returned
Markdown without reconstructing its asset URL:

```text
image = akb_put_image(
  parent="akb://eng/coll/specs",
  file_path="/workspace/architecture.png",
  alt_text="Request processing architecture")

akb_put(
  parent="akb://eng/coll/specs",
  title="Request Processing",
  content="# Architecture\n\n" + image.markdown)
```

For an existing document, use `akb_get` followed by a targeted
`akb_edit(base_commit=...)`. Do not pass only the image fragment to
`akb_update(content=...)`, which replaces the complete body. Image bytes are
immutable: replacing an image means uploading a new one and editing the
Markdown reference. Remove an image by deleting its Markdown expression; use
`akb_discard_image` only for an upload that never reached a successful document
commit. Run `akb_help(topic="images")` for retention and publication behavior.

The image tools require both the matching backend release and `akb-mcp` 2.2 or
newer. For upgrades, deploy the backend first, then publish/install the proxy
and restart existing MCP processes so they load the updated tool list.

## Document Format

Every vault resource has a location-aware AKB URI — the canonical handle
used by every tool and stored in relations. As of 0.3.0:

```
akb://{vault}                                          vault root (browse target)
akb://{vault}/coll/{coll_path}                         collection (browse target)
akb://{vault}[/coll/{coll_path}]/doc/{filename}        document
akb://{vault}[/coll/{coll_path}]/table/{name}          table
akb://{vault}[/coll/{coll_path}]/file/{uuid}           file
```

The `/coll/{coll_path}` segment is omitted for resources at the vault
root. Walking up a URI to its parent collection is a pure string
operation — paste the parent into `akb_browse(uri=...)` to list
siblings without an extra lookup.

...
```

### Open Knowledge Format (OKF) compatible

With the explicit Bare Git backend, a vault is stored as a git tree of
`.md` + YAML-frontmatter files whose
identity is the path — the same model as Google Cloud's
[Open Knowledge Format](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog)
(OKF v0.1), which AKB independently arrived at before the spec existed.
AKB-authored bundles satisfy all three OKF MUST rules. The Git-tree exporter
below exports Bare Git vaults as a conformant OKF bundle (documents, plus tables/files as concept docs)
and validates bundles. It is not a Native vault exporter:

```bash
python -m app.cli okf-export --from-git /data/vaults/_worktrees/<vault> \
    --vault <vault> --out ./okf-out/
python -m app.cli okf-validate ./okf-out/
```

OKF and AKB are complementary — OKF standardizes *how knowledge is written
down*; AKB stores, versions, searches, governs, and serves it to agents. See
[`okf/`](okf/) for the mapping and a sample bundle.

## Quick Start

New installations use **PostgreSQL Native** with a persisted installation identity
and an explicit database bootstrap. Use a **new Compose project and never-used
database**. Existing installations must follow the
[pre-upgrade preservation procedure](docs/operations/native-installation.md#preserve-existing-configuration-before-changing-defaults)
before using this version; changing a default does not migrate their data.

The recommended stack runs PostgreSQL with pgvector, MinIO, API, a separate
worker, and frontend. One-shot services prepare the File bucket and Native
authority before the application starts. Docker Compose 2.24.4+ is required.
Configure an OpenAI-compatible embedding endpoint for dense search; pgvector
and Qdrant degrade to BM25-only lexical search when embedding is unavailable.

```bash
# 1. Build this checkout's images. For a registry installation, use a backend
# image pinned as registry.example.com/akb-backend@sha256:... instead.
docker build -t akb-backend:native-local ./backend
docker compose -p my-native-install build frontend postgres
export AKB_NATIVE_IMAGE="$(docker image inspect akb-backend:native-local --format '{{.Id}}')"
export AKB_NATIVE_CONFIG_DIR="$PWD/config/native"

# 2. Prepare installation assets ONCE. Keep them and the original template.
mkdir -p "$AKB_NATIVE_CONFIG_DIR"
cp config/app.yaml.example "$AKB_NATIVE_CONFIG_DIR/template.yaml"
cp config/secret.yaml.example "$AKB_NATIVE_CONFIG_DIR/secret.yaml"
$EDITOR "$AKB_NATIVE_CONFIG_DIR/template.yaml" # provider and public URL settings
$EDITOR "$AKB_NATIVE_CONFIG_DIR/secret.yaml"   # credentials and independent secrets

docker run --rm -v "$AKB_NATIVE_CONFIG_DIR:/installation" \
  "$AKB_NATIVE_IMAGE" python -m app.cli generate-local-session-keyset \
  --output-dir /installation/local-session
docker run --rm -v "$AKB_NATIVE_CONFIG_DIR:/installation" \
  "$AKB_NATIVE_IMAGE" python -m app.cli prepare-native-config \
  --source /installation/template.yaml --secret /installation/secret.yaml \
  --output /installation/app.yaml --tenant-id my-installation --namespace akb \
  --image-digest "${AKB_NATIVE_IMAGE##*@}"

# 3. Use the same project, files and environment on every subsequent operation.
docker compose -p my-native-install \
  -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.native.yaml up -d --no-build

# 4. Provision the local recovery administrator with an operator-owned password.
docker compose -p my-native-install \
  -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.native.yaml \
  exec -T backend python -m app.cli provision-recovery-admin local \
  --username recovery-admin --email recovery-admin@example.com \
  --password-file - < /secure/operator/recovery-admin.password

open http://localhost:3000
```

To upgrade, update the checkout and repeat step 1 before step 3. `up --no-build`
never builds, so it cannot pick up what the new checkout builds (`frontend`,
`postgres`): a missing image makes it fail, and an old one keeps running. On the
upgrade that turned PostgreSQL into a built image, skipping step 1 stops the API
(`backend`) and then fails with `No such image: my-native-install-postgres:latest`,
which leaves the API down.

The local image ID pins the locally built bytes; it is not a registry digest.
For distributed installs, build/push first and use the registry digest for
`AKB_NATIVE_IMAGE`. Keep the generated initializing image receipt unchanged
when upgrading the workload image. Never regenerate identity or local-session
keys on restart. On Linux, ensure the operator can read and back up assets
created by the container (or run the preparer with the operator's UID/GID).

The generated `app.yaml` and companion `secret.yaml` are the single source of
application configuration and are mounted read-only at `/etc/akb`.
`AKB_PROCESS_ROLE=all|api|worker` only selects process composition;
`AKB_TOKENIZER_PROCESSES=1..4` can reduce tokenizer concurrency. Revision
selection is not an environment-variable switch.

See the [Native installation guide](docs/operations/native-installation.md)
for image upgrades, bootstrap recovery and Kubernetes. The
[Compose guide](deploy/compose/README.md) preserves the explicit Bare Git
upgrade path. Helm, all-in-one and standalone SSO remain **legacy Bare Git
compatibility paths** in this release. Native does not support document
templates or external Git imports; its discovery and API reject those
capabilities. Existing migration/history/diff/activity compatibility remains.

Ordinary registration always creates a non-admin account, including on an
empty database. Administrator bootstrap is available only through the
operator CLI; there is no unauthenticated HTTP bootstrap endpoint. The CLI
profile must match `auth_mode`:

```bash
# Local: have AKB generate the password only when an operator-owned output
# file is explicitly requested. A new file is created with mode 0600 and the
# password is not written to stdout, stderr, logs, or application config.
python -m app.cli provision-recovery-admin local \
  --username recovery-admin --email recovery-admin@example.com \
  --generate-password-file /secure/operator/recovery-admin.password

# SSO: pre-bind the product administrator to the exact external identity.
# Username and email are snapshots; issuer + subject are the identity key.
python -m app.cli provision-recovery-admin sso \
  --username recovery-admin --email recovery-admin@example.com \
  --issuer https://issuer.example.com/realms/akb \
  --subject exact-provider-subject
```

The same exact identity is idempotent. A different designation, an existing
username/email, or an already-bound external identity fails closed. The SSO
command stores no usable local password and does not contact the identity
provider. Generated output files are create-only and never overwritten; for a
retry after the file exists, pass that file back with `--password-file`.

The two local forms differ in one further way. `--generate-password-file` is
AKB producing a credential and handing it over, so the account it creates owes
a replacement for it: the first session that credential opens can reach the
password change and nothing else, exactly as a password reset behaves.
`--password-file` installs a value the caller already holds — AKB delivers it
to nobody — so it arms nothing, and an installation that signs in as this
account to bootstrap its own service identity keeps working. To force a
replacement for a credential supplied that way, rotate it afterwards with the
command below; rotation always leaves the account owing a change.

If that credential later leaks, is lost, or has to be taken back, rotate it
rather than reprovisioning the account:

```bash
# Break-glass: replace the credential and print the new one once. Nothing
# stores or logs the value, and the machine-readable report omits it.
python -m app.cli issue-recovery-admin-credential \
  --expected-username recovery-admin \
  --expected-email recovery-admin@example.com
```

Rotation names the account it expects and refuses any mismatch, so it cannot
act on the wrong one. The credential it replaces stops working immediately,
including one currently in use, and sessions held before the rotation are
revoked — both are what a compromise response requires. The same operation is
available at `POST /admin/recovery-admin/issue-credential`, which requires an
independent service-administrator token rather than a human session. Rotation
is not available in `sso` mode: the identity provider holds the credential,
and nothing in a running AKB can replace it.

Open `/admin` for the separate product-administration surface. In `local`
mode it accepts the provisioned local administrator and returns the same
`local-session-rs256-v2` profile used by local human authentication, but it
refuses non-admin accounts. In `sso` mode local credentials are absent:
`/admin` uses a dedicated confidential `akb-admin` Keycloak client with PKCE
and nonce, then accepts only the exact pre-bound `(issuer, subject)` whose AKB
account is still active and `is_admin=true`.

In SSO mode the same `/admin` surface can configure a built-in upstream IdP,
save it disabled, inspect its exact broker redirect URI, and enable or disable
its ordinary-login option without redeploying AKB. The option becomes a usable
button only when the server-side browser-session capability is ready. Client
secrets are write-only, and an enabled provider must be disabled before
reconfiguration.
See the [SSO provider guide](./docs/sso/README.md), the standards-based
[generic OIDC integration](./docs/sso/providers/oidc.md), and the stricter
[Keycloak OIDC reference](./docs/sso/providers/keycloak-oidc.md). Existing
Kubernetes installations should also follow the
[local-to-SSO cutover runbook](./docs/sso/kubernetes-cutover.md) instead of
treating `auth_mode` as a rolling one-line configuration change.

The dedicated admin callback stores no Keycloak access, refresh, or ID token.
It creates a short-lived opaque HttpOnly admin cookie plus a CSRF token;
PostgreSQL stores only their hashes plus the exact identity snapshot, and
rechecks the account, unchanged external binding, and admin flag on every
request. Its one-time OIDC state is also bound to a short-lived HttpOnly cookie
so a callback copied into another browser fails before token exchange.
Configure `keycloak_admin_client_secret`, register
`<public_base_url>/api/v1/admin/auth/keycloak/callback` and
`<public_base_url>/admin` in the dedicated client, and keep the admin client ID
out of every API/MCP resource-client path. Browser-facing AKB and Keycloak URLs
must use HTTPS outside the explicit loopback development exception.

Ordinary SSO login uses the separate `akb-web` client. The browser receives
only an opaque HttpOnly AKB session plus a readable CSRF value; SSO does not
mint an AKB user JWT. AKB encrypts the Keycloak refresh/ID token set with the
independent `sso_browser_session_encryption_key` and never persists an access
token. The client must map Keycloak's `identity_provider` user-session note
into both ID and access tokens with `oidc-usersessionmodel-note-mapper`; AKB
binds that signed broker alias to the selected enabled provider on callback
and every refresh. Production HTTPS cookies use the browser-enforced `__Host-` prefix,
`Secure`, no `Domain`, and `Path=/`; loopback HTTP uses isolated development
names. Generate the key as 32 random bytes encoded with unpadded base64url and
keep it stable across restarts. See the [Keycloak boundary](./docs/designs/keycloak-oidc/00-overview.md)
for refresh, logout, and back-channel revocation details.

Local login issues only the versioned `local-session-rs256-v2` profile:
RS256 with an installation-owned RSA-3072 key, an RFC 7638 `kid`, exact
deployment issuer/audience, `jti`, and a public-only JWKS at
`GET /api/v1/auth/jwks`. AKB never chooses a verifier from an untrusted token
`alg` header. Upgrading from an HS256 release is an intentional forced-login
boundary: generate and persist the v2 keyset before rollout, set
`jwt_algorithm: RS256`, and restart all backends together. Existing HS256 user
sessions then receive 401 and must sign in again; PATs and service keys are not
revoked. The old `jwt_secret` may be retained for one release only as migration
input for short-lived internal HMAC capabilities, or renamed unchanged to
`system_hmac_secret`; it is never accepted as human-session signing material.

For routine v2 key rotation, generate a new directory while retaining the
current public JWKS, publish the new immutable Secret/config revision, and
roll every backend to that exact pair:

```bash
cd backend
uv run python -m app.cli generate-local-session-keyset \
  --output-dir /secure/akb/local-session-next \
  --retain-jwks /secure/akb/local-session-current/jwks.json
```

Keep a retained public key for at least `jwt_expire_hours` plus rollout skew,
then remove it in a later coordinated keyset revision. Restoring the previous
private/JWKS pair is the rollback; never overwrite key files in place.

### Vector store (driver-pluggable)

See [BM25 statistics and VChord-only deployments](docs/vector-store-bm25-statistics.md)
for weight conventions, external statistics consumers and posting rollback requirements.

Hybrid search (dense + BM25 sparse, RRF-fused) runs through a driver
interface. Five drivers ship; pick at config time:

- **`pgvector`** (default) — uses the same Postgres container that holds
  application data. The install paths build that container's image from
  `deploy/postgres/Dockerfile`: pgvector plus the `vchord_bm25` BM25 index,
  which gives a new database the default `vchord` sparse shape. The driver
  creates a separate `vector_index` schema, so the main `chunks` table stays
  plain PostgreSQL. RRF fusion runs application-side. No external service to
  operate.
- **`qdrant`** — runs a separate Qdrant container; native RRF via the
  Query API. Useful when you already operate Qdrant or want to scale
  the vector store independently of Postgres.
- **`seahorse-cloud`** — points at a managed [Seahorse Cloud][shc] table
  over its BFF management API + per-table data-plane host (Bearer auth).
  No infrastructure to run on your side; you provision a table in the
  Seahorse console (or let the driver auto-create one) and AKB stores
  its chunks there. Native RRF, server-side BM25. See
  [`docs/vector-store-seahorse.md`](./docs/vector-store-seahorse.md)
  for the end-to-end setup walkthrough (sign-up → token → schema →
  config).
- **`seahorse-db`** — points at a **self-hosted SeahorseDB** cluster via
  its Coral coordinator HTTP API. You run Coral + Writer + Reader(s) +
  Redis + Kafka + a sparse-embedding server yourself (the SeahorseDB
  monorepo's `deploy/docker-compose.yml` brings up a minimal single-box
  stack). Native dense+sparse hybrid. Unlike the other drivers it does
  **not** support BM25-only fallback when the embed API is down (its
  sparse path is server-side and structurally coupled to a live embed
  step) — keep an embedding endpoint reachable for this driver.
- **`seahorse-db-grpc`** *(experimental)* — same Coral coordinator as
  `seahorse-db`, same `seahorsedb_*` settings, but talks gRPC instead
  of REST/JSONL. Coral merges axum + tonic onto a single listener so
  the port doesn't change; only the wire format does. Trades the JSON
  parsing path (and a class of foot-guns like INT64 sign mismatch and
  Arrow JSON decoder edge cases) for typed protobuf messages and an
  Arrow IPC streaming result. Prefer the REST driver for production
  until the gRPC variant clears its own QPS / recall benchmark. Same
  CRUD parity with REST (passes the same 25-scenario hybrid e2e), but
  it has not yet had the production-scale exposure the REST driver
  has.

Switching drivers is a config edit (no schema migration on the main DB):

```bash
# Default flow targets pgvector.
docker compose up

# Qdrant:
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.qdrant.yaml up
$EDITOR config/app.yaml     # vector_store_driver: qdrant
                            # vector_url: http://qdrant:6333

# Seahorse Cloud (managed; full guide in docs/vector-store-seahorse.md):
docker compose up           # no extra container needed
$EDITOR config/app.yaml     # vector_store_driver: seahorse-cloud
                            # seahorse_cloud_tenant_uuid: <your tenant>
                            # seahorse_cloud_table_name: <your table>
$EDITOR config/secret.yaml  # seahorse_cloud_token: shsk_<...>

# SeahorseDB (self-hosted cluster reached via the Coral coordinator):
docker compose up           # run the SeahorseDB stack separately
$EDITOR config/app.yaml     # vector_store_driver: seahorse-db
                            # seahorsedb_coordinator_url: http://localhost:3003
                            # seahorsedb_table_name: akb_chunks
```

Embedding model + dimensions are also fully pluggable via
`embed_base_url` / `embed_model` / `embed_dimensions` — the codebase has
no hard-coded model. For pgvector with HNSW, keep `embed_dimensions ≤ 2000`
(or 4000 with `halfvec`); larger models fall back to exact scan.
Qdrant / Seahorse (cloud or db) have no such limit (Qdrant up to 65536,
Seahorse up to its table-defined dim).

### LLM features (optional)

LLM is only used by the `metadata_worker` to auto-tag documents imported via
external git mirroring. Core CRUD/search works without it. To enable, set
`llm_base_url` / `llm_model` in `app.yaml` and `llm_api_key` in `secret.yaml`.

Standalone deployments default to `model_api_governance_mode: external_metering`
and may point embedding, chat, and rerank at any compatible provider. A managed
control plane can instead set `platform_hard` plus an exact
`platform_gateway_base_url`. In that mode AKB fails startup if an active model
route points anywhere else or lacks a credential, and every model call carries
a caller-generated `Idempotency-Key` for durable gateway reservation/settlement.
Gateway policy or budget denials are never fanned out into per-item retries.

### Event fanout (optional)

The PG `events` outbox is always written. Set `redis_url` in `app.yaml` to
have the `events_publisher` worker drain the outbox to a Redis Stream
(`akb:events`) so external services can subscribe via `XREAD` / consumer
groups. Leave blank to disable; events still accumulate in PG and you can
build an SSE endpoint on top of the LISTEN/NOTIFY trigger without Redis.

### Audit log (optional)

Off by default. Set `audit.enabled: true` in `app.yaml` to emit a structured,
append-only, **hash-chained** JSON-lines audit log at the MCP dispatch
chokepoint — every read, write, and auth denial, uniformly. AKB is a
**producer only**: it does not store, query, or retain audit data; your SIEM
(Splunk/QRadar/Elastic) scrapes the stream and owns retention under its own
compliance regime. Each line carries a monotonic `seq` plus
`sha256(prev ‖ line)`, so the chain can be verified for dropped or altered
lines and re-seeds from disk across restarts. Optionally hand the daily
rolled file off to a **WORM** object-storage bucket (`audit.bucket` —
provision with Object Lock and a write-only key for a true immutable trail);
the local buffer is pruned only after a confirmed upload. Capture is
best-effort and never raises into the serving path. See
`config/app.yaml.example` for the full `audit:` block.

### Production deployment

For Kubernetes, start with the
[`deployment guide`](./deploy/k8s/README.md). AKB provides standalone local and
standalone-SSO resource sets through both Helm and Kustomize.

- Use the dependency-free [`AKB Helm chart`](./deploy/helm/akb/README.md) for a
  standard `helm upgrade --install` workflow.
- Use [`deploy/k8s`](./deploy/k8s/README.md) for the standalone Kustomization or
  `deploy/k8s/standalone-sso` for an installation-owned Keycloak stack.
- Both paths consume pre-existing, operator-owned Kubernetes Secrets. AKB does
  not install or operate a credential service or synchronization controller.

Real hostnames, registries, storage classes, TLS issuers, and provider settings
belong in Helm values or an operator-owned Kustomize overlay; do not commit
production credentials to this repository.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.14, FastAPI, Uvicorn, asyncpg, GitPython, MCP SDK
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 (main DB needs no extension; the same
  pgvector/pgvector image hosts the optional vector_index schema)
- **Vector store**: driver-pluggable (pgvector default; Qdrant,
  Seahorse Cloud, or self-hosted SeahorseDB optional — hybrid dense +
  BM25 sparse, RRF fusion; BM25-only fallback when embed is down)
- **Event stream** (optional): PG `events` outbox + Redis Streams fanout
- **Audit log** (optional): hash-chained append-only JSONL at the MCP
  dispatch point + optional WORM S3 handoff; producer-only (SIEM owns retention)
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, Radix UI
- **Auth**: local RS256 sessions or Keycloak SSO, plus Personal Access Tokens
  (PATs) for API and MCP access
- **MCP**: Streamable HTTP (backend) + stdio proxy (`akb-mcp` on npm)

## Versioning

AKB follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/). The backend product version lives in
`backend/pyproject.toml` (`[project].version`). A coordinated release uses
`scripts/bump-version.sh <x.y.z>` to update it together with
`frontend/package.json`. With image building enabled, each
`deploy/k8s/deploy.sh` run tags the Docker images with both the
explicit backend version (`:${VERSION}`) and `:latest`, so historical builds
remain pullable for rollback.

`packages/akb-mcp-client` (the `akb-mcp` npm proxy) follows its own npm
semver lifecycle and is **not** tied to the product version.

## License

The AKB backend, frontend, and deployment manifests are licensed under

release.

The npm `akb-mcp` proxy (`packages/akb-mcp-client/`) is separately
licensed under the **MIT License** so it can be freely embedded in any
agent client without restriction.

**Free production use of the backend** — you may deploy AKB in
production, commercial or not, provided your aggregate deployment
serves **fewer than 100 Named Seats** (distinct human user accounts in
the `users` table, per deployment; service accounts and
90-day-inactive accounts excluded — see [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for the
precise definition).

**Commercial license required** for any of:

- Production use of the backend at or above 100 Named Seats.
- Offering AKB (modified or not) as a hosted service, on-premises
  product, embedded component, or rebranded distribution to third
  parties — regardless of seat count.
