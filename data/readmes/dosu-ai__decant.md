Decant turns the Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI session logs on your machine
into tangible insights. See where tokens, cost, and agent time go, inspect
context usage, find the files and tools agents touch, and search complete
transcripts from a CLI or local web UI.

Decant is local-first. It makes no outbound network calls at runtime, and your
transcripts never leave your machine.

It does keep a copy of them. To make sessions searchable, Decant writes prompts,
tool inputs, tool output, and canonicalized raw records for retained transcript
messages into an **unencrypted** SQLite archive at `~/.decant/decant.db`, with a
full-text index over the prompt and tool-argument text. Whatever your agents read
is in there too — source code, file contents, local paths, and any credentials
pasted into a session. Decant creates the archive owner-only (`0600`). If your
organization has a retention policy for agent transcripts, this archive is
subject to it. See
[What the archive stores](docs/data-lifecycle.md#what-the-archive-stores) to
inspect, delete, or remove it.

## Quick start

Run Decant with `npx` with no Bun install or global package required.

```sh
npx @dosu/decant@latest
```

This starts the local UI at <http://127.0.0.1:3000>, indexes the Claude Code,
Codex, and Gemini CLI logs on your machine, and watches for changes.

## What you get

- One SQLite archive for Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI sessions.
- Full-text search across messages, tool calls, and transcripts.
- Token, [estimated cost](docs/pricing.md), context, activity, tool, MCP, and
  file analytics.
- Browsable sessions, projects, files, and ingest diagnostics.
- Markdown, JSON, report, and trajectory exports.
- Deterministic scripts, replays, and agent instructions distilled from command
  history.

## Install

Published binaries support macOS and Linux on x64 and arm64. Native Windows
binaries are not currently available.

Install a persistent command with npm:

```sh
npm install --global @dosu/decant@latest
decant
```

Or use Homebrew:

```sh
brew install dosu-ai/dosu/decant
decant
```

Or install the latest release without Node.js or Bun:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dosu-ai/decant/main/install.sh | sh
decant
```

See [Distribution](docs/distribution.md) for installer options, Docker, source
builds, and release verification.

## Docker

```sh
docker run --rm \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 \
  -v decant-data:/var/lib/decant \
  -v "$HOME/.claude/projects:/sources/claude:ro" \
  -v "$HOME/.codex:/sources/codex:ro" \
  -v "$HOME/.gemini/tmp:/sources/gemini:ro" \
  ghcr.io/dosu-ai/decant:latest
```

Keep the `127.0.0.1:` prefix. Publishing `-p 3000:3000` exposes the
unauthenticated archive API on every host interface. Custom container networks
may need the trusted-peer setting documented under
[Docker distribution](docs/distribution.md#docker).

The source mounts are read-only, but `decant-data` is a **named volume**: the
archive outlives every container, and neither `--rm` nor `docker rm` removes it.
Use `docker volume rm decant-data` when you want it gone.

## CLI

```sh
decant                         # start the local web UI
decant sync                    # index new and changed sessions
decant ls                      # list sessions
decant show 1                  # render a transcript
decant search "auth bug"       # full-text search
decant stats --by model        # usage and cost rollups
decant economics               # token, cost, and time breakdowns
decant files --group ext       # file hotspots
decant tool stats              # tool usage
decant mcp stats               # MCP server usage
decant export 1 > session.md   # export a session
decant db info                 # what the archive holds and where
decant session rm 1 --yes      # delete a session and its descendants
decant db vacuum               # release the freed pages after a delete
```

Run `decant --help` or `decant <command> --help` for all commands and flags.
Read commands support `--json`; global flags include `--db`, `--format`,
`--quiet`, `--no-color`, and `--no-sync`.

Decant reads `~/.claude/projects`, `~/.codex`, and `~/.gemini/tmp` by default.
Override them with `DECANT_CLAUDE_DIR`, `DECANT_CODEX_DIR`, and
`DECANT_GEMINI_DIR`, or with the corresponding `--claude-dir`, `--codex-dir`,
and `--gemini-dir` flags on `sync`, `watch`, and `serve`.

To index selected files or a temporary source tree:

```sh
decant --db /tmp/decant.db sync --path ./session.jsonl --path ./sessions
```

## Local API

The OpenAPI 3.1 contract is [docs/api/openapi.yaml](docs/api/openapi.yaml), and
a running server exposes it at
<http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/openapi.json>. See [API recipes](docs/api/recipes.md)
for examples.
