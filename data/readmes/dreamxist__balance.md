  <h1>Balance</h1>
  <p><em>Opinionated personal finance, built around one promise: every coin is located and explained.</em></p>
</div>

Balance is a personal-finance app for developers who want full control over their money model. It is built on top of Supabase, ships a TypeScript CLI, and uses the **Balance Assertion with Reconciliation** pattern at its core: your real positions (cash in accounts, cards, investments, debts) must always equal the sum of your registered transactions. Delta = 0 or you find out fast.

This is not a YNAB or Mint replacement. It is a self-hosted, code-first alternative for people who like spreadsheets, the command line, and the idea that their financial system should be auditable end to end.

Status: **Beta — building in public.** Used daily by the author to migrate 9 years of Excel history. Schema is stable; UI iterating.

## Demo

> Replace `docs/assets/demo.gif` with a real recording. A 20-second loop showing `bal balance` + the dashboard works well.

## Features

- **Balance assertion engine.** Position vs. accumulated, delta = 0, or you debug it.
- **First-class CLI.** Add expenses, income, transfers, and debt payments without touching the browser.
- **Web dashboard.** React + Vite SPA: net worth, cash flow, debts, recurring charges, snapshots.
- **Multiple account types.** Cash, debit, credit cards, investments (Fintual integration), debts, receivables, properties.
- **Installment-aware debts.** Buy now, register later: full expense at purchase, monthly debt payments tracked separately.
- **Recurring charges.** Automatic ones (subscriptions, debt installments) are auto-registered by an edge-function cron with month catch-up; manual ones are surfaced at reconciliation so you know what's still on you to pay.
- **Snapshots & immutable history.** Transactions are never edited or deleted — corrections happen via undo / refund / adjustment.
- **Strict isolation.** Postgres RLS on every table. CLI uses short-lived JWTs minted from API keys, never `service_role`.
- **Fully self-hostable.** Supabase free tier is enough for personal use.

## Quick start (CLI)

The published CLI is `@dreamxist/bal-cli`. You still need a Supabase backend with the Balance schema deployed — see [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md).

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install -g @dreamxist/bal-cli

# 2. Point at your backend + log in with an API key
export SUPABASE_URL="https://<project-ref>.supabase.co"
export SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="<anon-key>"
bal login --api-key bal_...

# 3. Check your books
bal balance
```

More commands:

```bash
bal add 12000 supermercado --account "Checking"
bal add 1500000 sueldo --type income --account "Checking"
bal list --period month --type expense
bal key list
```

## Personal and SpA (two entities)

Balance tracks **two entities** in one database: your **personal** finances and, optionally, a **company (SpA)**. The `entity` field (`personal` | `spa`) keeps accounts and transactions separate, and reconciliation is scoped per entity — so company activity never breaks your personal `delta = 0`.

| | Personal | SpA (company) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accounts | `on_budget = true` | `entity = 'spa'`, usually `on_budget = false` |
| Reconciliation | full cuadre (delta 0) | tracked as **gross net worth** (pre-tax), excluded from personal delta |
| Commands | `bal add` / `bal balance` / `bal list` | `bal spa …` + `bal balance --entity spa` |

### Personal

```bash
bal balance                 # personal reconciliation (default)
bal add 12000 comida --account "Checking"
bal list --period month --type expense
```

### SpA (invoicing, VAT/F29, owner salary)

```bash
bal balance --entity spa                                          # company cash + month income/expenses
bal spa invoice create --direction emitida --counterpart "Client" --neto 2000000 --create-transaction  # sales invoice (VAT 19%)
bal spa invoice create --direction recibida --counterpart "Supplier" --neto 11990                       # domestic purchase (VAT credit)
bal spa gasto 10 saas --moneda USD --tc 950 --note "Hosting"      # foreign expense (no VAT credit)
bal spa f29 2026-05                                               # monthly VAT/F29 summary
bal spa f29-declarar 2026-05 --codigo 091=380355 --folio 123      # store official SII figures
bal spa sueldo 900000 --to "Checking"                            # owner salary SpA→personal
bal spa annual                                                   # yearly sales/costs/profit
bal patrimonio --neto --tasa 12.5                               # gross vs estimated after-tax net worth
```

The SpA module is feature-flagged (`profiles.features.spa`) and also has a web view at `/spa`. Foreign SaaS purchases are expensed without VAT credit (they go to the annual income tax, not the monthly F29); the official SII F29 codes are the source of truth.

## Self-host

Balance is designed to run on your own Supabase project. Step-by-step instructions, including migrations, edge functions, secrets, and cron setup, live in [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md).

Costs: a personal-scale install fits comfortably in the Supabase free tier (one project, < 500 MB DB, daily edge-function cron). Web hosting is also free on Vercel.
