> **Run code on any device from anywhere — using just HTTP.**                                                   
Intent Bus is a zero-infrastructure job coordination system with retries, atomic locking, priority scheduling, and cross-device workers.                                
Built for developers who want something lighter than Redis, RabbitMQ, or Firebase, while still being more reliable than cron.

# What makes this different?

- Trigger your **Android phone from a cloud server**
- Run jobs across devices **without opening ports**
- Coordinate scripts using **just HTTP + curl**
- **Priority queues** so important jobs are claimed first
- **Capability routing** so workers only claim supported jobs
- **Dead-letter queue** so failed jobs are archived instead of disappearing
- No Redis, RabbitMQ, or managed broker required

No external broker. Just a minimal Flask + SQLite core.

---

# How it works

1. A client **POSTs a job** to `/intent`
2. Workers **poll `/claim`**
3. One worker **atomically claims** the job
4. Worker executes and calls `/fulfill/<id>`
5. Failed jobs are retried with exponential backoff
6. Jobs exceeding retry limits move to the dead-letter queue

Claims are lease-based and automatically expire if a worker disappears before fulfillment.

# Why not just use X?

| Tool | Problem |
|------|---------|
| **Cron** | No coordination, no retries, silent failures |
| **Redis / Celery** | Requires running and maintaining infrastructure |
| **RabbitMQ** | Heavier operational complexity |
| **Firebase** | Vendor lock-in, SDK overhead, pricing at scale |
| **Intent Bus** | ✅ Small deployable core with minimal ops |

---

# Who is this for?

- Developers running scripts across multiple machines
- People using **Termux / Android automation**
- Indie hackers avoiding infrastructure complexity
- Anyone wanting job queues without Redis or RabbitMQ

Intent Bus is designed for low-to-medium traffic workloads and performs well under moderate concurrency when deployed with Docker.

# Authentication

Intent Bus supports two auth modes for regular clients and a separate admin auth layer.

## Standard Auth

```text
X-API-KEY: your_key_here
```

Works with curl, bash scripts, and lightweight devices.

## Strict Auth

Strict auth supports:

- HMAC-SHA256 signed requests
- Nonce-based replay protection
- Canonical request serialization

The Python SDK handles this automatically.

Enable globally using:

```bash
BUS_REQUIRE_SIGNATURES=true
```

## Admin Auth

Admin endpoints (`/admin/*`) use separate credentials:

- `X-Admin-Token: <BUS_ADMIN_SECRET>`
- HTTP Basic auth

---

# Quickstart (CLI)

```bash
pip install intent-bus
export INTENT_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

## Publish a job

```bash
intent-bus publish send_notification '{"instruction":"Hello"}' -n default
```

## Run a worker

```bash
intent-bus listen send_notification -n default -c notify
```

---

# Quickstart (Python SDK)

```bash
pip install intent-bus
```

## Publish a job

```python
from intent_bus import IntentClient

with IntentClient(api_key="your_key_here") as client:
    published = client.publish(
        goal="send_notification",
        payload={"instruction": "Hello from the cloud"},
        idempotency_key="task_123",
        priority=500,
    )

    print(f"Published: {published.id}")
```

## Job Visibility

- `private` *(default)* — only workers using the same API key can claim the job
- `public` — any authenticated worker in the namespace can claim it

> Public jobs should only be used in trusted environments.

## Run a worker

```python
from intent_bus import IntentClient, WorkerRuntime

def handler(job):
    print("Received:", job.payload.get("instruction"))

    return {
        "result": "delivered",
        "result_type": "text",
    }

client = IntentClient(api_key="your_key_here")
runtime = WorkerRuntime(client=client)

runtime.listen(
    goal="send_notification",
    handler=handler,
)
```

> Workers must be idempotent.
> The same job may be delivered more than once if:
>
> - the worker crashes mid-execution
> - the lease expires before `/fulfill` is called
> - the network drops after the server marks the job fulfilled but before the response arrives
> - the bus retries due to an ambiguous failure

# Quickstart (curl / Bash)

## Publish a job

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-bus.render.com/intent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: your_key_here" \
  -d '{"goal":"send_notification","payload":{"instruction":"Hello"}}'
```

## Publish with priority and delay

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-bus.render.com/intent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: your_key_here" \
  -d '{"goal":"send_notification","payload":{"instruction":"Urgent"},"priority":900,"delay":5.0}'
```

## Claim and fulfill

```bash
# Claim
curl -s -X POST \
  "https://your-bus.render.com/claim?goal=send_notification" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: your_key_here"

# Fulfill
curl -s -X POST \
  "https://your-bus.render.com/fulfill/<INTENT_ID>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: your_key_here" \
  -d '{"claim_token":"<TOKEN>","result":"done","result_type":"text"}'
```

If a job is not fulfilled within 60 seconds, it is automatically requeued with exponential backoff.

> Workers should respect the `Retry-After` header after receiving `204 No Content`.

---

# Job Lifecycle

```text
open ──► claimed ──► fulfilled
                │
                ▼
              open (retry with backoff)
                │
                ▼
              dead ──► dead-letter queue
```

Dead letters can be inspected through admin endpoints and retried later.

---

# Smart Routing

## Target a specific worker

```python
client.publish(
    goal="run_backup",
    payload={"instruction": "/data"},
    target_worker="termux-phone-1",
)
```

Worker:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "https://your-bus.render.com/claim?goal=run_backup" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: key" \
  -H "X-Worker-ID: termux-phone-1"
```

## Require a capability

```python
client.publish(
    goal="transcribe_audio",
    payload={"instruction": "meeting.mp3"},
    required_capability="whisper",
)
```

Worker:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "https://your-bus.render.com/claim" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: key" \
  -H "X-Worker-Capabilities: whisper,ffmpeg,gpu"
```

Both fields can be combined.

# Example Use Cases

- Trigger a phone notification when a cloud scraper finishes
- Deploy to a Raspberry Pi behind a firewall without opening ports
- Relay alerts to Discord from scripts
- Replace fragile cron pipelines with loosely coupled workers
- Coordinate heterogeneous worker fleets

---

# Features

- Reliable delivery with retries
- Atomic locking
- Cryptographic claim tokens
- Dead-letter queue
- Priority scheduling
- Namespace isolation
- Worker targeting
- Capability matching
- Delayed execution
- Result storage
- Idempotency keys
- Optional HMAC signing

---

# Architecture Guarantees

- Jobs are not silently discarded during normal operation
- Only one worker can hold a valid lease at a time
- Workers can crash safely and jobs will be retried

# Deployment Capacity & Performance

| Profile | PythonAnywhere Free | Render (Docker) | Android 12 (Termux) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Light** (5w, 50j) | ✅ Works | 100% / 3.72 j/s / P99 0.594s | 100% / 4.74 j/s / P99 0.314s |
| **Medium** (15w, 500j) | ❌ 100% Network Errors | 99.5% / 13.27 j/s / P99 0.517s | 99.5% / 18.76 j/s / P99 2.028s |
| **Heavy** (40w, 2000j) | ❌ Failed | 99.01% / 13.62 j/s / P99 2.586s | 99.07% / 28.04 j/s / P99 2.556s |
| **Extreme** (100+w, 5000j) | ❌ Failed | Not tested | 98.89% / 18.52 j/s / P99 9.002s |

Benchmark runs recorded (v7.61 validation run, 2026-05-24):

> Android 12 phone running the server via Termux outperformed the Render free tier at Heavy load.
> PythonAnywhere free tier is not recommended due to single-threaded request handling.

- 0 network errors
- 0 lease lost
- 0 rate limit errors

Higher concurrency increases tail latency, but the system remains stable under sustained contention.

> Stress test running on Android 12 phone via Termux

# Deployment Recommendations

## Recommended

Deploy with Docker on:

- Render
- Railway
- Fly.io
- Heroku

Multi-threaded deployments handle concurrent worker polling more comfortably.

## Surprisingly Viable

The server has been stress-tested running directly on an
**Android 12 phone via Termux**, sustaining 28 j/s at
A+ grade under heavy load — outperforming a Render free
tier container.

## Not Ideal

PythonAnywhere free tier is not well suited for high-concurrency worker polling because a single-threaded app process can create backlog under sustained load.

---

# Safe Operating Limits

Based on current testing:

- Safe concurrent workers: ~40
- Sustained throughput: 13+ jobs/sec in tested environments
- Recommended deployment: Docker with multiple app threads
- Default payload size: 8KB per intent/result

Larger payloads can be enabled by increasing:

```python
app.config["MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH"]
MAX_PAYLOAD
```

# Why I built this

I wanted to trigger scripts on my Android phone from a cloud server without Firebase, open ports, or complex infrastructure.

So I built a tiny job bus using Flask + SQLite.
