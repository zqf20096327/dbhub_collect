safe-migrate finds risky PostgreSQL migrations before they reach production.
It parses SQL, simulates schema changes, and checks the result against a
synchronized database snapshot. It never executes migration SQL.

PostgreSQL 14–18 are supported.

## Install

With Rust installed:

```bash
cargo install safe-migrate --locked
```

Prebuilt binaries are available from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dsecurity49/safe-migrate/releases). The
installer verifies release checksums:

```bash
VERSION='v0.9.3'
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsecurity49/safe-migrate/${VERSION}/install.sh" |
  bash -s -- --version "${VERSION}"
```

Download `install.sh` first and run `sh install.sh --help` to review destination
and target options.

## Quick start

```bash
export DATABASE_URL='postgres://readonly_user@localhost:5432/app'
safe-migrate sync
safe-migrate lint-chain --dir migrations
```

`sync` writes `.safe-migrate.cache`. Later checks use that snapshot offline.
Run `safe-migrate cache inspect` to view its provenance and redacted contents.

## What it checks

The 29 built-in rules cover:

- blocking locks, table rewrites, constraints, indexes, partitions, and
  materialized-view refreshes;
- destructive changes, cascades, schema drift, dependency breakage, and
  migration ordering conflicts;
- grants, policies, disabled triggers, roles, and privilege-sensitive changes;
- missing timeouts, transaction-incompatible operations, dynamic SQL,
  volatile defaults, and rerun safety.

Run `safe-migrate rules` for the catalog or inspect one rule directly:

```bash
safe-migrate rules --rule require-concurrent-index
```

## GitHub Actions

Create and protect the `safe-migrate-baseline` GitHub environment, then run:

```bash
safe-migrate init github-actions --path migrations --configure-secrets
```

This generates a trusted baseline refresh and an offline PR check. Follow the
[GitHub Action guide](docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md) to connect the runner and create
the first baseline.

## Results

| Tier | Meaning | Default command result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Tier1` | Blocking safety problem | Exit `2` |
| `Tier2` | Needs review | Exit `0` |
| `Tier3` | Informational guidance | Exit `0` |

Operational failures—such as invalid SQL, configuration, or cache data—exit
`1`. Every finding includes a stable rule ID, a reason, and remediation:

```text
[HALT] Require concurrent index (require-concurrent-index)
  reason : Creating this index can block writes on a large table.
  recipe : Use CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY outside a transaction.
```

Use `--json` for automation or `--markdown` for review artifacts. See the
[CLI and report contract](docs/CONTRACT.md) for schemas, confidence, verdicts,
and compatibility guarantees.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `lint --file migration.sql` | Check one migration. |
| `lint-chain --dir migrations/` | Check ordered migrations with state carried forward. |
| `sync` | Refresh the database baseline. |
| `cache inspect` | Show baseline provenance and redacted counts. |
| `rules` | Browse rules and effective settings. |
| `init github-actions --path migrations/` | Generate the GitHub integration. |
| `init cache-key` | Generate a cache-encryption key. |

Run `safe-migrate <command> --help` for every option.

## Database baseline

`sync` reads PostgreSQL catalogs in a read-only, repeatable-read transaction.
Direct remote connections are rejected; use localhost, a Unix socket, or a
trusted tunnel:

```bash
ssh -N -L 5433:db.internal:5432 bastion
export DATABASE_URL='postgres://readonly_user@localhost:5433/app'
safe-migrate sync
```

The snapshot reflects the connected role and its session defaults. Choose
between a restricted catalog reader and the real migration role based on the
accuracy and credential tradeoff described in the
[Action guide](docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md#database-role-and-runner-security).

The cache contains infrastructure metadata, including schema, roles,
privileges, dependencies, and statistics. It contains no credentials, password
hashes, or subscription connection strings, but should still be treated as
sensitive.

`--no-cache` is an explicit degraded mode for parser investigation and limited
SQL-only checks. Existing objects are unknown, so confidence is `Tainted` and
many findings become conservative.

## Configuration

Most projects can start with the built-in defaults. Place overrides in
`safe-migrate.toml`:

```toml
schemas = ["public", "auth"]
tier1_threshold_rows = 100000

[rules.missing-idempotency]
disabled = true
```

Unknown settings and rule IDs are rejected. `safe-migrate rules --json` lists
the configuration supported by each rule.

Without a synchronized baseline, the built-in version fallback is deliberately
conservative. Set `assume_pg_version` only when the target is known to be
PostgreSQL 14–18; for example, `assume_pg_version = 170000`.

Suppress a reviewed finding with its primary rule ID:

```sql
-- safe-migrate: ignore(require-concurrent-index)
CREATE INDEX users_email_idx ON users (email);
```

Keep suppressions narrow and explain the reason in the migration review.

## Migration timeouts

If the migration runner does not already set timeouts, add them before
lock-sensitive changes:

```sql
SET lock_timeout = '5s';
SET statement_timeout = '15min';
```

Keep a positive `lock_timeout` shorter than a positive `statement_timeout`.

## Rust library

Rust integrations use `safe_migrate::api`. Load a synchronized baseline when
one is available; otherwise choose explicit conservative analysis.

```rust,no_run
use safe_migrate::api::{self, Baseline, Config};
use std::path::Path;

let config = Config::load_from_file(Path::new("safe-migrate.toml"))?;
let baseline = Baseline::load_optional(Path::new(".safe-migrate.cache"), &config)?;
let outcome = api::analyze(
    &config,
    "2026-09-05_add_index.sql",
    "CREATE INDEX ...",
    &baseline,
)?;

if outcome.should_halt() {
    eprintln!("{}", outcome.markdown());
}
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

`load_optional` treats only a missing cache as unavailable; corrupt,
incompatible, or incorrectly encrypted caches remain errors. The API exposes
typed immutable findings, verdicts, evidence, baseline inspection, rule
metadata, and synchronization. Mutable parser, cache, and state-machine
internals are not public. Full API documentation is on
[docs.rs](https://docs.rs/safe-migrate).

Embedded applications can call `sync_with_secrets` with a validated
`DatabaseUrl` and optional `CacheKey`. This avoids changing process-wide
environment variables; the CLI continues to read secrets from its environment.
