**Full Project Title:** Minh Khoe Tue Y (_Chinese Simplified: 明康慧医_; _Vietnamese: Minh Khỏe Tuệ Y_; _Nom Script: 明劸慧醫_ ) — Design and Implementation of a Health Management and Diagnostic Assistance System Based on LLMs and Multimodal Artificial Intelligence
**Abbreviation:** MKTY Smart Healthcare System

## 📖 Project Overview

This project overview is based on the "Abstract" section of the associated undergraduate thesis paper:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driven by the further proliferation of Internet applications and the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technologies, the application of computer technology in the healthcare domain has become increasingly extensive. Growing public demand for healthcare services can no longer be met by traditional diagnosis and healthcare management models. Issues such as low diagnostic efficiency, uneven medical resource allocation, patient inconvenience, and reliance on experience-based decision-making are becoming increasingly pronounced. Therefore, how to leverage Internet technologies and cutting-edge AI—particularly large language models (LLMs) and multimodal technologies—to enhance the digitalization and intelligence of healthcare services has become an important research question.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To explore the potential of Internet and AI technologies, especially LLMs and multimodal AI, in the healthcare domain, this research presents the design and implementation of **Minh Khoe Tue Y (MKTY)**—a health management and diagnostic assistance system based on LLMs and multimodal Artificial Intelligence. This work also represents the author’s contribution as an undergraduate student toward improving doctor-patient communication and optimizing diagnostic workflows.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MKTY platform is a distributed system that integrates nine core modules: **User Registration & Login, Personal Information Management, Multimodal Intelligent Diagnosis Assistance, Medical Q&A, Diagnostic Forum, Medical Record Management, Diagnostic Checklist Management, Resource Center, and Administrative Backend**. The overall architecture adopts a frontend-backend decoupled design. The backend business logic layer is built using the `Python Flask` framework, the database uses `MySQL`, and asynchronous messaging between the business logic and AI services is implemented using `RabbitMQ`, enabling distributed microservice deployment. The frontend utilizes `Vue3`, `axios`, and `Element Plus` for component-based UI and interactive features. System authentication is ensured via JWT to safeguard data security.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the AI service side, the “Multimodal Intelligent Diagnosis Assistance” module is based on a cascaded architecture integrating the `BioMedCLIP` contrastive learning model and `MarianMTModel` neural machine translation model for Chinese-English translation. By analyzing medical images, it computes the relative probabilities of multiple diagnostic descriptions in Chinese. The Medical Q&A, in-depth question analysis, and other natural language generation tasks are powered by the `MKTY-3B-Chat` large language model, fine-tuned on extensive medical texts using `LLaMA-Factory` and based on `Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct`. The “In-depth Question Analysis” module adopts a novel LLM generation paradigm self-developed by the author—termed the “Discussion Mechanism”—which deeply mines and guides the reasoning capabilities of the LLM.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full design and implementation process of the MKTY system is thoroughly presented in this thesis. The study begins by clarifying the industry background and rationale behind the chosen technology stack, then proceeds to analyze technical feasibility, core functional requirements, and implementation strategies in a layered fashion. The working principles and technical highlights of each module are discussed in detail, and system performance was comprehensively tested. The author concludes by summarizing achievements and proposing directions for future improvement. This project represents an exploratory endeavor in digital healthcare. If it can spark student interest in AI for healthcare and encourage broader participation in this field, that would be the greatest value of this research.

### MKTY-3B-Chat Large-scale Language Model

> Public model weights available at:
> [https://huggingface.co/Duyu/MKTY-3B-Chat](https://huggingface.co/Duyu/MKTY-3B-Chat)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**The MKTY-3B-Chat Large-scale Language Model** (Chinese Simplified: _明康慧医大模型_; Vietnamese: _MKTY-3B-Chat Mô hình Ngôn ngữ Quy mô Lớn_) is a core component of this project and was developed as the undergraduate capstone project for the Faculty of Computer Science and Technology, Grade 2025, at Qilu University of Technology (Shandong Academy of Sciences).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a parameter size of `3.09B` and quantization precision of `BF16`, the model has been fine-tuned and optimized specifically for domains such as medicine, healthcare, and biology, demonstrating superior performance compared to its base model, `Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct` (Chinese Simplified: _通义千问_). Fine-tuning was conducted using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) algorithm, focusing exclusively on Chinese language tasks. The process involved both incremental pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), implemented in two alternating rounds (i.e., one round of pretraining followed by one round of SFT, repeated once more). This design addresses the limitation of small-scale base models in absorbing domain-specific knowledge and mitigates the problem of catastrophic forgetting after a single SFT round.

**Training Data**:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training corpus includes diverse biomedical texts, diagnostic and Q\&A datasets, medical exam multiple-choice questions, and self-awareness prompts. MKTY’s main application scenarios in this project are: medical Q\&A, in-depth model discussions, treatment plan summarization, and diagnosis and drug recommendation based on medical records. To support these use cases, domain-specific datasets were curated:

* Biomedical texts for incremental pretraining to enhance domain knowledge
* Medical Q\&A datasets for SFT to improve answer quality
* Clinical diagnostic texts to enhance case interpretation
* Medical exam questions to instruct answer format and decision-making patterns
* Self-awareness prompts to embed model identity and provenance knowledge

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total volume of training data is approximately `2.88 GB` compressed (about `6.79 GB` uncompressed). All datasets are open-source and used in compliance with their respective licenses. Due to the high volume and dispersed nature of the data, only major sources are listed below. All data were preprocessed via cleaning and formatting:

### In-depth Agent Analysis

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "in-depth agent analysis" functionality is based on a custom-designed mechanism known as **Large Language Model Discussion Mechanism** `LLMDM`. It involves three hyperparameters: number of agents, number of discussion rounds, and convergence threshold. Identical models (MKTY-3B-Chat) with different contextual histories are treated as distinct agents.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first round, the system creates multiple simulated agents by assigning distinct context arrays to each. Each agent then independently responds to the target question. A "moderator" agent with no prior context synthesizes their responses. In subsequent rounds, the original question is merged with the moderator’s previous summary and redistributed to the agents, who again respond from their updated contexts. This process repeats until a maximum number of rounds is reached.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assess semantic convergence, `BigBird` is used to embed the final-round outputs into sentence vectors. The mean pairwise distance among these vectors serves as a proxy for consensus—i.e., discussion convergence—which users can interpret qualitatively.

### Time Series Prediction Model with Text Integration

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While most recent time series prediction models use `LSTM` or `GRU`, and newer Transformer-based models have emerged in 2024, these models rarely integrate multimodal inputs like text.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this research, a GRU-based medical time series prediction model was proposed using clinical textual descriptions. The core methodology is as follows:

1. A basic GRU layer performs initial temporal modeling.
2. The frequency domain of historical time series is extracted via FFT, yielding amplitude and phase vectors.
3. Medical text is embedded using `BigBird`, and cross-attention is computed between these embeddings and the frequency-domain vectors.
4. The weighted frequency features are reconstructed using inverse FFT.
5. A threshold vector is computed via a linear layer, and a gating mechanism applies this vector to the reconstructed data.
6. The gated output is added to the GRU baseline output to yield the final prediction.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This design emphasizes the global pattern representation afforded by the frequency domain and its alignment with textual cues. For example, a clinical note stating "increased heart rate" aligns with higher amplitudes in the high-frequency components of an ECG waveform—a correlation that cross-attention can capture but time-domain features alone may not.

**The model architecture is illustrated below:**

</div>

#### Mathematical Formulation

<details>

<summary><b>Click to expand model formulation</b></summary>

##### 1. Text Encoding

Let medical text input be \$T\$. The pre-trained `BigBird` encoder yields:

$H_T = \text{BigBird}(T)$

Parameters of `BigBird` are frozen during training.

##### 2. Time Series Frequency Transformation

Given time series input \$X\$, compute its FFT:

$X_f = \text{FFT}(X)$

##### 3. Temporal Feature Extraction

Time-domain features are extracted via GRU:

$H_s = \text{GRU}(X)$

##### 4. Cross-Attention Mechanism

From \$H\_T\$, compute Query (\$Q\$) and Key (\$K\$); from \$X\_f\$, compute Value (\$V\$):

$Q = W_Q H_T,\quad K = W_K H_T,\quad V = W_V X_f$

Attention scores:

$A = \text{Softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)$

Cross-attention output:

$O = A \cdot V$

##### 5. Gating Mechanism

Apply inverse FFT to \$O\$, then pass through a Sigmoid to obtain gating factor \$G\$:

$G = \text{Sigmoid}(\text{IFFT}(O))$

##### 6. Modality Fusion

Fuse \$G\$ and GRU output \$H\_s\$:

$H_f = G \cdot H_s$

Final prediction:

$\hat{Y} = \text{Dense}(H_f + H_s)$

## 🚀 Project Deployment

### 1. Hardware Requirements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system is designed as a distributed architecture. It is recommended to deploy across multiple servers depending on performance requirements. The backend for business logic, the database server, and the SSR frontend server do not have specific hardware demands. The most performance-sensitive layer is the intelligent service layer. The Minh Khoe Tue Y large-scale model (MKTY-3B-Chat) requires 8GB of VRAM for weights and inference cache, BioMedCLIP requires 2GB, and BigBird also needs 2GB. The time-series forecasting model consumes negligible VRAM. The system can still be launched without deploying some or all of the AI services; however, only the backend and CSR/SSR frontend components will function, and corresponding AI functionalities will be unavailable.
