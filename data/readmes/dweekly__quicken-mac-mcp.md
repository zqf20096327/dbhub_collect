A **Claude Skill + MCP server** that gives Claude read-only access to your [Quicken For Mac](https://www.quicken.com/mac) financial data. Ask Claude about your accounts, transactions, spending by category, monthly trends, investment holdings, and more.

The database is **always opened read-only** — your Quicken data is never modified.

## Skill or MCP — which do I want?

This repo ships two artifacts that share the same schema knowledge ([`docs/schema.md`](docs/schema.md)):

- **Skill** ([`plugin/skills/quicken/SKILL.md`](plugin/skills/quicken/SKILL.md)) — teaches Claude to probe and read the Quicken SQLite database directly with Python 3's standard-library SQLite support. Its focused [`references/`](plugin/skills/quicken/references) cover balances, cash flow, investments, budgets, tags, and QuickFill rules. Works in Claude Code and any other Claude surface that loads skills. **No native module install or MCP server process.** This is the recommended path.
- **MCP server** — wraps the same SQL recipes as eight prepackaged tools (`list_accounts`, `query_transactions`, `spending_by_category`, …). Use it when you're working in a non-Claude MCP client (Cursor, Cline, mcp-remote bridges) that can't load skills, or when you'd rather call typed tools than have Claude write SQL.

The Claude Code plugin install (`claude plugin install quicken-mac-mcp`) bundles **both**, with the skill leading and the MCP tools available as shortcuts.

## Requirements

**Quicken For Mac must be open** while using either the skill or the MCP. Quicken encrypts its database file when the app is closed — the data is only readable while Quicken is running.

## How it works

Quicken For Mac stores data in a Core Data SQLite database inside a `.quicken` bundle in your Documents folder (e.g., `~/Documents/MyFinances.quicken/data`). The skill teaches Claude how to query that database directly; the MCP server is a thin wrapper that exposes eight prepackaged queries as tools.

## Install — recommended (Claude Code, plugin)

```bash
claude plugin install quicken-mac-mcp
```

This installs both the `/quicken` skill (recommended path) and the MCP server. Claude will lead with the skill and fall back to the MCP tools when convenient.

## Install — MCP-only paths

Use these if you're in a non-Claude-Code client that can't load skills, or you only want the typed-tool wrapper.

### Claude Code (MCP only)

```bash
claude mcp add quicken -- npx -y quicken-mac-mcp
```

### Claude Desktop (MCPB drag-and-drop)

Download the bundle for your Mac from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/dweekly/quicken-mac-mcp/releases) and drag it into Claude Desktop:

- Apple Silicon: `quicken-mac-mcp-arm64.mcpb`
- Intel: `quicken-mac-mcp-x64.mcpb`

It will prompt you for your database path (or auto-detect it).

### Claude Desktop (manual JSON)

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quicken": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "quicken-mac-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop and you'll see a hammer icon with 8 tools available.

### Custom database path

If you have multiple Quicken files, or your `.quicken` bundle isn't in `~/Documents`, set the `QUICKEN_DB_PATH` environment variable:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quicken": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "quicken-mac-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "QUICKEN_DB_PATH": "/path/to/YourFile.quicken/data"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

By default, the server auto-detects your Quicken database only when exactly one `.quicken` bundle exists in `~/Documents`. If multiple bundles exist, it refuses to guess; set `QUICKEN_DB_PATH` explicitly.

## MCP tools

These are the eight prepackaged tools the MCP server exposes. The skill covers the same ground (and more) by writing SQL directly against the database — see [`plugin/skills/quicken/SKILL.md`](plugin/skills/quicken/SKILL.md).

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_accounts` | List all accounts with name, type, and active/closed status. Optional type filter. |
| `list_categories` | List all category tags with parent hierarchy. Filter by expense/income. |
| `query_transactions` | Query transactions with filters: date range, account types/names, amount range, payee search, category. Returns one row per split entry, with `note` (transaction-level) and `split_note` (per-split) memos. |
| `spending_by_category` | Aggregate negative consumer-spending splits by category, excluding transfers and report-excluded rows and preserving `(Uncategorized)`. |
| `spending_over_time` | Monthly negative consumer-spending totals with the same exclusions, optionally broken down by category. |
| `search_payees` | Search payees by name with transaction counts. |
| `list_portfolio` | List investment holdings with shares, cost basis, and stored Quicken price quotes. |
| `raw_query` | Run arbitrary SELECT queries (500-row limit). |

## Self-Documenting Command-Line Interface (`qmac`)

This project includes a fully featured, self-documenting command-line interface `qmac` that allows you to query your Quicken SQLite database directly from the terminal without going through an MCP client.

### Features:
- **Centralized Schema Validation**: Arguments are dynamically coerced to correct types (numbers, booleans, arrays) and validated.
- **Subcommand Help (`--help` / `-h`)**: Easily inspect parameter descriptions and types for any subcommand (e.g. `qmac spending-by-category --help`).
- **Syntax Error Auto-Help**: Providing incorrect syntax or missing required fields outputs a precise error message along with the subcommand's help page.
- **Integrated Manual (`qmac man`)**: Renders the complete, stylized UNIX man page guide right in your shell.
- **Premium ASCII Table Layout**: Columns are dynamically auto-sized, numbers are right-aligned, and headers are formatted for supreme clarity. Use `--json` to get raw data for scripting.

### Example Commands:

```bash
# General help
qmac --help

# Render stylized manual page
qmac man

# List checking accounts
qmac list-accounts --account-type checking

# Find Costco transactions over $100 in 2024
qmac query-transactions --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-12-31 --payee-search costco --max-amount -100

# Get subcategory spending breakdown for Q1 2025
qmac spending-by-category --start-date 2025-01-01 --end-date 2025-03-31 --group-by category

# Display investment portfolio holding valuations
qmac list-portfolio
```

## Example prompts

- "List my accounts"
- "What did I spend on groceries last month?"
- "Show my spending by category for 2024"
- "How has my monthly spending changed over the past year?"
- "Find all transactions from Costco over $100"
- "What are my top 10 payees by transaction count?"
- "Compare my food spending in 2024 vs 2025"

## Sovereign Financial Exporter (CSV & relational schema.json)

Want to move your complete personal financial history out of Quicken to your own sovereign, self-hosted, or custom agentic analysis platform?

This project includes a high-speed, zero-dependency, pure Python utility `scripts/export_sovereign_csv.py` that connects to your unlocked Quicken database and extracts it into a cleanly normalized, portable package.

### How to use the exporter:

1. Open your Quicken For Mac application and log in so that the database is decrypted.
2. In your terminal, execute the export script:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/export_sovereign_csv.py
   ```
3. A new directory `quicken_sovereign_export/` will be generated, containing:
   - `accounts.csv`: Beautifully normalized accounts list (checking, credit, brokerage, retirement, etc.).
   - `categories.csv`: Income & expense category path structure.
   - `payees.csv`: Registered merchant names list.
   - `transactions.csv`: Top-level ledger with post-date, notes, and transaction-level details.
   - `transaction_splits.csv`: Line-item splits showing amounts and category IDs.
   - `holdings.csv`: Active investment holdings reconstructed from your individual tax lots with cost basis and unrealized returns.
   - `tags.csv`: Custom user tags mapped directly to splits.
   - `schema.json`: Complete relational column and foreign key reference dictionary.
   - `README.md`: A detailed migration guide demonstrating how to load and query your financial history instantly in **DuckDB**, **Pandas**, **PostgreSQL**, or other databases.

This allows other agentic platforms (like custom GPTs, self-hosted LLMs, or sovereign database agents) to immediately parse, ingest, and analyze your entire financial history.

## Database schema

Quicken For Mac uses Core Data with these key tables:

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `ZACCOUNT` | Bank accounts, credit cards, investment accounts |
| `ZTRANSACTION` | Individual transactions (with `ZNOTE` transaction-level memo) |
| `ZCASHFLOWTRANSACTIONENTRY` | Split line items — categories AND per-split `ZNOTE` memos live here |
| `ZTAG` | Category tags with parent hierarchy (Z_ENT looked up at runtime) |
| `ZUSERPAYEE` | Payee names |

Dates use **Core Data epoch** (seconds since 2001-01-01). The MCP server handles all date conversion automatically — you pass ISO 8601 dates, it returns ISO 8601 dates. The skill recipes show the conversion (`+ 978307200`) inline so Claude can write SQL directly.

Account types are stored as uppercase strings: `CHECKING`, `CREDITCARD`, `SAVINGS`, `MORTGAGE`, `RETIREMENTIRA`, `ASSET`, `LIABILITY`, `LOAN`, etc. The tools accept any casing.

For the full schema reference (84 entities, all tables, indexes, foreign keys, and Core Data write semantics including `Z_OPT` optimistic locking), see [`docs/schema.md`](docs/schema.md).

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dweekly/quicken-mac-mcp.git
cd quicken-mac-mcp
npm install
npm test          # run tests
npm run lint      # eslint
npm run format    # prettier
npm run dev       # run server locally
```

Set `QUICKEN_DB_PATH` before `npm test` if `~/Documents` holds more than one `.quicken` bundle; otherwise the live-schema suites skip.

Known issues and planned work live in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) — open bugs, developer-experience gaps, and deferred dependency upgrades (fresh as of 2026-08-14).

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t quicken-mac-mcp .
docker run --rm -v ~/Documents/YourFile.quicken:/data:ro quicken-mac-mcp
