A local-first, open-source tool for modelling software architecture — a self-hosted
alternative to Structurizr with a modern React Flow editor and **MCP built in**, so your
AI client works on exactly the same model you do.

> The diagram is **not** the source of truth. The semantic architecture model is.
> React Flow only visualises and lays out that model.

Useful for software architecture, the C4 model, presales, solution architecture,
architecture workshops, documenting systems, designing integrations — and for working on
architecture together with an AI assistant.

- MIT licensed, no account, no cloud, no telemetry — it works fully offline
- One container, one SQLite file
- REST API, MCP and the UI all sit on the same domain layer

## Quick start

Stable releases and automatically generated release notes are available under
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dziksu/StructSmith/releases). After the first
automated release, `latest` tracks the latest published release; use `:vX.Y.Z`
instead of `:latest` to pin a specific published version.

### Run the public image

With Docker installed, run:

```bash
docker run -d --name structsmith \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8090:8080 \
  -v structsmith-data:/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/dziksu/structsmith:latest
```

Then open <http://localhost:8090>. No repository clone or local build is needed.
Your workspaces persist in the `structsmith-data` Docker volume.

### Build from source with Docker Compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dziksu/StructSmith.git structsmith
cd structsmith
docker compose up -d --build
```

Then open <http://localhost:8090>.

### Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dziksu/StructSmith.git structsmith
cd structsmith
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run dev
```

`bun run dev` starts both processes: the Bun/Express API on `:3000` and the Vite dev server
on <http://localhost:5173>, which proxies `/api` and `/mcp` to the backend. The SQLite
database is created and migrated automatically — no Docker, Postgres, Redis, Java or Python
required for development.

The static project website lives in `apps/site`. Run it separately on
<http://localhost:4174> with:

```bash
bun run dev:site
```

`bun run build:site` creates the GitHub Pages artifact in `apps/site/dist`. Changes to the
site, shared public assets, or its workflow are published automatically from `main` by the
`GitHub Pages` action. Before the first deployment, select **GitHub Actions** as the source in
the repository's **Settings → Pages**; later pushes need no manual publishing step. The build
prerenders the complete page with React's server renderer and inlines its CSS into `index.html`;
the published page has no client-side React runtime or JavaScript bundle.

---

## Endpoints

| URL | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `http://localhost:8090/` | Web UI |
| `http://localhost:8090/api/...` | REST API |
| `http://localhost:8090/mcp` | MCP (Streamable HTTP) |
| `http://localhost:8090/health` | Health check |

In development the same endpoints live on `http://localhost:3000` (and `:5173` for the UI).

---

## Connecting an AI client (MCP)

MCP is a core feature, not an add-on: it starts with the backend and is served from the same
process. The transport is **Streamable HTTP** (the deprecated SSE transport is not
implemented).

### Quick install by client

Start StructSmith first, then use the command for your client. The examples assume the public
Docker image is available at `http://localhost:8090`.

**Codex CLI, Codex Desktop and the Codex IDE extension** share the same MCP configuration:

```bash
codex mcp add structsmith --url http://localhost:8090/mcp
```

In Codex Desktop you can instead open **Settings → MCP servers → Add server**, choose
**Streamable HTTP**, and paste the endpoint. Restart the current session after changing MCP
configuration.

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http structsmith http://localhost:8090/mcp
```

**GitHub Copilot CLI:**

```bash
copilot mcp add --transport http structsmith http://localhost:8090/mcp
```

**VS Code with GitHub Copilot** — add `.vscode/mcp.json` to the project where you want to use
StructSmith:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "structsmith": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:8090/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Then run **MCP: List Servers** and start `structsmith`; use Copilot Chat in Agent mode.

**Claude Desktop** needs a local STDIO bridge to reach a StructSmith instance on `localhost`.
See the [AI client installation guide](docs/AI_CLIENTS.md#claude-desktop) for a copy-ready
configuration. A public HTTPS deployment can instead be added under
**Customize → Connectors → Add custom connector**, but Claude connects to it from Anthropic's
cloud — `localhost` will not work there.

For Cursor, Windsurf, JetBrains IDEs and other MCP clients, point a native Streamable HTTP
connection at the endpoint or use this common configuration shape:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "structsmith": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:8090/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

For full client-specific instructions, token authentication, local-development ports and
troubleshooting, see **[Install StructSmith in AI clients](docs/AI_CLIENTS.md)**. The MCP page in
StructSmith also generates copy-ready snippets using the live URL, including custom ports.

### Manual Codex configuration

Codex can also load StructSmith automatically from a trusted project's `.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.structsmith]
url = "http://localhost:8090/mcp"
default_tools_approval_mode = "writes"
tool_timeout_sec = 120
```

For clients that only speak stdio:

```bash
bun run mcp:stdio
```

The UI shows the live endpoint, the tool list and the read-only state under **MCP** in the
top bar.

### What the AI can do

Tools cover workspaces, the model, elements, relationships, views, view-owned boundaries,
presentation settings, saved layout, presales records, snapshots and export. The preferred way to make a larger change is a single call to
`model_apply_operations`, which is atomic, revision-guarded and takes an automatic snapshot
first:

- Start with `workspace_list`, then `workspace_inspect` for one complete, validated context packet.
  View membership, boundaries and settings are always included; request `includeLayouts` when
  coordinates or relationship bend points are needed.
- Call `modeling_guide` for allowed values, C4 rules, relationship lifting and the recommended
  workflow instead of reading StructSmith source code.
- Run `model_preview_operations` before a large batch. It uses the real operation engine and
  validator, then rolls the transaction back.
- Apply the accepted batch with `model_apply_operations` and finish with `model_validate`.
- References copied from the UI are one-line `StructSmithRef` JSON payloads. Pass their
  `workspaceId`, `type` and `targetId` to `reference_resolve` to fetch the exact object and context.

```jsonc
{
  "workspaceId": "example-client-portal",
  "label": "Add asynchronous invoice processing",
  "operations": [
    { "op": "createElement", "ref": "queue",
      "data": { "kind": "container", "role": "queue", "name": "Invoice Queue", "technology": "SQS" } },
    { "op": "createElement", "ref": "worker",
      "data": { "kind": "container", "role": "worker", "name": "Invoice Worker" } },
    { "op": "createRelationship",
      "data": { "sourceElementId": "backend-api", "targetElementId": "@queue",
                "description": "Publishes invoice jobs to", "interactionStyle": "async" } },
    { "op": "createRelationship",
      "data": { "sourceElementId": "@queue", "targetElementId": "@worker",
                "description": "Delivers jobs to", "interactionStyle": "async" } },
    { "op": "setViewElements", "viewId": "containers-view-id", "elementIds": ["@queue", "@worker"] },
    { "op": "autoLayoutView", "viewId": "containers-view-id",
      "direction": "LR", "algorithm": "dagre" }
  ]
}
```

`ref` gives a new entity a local alias; later operations reference it as `@alias`. The whole
batch runs in one SQLite transaction — it either lands completely or not at all.

Boundaries are owned by a view and never become model elements or relationship endpoints. The
same element can belong to different boundaries in different views or layers. An element with no
boundary in the active layer remains an ordinary item in that view.

Resources expose the model in an AI-friendly shape (no React internals, no CSS, no viewport
data):

```
architecture://guide
architecture://workspaces
architecture://workspace/{workspaceId}
architecture://workspace/{workspaceId}/inspection
architecture://workspace/{workspaceId}/model
architecture://workspace/{workspaceId}/views
architecture://workspace/{workspaceId}/view/{viewId}
architecture://workspace/{workspaceId}/records
```

Prompt templates: `review_architecture`, `create_presales_architecture`,
`identify_architecture_risks`, `identify_unknowns`, `review_security`, `review_scalability`.

When an AI changes the model, the browser is notified over SSE (`GET /api/events`) and the
diagram updates on its own — no refresh needed.

---

## The model

```

 ├── Elements          person · softwareSystem · container · component ·

 ├── Records           assumption · risk · unknown · requirement · decision · note
 └── Snapshots
```

StructSmith models itself — this diagram is the container view of the example
self-model, exported straight from the tool with `export_mermaid`:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  architect(["Architect"])
  ai_client["AI Client<br/><small>Claude, Cursor, any MCP client</small>"]
  subgraph structsmith["StructSmith"]
    direction LR

    rest_api["REST API<br/><small>Bun, Express</small>"]

    repositories["Repositories<br/><small>Drizzle ORM</small>"]
    sqlite["SQLite<br/><small>WAL, bun:sqlite</small>"]
  end
  architect -->|"Models architecture in"| web_ui
  ai_client -->|"Reads and changes the model through"| mcp_server

  domain -.->|"Publishes model changes to"| event_bus
  event_bus -.->|"Notifies the SSE stream in"| rest_api
  rest_api -.->|"Pushes workspace.updated to"| web_ui
```

Three rules the implementation is built around:

1. **Positions belong to views, not to elements.** One element can appear on five diagrams
   without five copies of the data; moving a node never changes the architecture.
2. **Roles are not C4 levels.** `kind = container`, `role = database`,
   `technology = PostgreSQL` — roles drive icons, styling and filtering only.
3. **Views show implied relationships.** If a view shows a system but not its containers,
   traffic to those containers is lifted to the system, the way Structurizr does it.

Every workspace has a `revision`. Mutating REST and MCP calls may pass `expectedRevision`;
a mismatch returns `409 Conflict`, so a user and an AI editing at the same time cannot
silently overwrite each other.

Errors always use the same envelope:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "WORKSPACE_NOT_FOUND", "message": "...", "details": {} } }
```

---

## Editor

- Desktop-first three-pane layout: explorer, canvas, inspector — all resizable
- Custom React Flow nodes with icon, name, technology and a kind/role badge; external
  elements are visually distinct
- Import existing Mermaid diagrams in `flowchart`/`graph` syntax from `.mmd` / `.mermaid`
  files as a semantic workspace baseline
- Semantic, nested boundaries owned by a view, so the same model element can be grouped
  differently on deployment, security, compliance and ownership diagrams
- Explorer separates the active view tree from the reusable element library; elements can be
  added or dragged into a view or one of its boundaries
- Manual layout (debounced batch save) and automatic dagre, force, radial and grid layouts;
  compound dagre layout keeps boundary members together
- Views: the same element on many diagrams, each with its own structure, boundaries and layout
- Presales records linked to elements, with a subtle risk indicator on the canvas
- Deterministic validator with error / warning / info levels
- Export: semantic JSON, Mermaid, PNG, SVG. Import: native JSON and Mermaid flowcharts
- Snapshots with restore; undo/redo (`⌘Z` / `⌘⇧Z`) rides on them
- Command palette (`⌘K`), `F` to fit the view, `Delete`, `Escape`
- Light / dark / system themes, English and Polish UI

### Mermaid import

On the home page, choose **Import workspace**, drop or select a JSON backup,
`.mmd`, `.mermaid`, or text file, then edit the suggested workspace name and choose
**Import and open**. File selection alone does not create a workspace. The dialog
uses `react-dropzone` without a native extension filter so macOS can select Mermaid
files; content validation happens during import. Alternatively, call
`POST /api/workspaces/import/mermaid` / MCP `import_mermaid` with
`{ "source": "flowchart LR\nA[Client] -->|Uses| B[API]" }`.
An optional `name` overrides the Mermaid frontmatter title. Import creates a new
workspace by default. `mode: "overwrite"` requires `workspaceId` and replaces
that workspace's model, views, and records; it does not merge or synchronize.
MCP read-only mode does not expose this operation.

Supported syntax includes `flowchart` and `graph`, all five directions, standalone
and inline node declarations, traditional shapes, `@{ shape: ..., label: ... }`,
Unicode and quoted labels, multiline/Markdown strings, common HTML/Mermaid entities,
semicolon-separated statements, labeled and chained edges, `&` endpoint groups,
dotted/thick/long links, circle/cross arrowheads, bidirectional links, edge IDs,
and nested subgraphs (including links to subgraphs). A single fenced Mermaid block
and YAML frontmatter with a scalar `title` are accepted. Configuration, styles,
classes, click actions, accessibility directives, and invisible layout links are
ignored; callbacks and external image/icon resources are never executed or loaded.

Nodes and subgraphs become reusable semantic elements of kind `custom`; subgraph
membership becomes parent/child containment. This is an import convention, not an
inference of C4 meaning from visual shapes. Kind, role, and technology explicitly
embedded in StructSmith export labels are recovered. Edge labels become descriptions;
a trailing `[technology]` is recognized. Dotted links map to `async`, directed links
to `sync`, and undirected links to `custom`; bidirectional links create two directed
relationships. Mermaid IDs are retained as provenance in `properties["mermaid.id"]`.
Layout is computed by the existing domain layout helper and stored only on the view.
RL/BT imports are mirrored initially; later automatic layout uses the saved LR/TB axis.

This is a semantic starting point, not a pixel-perfect or lossless round trip.
Per-subgraph directions, styling, animation, exact shapes, and Markdown formatting
are not reproduced. Exported view boundaries cannot reliably be distinguished from
semantic subgraphs. Mermaid does not carry all StructSmith model metadata, and
older exports may use parent endpoint IDs distinct from their subgraph IDs.
Sequence, class, ER, state, C4, and other diagram families require separate semantic
adapters and are rejected with a clear error. Unrecognized structural syntax also
fails before any workspace is changed. Limits are 1,000,000 source characters,
2,000 nodes, and 10,000 relationships.

The syntax scope follows the official [Mermaid flowchart documentation](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html).
The transport/domain integration is small; most implementation and maintenance
complexity lies in syntax coverage and mapping Mermaid constructs into a semantic
model. Native JSON remains the format for complete backups and lossless round trips.

### Adding a language

The UI is fully translated through i18next. Drop a JSON file next to
`apps/web/src/i18n/locales/en.json`, register it in `apps/web/src/i18n/index.ts` and add it
to `supportedLanguages`. No copy is hard-coded in components.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `3000` (`8080` in Docker) | HTTP port |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | `./data/architecture.db` | SQLite file |
| `MIGRATIONS_DIR` | `./migrations` | Migration folder |
| `AUTH_MODE` | `none` | `none` or `token` |
| `APP_TOKEN` | – | Bearer token required when `AUTH_MODE=token` |
| `MCP_READ_ONLY` | `false` | When `true`, MCP exposes no mutating tools |
| `SEED_EXAMPLE` | `true` | Seed the example workspace on first boot |
| `APP_NAME` | `StructSmith` | Product name shown in the UI |

In token mode, `/api` and `/mcp` require `Authorization: Bearer <APP_TOKEN>`; `/health`
stays public. There is no user system — this is a local/self-hosted tool.

> [!WARNING]
> The defaults (`AUTH_MODE=none`, `HOST=0.0.0.0`) are meant for `localhost`. As shipped,
> anyone who can reach the port can read **and modify** every workspace. Before exposing
> StructSmith beyond your own machine, set `AUTH_MODE=token`, put TLS in front of it, and
> publish the container port as `127.0.0.1:8090:8080`. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Project layout

```
apps/
  web/        React + Vite UI          (React Flow, TanStack Router/Query, Zustand, shadcn-style UI)
  server/     Bun + Express            (REST, MCP transport, SSE, static UI)
docs/         Client setup and operating guides
packages/
  contracts/  Zod schemas and DTOs shared by frontend, backend and MCP
  domain/     Pure domain: rules, validation, operations, services (no Express, no SQLite)
  database/   Drizzle + bun:sqlite repositories implementing the domain ports
  mcp/        MCP server: tools, resources, prompts, Streamable HTTP handler
migrations/   Plain SQL, applied in order at startup
tests/        bun:test suite over the real domain and a real (in-memory) database
```

REST and MCP call the same services; only the `database` package knows SQL:

```
        REST ──┐
               ├──► Application / Domain services ──► Repositories ──► SQLite
        MCP ───┘
```

## Scripts

```bash
bun run dev         # API + UI, one command
bun run build       # production build of the UI
bun run start       # run the server with the built UI
bun run test        # domain + persistence tests
bun run typecheck   # strict TypeScript across the whole monorepo
bun run db:generate # generate a migration with drizzle-kit
bun run db:migrate  # apply migrations
bun run db:seed     # (re)create the example workspace
bun run mcp:stdio   # MCP over stdio
```

## Roadmap

The next improvements focus on C4 navigation, dependency exploration, and visual
overlays. Later milestones add message flows, offline presentations, visual change
review, and saved proposals.

See [the product roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for priorities, scope, completion criteria,
and follow-up work including documentation, interoperability, and collaboration.
