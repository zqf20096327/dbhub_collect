**Natural language marketing analytics powered by MCP, dbt Semantic Layer, and ML lead scoring. Works with Claude Desktop, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, and Antigravity IDE.**

> *"Which channels actually drive revenue, not just clicks?"*<br>
> This system answers that question in 15 seconds via natural language — backed by multi-touch attribution, a production ML scoring API, and dashboards fed from a single governed semantic layer running across 5 data warehouses.

---

## The Problem

Companies run ads across Google, Meta, and organic channels. Marketing claims leads. Sales says they're low quality. The CEO asks: *"Where should we spend next quarter?"*

Answering this requires joining data from 5+ platforms, building attribution models, scoring leads, and making it all accessible to non-technical stakeholders. Most teams cobble together spreadsheets and one-off queries. This project builds the production system — at $0/month base cost.

## Demo

> Predefined commands: type `/marketing` and see the magic happens:

![marketing-gif](demo/videos/marketing.gif)

**[▶ Watch the video →](demo/videos/marketing-query.mp4)**

> View the dashboards for all commands available: <br>
> [[/marketing]](dashboards/full_funnel_marketing_dashboard.html) | [[/attribution]](dashboards/attribution_dashboard.html) | [[/campaign]](dashboards/campaign_performance_dashboard.html) | [[/pipeline]](dashboards/pipeline_dashboard.html) | [[/traffic]](dashboards/traffic_ga4_dashboard.html)

### Hero Query

> *"Show me the complete marketing funnel for Q1 2025: ad spend across Google and Meta, website sessions by channel, lead conversion rates, and final revenue. Calculate blended CAC and ROAS."*

![open-query.gif](demo/videos/open-query.gif)

**[▶ Watch the demo video →](demo/videos/open-query.mp4)**

The AI queries the dbt semantic layer via MCP, pulls GA4 traffic and CRM pipeline data from mock platform servers, and returns a formatted analysis with KPI cards, charts, and recommendations — in ~15 seconds. Works from Claude Desktop, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, or Antigravity IDE.

### Other queries this system handles

- *"Compare first-touch vs last-touch attribution for our top channels"*
- *"Score this lead: came from Google Ads, visited 5 pages, 3 min on site"*
- *"Which product categories have the highest CAC but lowest LTV?"*
- *"What should we change about our ad spend next quarter?"*

## The Core Insight: Governance is What Makes AI Analytics Reliable

Most AI-to-SQL tools fail because they lack a **source of truth.** When an AI writes SQL on behalf of a marketing manager who can't verify it, you need guaranteed correctness.

This project solves that with the **dbt Semantic Layer (MetricFlow)**: define "ROAS" once in YAML, and every AI client, dashboard, and ML pipeline consumes the exact same definition — `SUM(attributed_revenue) / SUM(ad_spend)` with the correct filters and joins, forever.

> According to [The 2025 Metabase Community Data Stack Report](https://www.metabase.com/data-stack-report-2025):
> *"Average confidence in AI-generated queries is just **5.5/10** without a semantic layer. Tools like dbt MCP (60+ tools) now provide production-grade MCP servers that give LLMs deterministic metric definitions, reducing hallucination and enforcing governance across platforms like Snowflake and Databricks."*
>
> **This project implements exactly that architecture** — moving from 5.5/10 confidence to deterministic, production-grade certainty.

## CI/CD & Production Readiness

The project ships with four GitHub Actions workflows that enforce zero metric drift from source to dashboard.

### Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ |
| [`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) | Every pull request | dbt compile + test on DuckDB → generate golden metrics → validate drift → pytest. No cloud creds needed. |
| [`warehouse-deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/warehouse-deploy.yml) | Push to `main` | Deploys dbt to BigQuery **and** Snowflake in parallel → validates cross-warehouse parity against the committed golden layer. |
| [`scheduled-refresh.yml`](.github/workflows/scheduled-refresh.yml) | Daily 06:00 UTC | Regenerates synthetic appends up to today (in the runner — never committed) → dbt run/test → regenerates golden metrics → validates drift + freshness → commits **only** `golden_metrics.json`. |

### The Zero-Drift Guarantee

```
Raw data
  → dbt staging/intermediate/mart models
  → generate_golden_metrics.py  (reads mart tables, writes dashboards/golden_metrics.json)
  → validate_metrics.py         (re-queries warehouse, diffs vs JSON — exits 1 if any drift)
  → HTML dashboards + Claude skills + Streamlit app  (all read golden_metrics.json)
```

Every PR gate and every warehouse deploy runs `validate_metrics.py`. If a metric in the dashboard diverges from the warehouse by more than the configured tolerance, the workflow fails and blocks the merge.

### GitHub Secrets Required

To enable BigQuery and Snowflake deploys, add these secrets in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

| Secret | Platform |
| ------ | -------- |
| `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | BigQuery |
| `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_JSON` | BigQuery |
| `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT` | Snowflake |
| `SNOWFLAKE_USER` | Snowflake |
| `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD` | Snowflake |
| `SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE` | Snowflake |
| `SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE` | Snowflake |
| `SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA` | Snowflake |

The DuckDB PR gate needs **no secrets** — it runs entirely locally inside the Actions runner.

See the [Production Readiness Guide](docs/guides/production_readiness_guide.md) for full setup instructions, including how to create a BigQuery service account and configure Snowflake.

## Data Architecture — What Lives Where

| Layer | Location | In git? | How it's created |
|-------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Olist raw dataset | `data/olist/*.csv` | ❌ Never (400MB) | `python scripts/download_olist_data.py` (optional, Kaggle) |
| Mock marketing CSVs | `data/mock_marketing/*.csv` | ✅ Frozen baseline (~60MB, one-time) | Olist-anchored baseline committed once; **daily days are regenerated locally, never committed** |
| Synthetic daily appends | rows appended to the CSVs above | ❌ Regenerated | `fullfunnel append` — deterministic (seeded per calendar date), so every machine computes identical rows |
| DuckDB warehouse | `data/olist_analytics.duckdb` | ❌ Never | Built locally by `fullfunnel demo` / `refresh` |
| Golden metrics snapshot | `dashboards/golden_metrics.json` | ✅ Yes (~50KB) | Committed daily by the scheduled refresh — the artifact of record |

**Why this design:** the daily data is *code, not state*. Generators are
seeded by calendar date (`tests/test_determinism.py` guards this in CI), so
committing the rows would only bloat git history — any clone regenerates them
byte-identically in seconds. The one thing that must be shared is the golden
metrics artifact, and that is the only thing the bots commit.

### Keeping your local data current (daily routine)

One command — run it whenever you want your local dataset, warehouse, and
golden metrics brought up to today:

```bash
fullfunnel refresh    # catch data up to today → rebuild DuckDB → dbt run/test → golden metrics → strict validation
```

That's it. Notes:

- **Missed a few days?** Still one command — catch-up backfills every table
  from its own last date to today, and a same-day re-run is a no-op.
- **Your local CSVs will show as modified in git** — expected: you regenerated
  days on top of the frozen baseline. Don't commit them. To reset to the
  committed baseline: `git checkout -- data/mock_marketing/`
- **After `git pull`:** Claude dashboards update immediately (they read the
  committed `golden_metrics.json`). For Streamlit/DuckDB, run
  `fullfunnel refresh` once.
- **Olist raw data** stays local and is only needed if you want to regenerate
  the *baseline* from scratch (`python scripts/generate_mock_marketing_data.py`);
  day-to-day refreshes never touch it.

See [Data Import Guide](docs/guides/data_import_guide.md) for the full explanation including how this maps to a real production pipeline (Fivetran → BigQuery → dbt Cloud).

## Importing Your Own Data

The platform supports three ways to bring in real data — from a spreadsheet, a CSV file, or a live warehouse.

### Streamlit Data Sources UI (easiest)

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
```

Click **Data Sources** in the sidebar to open the three-tab interface:

| Tab | What it does |
| --- | ------------ |
| **File Upload** | Drag-and-drop a CSV or Excel file, preview 20 rows, choose which table to replace, and save it to `data/mock_marketing/` |
| **Warehouse Connection** | Configure and test a connection to DuckDB, BigQuery, or Snowflake. Preview any mart table. Saves to `~/.full_funnel_connectors.json` (never committed to git). |
| **MCP Server Status** | Live view of all 6 MCP servers — CSV path, row count, and latest date in the data. |

After saving a file, rebuild the pipeline from the terminal:

```bash
python scripts/load_duckdb.py
cd dbt_project && dbt run --target duckdb && cd ..
python scripts/generate_golden_metrics.py
python scripts/validate_metrics.py   # must exit 0
```

### See Updated Data in Claude

Once `golden_metrics.json` is regenerated, every Claude skill (`/marketing`, `/attribution`, `/campaign`, etc.) reads the new numbers automatically. In Claude Code on the web, push the updated JSON to the repo so the container has the latest file.

See the [Data Import Guide](docs/guides/data_import_guide.md) for all three import methods, column mapping tables, and troubleshooting tips.

## AI-Powered Commands

Type these in Claude Code CLI or Antigravity to generate a deep-dive analysis artifact:

| Command        | What it does                                                 |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/marketing`   | Full exec dashboard — KPIs, spend, funnel, pipeline          |
| `/attribution` | Channel attribution deep-dive — scatter, waterfall, insights |
| `/pipeline`    | Sales pipeline — funnel stages, deal velocity, lifecycle     |
| `/campaign`    | Paid campaign performance — Google vs Meta, budget pacing    |
| `/traffic`     | GA4 traffic — sessions trend, channel breakdown, anomalies   |

Commands live in `.claude/commands/` (Claude CLI) and `.opencode/commands/` (OpenCode). Same logic, both formats. You can add your own commands as well.

### Claude Desktop

Since Claude Desktop doesn't support command files, use **Projects**:
1. Open Claude Desktop → **Projects** → **New Project**
2. Paste [`claude_desktop_project_instructions.md`](docs/guides/claude_desktop_project_instructions.md) into **Project Instructions**
3. Use natural language instead of slash commands:

| CLI Command    | Claude Desktop Equivalent     |
| :------------- | :---------------------------- |
| `/marketing`   | "marketing dashboard"         |
| `/attribution` | "which channels are working?" |
| `/traffic`     | "show me sessions"            |
| `/campaign`    | "google vs meta performance"  |
| `/pipeline`    | "show me deals"               |

## Quick Start

**Default path — zero credentials, under 5 minutes.** The repo ships with the
synthetic dataset committed, so the pipeline runs end-to-end with nothing but
Python:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eduardocornelsen/full-funnel-ai-analytics.git
cd full-funnel-ai-analytics
pip install -e .
fullfunnel demo            # data → DuckDB → dbt → golden metrics → validation
fullfunnel demo --serve    # same, then launches the Streamlit app
```

Or with Docker:

```bash
docker compose up          # Streamlit at :8501, scoring API at :8000
```

Then ask an AI client:

```bash
# Claude Code: works as-is — the repo's .mcp.json uses relative paths.
#   Open Claude Code in the repo and type /marketing
# Claude Desktop: copy mcp_servers/claude_desktop_config.example.json into your
#   Desktop config and replace /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/ with your clone location
```

Everyday commands:

```bash
fullfunnel append      # advance synthetic data to today (the daily cron does this)
fullfunnel refresh     # append + rebuild + strict validation
fullfunnel validate    # metric drift + staleness gates (must exit 0)
fullfunnel bench       # SQRA retrieval-accuracy benchmark
```

<details>

## Key Design Decisions

### Why MCP instead of LangChain?

MCP is an open standard (Linux Foundation) for AI tool calling — it eliminates the middleware layer. The result: simpler code, fewer dependencies, and a direct connection between any LLM and any data source. Unlike LangChain, which ties you to its abstraction layer, MCP servers work with Claude Desktop, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Cursor, and any future MCP-compatible client.

### Why mock MCP servers?

The mock servers expose the **exact same tool interface** as real platform APIs. When you swap mock → production, all client configurations, commands, and dashboards work without code changes. This proves the MCP abstraction layer works — and that the system is vendor-agnostic and LLM-agnostic.

### Why MetricFlow?

When AI writes SQL on behalf of someone who can't verify it, you need guaranteed correctness. MetricFlow ensures "ROAS" always means the same thing — defined once in YAML, consumed everywhere: AI queries, BI dashboards, ML features.

### Why 5 warehouses?

Not because you'd run 5 in production — but because it proves the semantic layer is truly warehouse-agnostic. Same dbt models, same metrics, same MCP interface, different execution engine. This directly answers *"but we use Snowflake"* — you show it working on Snowflake.

### Why 4 AI clients?

Same principle — it proves the MCP architecture is LLM-agnostic. This directly answers *"but we use GPT-4"* — you show the same servers working with any client.

### Why a golden metrics JSON?

The `dashboards/golden_metrics.json` file is pre-computed from the dbt warehouse and is the single source of truth for all dashboards and Claude skills. Every number a dashboard shows is copied verbatim from this file — no recalculation by the AI, no rounding drift, no stale aggregates. `validate_metrics.py` re-queries the warehouse and diffs against this file, guaranteeing bit-for-bit reproducibility. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) §14 for the full rule set.

## Swapping to Real Platform Data

| Mock Server                 | Production Replacement      | Setup                                  |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `mock_google_ads_server.py` | `cohnen/mcp-google-ads`     | Google Ads API developer token + OAuth |
| `mock_meta_ads_server.py`   | `meta-ads-mcp-server` (npx) | Meta access token with ads_read        |
| `mock_ga4_server.py`        | GrowthSpree GA4 MCP         | Google OAuth                           |
| `mock_hubspot_server.py`    | Official HubSpot MCP        | HubSpot access token                   |
| `mock_salesforce_server.py` | Airbyte agent connector     | Salesforce Connected App               |

See [docs/mcp_servers.md](docs/mcp_servers.md) for the full swap guide including tool interface compatibility requirements.

## Multi-Warehouse Portability

The entire stack is warehouse-agnostic. Only connection config changes between warehouses — all dbt models, MetricFlow definitions, MCP interfaces, client commands, and dashboards stay identical.

| What stays the same                         | What changes                                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| All dbt model SQL (Jinja handles dialects)  | `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` connection details                   |
| All MetricFlow semantic models and metrics  | One MCP binary/config per warehouse                        |
| All MCP server tool interfaces              | Minor SQL dialect differences (auto-handled by dbt macros) |
| All client commands, skills, and dashboards |                                                            |
