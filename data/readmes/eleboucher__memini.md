# memini

> A shared, persistent memory service for AI agents.

`memini` gives any [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)-capable agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, opencode, Hermes, OpenClaw, Open WebUI) one place to `remember` and `recall`, with retrieval quality that compounds over time. It runs as a single Go binary, boots with zero configuration, and scales from an embedded SQLite file on a laptop to Postgres in Kubernetes.

## How it works

memini draws on three earlier projects:

- A curated, deduplicated artifact rather than a pile of chunks (after Karpathy's "LLM wiki").
- Tiered memory (working, episodic, semantic, procedural) with decay and hybrid (vector + keyword) retrieval fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (after `agentmemory`). See [docs/tiers.md](docs/tiers.md) for what each tier means and how memories move between them.
- A stateless, K8s-native HTTP service with an opt-in LLM consolidation pipeline, per-memory TTLs, per-namespace isolation, Prometheus metrics, and an `fsck` consistency checker (after `mnemory`).

Hybrid results are re-ranked by a composite of relevance, access recency, and importance rather than similarity alone, and near-duplicates are collapsed at recall time.

An LLM is optional. With one configured, writes are stored immediately and then deduplicated and contradiction-resolved in the background, and each fresh episodic capture is distilled into durable semantic facts at write time, so a fact stated once is durable immediately. Without one, marker heuristics run the same lifecycle, so durable knowledge still accumulates in an embedder-only deployment.

| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Language   | Go: single static binary, tiny image, low memory                                           |
| Storage    | Pluggable: **sqlite-vec** (embedded, default) or **Postgres + VectorChord** (scale)        |
| Embeddings | External OpenAI-compatible endpoint (you deploy the model)                                 |
| LLM        | **Opt-in**: runs headless without one                                                      |
| Ranking    | Hybrid (vector + keyword) RRF, re-ranked by relevance + recency + importance, deduplicated |
| Interfaces | REST + MCP (stdio and Streamable HTTP) + embedded web UI, sharing one service layer        |

## Quick start

memini boots with zero configuration in its embedded SQLite mode. Vector search is the one thing it cannot invent, so point it at any OpenAI-compatible embeddings endpoint:

```sh
export MEMINI_EMBED_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8081/v1
export MEMINI_EMBED_MODEL=bge-m3
export MEMINI_EMBED_DIMS=1024   # must match the model
mise run run
curl -s localhost:8080/healthz
```

`MEMINI_EMBED_DIMS` has to match the model you point at. That is the most common setup mistake, and it corrupts the store rather than failing cleanly.

For the full walk-through, including wiring it into an agent, see [Solo laptop](docs/guides/solo-laptop.md). For Docker, Compose and Kubernetes, see [Deployment](docs/operations/deployment.md).

## Agent plugin

Most integrations read **`MEMINI_BASE_URL`** for the server and **`MEMINI_API_KEY`** for the token. `MEMINI_URL` and `MEMINI_TOKEN` are removed: clients warn once at session start and otherwise ignore them. The Codex and Cursor plugins are the exception: their bundled MCP config uses a fixed local URL with static env-based headers; see the remote override recipe below. Where an integration has its own config (opencode options, Open WebUI Valves, `openclaw.json`), that config wins over the environment.

**Claude Code:**

```
/plugin marketplace add eleboucher/memini
/plugin install memini
```

**opencode:** add the plugin to `opencode.json` (or `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`):

```json
{
  "plugin": ["@eleboucher/opencode-memini"]
}
```

**Hermes:** `hermes plugins install eleboucher/memini-hermes`

**OpenClaw:** `openclaw plugins install clawhub:@eleboucher/memini`

**Open WebUI:** paste [`filter/memini_memory.py`](integrations/openwebui/filter/memini_memory.py) into Admin Panel, Functions, and optionally [`tools/memini_tools.py`](integrations/openwebui/tools/memini_tools.py) into Workspace, Tools.

**Codex:**

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add eleboucher/memini
codex plugin add memini@memini
```

Start the local server first (`memini`, default `http://localhost:8080`), set `MEMINI_API_KEY` when authentication is enabled, review and trust the bundled hooks with `/hooks`, then start a new thread. Remote and custom-server setup is covered in [`integrations/codex/`](integrations/codex/).

**Cursor:**

```sh
ln -s "$PWD/plugin" ~/.cursor/plugins/local/memini
```

Reload the window (**Developer: Reload Window**) and confirm under Customize → Plugins; teams can instead import the repo as a marketplace (Dashboard → Plugins → Import from Repo). The bundled MCP server targets a fixed `http://localhost:8080/mcp`; authentication and remote setup (a `~/.cursor/mcp.json` override) are covered in [`plugin/README.md`](plugin/README.md#cursor).

Full details, edge cases and every client-side setting live in [`integrations/`](integrations/) and [`plugin/README.md`](plugin/README.md). If a variable seems to have no effect, check [server vs client variables](docs/reference/env-vars.md): four names mean different things on each side.

## Using it as an MCP server

memini speaks the Model Context Protocol, over two transports:

- **Remote (Streamable HTTP):** `http://<host>:8080/mcp`
- **Local (stdio):** `memini mcp`

The nine tools an agent sees, their parameters, and the standing policy the server sends every client on connect are in [MCP tools](docs/reference/mcp-tools.md). Ready-to-paste client configs are in [`integrations/`](integrations/).

## Benchmarks

memini's hybrid retrieval beats `agentmemory`'s published LongMemEval-S numbers on the same model, dataset and metric (98.4% recall@5 against 95.2%), and reranking adds double-digit gains on the turn-level sets where base recall still has headroom.

```sh
mise run bench
```

Full tables, per-leg and per-category breakdowns, the tune and held-out split, parameter sweeps, methodology, caveats, and the LoCoMo comparison against mem0 and Letta are in [`bench/README.md`](bench/README.md).

## Contributing

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the dev loop, the generated-code drift gates, and the docs conventions. The short version: the reference under [`docs/reference/`](docs/reference/) is generated from the code (`mise run docs`), and CI fails if it has drifted. If you add a setting, a CLI command or an MCP tool, run `mise run docs` and commit the result. The generator refuses to run when a new setting has no doc comment or belongs to no section, which is deliberate: that is how a knob ships undocumented.
