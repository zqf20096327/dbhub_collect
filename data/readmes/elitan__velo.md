# Velo

Web-first Postgres branching.

Velo runs a small self-hosted control plane for production Postgres, backups, PITR, and disposable dev branches.

## Model

- Production Postgres runs on a prod server.
- Velo web UI runs on a dev/control server.
- Production uses pgBackRest backups and PITR.
- Dev branches run as Docker Postgres containers on ZFS copy-on-write datasets.
- Production is special, but appears beside branches in the UI.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu/Debian dev server
- Ubuntu/Debian prod server
- SSH access from dev to prod
- Bun
- Docker
- ZFS
- PostgreSQL client tools
- pgBackRest

## Install

Use [`install.md`](install.md). Give that file to an AI coding agent with access to two fresh Ubuntu/Debian servers.

The agent installs Velo end-to-end:

- installs system packages
- clones this repo
- creates the Velo web service
- configures production Postgres and pgBackRest
- creates the dev replica base
- verifies readiness with `/healthz?ready=1`

When the agent finishes, Velo is ready at:

Open:

```text
http://<dev-server-ip>:3000
```

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run db:migrate
bun run dev
```

### Local Docker Loop

For fast local product work without Hetzner:

```bash
bun run local:reset
bun run local:dev
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

This starts:

- local prod Postgres on `localhost:55432`
- local dev Postgres on `localhost:55433`
- local MinIO on `localhost:59000`
- local SQLite at `.velo/local-docker.sqlite`
- real pgBackRest backups and WAL archive to MinIO

Local Docker is prod-like for backup and PITR work. It creates a pgBackRest stanza, checks WAL archiving, runs a full backup, and runs each local branch as its own Postgres container with source data copied by `pg_dump`. Branch connection strings point at the Go TCP proxy, which wakes stopped branches and stops idle ones. In local timing runs, an idle-stopped branch woke and answered queries in about 256-268 ms. It still does not prove SSH, systemd, Hetzner networking, R2, or ZFS COW. Use remote dev before merging infra-sensitive work.

Each git branch gets one local environment by default. Ports are assigned once and stored in `.velo/local/<branch>/env`, so multiple branches can run on the same computer without port collisions.

Useful local stack commands:

```bash
bun run local:up
bun run local:status
bun run local:down
```

`bun run local:dev` starts the proxy. For a manual stack, start the web app, then run:

```bash
set -a; source .velo/local/<instance>/env; set +a
VELO_INTERNAL_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:$VELO_LOCAL_WEB_PORT/internal bun run proxy
```

Useful checks:

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun run test
bun run web:build
bash -n scripts/*.sh
scripts/test-release-artifact.sh
scripts/test-update-flow.sh
scripts/test-packaged-update-flow.sh
scripts/test-release-upgrade-flow.sh
```

## Releases

Releases are made by GitHub Actions:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml -f version=patch
```

The workflow validates the bump, builds and tests Velo, generates release notes, creates `velo-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz`, smoke-tests update/install paths, tags the release, and uploads the artifact.

## Test Deploy

```bash
VELO_DEPLOY_DEV_HOST=157.180.22.136 \
VELO_DEPLOY_PROD_HOST=89.167.89.255 \
VELO_DEPLOY_USER=root \
VELO_DEPLOY_KEY=$HOME/.ssh/frost-e2e-ci \
bun run deploy
```

This resets the Hetzner app and database state, installs Velo, bootstraps Postgres and pgBackRest, and starts `velo-web`.

Remote Vite loop:

```bash
VELO_REMOTE_HOST=157.180.22.136 bun run remote:dev
VELO_REMOTE_HOST=157.180.22.136 bun run remote:sync
```

## Repo Shape

```text
src/db        SQLite schema, migrations, generated DB types
src/server    tRPC routers, jobs, setup, branch, restore services
src/web       TanStack Start UI
src/managers  Docker, ZFS, WAL, cert adapters
src/utils     small shared helpers
scripts       deploy, remote dev, cleanup
```

## Notes

Velo v2 is web only. There is no CLI entrypoint, no npm binary, and no JSON state engine. Local state lives in SQLite at `.velo/velo.sqlite`. It contains operational secrets, so keep `.velo` private.
