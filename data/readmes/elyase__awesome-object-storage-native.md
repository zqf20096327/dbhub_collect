# Awesome Object Storage Native [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Open-source databases, application runtimes, and storage engines that use object storage for durable state, logs, indexes, or transactional datasets.

Entries are open-source implementations with a documented configuration in which object storage, such as Amazon S3, an S3-compatible service, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage, holds authoritative state, retained records, indexes, or transactional datasets. Some commit directly to object storage; others acknowledge writes through a separate durable tier first. Object-storage native does not mean bucket-only infrastructure: many entries also need a catalog, coordinator, or metadata database. Backup-only tools and general file-query engines are listed under Related Tools.

The [comparison](COMPARISON.md) records object-storage backends, licenses, the role object storage plays, dependencies, and caveats for each entry. Experimental implementations are kept in a [separate list](EXPERIMENTAL.md).
