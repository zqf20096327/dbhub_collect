## Why Nudlers?

Managing finances across multiple Israeli banks and credit cards is a nightmare. Different apps, different formats, no unified view. **Nudlers solves this.**

| The Problem | The Nudlers Solution |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Scattered data across 5+ apps | One unified dashboard |
| Manual transaction logging | Automatic daily sync |
| Forgotten subscriptions and silent price hikes | Insights inbox flags them automatically |
| No cross-bank insights | AI-powered analysis |
| Time wasted on categorization | Smart auto-categorization |
| Missed budget alerts | WhatsApp notifications |

---

## ✨ Features

### 📊 Unified Financial Dashboard

See all your money in one place. Nudlers aggregates transactions from every Israeli bank and credit card into a single, beautiful interface.

- **Multi-View Analytics** — Switch between Summary, Budget, Category, Recurring Payment, and Balance Projection views
- **Balance Forecasting** — Predict your future bank balance based on recurring payments and upcoming credit card charges
- **Real-Time Sync** — Background syncing keeps your data fresh automatically
- **Custom Billing Cycles** — Track spending by your credit card billing cycle, not just calendar months
- **Installment Tracking** — Monitor ongoing installments with remaining payments and amounts

### 🧠 Intelligent Auto-Categorization

Stop wasting time manually categorizing transactions. Nudlers learns your spending patterns.

**3-Phase Smart Categorization:**
1. **Rule-Based Matching** — Custom regex patterns for merchants you define
2. **Historical Learning** — Remembers how you categorized "Aroma Coffee" and applies it automatically
3. **Selective Enrichment** — Only fetches additional data when needed, avoiding bot detection

> 95%+ of transactions are categorized automatically after initial setup

### 🔔 Insights — anomalies worth your attention

A dedicated "Insights" view (תובנות) surfaces things that would otherwise hide in the noise. Everything is computed locally, fingerprinted so re-runs don't double-flag, and re-evaluated automatically after each daily sync.

- **Price hikes on subscriptions** — "Apple Music: ₪19.90 → ₪29.90 after 8 stable months." Catches silent price increases that most apps miss because the new amount clusters separately from the historical pattern.
- **New recurring charges** — Surfaces forgotten free trials that quietly turned into monthly charges, on the second or third confirmation.
- **Category spend spikes** — Flags weeks where a category jumps statistically far above its trailing-12-week mean (μ + 2σ). Skips income/refund weeks; requires real history before it'll fire.
- **Daily WhatsApp digest** — High and medium-severity anomalies are folded into the top of the daily summary message, so you see them without opening the app.
- **Inbox actions** — Dismiss, mark "this is normal," or acknowledge — with optimistic updates and rollback on failure.

### 📱 Native WhatsApp Integration

Get your daily financial summary delivered right to WhatsApp — no Twilio, no third-party services.

- **Daily Summaries** — Wake up to yesterday's spending overview, with insight alerts at the top when something fired
- **Restart Notification** — Optional one-shot ping when the app comes back up and the vault is locked, so you know to go unlock it (great for catching unexpected NAS reboots or deploys)
- **Resilient Send Path** — Connection is verified before each send and reconnected automatically if the WhatsApp Web session drifted into a stale state
- **Group Support** — Share summaries with family or partners
- **QR Code Setup** — Connect in seconds, session persists across restarts

### 🤖 AI-Powered Insights

Ask questions about your finances in plain language. Bring your own AI provider — any OpenAI-compatible API works (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Groq, Together, Gemini, LMStudio, Ollama, etc.).

```
"What did I spend on groceries this month?"
"Compare my dining expenses to last month"
"Show me my top 10 expenses"
```

### 🔌 MCP Integration for AI Assistants

Connect Nudlers directly to **Claude Desktop**, **Cursor**, or **Claude Code** using the Model Context Protocol.

**Quick Setup (localhost):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nudlers": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "supergateway@latest", "--sse", "http://localhost:6969/api/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**For remote/hosted instances**, replace `localhost:6969` with your server URL (see [MCP Setup](#mcp-for-claude-desktop--cursor--claude-code) for details).

Now your AI assistant can query your finances, search transactions, and add manual expenses.

### 💰 Smart Budget Management

Set budgets by category and track them in real-time.

- **Visual Progress Bars** — See budget consumption at a glance
- **Burndown Charts** — Daily spending vs. ideal pace visualization
- **Historical Comparison** — Compare this month to previous months
- **Overspend Alerts** — Get notified before you exceed limits
 
### 📈 Smart Balance Projection

Know your future balance before it happens. Nudlers projects your bank balance for the next 30 days.

- **Predictive Analytics** — Combines current balances, detected recurring bank transactions, and upcoming credit card settlements.
- **Visual Trends** — Interactive charts show your balance trajectory and highlight potential risks.
- **Manual Overrides** — Add manual recurring payments (like rent or direct debits) that the system hasn't detected yet.
- **Billing Cycle Awareness** — Intelligently accounts for Israeli credit card billing cycles and settlement dates.
- **Negative Balance Alerts** — Visual indicators catch when your projected balance might drop below zero.

### 🔒 Bank-Grade Security

Your credentials never leave your machine unencrypted.

- **AES-256-GCM Encryption** — Industry-standard encryption for all credentials
- **Local Processing** — No cloud service sees your bank passwords
- **Secure by Design** — Credentials decrypted only at scraping time
- **Memory-Locked Vault** — Mandatory security layer. Your master key exists only in RAM. Even if your server is compromised, credentials remain unreadable without your passphrase
- **Passkey / Biometric Unlock** — Use TouchID, FaceID, or a hardware security key to unlock the vault without typing your passphrase
- **Native 2FA Flows** — Built-in support for OneZero's two-factor authentication and Bank Hapoalim's OTP, no third-party extensions required
- **Zero Telemetry** — No analytics, no remote logs, no "anonymized usage data." If you don't see it in DevTools, it isn't happening

### 🌐 Hebrew & English, with proper RTL

Built for the Israeli banking ecosystem, with first-class support for both languages.

- **Live language switch** — Toggle between עברית and English from the menu; the entire UI flips direction without a reload
- **Real RTL** — Card corners, arrow direction, table alignment, financial number layout — all behave correctly in both directions, not bolt-on right-to-left
- **Hebrew display fonts** — Heebo for the UI, with English text rendering in Inter when the app is in English mode

### 🔒 Memory-Locked Credentials (Vault)

Nudlers uses a **Memory-Locked Vault** for all credential encryption. Your master encryption key is "wrapped" with a passphrase and stored in the database. When the application starts, it remains in a "locked" state until you provide the passphrase (or use a passkey) via the UI.

- **Non-Persistent**: The decrypted key exists only in the application's memory (RAM).
- **Auto-Lock**: If the app restarts or the server reboots, the vault automatically locks.
- **Brute-Force Protected**: Key derivation uses `scrypt` with a custom salt.

```

#### Setup Guide

- **New Installation**: Launch Nudlers. The UI automatically detects that the vault is uninitialized and guides you through creating a passphrase. After setup, you'll be prompted to optionally register a passkey for biometric unlock.
- **Legacy Migration**: If you have `NUDLERS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` set, the UI will guide you through migrating to the vault. All credentials are re-encrypted in a single transaction. You can remove the env var after migration.

#### Passkey Management

- Register multiple passkeys (e.g., laptop fingerprint + phone FaceID)
- View and delete individual passkeys in **Settings → Vault Security**
- When passkeys are registered, the vault defaults to passkey authentication
- You can always switch to passphrase entry by clicking "Use passphrase instead"
- Changing your passphrase invalidates all registered passkeys (re-register required)

#### Environment Variables for Vault

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|:--------:|-------------|
| `PASSKEY_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` | Production | **Required if using passkeys in production.** A stable secret used to encrypt the vault passphrase stored in the database. Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`. **Must never change** — rotating it invalidates all registered passkeys. |
| `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID` | Production | WebAuthn Relying Party ID. Defaults to `localhost`. **Must be set to your domain** (e.g. `nudlers.example.com`) when running behind a reverse proxy or over HTTPS. |
| `WEBAUTHN_ORIGIN` | Production | WebAuthn expected origin. Defaults to `http://localhost:6969`. **Must be set to your full app URL** (e.g. `https://nudlers.example.com`) when running behind a reverse proxy or over HTTPS. Without this, passkey registration/login will fail with an origin mismatch error. |

## 🤖 AI Integrations

### Built-in AI Assistant

The built-in chat answers questions about your finances using any OpenAI-compatible AI provider:

- "What's my budget status for groceries?"
- "Show me all transactions from Rami Levy"
- "How much did I spend on dining this month vs last month?"

**Setup:** Open **Settings → AI Provider** and configure:
- **Base URL** — defaults to OpenRouter (`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`). Presets included for OpenAI, Groq, Together, Gemini, or paste any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- **API Key** — bearer token for the selected provider.
- **Model** — provider-specific slug (e.g. `google/gemini-2.5-flash`, `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`).

Or via env vars: `AI_BASE_URL`, `AI_API_KEY`, `AI_MODEL`.

### MCP for Claude Desktop / Cursor / Claude Code

Nudlers exposes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) endpoint that AI assistants can use directly to query and manage your finances.

#### Setup for Claude Desktop

Add to `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS/Linux) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nudlers": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "supergateway@latest", "--sse", "http://localhost:6969/api/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Setup for Cursor

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nudlers": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "supergateway@latest", "--sse", "http://localhost:6969/api/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Setup for Claude Code

Add to your project's `.mcp.json` or global `~/.claude/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nudlers": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "supergateway@latest", "--sse", "http://localhost:6969/api/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Remote / Hosted Setup

For Nudlers running on a remote server, NAS, or Docker container, replace the URL:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nudlers": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "supergateway@latest", "--sse", "https://your-server.com/api/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Examples:**
- Docker on local network: `http://192.168.1.100:3000/api/mcp`
- Synology NAS: `http://nas.local:3000/api/mcp`
- Cloud server with HTTPS: `https://nudlers.yourdomain.com/api/mcp`

> **Note:** For HTTPS, ensure your server has a valid SSL certificate. For local network access, use HTTP with your server's IP address.

#### Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_monthly_summary` | Get financial summary by vendor with income, expenses, and net balance |
| `get_category_expenses` | Get all transactions for a specific category |
| `get_category_breakdown` | Get spending breakdown by category with percentages |
| `get_all_categories` | List all spending categories in the system |
| `search_transactions` | Search transactions by description, vendor, or category |
| `get_all_transactions` | Get all transactions for a time period |
| `get_budgets` | Get budget vs actual spending comparison |
| `get_recurring_payments` | List subscriptions and installment payments |
| `get_balance_projection` | Get daily balance projection for the next 30 days |
| `get_sync_status` | Check sync status for all connected accounts |
| `list_accounts` | List all configured bank accounts and credit cards |
| `add_manual_expense` | Add a manual expense or income transaction |

#### Example Queries

Once connected, you can ask your AI assistant:
- "What did I spend on groceries this month?"
- "Show me my budget status"
- "Add a manual expense: Coffee at Aroma, 25 ILS, today, category Dining"
- "What are my recurring payments?"
- "Search for transactions from Rami Levy"
- "Compare my spending by category"

#### Troubleshooting MCP

**Connection refused:**
```bash
# Verify Nudlers is running
curl http://localhost:6969/api/ping
# Should return: {"status":"ok"}
```

**Test the MCP endpoint:**
```bash
# This should return SSE headers and keep connection open
curl -N http://localhost:6969/api/mcp
```

**"supergateway" not found:**
```bash
# Ensure npx is available (comes with Node.js)
npx --version

# Or install supergateway globally
npm install -g supergateway
```

**Wrong port:**
- Development mode uses port `6969`
- Docker production typically uses port `3000`
- Check your `docker-compose.yaml` for port mappings

**Firewall issues (remote access):**
- Ensure the port is accessible from your client machine
- For Docker: check port mappings in `docker-compose.yaml`
- For NAS: check firewall and port forwarding settings

## 💡 Smart Categorization Explained

Nudlers uses a unique 3-phase approach to achieve high accuracy while avoiding bot detection:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        PHASE 1: Hybrid Scrape                        │
│  Fetch transactions WITHOUT categories (avoids bot detection)        │
└────────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘
                                 │
                                 ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     PHASE 2: Local Matching                          │
│  ┌──────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │   Custom Rules   │ -> │  If no match, check historical cache │   │
│  │  (Regex-based)   │    │   "Aroma" -> "Dining" (from history) │   │
│  └──────────────────┘    └──────────────────────────────────────┘   │
└────────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘
                                 │
                                 ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  PHASE 3: Selective Enrichment                       │
│  Only for remaining uncategorized: targeted API calls (low risk)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This approach provides:
- **Speed** — Most transactions categorized instantly from cache
- **Accuracy** — 95%+ categorization rate
- **Safety** — Minimal API calls prevent account lockouts

## 📱 WhatsApp Integration

### How It Works

Nudlers uses a headless browser to connect to WhatsApp Web — no third-party services required.

### Setup

1. Go to **Settings** → **WhatsApp Daily Summary**
2. Click **Start WhatsApp Service**
3. Scan the QR code with your phone (WhatsApp → Linked Devices)
4. Configure recipients (phone numbers or group IDs)
5. Set your preferred delivery time

### Docker Configuration

For Docker deployments, add these to your `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  nudlers-app:
    volumes:
      - whatsapp-data:/app/.baileys_auth  # Persist Baileys session
    cap_add:
      - SYS_ADMIN
    security_opt:
      - seccomp=unconfined
    shm_size: '2gb'

volumes:
  whatsapp-data:
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Block Automation" Errors (Isracard/Max/Amex)

These vendors have aggressive bot detection. Solutions:

1. **Use Low Resource Mode** — Set `RESOURCE_MODE=low` to reduce browser footprint and memory usage
2. **Reduce Sync Days** — Lower `sync_days_back` to 7-14 days
3. **Manual Login** — Log in to the vendor website once to clear notices
4. **Wait** — If blocked, wait 24 hours before retrying

### Chrome Not Found

For custom environments:
```env
PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/google-chrome
```

### WhatsApp QR Code Not Appearing

1. Check browser capabilities in Docker config
2. Ensure `shm_size` is at least `1gb`
3. Check logs: `docker-compose logs -f nudlers-app`
