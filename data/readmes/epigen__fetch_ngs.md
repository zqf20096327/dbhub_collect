# Fetch Public Sequencing Data and Metadata Using iSeq
A [Snakemake 8](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow to fetch (download) and process public sequencing data and metadata from **[GSA](https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa/)**, **[SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/)**, **[ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/)**, **[GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)** and **[DDBJ](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/)** databases using [iSeq](https://github.com/BioOmics/iSeq).

# 💿 Software
This project wouldn't be possible without the following software and their dependencies.

# 🔬 Methods
This is a template for the Methods section of a scientific publication and is intended to serve as a starting point. Only retain paragraphs relevant to your analysis. References [ref] to the respective publications are curated in the software table above. Versions (ver) have to be read out from the respective conda environment specifications (`workflow/envs/*.yaml file`) or post-execution in the result directory (`{module}/envs/*.yaml`). Parameters that have to be adapted depending on the data or workflow configurations are denoted in squared brackets e.g., [X].

__Data Acquisition & Processing.__ Public sequencing data were retrieved from [GSA|SRA|ENA|DDBJ] under the accession(s) [accession_ids] using iSeq (ver) [ref]. The data were downloaded as FASTQ files (and converted to unmapped BAM ([uBAM](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035532132-uBAM-Unmapped-BAM-Format)) files using Picard FastqToSam (ver) [ref], preserving sample information and read groups while supporting both single-end and paired-end sequencing data).  Metadata for each dataset was collected and merged into a single Comprehensive reference file.

**The data acquisition and processing described here were performed using a publicly available Snakemake (ver) [ref] workflow [10.5281/zenodo.15005419](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15005419).**

# 🚀 Features
The workflow performs the following steps that produce the outlined results:

- Data Acquisition
  - Downloads sequencing data from public repositories **[GSA](https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa/)**, **[SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/)**, **[ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/)**, and **[DDBJ](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/)** using various [accession ID types](https://github.com/BioOmics/iSeq/blob/main/README.md#1--i---input)
  - Extracts comprehensive metadata for each dataset
  - Supports parallel downloading for improved performance using threads
- Data Processing
  - Automatic handling of both single-end and paired-end sequencing data
  - Creation of a unified comprehensive metadata file with accession IDs and file paths
  - Optional conversion from `FASTQ` (as `*.fastq.gz`) to [unmapped BAM](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035532132-uBAM-Unmapped-BAM-Format)(as `*.bam`) format using [Picard's](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) [FastqToSam](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360036351132-FastqToSam-Picard)
- Metadata-only mode for quick exploration without downloading sequence files (`metadata_only: 1`)
- Considerations
  - Dependent on iSeq's supported repositories and accession types
  - Requires internet connectivity and sufficient storage space for downloaded data

The workflow produces the following directory structure:

```
{result_path}/
└── fetch_ngs/
    ├── metadata.csv                # merged metadata for all accessions
    ├── .fastq_to_bam/              # processing marker files
    │   └── [accession].done
    └── [accession]/                # one directory per accession
        ├── [accession].metadata.csv  # metadata for this accession
        └── [sample].[bam/fastq.gz]   # sequence files
```

# 🛠️ Usage
Here are some tips for the usage of this workflow:
- Run your workflow with `snakemake --resources parallel_downloads=3` to restrict concurrent download jobs to three (worked well for me), thereby reducing the risk of triggering IP blacklisting from excessive parallel FTP connections. This can also be achieved by using the workflow's [profile](./workflow/profiles/default/config.yaml). In case of usage as module, put the parameter into the parent workflow's profile.
- Specify accession IDs in the configuration file as a list to download multiple datasets in one run
- Use `metadata_only: 1` for a quick preview of available data before committing to full downloads
- Choose between `FASTQ` or `BAM` output formats based on your downstream analysis needs
- For large datasets, consider increasing `threads` and `mem` parameters
- For super series (e.g., GSE) or projects containing many samples, start by running in `metadata_only: 1` mode to extract run accession IDs. Then use these IDs in the config to enable maximum parallelization, avoiding sequential download and conversion.
- The merged metadata file can be used as a basis for sample annotation files downstream
- BAM output format (`output_format: bam`) is recommended for direct integration with BAM compatible downstream analysis workflows
