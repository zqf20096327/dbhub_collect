## What is Apricity?

[MemPalace](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace) gives your AI assistant a structured, durable memory — wings, rooms, drawers, and a knowledge graph, all stored locally. **Apricity is the front-end for it.** Once you have hundreds of memories, you need a way to **see, search, and curate** them without dropping to SQL or living inside an MCP shell. That's what Apricity is for.

It is *not* a memory system of its own — it reads and writes an existing MemPalace install on the same machine, through the official `mempalace` package. Think of it as the window onto your palace.

- 🏠 **Local-first.** Binds to `127.0.0.1`. No telemetry, cloud account, or memory-data upload. The optional release check can be disabled.
- 🪶 **Zero runtime dependencies.** Pure-Python standard-library server + plain HTML / CSS / vanilla JS front-end. No `pip install`, no `npm`, no Docker, no build step.
- 🛡️ **Safe by construction.** Every write goes through the official `mempalace` Python package. Every destructive action is snapshotted and recoverable. ETag concurrency control prevents lost edits.
- ⚡ **Fast.** Reads the SQLite/Chroma backends directly; a localStorage cache, gzip, and serve-time minification make reloads feel instant.
- ⌨️ **Keyboard-driven.** `⌘K` to search, `E` to edit, `F` to maximize/browse — core actions are remappable.

> ⚠️ Apricity expects an installed and initialised MemPalace instance on the same machine. It does **not** ship MemPalace itself — install it first from [MemPalace/mempalace](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace).

## Features
### Browse & navigate

<div align="center">

  </picture>
  <br />
  <sub>The search bar's always-on rotating ring — Apricity's “alive and listening” affordance. <code>⌘K</code> from anywhere.</sub>
</div>

- **Search** across content and metadata, **filter** by author, and **sort** by date or title (with a configurable default). `⌘K` focuses it from anywhere; `Enter` jumps to the first match.
- **Three panes** — a Rooms sidebar (wings → rooms, iOS-style drill-down), a Memories list, and a Detail view.
- **Browse mode** — maximize the Memories panel into an adaptive multi-column grid; toggle with `F`.
- **Wiki-style links** — `[[drawer_id|Display Title]]` references in memory content become clickable jumps to the linked memory, with one-click back-navigation.
- **URL state** — the current wing / room / memory / query / sort survive reloads and are linkable.

### Write & edit

  <br />
  <sub>The inline WYSIWYG editor — circular toolbar, live bold/italic, <code>## </code> → heading autoformat, and callouts. No modal, no raw-Markdown round-trip.</sub>
</div>

- **Inline visual editor** — a WYSIWYG editor for bold/italic, headings, lists, links, and callouts, with Markdown autoformatting and HTML→Markdown conversion on save. No modal, no raw-Markdown round-trip.
- **Edit metadata** — change content, title, wing, and room, or move a memory between rooms, with content-hash ETag protection against concurrent edits.
- **Optimistic saves** — edits apply instantly and revert automatically (with a notification and a retry affordance) if the server rejects them.
- **Drafts inbox** — stage partial memories, edit them in place, and file them into the palace when ready.

### Curate & recover

  </picture>
  <br />
  <sub>Nothing is ever lost — every delete is snapshotted into <strong>Recently deleted</strong>, one click from restore.</sub>
</div>

- **Delete** a single memory, a whole room, or a whole wing — every delete is snapshotted to a recoverable log.
- **Recently deleted** — restore a deleted memory with one click (optimistically), or purge the log.
- **Knowledge graph** — view triples, add new facts, invalidate stale ones, and explore a force-directed graph visualisation.
- **Tunnels** — cross-room / cross-wing links surfaced inline as room chips; create and delete them, bind them to specific memories, and inspect them on a dedicated tunnel page.

### Stay in the loop

  </picture>
  <br />
  <sub>The bell rings as each model files or revises a memory — per-model avatars, <strong>created</strong> vs <strong>updated</strong> at a glance.</sub>
</div>

- **Notifications** — a bell that surfaces newly created and updated memories with the originating model's avatar (Claude, Codex, …), distinguishing *created* from *updated*.
- **Recently-updated markers** — memories touched recently get a relative-time marker that clears once you've viewed them.
- **Live polling** — optional background refresh (15 / 30 / 60 s) that pauses when the tab is hidden, with an optional sound and LAN-wide "seen" sync so dismissing on one device clears it everywhere.

### Make it yours

  </picture>
  <br />
  <sub>Auto / Light / Dark — follow the system or pick a side; your choice is persisted.</sub>
</div>

- **Tools panel** — a power-user sheet that surfaces MemPalace's MCP tools: knowledge-graph query + timeline, tunnels (list, create, delete, find, follow, traverse), diary (read / write), stats, and maintenance (taxonomy, duplicate check, hook settings, sync, reconnect, AAAK spec). Hidden by default; enable it in Settings. See the [API reference](#api-reference) for the underlying endpoints.
- **Settings** — a redesigned sheet with sidebar navigation: Display (theme, reduce-motion, relative time, title/name polishing, panel-control reveal), Notifications, remappable keyboard Shortcuts, Trash, Backup, Account, and an About pane with an update-available check.
- **Theme** — Auto / Light / Dark, overriding or following the system preference, with your choice persisted.
- **Auth** — fail-closed username + password protection with PBKDF2-SHA256 hashing and HTTP-only session cookies (12-hour default, 30-day "Remember me").

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.11 or newer** (Apricity itself uses only the standard library — no `pip install` required).
- A working **MemPalace** install with its own venv. Apricity shells out to it for writes, so it must be importable from `$MEMPALACE_PYTHON_BIN`.

### Run from a clone (no install step)

The whole server is one file of standard-library Python, so the simplest way to run Apricity is straight from a checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/epinethrone/apricity
cd apricity
python3 server.py            # equivalent to `python -m mempalace_dashboard`
```

The server prints a one-time setup secret. Open <http://127.0.0.1:8765>, go to
**Settings → Account**, and enter that secret to create the owner account.

### Install as a command

Prefer an isolated, on-`PATH` install? Use pipx (or `uv tool install`):

```bash
pipx install apricity
apricity
```

> [!NOTE]
> Published on PyPI as [`apricity`](https://pypi.org/project/apricity/) — `pip install apricity` or `uv tool install apricity` work too.

There's no build step and no third-party runtime dependencies — the package is published purely so installing it is one command. If your MemPalace install lives somewhere non-standard, copy [`.env.example`](.env.example) to `.env` (or export the variables in your shell) and adjust the paths before launching.

### First-run checklist

1. ✅ MemPalace itself is installed and you've successfully filed at least one memory through it.
2. ✅ `~/.mempalace/palace/chroma.sqlite3` and `~/.mempalace/knowledge_graph.sqlite3` exist (or you've pointed `MEMPALACE_PALACE_DB` / `MEMPALACE_KG_DB` at where they actually live).
3. ✅ `MEMPALACE_PYTHON_BIN` points at a Python that can `import mempalace`.
4. ✅ You copied the setup secret from the server log, opened **Settings → Account**, and created the owner account.

## Configuration

All filesystem locations default to the standard MemPalace home (`~/.mempalace`). Override with environment variables if your installation differs (see [`.env.example`](.env.example) for a starter file):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `8765` | Port Apricity listens on. |
| `MEMPALACE_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Address Apricity binds to. A non-loopback value requires configured authentication. |
| `MEMPALACE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | _(unset)_ | Comma-separated additional hostnames accepted by Host-header validation, such as a reverse-proxy hostname. |
| `MEMPALACE_HOME` | `~/.mempalace` | Root for all of Apricity's data. |
| `MEMPALACE_PALACE_DB` | `<HOME>/palace/chroma.sqlite3` | The Chroma SQLite backend. |
| `MEMPALACE_KG_DB` | `<HOME>/knowledge_graph.sqlite3` | The knowledge-graph SQLite database. |
| `MEMPALACE_INBOX` | `<HOME>/dashboard-inbox` | Where drafts are staged before filing. |
| `MEMPALACE_VERSIONS` | `<HOME>/dashboard-versions.jsonl` | Append-only log of deletions (powers Recently deleted). |
| `MEMPALACE_CREDENTIALS` | `<HOME>/dashboard-credentials.json` | Username + PBKDF2 hash. Mode `0600`. |
| `MEMPALACE_SESSIONS` | `<HOME>/dashboard-sessions.json` | Active session tokens. Mode `0600`. |
| `MEMPALACE_PREFERENCES` | `<HOME>/dashboard-preferences.json` | Server-side UI preferences (sort, theme, notification settings). |
| `MEMPALACE_PYTHON_BIN` | `~/.local/share/mempalace-venv/bin/python` | Python that can import `mempalace`. |
| `MEMPALACE_TOKEN` | _(unset)_ | Optional shared-secret used by scripts via the `X-Auth-Token` header. Coexists with the cookie flow. |
| `MEMPALACE_SETUP_TOKEN` | random per startup | Optional fixed first-run enrollment secret. Prefer the generated value printed at startup. |
| `MEMPALACE_COOKIE_SECURE` | `false` | Set to `true` when Apricity is served over HTTPS so session cookies carry `Secure`. |
| `MEMPALACE_SYNC_ROOTS` | _(unset)_ | Roots allowed for caller-supplied `/api/sync` project directories, separated by the platform path separator (`:` on Linux/macOS). Explicit directories are disabled when unset. |
| `APRICITY_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK` | `false` | Set to `true` to disable the cached request to the GitHub releases API. |

## Securing Apricity

1. Start the server and copy the generated setup secret from its startup log.
2. Open the UI and go to **Settings → Account**.
3. Enter the setup secret, choose a username and password (≥ 8 characters), and save.

Apricity fails closed before enrollment: palace endpoints remain inaccessible, and only
the setup-secret-protected enrollment request is accepted. Missing, malformed, or
unreadable credential files never enable anonymous access. Credentials are stored as
`pbkdf2_sha256$200000$<salt>$<hash>` and never leave the host.

If you forget the password, delete `~/.mempalace/dashboard-credentials.json` and
`~/.mempalace/dashboard-sessions.json`, restart the server, and re-enroll using the
new setup secret printed at startup. This does not create an anonymous-access window.

For scripted access, set `MEMPALACE_TOKEN=<some-secret>` in the environment and send
it as the `X-Auth-Token` header. The token is enforced even when no credential file
exists and coexists with the cookie flow.

To listen beyond loopback, first configure an owner account or `MEMPALACE_TOKEN`, then
set `MEMPALACE_HOST` explicitly. Apricity refuses a non-loopback bind without one of
those authentication mechanisms. Prefer an HTTPS reverse proxy or authenticated
tunnel, set `MEMPALACE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` to its hostname, and enable
`MEMPALACE_COOKIE_SECURE=true` when the browser reaches Apricity over HTTPS.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Four actions are **remappable** under **Settings → Shortcuts** (defaults shown); `⌘K` and `Esc` are fixed.

| Shortcut | Action | Remappable |
|---|---|---|
| `F` | Maximize / Browse mode | ✅ |
| `E` | Edit the selected memory | ✅ |
| `X` | Close / collapse the current panel or sheet | ✅ |
| `Backspace` | Delete the focused item (with confirmation) | ✅ |
| `⌘K` / `Ctrl+K` | Focus the search box (inserts a link inside the editor) | — |
| `Esc` | Close any open sheet — permanent fallback for `X` | — |
| `Enter` (in search) | Jump to the first matching memory | — |

Single-key shortcuts only fire when you're not typing in a field. Full details in the [wiki](https://github.com/epinethrone/apricity/wiki/Keyboard-Shortcuts).

## API reference

All endpoints are JSON over HTTP. Auth is by session cookie (`mempalace_session`) or
`X-Auth-Token` header when `MEMPALACE_TOKEN` is set. Every POST requires
`Content-Type: application/json`. Cookie-authenticated mutations also require the
session's `X-CSRF-Token`; the bundled UI handles this automatically. Token-authenticated
scripts do not need a CSRF token.

| `POST` | `/api/diary` | auth | Write a diary entry (`{agent_name, entry, topic?, wing?}`). |
| `GET`  | `/api/tunnels?wing=…` | auth | List tunnels (optionally filtered by wing). |
| `POST` | `/api/tunnels` | auth | Create a tunnel (`{source_wing, source_room, target_wing, target_room, label?, source_drawer_id?, target_drawer_id?}`). |

| `POST` | `/api/sync` | auth | Sync from a project tree (`{apply?, wing?, project_dir?}`). Caller-supplied directories must resolve beneath `MEMPALACE_SYNC_ROOTS`. Slow — runs with a 5-minute timeout. |
| `POST` | `/api/reconnect` | auth | Force-reconnect the MemPalace backend. |

Example — file a memory from the command line:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/memories \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Auth-Token: $MEMPALACE_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"wing":"notes","room":"general","title":"hello","content":"first memory from curl"}'
```

## Safety model

- **No raw DB writes.** Every mutation routes through the official `mempalace` Python package — Apricity never modifies SQLite directly.
- **Snapshot before destruction.** Every delete (memory, room, wing, tunnel) appends a record to the versions log so the content is recoverable. Restoring recreates the memory through MemPalace with its original content, author, and source, plus a fresh ID and filing time. Edits aren't snapshotted as history — they're protected from accidental overwrite by ETag concurrency instead.
- **ETag concurrency.** The edit form sends the content hash it was opened with; the server refuses to overwrite if it has changed.
- **Confirmation values.** Bulk deletes and snapshot wipes require an exact-string confirmation in the request body.
- **Fail-closed authentication.** Missing or invalid credentials do not grant palace access. First-run enrollment requires a generated setup secret, and login attempts are rate-limited.
- **Browser request isolation.** Host-header validation blocks DNS rebinding. Mutations require same-origin requests, JSON content, and a per-session CSRF token. A restrictive Content Security Policy limits executable content.
- **No plaintext secrets.** Credentials are hashed with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (200 000 iterations, 16-byte salt). Sessions are stored server-side; cookies are `HttpOnly` + `SameSite=Lax`, with optional `Secure` for HTTPS deployments.
- **Constrained maintenance paths.** Explicit sync directories are disabled unless their allowed roots are configured; resolved paths and symlink targets must remain within those roots.
- **Loopback by default.** The server binds to `127.0.0.1`. Non-loopback binding is explicit and refused without authentication. If you put it behind a reverse proxy, terminate TLS there and keep the upstream on loopback where possible.

- **Reads** go directly against the SQLite files for speed.
- **Writes** are dispatched to a child Python that imports `mempalace` — keeps Apricity in lock-step with the canonical schema.
- **State that belongs to Apricity** (drafts, snapshots, credentials, sessions, preferences) lives in `$MEMPALACE_HOME` alongside the palace data so a single backup captures everything.

> The Python import package is still named `mempalace_dashboard` (hence `python -m mempalace_dashboard` and the directory layout below) — only the distribution, command, and brand are `apricity`.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Apricity loads but the palace is empty</strong></summary>

The UI rendered, but `Wings: 0` and the list is empty.

- Confirm `~/.mempalace/palace/chroma.sqlite3` exists. If it doesn't, MemPalace itself hasn't been initialised on this machine.
- If your palace lives elsewhere, set `MEMPALACE_PALACE_DB` and `MEMPALACE_KG_DB` to the correct absolute paths and restart.
- Check the server log — Apricity reports the exact paths it tried to open.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"mempalace package not found" when writing</strong></summary>

Reads work, but every save / delete fails with a subprocess error mentioning `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mempalace'`.

- `MEMPALACE_PYTHON_BIN` points at a Python that can't `import mempalace`. Run it manually:
  ```bash
  $MEMPALACE_PYTHON_BIN -c "import mempalace; print(mempalace.__file__)"
  ```
- Fix the path, or install `mempalace` into that venv, then restart Apricity.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I forgot my password</strong></summary>

```bash
rm ~/.mempalace/dashboard-credentials.json ~/.mempalace/dashboard-sessions.json
```

Restart the server, copy the newly generated setup secret from its log, and re-enroll
via **Settings → Account**. This does **not** touch your memories or expose them without
authentication.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Port 8765 is already in use</strong></summary>

```bash
PORT=9000 python3 server.py
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I want to reach Apricity from another machine on my LAN</strong></summary>

The server binds to `127.0.0.1` deliberately. Prefer a reverse proxy (Caddy, nginx,
Tailscale Serve) that terminates TLS and forwards to the loopback port. Configure its
hostname in `MEMPALACE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` and set `MEMPALACE_COOKIE_SECURE=true`.

Direct LAN binding is an explicit opt-in: configure an owner account or
`MEMPALACE_TOKEN`, then start with `MEMPALACE_HOST=0.0.0.0`. Apricity refuses this mode
without authentication. Never expose the raw port to the public internet.
</details>

## FAQ

**Is this an official MemPalace project?**
No. Apricity is a community front-end that talks to the official `mempalace` package. The MemPalace project itself lives at [MemPalace/mempalace](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace).

**Does it work offline?**
Yes. The server is loopback-only by default and the front-end is vendored — no CDNs or
analytics. The only optional outbound request is a cached GitHub releases check;
disable it with `APRICITY_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK=true`.

**Do my memories leave my machine?**
Memory content is never uploaded. Apricity reads and writes the local palace; the
optional release check sends no palace data but does contact `api.github.com`, and can
be disabled with `APRICITY_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK=true`.

**Can I run multiple instances on one host?**
Yes — give each one its own `PORT` and (if you want isolated palaces) its own `MEMPALACE_HOME`.

**Why no `pip install` requirement?**
The whole server is one file of standard-library Python. Keeping it dependency-free means you can audit it, vendor it, or run it on a fresh box without thinking about supply chains.

**Can I script against it?**
Yes. Set `MEMPALACE_TOKEN=…` and pass it as `X-Auth-Token`. See [API reference](#api-reference).

If you're adding a feature, please open an issue first to talk through the shape of it — Apricity values being small and dependency-free, so not every feature is the right fit.

## Security

If you find a vulnerability, please **do not** open a public issue. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the disclosure process.
