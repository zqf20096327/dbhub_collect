## 🔐 Portable, Private & Secure

Designed for the privacy-conscious artist, this application operates on a strictly "Local-First" philosophy.

* **Standalone Desktop App:** Runs as a single `.exe` (Windows), `.AppImage` (Linux), or `.dmg` (macOS). No installer required.
* **Bundled Runtime:** Includes a self-contained Java 21 environment. No system-wide Java installation is required.
* **Portable Data:** All data (database, thumbnails, settings) is stored in a local `data/` folder next to the executable, including on macOS (it sits beside the app bundle, not in `~/Library/Application Support`), making it easy to backup or move.
* **100% Offline / No Telemetry:** There are no "cloud sync" features, analytics, or background API calls. Your prompts and generation data never leave your machine.
* **Privacy Scrubbing:** Integrated **Scrubber View** allows you to sanitize images before sharing. It strips hidden generation metadata (Prompts, ComfyUI Workflows, Seed data) while preserving visual quality.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* **Universal Metadata Engine:** Advanced parsing strategies for the entire stable diffusion ecosystem.
  * **ComfyUI:** Traverses complex node graphs (recursive inputs) and API formats to identify the true Sampler, Scheduler, and LoRAs used.
  * **Automatic1111 / Forge:** Parses standard "Steps: XX, Sampler: XX" text blocks.
  * **Others:** Native support for **InvokeAI**, **SwarmUI**, and **NovelAI**.
  * *Note: Metadata extraction requires images to contain embedded EXIF or PNG text chunks (standard for most AI generators).*
* **AI Auto-Tagger:** Integrated **WD14 ONNX** model for local image interrogation. Automatically generate descriptive tags for your library without external API calls.
* **Library Management:**
  * **Smart Collections:** Create dynamic collections based on metadata filters (e.g., "All images using Flux model with > 4 stars").
  * **Visual Previews:** Collections feature a 3D-stacked image preview for immediate visual context.
  * **Pinned Folders:** Bookmark frequently accessed directories for rapid navigation.
  * **Star Ratings:** Rate images (1-5 stars) with instant filtering.
* **Speed Sorting:** A dedicated mode for processing high-volume generation batches.
  * **Hotkeys:** Instantly move images to configurable target folders using numeric keys (1-5).
  * **Recycle Bin:** Safely move unwanted results to the OS trash (Recycle Bin/Trash).
* **Performance:**
  * **FTS5 Search:** Powered by SQLite's Full-Text Search for near-instant results across tens of thousands of images.
  * **Virtualization:** Uses virtual scrolling to handle massive folders without UI lag.
  * **Project Loom:** Uses Java 21 Virtual Threads for non-blocking background indexing.
* **Modern UX & Customization:**
  * **Latent Design System:** A unified dark interface (cyan & violet accents) built from a shared component library for visual consistency across every tool view.
  * **Image Comparator:** Side-by-side comparison tool with a draggable slider.
* **Real-Time Hot Folder Sync:** Keep the app open alongside your generator. A background file watcher detects new images and injects them into your gallery in real-time as they are generated, without locking the database.
* **Network Drive & WSL Path Support:** Folder monitoring works with any path your OS can browse to, including mapped network drives and Windows Subsystem for Linux shares (`\\wsl$\`). Handy for pinning Dockerized ComfyUI/Automatic1111 output folders.

---

## 💻 System Requirements

* **OS:** Windows 10/11 (64-bit), Linux (AppImage), or macOS (11+).
* **Memory:** 
  * **Minimum:** 4GB RAM.
  * **Recommended:** 8GB+ RAM (especially when using the AI Auto-Tagger).
* **Storage:** ~300MB for the application + additional space for the WD14 AI model (~300MB) and thumbnail cache (~50MB per 10,000 images).
* **GPU:** Not required. AI interrogation runs efficiently on the CPU via ONNX Runtime.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

The application is built as a highly concurrent hybrid desktop app, combining a resilient Spring Boot backend with a strict lazy-loading Vue.js frontend, packaged via Electron.

* **Backend (Java 21 + Spring Boot 3.3):**
  * **SQLite + FTS5:** High-performance local indexing and relational storage.
  * **Virtual Threads:** Optimized for heavy I/O tasks (file scanning and metadata extraction).
  * **ONNX Runtime:** Local execution of AI models with automated native resource management and idle-eviction.
  * **Flyway:** Automated database schema migrations.

* **Frontend (Vue 3 + PrimeVue):**
  * **Pinia:** Centralized state management for the image library and UI state.
  * **PrimeVue:** Premium UI component library with custom glassmorphism overrides.
  * **Vite:** Modern build pipeline for the frontend assets.

* **Desktop (Electron):**
  * **Process Management:** Automatically spawns and terminates the Spring Boot backend.
  * **Native Integration:** Provides access to native folder selection dialogs and OS file explorer.
  * **Cross-Platform:** Builds for Windows, Linux, and macOS using GitHub Actions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

[![Download Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Latest_Release-2ea44f?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/erroralex/Latent-Library/releases/latest)

1.  **Download** the appropriate file for your OS:
    *   **Windows:** `Latent Library X.X.X.exe` (portable, no installer)
    *   **Linux:** `Latent Library-X.X.X.AppImage` (mark as executable with `chmod +x`)
    *   **macOS:** `Latent Library-X.X.X.dmg`
2.  **Run** the application. No installation is required.
3.  **Select a Folder** containing your AI-generated images to start indexing.

> **🍎 macOS Users:**
> Because this app is not yet signed with an Apple Developer Certificate, you may see an error saying the app is **"damaged and can't be opened."** This is a standard macOS security message for unsigned apps.
>
> **To fix this:**
> 1. Move the app to your **Applications** folder.
> 2. Open **Terminal**.
> 3. Run the following command to clear the quarantine attribute:
>    ```bash
>    sudo xattr -cr "/Applications/Latent Library.app"
>    ```
> 4. You can now open the app normally.

### 🔄 How to Update
Latent Library is completely portable. To update to a new version without losing your collections, tags, or database:
1. **Download** the latest release for your OS.
2. **Replace** your old executable with the new one.
3. **Keep your `data/` folder intact.** As long as the new executable is placed next to your existing `data/` folder, it will load your existing library automatically.
