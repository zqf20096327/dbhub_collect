EVBook is an open-source EV logbook: it records what your car does and turns it
into a history you can read — every drive, every charging session, what it cost
and how the battery is ageing. It speaks to **Tesla** vehicles through the Tesla
Owner API and to **Volvo** through Volvo's official API, and is structured so
other EV makes can follow.

It is self-hosted with none of the self-hosting. Where
[TeslaMate](https://github.com/teslamate-org/teslamate) asks for a server,
PostgreSQL, Grafana and an MQTT broker, EVBook is a single Cloudflare Worker and
a D1 database in your own account — no servers, no Docker, nothing to back up or
upgrade. Prefer your own box? The same app runs as one Docker container.

## Highlights

- **Free to run.** Cloudflare's Workers and D1 free tiers cover a car or two of
  typical driving, and need no payment method on file.
- **One command to deploy.** `bun run setup` provisions, migrates, sets the
  secrets and deploys. Or hand the bundled
  [deploy skill](./skills/evbook-deploy/SKILL.md) to Claude Code (or any coding
  agent) and it does the same, without ever asking you to paste a secret into
  the chat.
- **Lets the car sleep.** A vehicle state machine with careful
  sleep-preservation rules logs the car without keeping it awake, so logging
  does not cost you range.
- **Updates itself.** The app notices new releases on its own, and on Cloudflare
  an **Install** button deploys them for you through GitHub Actions
  ([docs/updating.md](./docs/updating.md)).
- **Your data stays yours.** It signs in to your own account, stores everything
  in your own database, and every table is a CSV download away.

And beside the log itself:

- **Places** — named geofences with a map editor and per-location pricing.
- **Glovebox** — the car's papers (logbook or title, insurance, inspection, road
  tax) kept beside its history, with thumbnails and direct camera capture.
- **Import** — bring your history from another logger: upload the export in the
  app. A Tessie export replays through the real state machine; a TeslaMate
  backup brings its drives, charges, costs and tracks across as they are
  ([docs/import.md](./docs/import.md)).
- **Installs like an app** — a PWA with an offline-aware shell and light and
  dark themes; add it to a phone's home screen and it opens standalone,
  straight into the overview.

Every page is live at **[demo.evbook.app](https://demo.evbook.app)**, against
two cars and three years of generated history — no sign-up, nothing to install.

## Deploy your own

### On Cloudflare

You need a Cloudflare account (the free plan is enough), [Bun](https://bun.com)
1.4 or newer, and Node 22.18 or newer — the Cloudflare CLI runs on it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evbook/evbook.git && cd evbook
bun install
bunx cf auth login
bun run setup      # asks for the password you will log in with, generates the encryption key, deploys
```

That is the whole of it. `bun run setup` generates `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (only if
the worker has none — re-running it never replaces one), asks for
`APP_PASSWORD` without echoing it, and deploys with
[`cf`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/), the Cloudflare CLI. The deploy
provisions the D1 database by name in your account, and the worker applies its
own migrations — so the same unmodified configuration deploys into any
Cloudflare account. Glovebox documents are kept in D1 unless R2 is enabled on
the account, in which case the deploy provisions a bucket for them. Later
updates are just `bun run deploy`; `bun run setup --password` changes the
password. See [docs/cloudflare-cli.md](./docs/cloudflare-cli.md).

The guided path does the same from a chat: point Claude Code at
[`skills/evbook-deploy`](./skills/evbook-deploy/SKILL.md) and ask it to deploy
EVBook.

### On your own server

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # set APP_PASSWORD and ENCRYPTION_KEY
docker compose up -d    # serves on :3000
```

The compose file runs the published image, `ghcr.io/evbook/evbook` (amd64 and
arm64). Plain Node or Bun without Docker works too —
[docs/vps.md](./docs/vps.md).

### Connect your car

Open the URL, log in, and pick your car's make.

**Tesla** — paste an access and refresh token pair. The easiest way to get one
on a computer is the
[EVBook Token Helper](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/evbook-token-helper/bmlcajjacefiijccjjliojdaekghclld)
browser extension (Chrome, Edge, Brave), which signs in on Tesla's own page and
hands the pair back; any token app you trust works too. Your cars appear within
seconds.

**Volvo** — paste an API key from a free application on the
[Volvo developer portal](https://developer.volvocars.com/), and sign in with your
Volvo ID. See [docs/volvo.md](./docs/volvo.md) for what is logged and how the
sign-in works.

Another car later — a second Tesla account, or a Volvo beside a Tesla — goes
through the same two steps from **Settings → Car accounts → Add a car**. That
card lists every account EVBook reads through, and is where one is signed back
in or disconnected.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Keep `ENCRYPTION_KEY` safe.** It encrypts your car accounts' tokens at rest;
> losing it means signing in to them again. Your logged history is never affected.

Smoke-test a deployment at any time:

```bash
./skills/evbook-deploy/verify.sh https://your-worker.workers.dev
```

## How it works

```
Browser (React SPA) ──► Hono app ──► SQL database (D1 / node:sqlite)
                           │
                           ├─► VehicleActor, one per car: the state machine
                           ├─► AuthActor: Tesla token store and refresh
                           ├─► ImportActor: history import, slice by slice
                           └─► cron, every minute: poll parked cars
```

One actor per car runs a pure state machine — `(state, event) → {next, effects}` —
that decides when to poll, when to back off so the car can fall asleep, and
where a drive or a charge begins and ends. The hosting provider is a layer, not
the architecture: on Cloudflare the actors are Durable Objects and the database
is D1; on a server the same actors run in one process over `node:sqlite`.

Built with TypeScript, [Hono](https://hono.dev), React 19, Tailwind CSS 4,
Recharts and Leaflet. [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md) has the
design and the reasoning behind it.

## FAQ

**Is EVBook free?**
Yes. The code is Apache-2.0, and a deployment on Cloudflare's free plan covers a
car or two of typical driving with no payment method on file.

**Which cars does it support?**
Teslas, through the Tesla Owner API, and Volvos, through Volvo's official API
(read-only; Volvo decides which markets it serves — see
[docs/volvo.md](./docs/volvo.md)). Both feed the same state machine, so other EV
makes can follow the same way.

**Will it drain the battery by keeping the car awake?**
No. The polling loop backs off so the car can fall asleep, and the History page
shows how much of the time it actually spent asleep.

**How does it work out what charging cost?**
Give a place a price under Geo-fences: a rate per kWh or per minute, an
optional session fee, and optional time windows with their own rate — a
22:00–06:00 night rate, say, or a winter-only one. Prices are dated: "New price
from…" starts a new one on the day your tariff changed and leaves older
sessions at what they cost then, while correcting a price reprices the sessions
it covers. Where the car did not report what it drew from the grid, the bill is
estimated from the battery's gain at 88% (AC) or 95% (DC) efficiency, or your
own figure per place. A session whose timing is only partly known — a long gap
in the samples, or a charge that happened while the car was offline — gets a
range, from the cheapest to the dearest way it could have fallen across the
rates; the charger's power narrows it. Have the actual bill? Type it in on the
session and it stays. See [docs/api.md](docs/api.md#costs) for the details.

**Can I bring my history from another logger?**
From Tessie and TeslaMate, yes — upload the file under Settings → Import
history. For TeslaMate that is the backup its own docs have you make, as it is
(gzip it first to upload faster):

```bash
docker compose exec -T database pg_dump -U teslamate teslamate > teslamate.bck
```

Only history from before EVBook started logging the car is taken, so nothing is
doubled, and an import can be replaced or deleted as a whole. Other sources are a
matter of writing an adapter; [docs/import.md](./docs/import.md) shows how.

**Does it work with Home Assistant or MQTT?**
Not yet: MQTT publishing (and therefore direct Home Assistant integration — see
the [proposal](./docs/proposals/home-assistant.md)), the Tesla streaming API and
the official Fleet API are not included. The [JSON API](./docs/api.md) is the
integration surface for now.

**Where does my data go?**
Into your own database, and nowhere else to be kept. To do its job the instance
talks to Tesla, to OpenStreetMap and Open-Meteo (to turn coordinates into
addresses and elevation) and to GitHub (the update check). Telemetry to the
project is opt-in and off by default, and
[docs/telemetry.md](./docs/telemetry.md) lists exactly what each level would
send — never the VIN, a location or a credential.

## Credits

EVBook exists because two great products came before it and set the bar.
[TeslaMate](https://github.com/teslamate-org/teslamate) proved that a
self-hosted logger can be gentle to the car's battery and thorough with its
history — its state machine, sleep logic and derived-value algorithms,
sharpened by years of community work, are the intellectual foundation this
project reimplements, and its contributors did the hard thinking first.
[Tessie](https://tessie.com) showed how effortless the experience of a Tesla
logger can be. Deep respect and gratitude to both teams and their
communities — go check them out; either might fit you better.
