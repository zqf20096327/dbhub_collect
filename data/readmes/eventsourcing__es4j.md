### *Enabling plurality and evolution of domain models*

Instead of mutating data in a database, Eventsourcing stores all changes (*events*) and what caused them (*commands*). To make this data useful,
Eventsourcing builds indices over it.

This helps developing applications faster because there is no need to worry
about designing the *right* domain models upfront (or as close to *right* as possible). By keeping all the commands and events, we can enrich or change
our domain models over time with very little friction. Furthermore, this approach removes a need to have a *one and only* domain model for every entity. We experience the world and reality in different ways, depending on circumstances and points of view, and our programs should be able to reflect that.

# Downloading and installing

To start using ES4J, please follow the [installation instructions](https://es4j.eventsourcing.com/docs/master/getting_started/install.html).

# Documentation

Documentation can be found at [es4j.eventsourcing.com](https://es4j.eventsourcing.com/docs/master)

We strive to specify the building blocks behind Eventsourcing and its ecosystem as succinct specifications, you can find the current list of them at [rfc.eventsourcing.com](http://rfc.eventsourcing.com)

# Roadmap

As this project is striving to be a decentralized, contributors-driven project governed by the [C4 process](http://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:1/C4), there is no central roadmap per se. However, there's a [centralized list of reported issues](https://github.com/eventsourcing/es4j/issues). These do not imply an actual roadmap, just what has been reported, ranging from bugs to longer-term  design issues.

# Contributing

Contributions of all kinds (code, documentation, testing, artwork, etc.) are highly encouraged. Please open a GitHub issue if you want to suggest an idea or ask a question.

We use Unprotocols [C4 process](http://rfc.unprotocols.org/1/). In a nutshell, this means:

* We merge pull requests rapidly (try!)
* We are open to diverse ideas
* We prefer code now over consensus later

For more details, please refer to [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)
