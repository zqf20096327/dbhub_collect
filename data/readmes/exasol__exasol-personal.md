## 📖 About Exasol Personal

Exasol is an in-memory, massively parallel analytics database with full SQL support, a vast
ecosystem, extensive AI capabilities, and flexible extensibility.

Exasol Personal gives individual users a complete Exasol database for development, exploration,
analytics, and AI-assisted workflows. It runs either locally (on macOS, Linux, or Windows) or on
one of the supported clouds (AWS, Azure, STACKIT, or Exoscale), managed by the Exasol Launcher, an
open-source scriptable command-line application. Exasol Personal is free for personal use and
does not impose an artificial data-size limit.

## 🚀 Get started

On macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL), install the launcher with:
```bash
curl https://downloads.exasol.com/exasol-personal/installer.sh | sh
```

For a quick start and a general overview of the available commands, type:

```bash
exasol help
```

If you get a `command not found` error, add `~/.local/bin` to your `PATH`.

For next steps, read the [user documentation](https://exasol.github.io/exasol-personal/latest/).
It also covers the system requirements and supported deployment targets, as well as tutorials,
command guidance, and troubleshooting information.

If you work with AI coding agents, the
[Exasol Personal Local Starter Kit](https://github.com/exasol-labs/exasol-personal-local-starterkit)
bundles an MCP server, agent skills, and other components that let your agent work with Exasol
directly.

Install it with:

```bash
curl https://www.exasol.com/install/ | sh
```
