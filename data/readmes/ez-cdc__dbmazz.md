# dbmazz

**Real-time PostgreSQL CDC in ~11 MB of RAM. One binary. No Kafka.**

A single Rust daemon that streams PostgreSQL changes to StarRocks, Snowflake, or another PostgreSQL with sub-second replication lag — **23–360× lighter** than [Debezium standard deployments][deb-faq] and **727× lighter** than [Airbyte's minimum recommendation][air-deploy]. ([How we measured ↓](#-performance))

## What is dbmazz?

dbmazz is what CDC looks like without the JVM tax: a single Rust binary, built and maintained by **[EZ-CDC](https://ez-cdc.com)**, that reads the PostgreSQL WAL via logical replication and streams every `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` into your sink in **real time, with sub-second replication lag in steady state**. No Kafka, no Flink, no ZooKeeper, no Connect cluster, no schema registry — and no batch windows.

The whole thing is **~30 MB on disk** and **~11 MB resident in memory** — about the size of an idle shell session, not a database tool. Run it from the official Docker image or build it from source. Each instance handles one replication job.

## At a glance

How dbmazz compares to other open-source CDC tools on **resource footprint** and **deployment complexity** — the two dimensions where dbmazz is purpose-built to win.

|  | **dbmazz** | Debezium (standard) | Airbyte |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Language / runtime** | Rust (static binary) | Java / JVM | Java / Python |
| **Replication mode** | **Real-time CDC** (sub-second WAL streaming) | Real-time CDC (sub-second WAL streaming) | **Batch ETL** (scheduled syncs, minutes – hours) |
| **Components for one PG → sink pipeline** | **1** (single binary) | 2–7 (JVM + Kafka + …) | 7–10+ (microservices) |
| **External dependencies** | **none** | Kafka, ZooKeeper | Postgres, Temporal, scheduler |
| **Published min memory** | **~11 MB RSS** | 256 MB – 4 GB | 8 GB+ minimum recommended |
| **Deployment** | **Single CLI** | Compose / K8s with multiple services | Docker Compose / K8s with microservices |

Each tool optimizes for different things. dbmazz optimizes for **resource efficiency and operational simplicity**. The numbers above are from each project's own documentation:

- **Debezium**: [official FAQ](https://debezium.io/documentation/faq/) (256 MB – 2 GB typical heap), with 4 GB+ for high-throughput per [RisingWave's deployment guide](https://risingwave.com/blog/debezium-kubernetes-deployment-production/).
- **Airbyte**: [official deployment docs](https://docs.airbyte.com/platform/deploying-airbyte) (4 vCPU + 8 GB minimum recommended).
- **dbmazz**: from [our own benchmark report](benchmarks/2026-04-13-cdc-footprint-multitenant.md) (40 daemons concurrent on a single 2 vCPU / 4 GB worker, ~11 MB RSS each).

---

## 🤔 Why dbmazz?

In a 3-day production load test we ran **40 dbmazz daemons in parallel on a single 2 vCPU / 4 GB worker**, each replicating its own PostgreSQL database to a shared StarRocks instance. Total worker memory: 522 MB out of 4 GB. Total worker CPU: 15 % average, 32 % peak. Every daemon held its own replication slot, parsed pgoutput, and pushed batched writes to the sink — converging on roughly **1 % of one CPU core and ~11 MB of RSS**, regardless of whether the source was producing 1 000 inserts/sec or 1 insert/minute. dbmazz overhead is **fixed-cost per daemon, not load-dependent**. ([Full CDC footprint benchmark](benchmarks/2026-04-13-cdc-footprint-multitenant.md))

For backfill at scale, we've also benchmarked **TPC-DS 1 TB at ~110 K rows/sec sustained** on an 8 vCPU worker, with the bottleneck at worker compute — not PostgreSQL or the sink. Full numbers, methodology, and hardware specs in the [snapshot benchmark](benchmarks/2026-03-07-tpcds-1tb-snapshot.md).

### Where dbmazz wins

- **🪶 The smallest CDC footprint that still does real work.** ~30 MB on disk, ~11 MB resident in memory at steady state — about the size of an idle shell session. Runs comfortably on a `t3.micro`, a Raspberry Pi, or as a sidecar to your application container. Compare to 256 MB – 4 GB for [Debezium](https://debezium.io/documentation/faq/) or 8 GB+ for [Airbyte](https://docs.airbyte.com/platform/deploying-airbyte).
- **⚡ Real-time streaming, not scheduled batch syncs.** dbmazz delivers WAL events as they happen, with sub-second replication lag in steady state. No sync windows, no waiting for the next batch. If freshness matters, that's the difference between an *operational replica* and a *day-old data lake*.
- **🪐 Multi-tenant CDC at minimal cost.** The benchmark shows 40 daemons on a 2 vCPU / 4 GB box with ~70 % memory headroom still free. A `t3.medium` at $0.04/hour can carry your whole CDC fleet.
- **🏔️ Postgres → analytical warehouse without a streaming platform** — direct sink writes (Stream Load for StarRocks, binary `COPY` for Postgres, Parquet staging for Snowflake), no Kafka in between. No Kafka cluster. No ZooKeeper. No schema registry. No Connect cluster. No Temporal stack. No microservices.
- **🚀 Time to first replication: under 2 minutes.** Install the CLI, point it at two databases, watch the live dashboard. No deployment manifests, no Kubernetes, no SaaS signup.
- **🦀 Built on Rust.** Memory-safe, no GC pauses, no JVM warm-up time. Predictable performance, predictable footprint.

## 🚀 Try it in 2 minutes

dbmazz is operated through the `ez-cdc` CLI. Install it with one command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ez-cdc/ez-cdc-cli-releases/main/install.sh | sh
```

Then spin up a self-contained demo (PostgreSQL source + sink already seeded) and watch a pipeline run:

```bash
ez-cdc quickstart --demo
```

That boots the demo stack, starts dbmazz, and drops you into the live dashboard — no config files, no databases of your own required. Press `t` to generate live traffic, `q` to quit.

The CLI runs on Linux and macOS (`amd64` and `arm64`).

**Or run the daemon directly with Docker.** Skip the CLI and pull the official image — one command, your daemon is up:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e SOURCE_URL='postgresql://user:pass@source-host:5432/mydb' \
  -e SINK_URL='http://sink-host:8030' \
  -e SINK_TYPE=starrocks \
  -e SINK_DATABASE=analytics \
  ghcr.io/ez-cdc/dbmazz:latest
```

```

dbmazz reads PostgreSQL's logical replication stream (`pgoutput`), batches events, and writes them to a sink. Each sink owns its loading strategy — Stream Load, binary `COPY`, or Parquet staging — the engine doesn't care.

## 📊 Performance

We publish reproducible benchmarks with full hardware specs and methodology. Numbers below come from real runs, not synthetic projections.

### Read this first — Snapshot vs CDC

dbmazz operates in two modes with **fundamentally different resource profiles**. Don't conflate them.

- **Snapshot** (one-time backfill) is a heavy parallel workload. It runs N concurrent `SELECT` chunks over multiple PostgreSQL connections, serializes millions of rows to the sink format, and pushes them in batches. The CPU and memory you see in the snapshot benchmark below reflect this *workload* — N workers each holding a chunk in memory waiting for the sink to ACK — not steady-state daemon overhead. Snapshot runs once.

- **CDC streaming** (steady state) is an entirely different beast. dbmazz reads logical replication messages over a *single* PostgreSQL connection, batches them in a small in-memory channel, and flushes to the sink. There is no read-side parallelism because the WAL stream is sequential. Memory is bounded by the channel buffer (a few thousand events, configurable). This is what you run 99% of the time, and it costs almost nothing.

> **TL;DR**: if you see "1.7 GB RSS" in the snapshot benchmark and assume that's what dbmazz uses on your production CDC pipeline — that's the wrong takeaway. CDC steady state runs in a fraction of the resources.

### Snapshot — TPC-DS 1 TB (partial run)

We published a partial TPC-DS 1 TB snapshot run alongside the source code so you can see exactly what we measured, on what hardware, and where the bottleneck is.

- **Source**: PostgreSQL 16 on RDS (`us-west-2`), gp3 storage
- **Sink**: StarRocks on EC2 (same region)
- **Worker**: c5.2xlarge — 8 vCPU, 16 GB RAM
- **Workers / chunk size**: 25 concurrent / 50,000 rows
- **Dataset**: 25 tables, ~6.35 B rows total
- **Result**: ~110 K rows/sec sustained, ~1.7 GB RSS, 82–91 % CPU sustained
- **Estimated total time** (full 1 TB): ~16 hours

> **Status**: this is a *partial* run (2,176 of 113,129 chunks completed at the time of recording). A complete end-to-end run is in progress. Full report: [`benchmarks/2026-03-07-tpcds-1tb-snapshot.md`](benchmarks/2026-03-07-tpcds-1tb-snapshot.md).

**Where's the bottleneck?** All 8 vCPUs of the worker are saturated on JSON serialization and gzip compression — the bottleneck is *worker compute*, not PostgreSQL or StarRocks. Larger instances scale further until you hit the source DB's read IOPS ceiling (typically ~12 K IOPS on RDS gp3).

### CDC streaming — per-daemon footprint

In a 3-day production load test, **40 dbmazz daemons ran concurrently on a single ~t3.medium worker** (2 vCPU / 4 GB RAM), split across three workload tiers that differed by 4 orders of magnitude in configured insert rate. Per-daemon footprint was nearly constant across all three tiers:

| Tier | Configured rate (per source) | Jobs | CPU avg | RSS avg |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **High-rate** | 500–1 000 inserts/sec | 10 | **11.3 millicores** | **11.0 MB** |
| **Moderate-rate** | 50–100 inserts/sec | 20 | **10.7 millicores** | **10.7 MB** |
| **Low-rate** | 1–5 inserts/min | 10 | **12.3 millicores** | **10.7 MB** |

> **The headline finding**: dbmazz overhead is **fixed-cost per daemon**, not load-dependent. Whether the source is producing 1 000 inserts/sec or 1 insert/minute, a daemon converges on roughly **1 % of one CPU core and ~11 MB of RSS**. The cost is dominated by holding the replication slot, parsing pgoutput, and maintaining the sink connection — the marginal cost per event is invisible at this scale.

The same worker reported **15 % total CPU and 522 MB total RAM used (12.7 % of capacity)** with all 40 daemons running. dbmazz scales horizontally on a single host: each daemon is an independent Unix process with its own replication slot and sink connection.

Full setup, per-tier breakdown, methodology, queries, and honest caveats: [`benchmarks/2026-04-13-cdc-footprint-multitenant.md`](benchmarks/2026-04-13-cdc-footprint-multitenant.md).

**What this does NOT measure**: maximum sustained throughput per daemon (no daemon was anywhere close to saturated), end-to-end lag percentiles (the workload was light enough that lag stayed below the metric's reporting threshold), or behaviour under a sink slowdown. A reproducible single-daemon throughput benchmark with `pgbench`-driven sustained load is tracked in [issue #71](https://github.com/ez-cdc/dbmazz/issues/71).

## 👩‍💻 For developers

### Build and test

```bash
cargo build --release
cargo test
cargo fmt -- --check
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

Requires Rust 1.91.1+. System deps: `musl-tools`, `pkg-config`, `perl`, `make`.

### Contributing a new sink

The engine is sink-agnostic. Adding a new sink means implementing one trait — six methods, one with a default — modelled after Kafka Connect:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Sink: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;
    fn capabilities(&self) -> SinkCapabilities;
    async fn validate_connection(&self) -> Result<()>;
    async fn setup(&mut self, source_schemas: &[SourceTableSchema]) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }
    async fn write_batch(&mut self, records: Vec<CdcRecord>) -> Result<SinkResult>;
    async fn close(&mut self) -> Result<()>;
}
```

Snapshot and CDC both go through `write_batch()` — there is no separate snapshot path. The sink owns its loading strategy (Stream Load, `COPY`, S3 staging, `MERGE`, etc.) and the engine doesn't care.
