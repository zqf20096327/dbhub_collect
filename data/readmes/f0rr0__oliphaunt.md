Oliphaunt is a family of peer SDKs and runtime products over the same embedded
PostgreSQL model. Applications own their database roots, choose an honest
runtime mode for their platform, and package only the exact PostgreSQL
extensions they select.

## Product model

Oliphaunt is a multi-product monorepo, not one repository-wide version:

- `liboliphaunt-native` owns the PostgreSQL 18 C ABI runtime and native target
  carriers.
- `liboliphaunt-wasix` owns portable WASIX runtime assets and host AOT
  carriers.
- `liboliphaunt-wasix-postmaster` owns the concurrent Linux x64 GNU and macOS arm64 WASIX
  postmaster carrier with isolated PostgreSQL backends.
- Native and WASIX own independent versions. A change to one does not select
  the other unless a declared directed compatibility dependency requires it.
- Rust, Swift, Kotlin/Android, React Native, TypeScript, Rust WASIX, and WASIX
  TypeScript are separately versioned SDK products.
- Broker and Node-direct helpers are separately versioned runtime products.
- Every SQL extension in the catalog remains exactly selectable. PostgreSQL 18
  contrib members share one logical artifact bundle whose native and WASIX
  carriers belong to their respective runtime releases; each external extension
  is a separately tagged, independently versioned product.

A product owns its SemVer, changelog, source identity, product tag, and GitHub
release. Platform packages, ABI payloads, and size-split crates are carriers of
that product; they use the product version and are not extra products.

## First-release target envelope

The release target manifests currently declare:

| Surface          | Declared release targets                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Desktop native   | Linux x64 GNU, Linux arm64 GNU, macOS arm64, Windows x64 MSVC                                                              |
| Android          | `arm64-v8a`, `x86_64`                                                                                                      |
| Apple            | iOS XCFramework carrier plus the declared macOS arm64 runtime carrier, delivered through SwiftPM and GitHub release assets |
| WASIX            | portable runtime plus AOT carriers for Linux x64/arm64 GNU, macOS arm64, and Windows x64 MSVC                              |
| WASIX postmaster | sealed concurrent runtime carriers for Linux x64 GNU and macOS arm64                                                      |

The first release intentionally does **not** claim macOS x64, Windows ARM64,
Linux musl, Android 32-bit, or undeclared Apple architectures. A compiler,
language, or runtime working on a broader platform is not a support promise;
the explicit target manifest, publication catalog, and frozen release lock are
the boundary.

Exact-extension support is target-specific too. An extension is publishable
for a target only when its own target manifest and evidence declare that row.
The public [release reference](src/docs/content/reference/releases.mdx)
publishes the enforced OS/API/ABI floors and distinguishes built package
coverage from installed-app execution evidence, including the Android arm64
and physical-iOS boundaries.

Kotlin common sources are compiled and tested on the JVM as development
evidence, but only the Android facade is supported and published. The first Swift release starts at
`0.6.0` because legacy unscoped SwiftPM tags already occupy `0.1.0` through
`0.5.1`; other new products start at `0.1.0`.

## Exact extensions

Extension selection uses exact PostgreSQL SQL names. There are no selection
packs, aliases, or implicit groups; the contrib distribution bundle is only a
carrier envelope. Selecting `earthdistance` may include its declared `cube`
dependency; selecting `vector` does not pull unrelated extensions into the
application.

The logical `oliphaunt-extension-contrib-pg18` bundle has no independent
version or release. Its native carriers follow `liboliphaunt-native`; its WASIX
carriers follow `liboliphaunt-wasix`. Each carrier contains an exact,
checksummed member inventory, but consumers stage only requested SQL members.
External extension products own independent packaging SemVer. Their immutable
upstream version/commit and compatible Oliphaunt runtime versions are recorded
separately, so consumers must not infer compatibility from matching version
numbers.

## Development

Install the pinned toolchain once, then use Moon as the repository task
surface:

```sh
proto upgrade 0.61.3
proto install
tools/dev/bootstrap-tools.sh
moon query tasks --project oliphaunt-rust
moon run oliphaunt-rust:build oliphaunt-rust:test oliphaunt-rust:package
```

Choose the project you are changing; its tasks own the required checks and
build tools. For workflow checks alone, `tools/dev/bootstrap-tools.sh --workflows`
installs Actionlint and Zizmor. The default also installs Prek and cargo-nextest.

For a product metadata change, also run the metadata gate:

```sh
moon run release-tools:metadata
```

Use `release-tools:test` or `ci-workflows:check` when its
corresponding machinery changes. Reserve `release-tools:check` for an exact
release candidate.

The protected GitHub `Release` workflow owns candidate dry-runs and all public
mutation. Local development commands do not publish packages, create tags, or
promote releases.
