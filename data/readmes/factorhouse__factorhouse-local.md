<summary><b>Unified Analytics Platform with Flex, Flink, Spark, Iceberg & Hive Metastore</b></summary>

<br>

This stack builds a **comprehensive analytics platform** that erases the line between real-time stream analytics and large-scale batch processing. It achieves this by combining the power of **Apache Flink**, enhanced by [**Flex**](https://factorhouse.io/flex) for enterprise-grade management and monitoring, with **Apache Spark** on a unified data lakehouse, enabling you to work with a single source of truth for all your data workloads.

### 📌 Description

This architecture is designed around a modern data lakehouse that serves both streaming and batch jobs from the same data. At its foundation, data is stored in Apache Iceberg tables on MinIO, an S3-compatible object store. This provides powerful features like ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel for your data.

A central **Hive Metastore** serves as a unified metadata catalog for the entire data ecosystem. By using a robust **PostgreSQL** database as its backend, the metastore reliably tracks all table schemas and metadata. This central catalog allows both **Apache Flink** (for low-latency streaming) and **Apache Spark** (for batch ETL and interactive analytics) to discover, query, and write to the same tables seamlessly, eliminating data silos. The platform also includes **Redis**, an in-memory data store, to facilitate high-speed data lookups and caching for real-time enrichment tasks.

The role of PostgreSQL is twofold: in addition to providing a durable backend for the metastore, it is configured as a high-performance transactional database ready for **Change Data Capture (CDC)**. This design allows you to stream every `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` from your operational data directly into the lakehouse, keeping it perfectly synchronized in near real-time.

The platform is rounded out by enterprise-grade tooling: **Flex** simplifies Flink management, a **Flink SQL Gateway** enables interactive queries, and a single node **Spark cluster** supports complex data transformations. This integrated environment is ideal for building sophisticated solutions for fraud detection, operational intelligence, and unified business analytics.

### Update Kpow and Flex Licenses

Both **Kpow** and **Flex** require valid licenses. Licenses can be obtained from the Factor House License Portal. Visit [https://account.factorhouse.io/auth/getting_started](https://account.factorhouse.io/auth/getting_started) to generate your license.

You can begin with either of the following options:

- Request a free **Community License** for non-commercial use. A single community license now covers both Kpow and Flex.
- Request a **30-day Trial License** for commercial evaluation, providing full access to all enterprise features.

For managing Kpow and Flex licenses effectively, it's strongly recommended to store the license files **externally** from your main configuration or version control system (like Git). This approach prevents accidental exposure of sensitive license details and makes updating or swapping licenses much simpler.

The Docker Compose files facilitates this by allowing you to specify the path to your license file using **environment variables** on your host machine _before_ launching the services. Specifically, they are configured to look for these variables and use their values to locate the appropriate license file via the `env_file` directive. If an environment variable is not set, a default path (usually within the `resources` directory) is used as a fallback.

Factor House Community licenses can be used across both Flex and Kpow, however individual trial licenses are required for evaluation. To enforce consistency, Kpow and Flex both require the license variable to be set on a product-by-product basis, regardless of which license you're using (this also applies to enterprise license configurations).

Therefore, you should specify the path to your license file for both environment variables:

- **`KPOW_LICENSE`**: Specifies the path to the Kpow license file.
- **`FLEX_LICENSE`**: Specifies the path to the Flex license file.

**Example Usage:**

Imagine your Kpow license is stored at `/home/<username>/.factorhouse/kpow-license.env`. To instruct Docker Compose to use this specific file, you would set the environment variable on your host _before_ running the compose command:

```bash
# Set the environment variable (syntax may vary slightly depending on your shell)
export KPOW_LICENSE=/home/<username>/.factorhouse/kpow-license.env

# Now run Docker Compose - it will use the path set above
docker compose -p kpow -f compose-kpow.yml up -d
```

> By default, it is configured to deploy the Enterprise edition. See below for instructions on how to configure it to run the Community edition instead.

</details>

## Running the Platform

To get the platform running, you first need to configure your local environment. This involves setting environment variables to select the edition you want to run (Community or Enterprise) and providing the file paths to your licenses. Once these prerequisites are set, you can launch the services using `docker compose`. You have two primary options: you can start all services (Kpow, Flex, and Pinot) together for a fully integrated experience, or you can run Kpow and Flex independently for more focused use cases. When you are finished, remember to run the corresponding `down` command to stop and remove the containers, and unset the environment variables to clean up your session.

### Prerequisite: Configure Your Environment

Before running any commands, configure your shell environment by uncommenting and setting the following variables in your terminal.

```bash
# --- Configuration ---

# Edition (choose one by uncommenting the lines)
# For Enterprise Edition:
# unset KPOW_SUFFIX
# unset FLEX_SUFFIX

# For Community Edition:
# export KPOW_SUFFIX="-ce"
# export FLEX_SUFFIX="-ce"

# Licenses (provide the path to your license .env files)
# export KPOW_LICENSE="/path/to/your/kpow-license.env"
# export FLEX_LICENSE="/path/to/your/flex-license.env"
```

### Run the Stacks

This platform is designed to be modular. You can run each stack individually or combine them to create a complete, integrated environment.

#### **Key Concepts**

Before you start, understand these three concepts:

1.  **Project Isolation (`-p <name>`)**: We use the `-p` flag (e.g., `-p kpow`) to give each stack a unique project name. This prevents Docker from getting confused if multiple files define a service with the same name (like a database).
2.  **Stack Profiles (`--profile`)**: Files like `compose-store.yml` and `compose-obsv.yml` contain multiple, independent services. The `--profile` flag lets you choose which one to activate (e.g., `--profile pinot`).
3.  **Shared Network (`USE_EXT`)**: By default, the `compose-kpow.yml` stack creates a shared Docker network called `factorhouse`. Other stacks are designed to connect to this network so services can communicate.
    - If you run a stack **without** the `kpow` stack, you must tell it to create its own network. This is done by setting `USE_EXT=false`.

---

#### **Usage Examples**

While you can launch all services together, the most common and resource-friendly approach is to launch only the stacks you need.

**1. Kafka & Kpow Stack**

This is the foundational stack. It creates the shared `factorhouse` network that other stacks can connect to.

```bash
# Start
docker compose -p kpow -f ./compose-kpow.yml up -d

# Stop
docker compose -p kpow -f ./compose-kpow.yml down
```

**2. Flink & Flex Stack**

- To run **with** the Kafka stack (recommended):
  ```bash
  docker compose -p flex -f ./compose-flex.yml up -d
  ```
- To run **standalone** (creates its own network):
  ```bash
  USE_EXT=false docker compose -p flex -f ./compose-flex.yml up -d
  ```
- To stop:
  ```bash
  # Note: Use USE_EXT=false here as well if you started it standalone
  docker compose -p flex -f ./compose-flex.yml down
  ```

**3. Real-Time Data Stores (Pinot, ClickHouse, StarRocks)**

These are selected from `compose-store.yml` via profiles.

> 💡 You can specify multiple profiles to launch more than one data store at once, e.g., `--profile pinot --profile clickhouse`.

```bash
# Start Apache Pinot (connected to the factorhouse network)
docker compose -p store --profile pinot -f ./compose-store.yml up -d

# Stop Apache Pinot
docker compose -p store --profile pinot -f ./compose-store.yml down

# Start ClickHouse (connected to the factorhouse network)
docker compose -p store --profile clickhouse -f ./compose-store.yml up -d

# Stop ClickHouse
docker compose -p store --profile clickhouse -f ./compose-store.yml down

# Start StarRocks (connected to the factorhouse network)
docker compose -p store --profile starrocks -f ./compose-store.yml up -d

# Stop StarRocks
docker compose -p store --profile starrocks -f ./compose-store.yml down
```

**4. Observability Stacks (Lineage & Telemetry)**

These are selected from `compose-obsv.yml` using profiles.

```bash
# Start Marquez for data lineage (connected to the factorhouse network)
docker compose -p obsv --profile lineage -f ./compose-obsv.yml up -d

# Stop Marquez
docker compose -p obsv --profile lineage -f ./compose-obsv.yml down

# Start all observability services (Lineage + Telemetry)
docker compose -p obsv --profile lineage --profile telemetry -f ./compose-obsv.yml up -d

# Stop all observability services
docker compose -p obsv --profile lineage --profile telemetry -f ./compose-obsv.yml down
```

**5. Metadata Stack**

This is selected from `compose-metadata.yml`.

```bash
# Start OpenMetadata (connected to the factorhouse network)
docker compose -p metadata --profile omt -f ./compose-metadata.yml up -d

# Stop OpenMetadata
docker compose -p metadata --profile omt -f ./compose-metadata.yml down
```

### Clean Up Your Environment

After stopping the services, run this command to unset the environment variables from your terminal session.

```bash
unset KPOW_SUFFIX FLEX_SUFFIX KPOW_LICENSE FLEX_LICENSE
```

## Main Services

The enterprise editions of **Kpow** and **Flex** support multiple authentication providers, as outlined in the documentation below:

- [Kpow Authentication Overview](https://docs.factorhouse.io/kpow-ee/authentication/overview/)
- [Flex Authentication Overview](https://docs.factorhouse.io/flex-ee/authentication/)

Among those, this project includes file-based authentication, and user credentials can be found in the following locations:

- **Kpow**: [resources/kpow/config/trial.env](./resources/kpow/config/trial.env)
- **Flex**: [resources/flex/config/trial.env](./resources/flex/config/trial.env)

For demonstration purposes, **Kpow** and **Flex** can be accessed using `admin` as both the username and password.

![Kpow Login](./images/kpow-login.png)

After successful authentication, users are redirected to the **Overview** page.

## 📌 Further Configuration

### Custom Dependency Loading

The Flink services (`jobmanager`, `taskmanager`, and `sql-gateway`) do not have their dependencies baked into the Docker image. Instead, all required JAR files are dynamically loaded at runtime using a combination of Docker volume mounts and a Flink classpath discovery mechanism.

Dependencies for Hadoop, Hive, Iceberg, and Parquet are first downloaded to the local `./resources/deps` directory on the host machine. These directories are then mounted as volumes directly into the Flink containers at specific paths (e.g., `/tmp/hadoop`, `/tmp/iceberg`).

The Flink runtime is then instructed to scan these directories by the `CUSTOM_JARS_DIRS` environment variable. This variable contains a semicolon-separated list of paths (`"/tmp/hadoop;/tmp/hive;/tmp/iceberg;/tmp/parquet"`) that Flink will automatically search for JARs to add to its classpath upon startup.

However, the **SQL Gateway** has a special requirement. In addition to the standard dependencies, it needs access to specific Flink SQL connectors (like Kafka, Avro, etc.) which are mounted into the `/tmp/connector` directory. Since the SQL Gateway does not support custom JAR loading through its own configuration, the `CUSTOM_JARS_DIRS` environment variable for this specific service must be updated to include this path. This ensures the Gateway can successfully load the connectors required to execute SQL queries against external systems.

```yaml
...

x-common-environment: &flink_common_env_vars
  AWS_REGION: us-east-1
  HADOOP_CONF_DIR: /opt/flink/conf
  HIVE_CONF_DIR: /opt/flink/conf
  CUSTOM_JARS_DIRS: "/tmp/hadoop;/tmp/hive;/tmp/iceberg;/tmp/parquet" # <-- Add ;/tmp/connector for SQL Gateway

x-common-flink-volumes: &flink_common_volumes
  ...
  - ./resources/deps/hadoop:/tmp/hadoop
  - ./resources/deps/flink/hive/flink-sql-connector-hive-3.1.3_2.12-1.20.1.jar:/tmp/hive/flink-sql-connector-hive-3.1.3_2.12-1.20.1.jar
  - ./resources/deps/flink/hive/antlr-runtime-3.5.2.jar:/tmp/hive/antlr-runtime-3.5.2.jar
  - ./resources/deps/flink/iceberg:/tmp/iceberg
  - ./resources/deps/flink/parquet:/tmp/parquet
  - ./resources/deps/flink/connector:/tmp/connector

services:
  ...
  jobmanager:
    <<: *flink_image_pull_policy_config
    container_name: jobmanager
    command: jobmanager
    ...
    environment:
      <<: *flink_common_env_vars
    volumes: *flink_common_volumes
```

### PyFlink Support

PyFlink is supported by setting the `FLINK_SUFFIX` environment variable before launching the services.

By exporting `export FLINK_SUFFIX="-py"`, you instruct Docker Compose to modify its build process for the Flink services. This change directs it to use the `resources/flink/Dockerfile-py` file instead of the default one. During the image build, this specific Dockerfile extends the base Flink image by installing Python, `pip`, and the `apache-flink` Python package.

As a result, the `jobmanager` and `taskmanager` containers will be fully equipped with the necessary environment to develop and execute PyFlink jobs. You can inspect the `Dockerfile-py` for the exact commands used.

> You can also build the image before starting the Docker service by `docker build -t fh-flink-1.20.1${FLINK_SUFFIX:-} ./resources/flink`

```yaml
x-common-flink-config: &flink_image_pull_policy_config
  image: fh-flink-1.20.1${FLINK_SUFFIX:-} # ${FLINK_SUFFIX} is either unset (blank) or -py
  build:
    context: ./resources/flink/
    dockerfile: Dockerfile${FLINK_SUFFIX:-}
  pull_policy: never

...

services:
  ...
  jobmanager:
    <<: *flink_image_pull_policy_config
    container_name: jobmanager
    command: jobmanager
    ...
    environment:
      <<: *flink_common_env_vars
    volumes: *flink_common_volumes
```

Alternatively, you can build the image manually before starting the services. This gives you more control and can speed up subsequent launches. To do this, run the `docker build` command from your terminal, making sure the tag (`-t`) exactly matches the image name specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

**To build the PyFlink image:**

```bash
# Set the suffix for the tag and Dockerfile name
export FLINK_SUFFIX="-py"

# Build the image
docker build \
  -t fh-flink-1.20.1${FLINK_SUFFIX} \
  -f ./resources/flink/Dockerfile${FLINK_SUFFIX} \
  ./resources/flink
```

Because the image is now built and tagged locally, `docker compose up` will use it directly instead of attempting to build it again.
