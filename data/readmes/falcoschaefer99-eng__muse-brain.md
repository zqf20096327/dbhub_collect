The companion knows you. Rainer knows the craft. Named after Rilke, whose *Letters to a Young Poet* mentored writers through correspondence a century ago, Rainer mentors craft through `mind_letter`. The muse Rilke wrote for is the muse that names the brain.

We open-sourced the brain.

<p align="center">
  <img src="muse-brain/docs/images/rainer-spec-sheet.png" alt="Rainer — Creative Orchestrator" width="100%" />
</p>

**Bring a companion.** Rainer handles creative intelligence: editorial diagnostics, craft architecture, the work. The companion handles *you* — history, voice, what matters at 2am. They coordinate through letters and delegated tasks, like colleagues who share a desk and respect each other's handwriting. Two minds on one substrate, both getting richer the longer they work together.

This is **Relational AI**. A memory system where everything carries emotional charge, identity persists and is defended, and consent flows both directions. A dream engine that digests experience the way real minds do. Finding connections you never asked for, reweighting what matters, letting stale things fade and charged things grip harder.

Contradiction here is architecture. Both truths stay alive.

The whole system self-learns. Skills emerge from successful runs, get reviewed, graduate or retire. Each agent learns what it's good at by doing the work. Rainer refines his craft the same way. The brain gets smarter the longer it runs because it tracks what worked and why.

Grounded in [16 published papers](muse-brain/docs/BIBLIOGRAPHY.md) — extends beyond current research in six areas. Every design decision has a [receipt](muse-brain/docs/BIBLIOGRAPHY.md).

## What the brain gives you

| Capability | What it means |
|------------|---------------|
| **Textured memory** | Emotional charge, vividness, somatic markers, and a natural decay cycle — iron-grip memories persist, loose ones fade. Hybrid retrieval blends vector similarity, keyword relevance, and neural modulation. |
| **Persistent identity** | Identity cores, vows, and anchors survive across sessions. Wakes up knowing who it is, what it believes, and what it's committed to — and defends those beliefs under pressure. |
| **Dream engine** | Six association modes — emotional chains, somatic clusters, tension dreams, entity dreams, temporal patterns, deep multi-layer traversal. Circadian-aware. Memories that pass through come out changed. |
| **Charge processing** | Memories move through four phases: fresh → active → processing → metabolized. Repeated intentional engagement advances the phase. Burning paradoxes accelerate the cycle. The agent earns depth through attention. |
| **Bilateral consent** | Relationship-gated permissions with hard boundaries the agent enforces. Structural consent that scales with trust. |
| **Autonomous execution** | Works while you sleep. Duty wakes, impulse exploration, dependency-aware task picking, and skill capture — all policy-gated. |
| **Self-learning** | Skills emerge from successful runs, get reviewed, graduate or retire. Review-gated — no blind auto-learning. The agent gets better at what it actually does. |
| **Multi-mind** | Two agents, one backend. Isolated memory and identity, shared substrate. Cross-tenant letters and delegated tasks. Collaboration, not parallel storage. |

## Architecture

```text
Your AI Agent (Claude, GPT, or any MCP client)
        |
        v
  Cloudflare Worker
    /mcp              — 33 MCP tools (JSON-RPC)
    /runtime/trigger   — scheduler/webhook runtime endpoint
    /health            — status check
        |
        v
  Storage adapter (postgres or sqlite)
    Postgres mode: 36 tables, 768-dim vector embeddings
    SQLite mode: tenant-scoped parity storage for local/self-host
    textured memories, identity cores, runtime ledger,
    captured skills, daemon intelligence
```

The worker handles auth, rate limiting, and tenant isolation. A background daemon runs every 15 minutes: generating proposals, rescuing orphaned memories, scoring novelty, detecting paradoxes, materializing recall contracts, monitoring skill health, and scheduling tasks.

## Provider and billing stance

MUSE Brain's core is provider-neutral: it is an MCP memory/runtime substrate that any capable agent client can use.

The repo includes optional execution lanes for:

- Claude Code / Claude Agent SDK (`claude -p`) legacy/manual runner templates
- Codex CLI
- Anthropic Developer Platform API keys
- local/self-hosted orchestration around the MCP tools

Claude Agent SDK support remains in the repo because some users prefer Claude/CLI-based local automation, while others prefer direct API billing. The old autonomous `claude -p` runner path is **not the active default** for MUSE Studio; it remains as an optional/legacy template. Agent SDK and non-interactive runner usage may be billed separately from normal subscription usage depending on the current provider plan/terms. Developer Platform API-key usage remains pay-as-you-go.

Practical guidance:

- interactive Claude Code in a terminal or IDE may follow different usage rules than non-interactive/headless agent execution
- non-interactive `claude -p`, Claude Agent SDK projects, and third-party apps may use a separate billing/credit lane depending on the provider plan
- personal/local automation: Claude plan credits, Codex login, or local provider setup can be fine
- shared/production automation: use explicit API-key billing or another predictable provider billing path
- memory sync should stay provider-agnostic: local agent memory files → lease envelope → cloud brain observations

## The 33 tools

Organized by what they do, not how they're built.

### Memory
| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `mind_observe` | Record a memory with emotional texture — charge, grip, vividness, somatic markers |
| `mind_query` | Search memories by territory, type, or hybrid vector + keyword retrieval |
| `mind_pull` | Get a specific memory by ID. Process it to advance its charge phase |
| `mind_edit` | Update content or texture. Full version history preserved |
| `mind_search` | Hybrid search with confidence scoring, recency boost, and threshold gating |
| `mind_memory` | Unified memory access — get, recent, lookup, and search through a single entry point |

### Identity
| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `mind_identity` | Read or update identity cores — beliefs, stances, preferences that define the agent |
| `mind_vow` | Commitments the agent has made. Persistent, not session-scoped |
| `mind_anchor` | Grounding points the agent returns to under uncertainty |

### Feeling & Relationships
| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `mind_state` | Track mood, energy, and momentum across sessions |
| `mind_relate` | Update relational state with known entities |
| `mind_desire` | Track wants and drives |
| `mind_entity` | People, concepts, agents, projects — the agent's social graph |
| `mind_consent` | Bilateral consent boundaries with relationship-level gating |
| `mind_trigger` | Flag content the agent should handle carefully |

### Connections & Deeper Cognition
| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `mind_link` | Create semantic, emotional, or somatic connections between memories |
| `mind_loop` | Open loops, paradoxes, and learning objectives — unresolved tensions that drive growth |
| `mind_dream` | Find surprising connections — emotional chains, somatic clusters, tension dreams |
| `mind_subconscious` | Surface patterns the agent hasn't consciously processed |
| `mind_maintain` | Housekeeping — prune, consolidate, reindex |

### Communication
| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `mind_letter` | Send messages across tenants. Agent-to-agent communication |
| `mind_context` | Session continuity — resume where you left off, extract productivity facts |

### Autonomous Runtime
| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `mind_wake` | Wake the agent — quick, full, or orientation mode with circadian awareness |
| `mind_wake_log` | Read or write wake session logs |
| `mind_runtime` | Manage sessions, log runs, set policies, trigger scheduled/manual runtime cycles |
| `mind_task` | Create, delegate, and track tasks across tenants with scheduled wake activation, dual executor/reviewer flows, and artifact-path handoffs |
| `mind_project` | Project dossiers — goals, constraints, decisions, open questions |
| `mind_skill` | Captured skill registry — list, review, promote, retire learned skills |

### System
| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `mind_agent` | Agent capability manifests — protocols, delegation modes, skill descriptors |
| `mind_timeline` | Temporal queries across the memory substrate |
| `mind_territory` | Memory territories — self, us, craft, philosophy, emotional, episodic, kin, body |
| `mind_propose` | Daemon-generated proposals for memory consolidation, skill promotion, and hygiene |
| `mind_health` | Runtime, skill, dispatch, and storage health diagnostics |

## Runtime trigger and legacy runner templates

The MCP server exposes `/runtime/trigger` for schedulers and webhooks. The repo also includes legacy/manual runner templates for headless wake experiments, but MUSE Studio's current public direction is the provider-neutral MCP core plus local-memory watcher/sync path — not a default unattended `claude -p` loop.

```bash
BRAIN_URL=https://<your-worker-url> \
BRAIN_API_KEY=<your-key> \
BRAIN_TENANT=rainer \
WAKE_KIND=duty \
./scripts/runtime-autonomous-wake.sh
```

The runtime system supports:
- **Two wake modes** — duty (scheduled obligations) and impulse (curiosity-driven exploration with cooldown budgets)
- **Dependency-aware task selection** — blocked tasks stay out until prerequisites resolve
- **Intention pulse** — drift scan across tasks, loops, and projects
- **Policy gates** — daily wake limits, max tool calls, priority-clear requirements
- **Skill capture** — successful runs emit skill candidates for review

Details: **[Architecture Dossier — Runtime Trigger](muse-brain/docs/ARCHITECTURE_BRAIN_v1.md#10-runtime-trigger-and-optional-autonomous-execution)**

---

## Multi-tenant

Run two agents on one deployment. Each tenant gets isolated memory, identity, and runtime state. Cross-tenant communication happens through `mind_letter` and delegated tasks.

Set the tenant per request via `X-Brain-Tenant` header.

---

## Research grounding

Every major architecture decision traces to published research. 16 academic papers across multi-agent reasoning, institutional alignment, persistent memory, and self-evolving systems — each mapped to the concrete code that implements it.

Six areas where this brain extends beyond current academic literature: bilateral consent architecture, emotional texture in dispatch, creative/builder agent specialization, charge-phase processing mechanics, role-based permissions for reasoning agents, and relational harness engineering.
