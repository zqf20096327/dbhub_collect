Reference-backed [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) for real ERP work — built for consultants, developers, and integrators.

ERP systems are complicated. Their schemas, APIs, SDKs, versions, and configuration rules are even worse.

These skills give Claude the references it needs to work with real ERP systems — Sage 300, Sage 200 Evolution, Sage X3, SAP Business One, Acumatica, and more. No plausible guessing. No invented fields. No hallucinated APIs.

Small, composable skills built around vendor documentation, data dictionaries, release notes, SDK references, and other authoritative sources. Give your agent the knowledge. Keep control of the engineering.

## Installing a skill

These skills run inside **[Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code)** — Anthropic's assistant that you use through the Claude desktop app or the `claude` command. You don't need to write any code to install or use them. You add this collection once, then install whichever skill you need.

**Step 1 — Add this collection (do this once).** In Claude Code, type:

```
/plugin marketplace add fdtaljaard/claude-skills
```

This just tells Claude where to find the skills. You only ever do it once.

**Step 2 — Install the skill you want.** Type one of:

```
/plugin install sage300-assistant@fdtaljaard-skills
/plugin install sage200-assistant@fdtaljaard-skills
/plugin install sapb1-assistant@fdtaljaard-skills
/plugin install sagex3-assistant@fdtaljaard-skills
/plugin install acumatica-assistant@fdtaljaard-skills
/plugin install quickbooksdesktop-assistant@fdtaljaard-skills
```

(Pick the one for the system you work with — Sage 300, Sage 200 Evolution, SAP Business One, Sage X3, Acumatica, or QuickBooks Desktop.)

**Step 3 — Just ask your question in plain English.** There's no special command to "turn it on" — the skill switches itself on whenever your question is about that product. For example: *"I need a Sage 300 view of open sales orders with the customer name and total."* Claude looks the answer up in the bundled reference and shows its working.

**Keeping it current.** To get the latest version later, type `/plugin marketplace update fdtaljaard-skills`. To remove a skill, type `/plugin uninstall <skill-name>@fdtaljaard-skills`.

<summary><b>Other ways to install (for developers)</b></summary>

**With the [skills CLI](https://agentskills.io):**

```bash
npx -y skills add fdtaljaard/claude-skills --skill sage300-assistant --agent claude-code
```

**Manually** — copy the skill folder into your Claude skills directory (`~/.claude/skills/` for all projects, or `<project>/.claude/skills/` for one):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fdtaljaard/claude-skills.git
cp -r claude-skills/skills/sage300-assistant ~/.claude/skills/
```

Each skill's `SKILL.md` describes when it triggers and how it works; `MAINTENANCE.md` covers how it is built and kept up to date.

Issues and pull requests are welcome — corrections to a reference, a new skill, or a new capability on an existing one. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how skills are structured and the bar a change should meet (every claim verifiable and cited), and [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for how we work together.

## Disclaimer

Sage 300 and Accpac are trademarks of their respective owners. This project is independent and not affiliated with or endorsed by Sage. Reference material bundled with `sage300-assistant` is derived from Sage's published documentation and product metadata for use as a lookup aid; always verify against official Sage documentation before acting on it in a production system.

Sage 200 Evolution and Pastel Evolution are trademarks of their respective owners. `sage200-assistant` is independent and not affiliated with or endorsed by Sage. Its SDK reference is extracted from the shipped `Pastel.Evolution.chm` and XML documentation for SDK version **11.0.0.10 only** (other versions are not included), and Sage's own terms apply to that material. It documents the `Pastel.Evolution` object SDK, not the Evolution ODBC/SQL layer or the Connector/API web service. Verify against Sage's own documentation, and on the client's installed SDK, before relying on any of it — the SDK binds to a licensed Evolution install of a matching version.

Sage X3 is a trademark of its respective owner. `sagex3-assistant` is independent and not affiliated with or endorsed by Sage. Its table dictionary is a compact extraction of facts (table and column names, types, keys, local-menu values, link expressions) from the "Table dictionary" pages of Sage's public online help for **Sage X3 V11 only** (`online-help.sagex3.com/erp/11/`), not a copy of those pages; Sage's own terms apply to that material. Other versions (V12 and later, V9/V10 patches), folder-specific customizations, activity-code-dependent columns and local-menu changes are not included. Confirm against Sage's own documentation, and on the client's folder, before relying on any of it.

SAP and SAP Business One are trademarks of SAP SE. `sapb1-assistant` is independent and not affiliated with or endorsed by SAP. Its object type list is compiled from community websites, its B1 10.0 schema dictionary and DI API reference are compiled from SAP's own SDK help (`REFDB.chm`, `REFDI.chm`) and SAP's terms apply to them, its 9.3 schema dictionary comes from erpref.com (a third party; the schema IP belongs to SAP), and its Service Layer references are prose summaries of SAP Help Portal pages (sources and caveats are in `skills/sapb1-assistant/references/objects/INDEX.md`, `skills/sapb1-assistant/references/dictionary/INDEX.md`, `skills/sapb1-assistant/references/diapi/INDEX.md` and `skills/sapb1-assistant/references/servicelayer/INDEX.md`). The schema dictionaries cover SAP Business One **10.0 and 9.3 only**; other releases (including later feature packs) and client-specific user-defined tables and fields are not included. Confirm against SAP's own documentation, and on the client's database, before relying on any of it.

Acumatica is a trademark of Acumatica, Inc. `acumatica-assistant` is independent and not affiliated with or endorsed by Acumatica. Its references are a compact extraction of facts (URL patterns, parameters, headers, status codes, JSON shapes, rules) from the **2026 R2** editions of Acumatica's publicly available Integration Development Guide and Reporting Tools Guide on beacon.acumatica.com, not a copy of those pages, and Acumatica's own terms apply to that material (sources and caveats are in `skills/acumatica-assistant/references/rest/INDEX.md` and `references/odata/INDEX.md`). The entity, field and action names of one system endpoint (`Default/25.200.001`, 2025 R2) are extracted from its OpenAPI document (`skills/acumatica-assistant/references/endpoints/INDEX.md`), and the DAC, field and navigation names of a clean 2026 R2 instance from its DAC-based OData `$metadata` (`references/odata/metadata/INDEX.md`); other endpoint versions and releases can differ. Confirm against Acumatica's own documentation, and on the client's instance, before relying on any of it.

QuickBooks is a trademark of Intuit Inc. `quickbooksdesktop-assistant` is independent and not affiliated with or endorsed by Intuit. Its references describe the publicly documented QuickBooks **Desktop** SDK (qbXML / QBFC / QBXMLRP2 / Web Connector) as a lookup aid and are not a copy of Intuit's documentation; they are a curated, structural reference rather than a complete field dump, so object names, field names, length limits and the qbXML version a field was introduced in should be confirmed against Intuit's onscreen reference (OSR) and developer.intuit.com. It targets QuickBooks Desktop only — QuickBooks Online is a separate REST API and out of scope. Confirm against Intuit's own documentation, and on the client's QuickBooks install, before relying on any of it.
