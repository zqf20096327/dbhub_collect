As shown in the figure below, TopoData supports configuring the point table via Excel import and export. The first column is the variable name, which will be used later for database storage and external interfaces; the second column is the PLC point address (the address naming is the same as in TIA Portal, e.g., DB301.wstring12.10, where 301 is the DB block number, 12 is the absolute address of the string, and 10 is the string length); the third column is the data type; the fourth column is the unit of the point (if no unit is required, use another character as a placeholder, preferably not left blank); the fifth column is the remark or description of the variable name.

*Notes:*

- *For the first-time configuration, users can click the "Export" button. The software provides a sample address format, which users can edit based on, then import and save.*
- *To improve communication efficiency, it is recommended to place data communication points in one or as few DB blocks as possible, with data locations as adjacent as possible.*
- *The current driver only supports read/write operations for DB blocks; other memory areas are not supported at this time.*
- *Bool-type data does not support write operations.*

# 4 **DataTable storage**

This functional module is mainly used for data storage configuration. Users can utilize a fixed database table structure or create their own, bind corresponding PLC communication points, and store the data.

![](images/1d1bc35e8a5c23ea3e8b80f2c2dbad7bed3e5ac7e2b13b935465bcde423532cd.jpg)

- Storage Information

Task: Storage Task

DB Table: user defined Database table name

Equipment: equipment name

Switch button: enable or disable database storage

Time scale table checkbox: If this option is not selected, data will be stored in the user-defined table structure, with the table name taken from the "DB Table" text box; if this option is selected, data will be stored in the table "tb\_au\_pubHisvalues".

- 数据存储规则

Consecutive Acquisition: As shown in the figure below, select the " Consecutive Acquisition" radio button to enable the system to continuously collect data according to the acquisition cycle. Users need to fill in the acquisition cycle and a bool-type trigger condition data acquisition point. When the bool value is true, the software performs table data storage; when false, the system does not store data.

![](images/cfcb5c53b35236b7d67f29379dbbd1e4d3c7a3f814429b1ed3ddaaeb9358e63d.jpg)

To achieve more complex acquisition and storage rules, please check the " Expression" checkbox, click the "Expression" button, and a dialog box will pop up for configuring the expression conditions.

Rising Edge Acquisition: As shown in the figure below, select the "Rising Edge Acquisition" radio button to enable table data storage when the system detects a bool value of On/True. Users need to configure a bool-type trigger condition point.

![](images/0e3dfb4fca7097c3430f5a53f141006bf512145bbbebb31d06a41a46877987d6.jpg)

To achieve more complex acquisition and storage rules, please check the " Expression" checkbox, click the "Expression" button, and a dialog box will pop up for configuring the expression conditions.

Use Expression: Expressions can be used in both Rising Edge and Continuous Acquisition modes. An expression is a formula that combines multiple variable conditions to determine the data storage condition.

Users check the " Expression" checkbox and click the "Expression" button to pop up the Expression Editor dialog. First, users click the plus button to the right of the parameter list in the middle to add one or more internal variables for the expression. Then, edit the expression in the expression text box, click the red checkmark button to verify if the expression is correct. If correct, click the Save button to save the expression.

![](images/1b5d301ac5060d10a4fb72242a599cc9aa23b35745b8a99d7014edcbc8b99c85.jpg)

- Data Collection

As shown in the figure below, users can custom-configure the storage data table structure, where each data column corresponds to a device communication point. The system stores a set of real-time data into this table according to the acquisition rules configured above.

![](images/b069835157d9d188835b6a4eae71a19e7a7de33b01dd643b572c6d0e54675230.jpg)

- Batch Tag

This configuration is optional. If a batch number communication point is configured, the system will assign work order (WO) information to the corresponding reserved WO field in the table based on this point. This communication point must be in string format.

![](images/12776c16c6a3e6a28e8e97a1a196533bdb078b550dd9311a1b8e79417e5fab62.jpg)

Data stored in the relational database can be queried through the Historical Query module and exported to Excel.

If 'DataTable' is selected, the queried data comes from the database table 'ProcessData' configured in Chapter 5; if 'Time Scale Table' is selected, the queried data comes from the database table 'tb\_au\_pubHisvalues'.

<a id="_Toc222430993"></a>
# 8 **WebAPI Read and Write**

## 9.3 **Mqtt Item Subscription** 

TopoData have 2 kinds off subscription, one is by each tag item, the other is subscribe by all device.

![](images/37ab9cb93a87434c944b9793e2b01a2aa52cd6e209e31637abb28f236a380db1.jpg)

- Group Subscription

Whole device tags will be published together with item “Group Mqtt Topic” configuration, e.g.  “industrial/realtime”.

- Tag Subscription

Mqtt consumer client can subscribe item by Tag Name as shown in below figure, e.g. “R021.A20”

![](images/2e981a933c1703b4ce33a9c1c857b1b82e749e82ebbbf13039b08205820e03f6.jpg)

<a id="_Toc222430997"></a>
# 10 **Python Scripts**

TopoData provides a Python script module for users who need custom logic with python's ablity. Scripts can be created, edited, saved  and enabled from the "Script" page in the main application.
![](images/ScriptMain.png)

## 10.1 **Script Configuration**

Each Python script item contains the following configuration:

- Script Name: The unique script name. It is also used to generate the runtime `.py` file.
- Description: Optional notes for the script.
- Enable Switch: Enables or disables the script when the service starts.
- Trigger Tag: A bool-type communication point used to trigger script execution on a rising edge.
- Expression Trigger: An optional expression-based trigger. When enabled, the script runs when the expression changes from false to true.
- Python Script: The Python code to execute. The field can also contain a path to an external `.py` file.

The script configuration is stored in `hiTopoPythonScriptDef.xml` under the TopoData configuration folder. On Windows, the default configuration folder is:

`C:\Users\Public\Documents\Config\`

Project import and export include the Python script configuration file.

## 10.2 **Running Scripts**

When the TopoData service starts, all enabled scripts are loaded and monitored. A script is executed only when its bool trigger or expression trigger has a rising edge, which helps prevent repeated execution while the condition remains true.

Before execution, TopoData generates a runtime `.py` file under:

`C:\Users\Public\Documents\Config\PythonScripts\`

The Python executable is resolved in the following order:

- The `HITOPO_PYTHON_EXE` environment variable.
- `python\python.exe` under the application directory.
- `python.exe` on Windows, or `python3` on other systems.

## 10.3 **Reading Realtime Values**

Scripts can read realtime tag values by using the following expression format:

```python
temperature = Read[R0021.Temperature]
pressure = Read[R0021.Pressure]
```

Before the Python code is executed, TopoData resolves each `Read[channel.tag]` expression to a Python literal value. Supported resolved value types include bool, number, string, and `None`.

If the tag cannot be found, or if the tag quality is invalid, the script will not be executed and an error will be written to the log.

## 10.5 **Example**

```python
a = Read[R0021.pH] #Read data to a
text_to_add = message = f"Current value is：{a}，please confirm。\n"
file_path = r"D:\xxx.txt" 

try:
    with open(file_path, 'a', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        file.write(text_to_add)
    print(f"write to {file_path}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"error: {e}")
```
