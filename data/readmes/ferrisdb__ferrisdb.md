A distributed, transactional key-value database written in Rust, inspired by FoundationDB.

> 📚 **Educational Project** | 🌐 **[Documentation](https://ferrisdb.org)**
>
> FerrisDB is an educational project where humans and AI collaborate to:
>
> - Learn distributed systems by building one
> - Implement a real database from scratch in Rust
> - Pioneer human-AI collaborative development
>
> ⚠️ **NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE**
>
> This is a learning project. Components are built for education, not production reliability.
> We prioritize clarity and teaching value over performance and robustness.

## Vision

We're building a distributed database inspired by FoundationDB's architecture. Like any ambitious project, we're starting with the foundation (storage engine) and building up to the full distributed system.

## Current Progress

### ✅ What's Working Now

The storage engine foundation:

- **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)** - Durability with file headers, CRC32 checksums, and metrics
- **MemTable** - Lock-free concurrent skip list with MVCC timestamp support
- **SSTable** - Reader and writer with efficient binary search and block structure
- **BytesMutExt** - Zero-copy optimizations with 23-33% performance improvement

### 🚧 What We're Building

Active development on:

- **Compaction** - Background merging of SSTables
- **Transaction Layer** - ACID transaction support
- **Distribution Layer** - Data partitioning and replication
- **Consensus Protocol** - Likely Raft for coordination

### 🎯 The End Goal

A fully functional distributed database with:

- **ACID Transactions** - True serializable isolation
- **Horizontal Scalability** - Add nodes to scale out
- **Fault Tolerance** - Automatic failover and recovery
- **Strong Consistency** - Linearizable operations
- **Simple API** - Clean key-value interface

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/ferrisdb/ferrisdb.git
cd ferrisdb
cargo build --all

# Run tests
cargo test --all

# Explore the code
cargo doc --all --open
```

## Architecture

FerrisDB follows a layered architecture inspired by FoundationDB:

```
       ┌─────────────────┐
       │ Client Library  │  [PLANNED]
       └────────┬────────┘
                │
       ┌────────▼────────┐
       │  Server (gRPC)  │  [PLANNED]
       └────────┬────────┘
                │
       ┌────────▼────────┐
       │ Storage Engine  │  [IN PROGRESS]
       │   (LSM-tree)    │
       └────────┬────────┘
                │
     ┌──────────┼──────────┐
     │          │          │
┌────▼────┐ ┌───▼────┐ ┌───▼────┐
│MemTable │ │SSTables│ │  WAL   │
└─────────┘ └────────┘ └────────┘
[COMPLETE]  [COMPLETE]  [COMPLETE]
```

Currently integrating the storage components into a working engine.

## The Human-AI Collaboration Experiment

FerrisDB is unique: it's being built through genuine collaboration between human developers and AI. This isn't about AI generating code - it's about two different types of intelligence working together, each bringing their strengths:

- **Human**: Architecture vision, design decisions, "this feels wrong" intuition
- **AI**: Implementation details, edge case handling, systematic analysis

Read our [development blog](https://ferrisdb.org/blog/) to see this collaboration in action!

## Why FerrisDB?

FerrisDB is **not** trying to be the next production database. It's:

1. **📚 A Learning Platform** - Watch a database being built from scratch
2. **🤝 A Collaboration Experiment** - Pioneering human-AI development
3. **🦀 A Rust Teaching Tool** - Learn Rust through real systems programming
4. **📖 Open Documentation** - Every decision explained, every mistake shared

**If you need a production database**, use PostgreSQL, SQLite, or FoundationDB.  
**If you want to learn how databases work**, you're in the right place!
