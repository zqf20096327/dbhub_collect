1. Download mytop directly into /usr/local/bin/ and make it executable
```bash
curl -fsSL -o /usr/local/bin/mytop https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fevangelou/mytop/main/mytop && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mytop
```

2. Run anywhere (the defaults work just fine on Debian 11+, Ubuntu 22.04+ and RHEL distros v7 or newer)

## ABOUT

<img width="735" height="324" alt="mytop_v2 0_screenshot" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/604a37de-20c1-418a-8eac-5649b2b4aeb5" />

This is a fork of the original mytop Perl script, updated for MySQL 8.x & MariaDB 10.3+ (or newer) releases.

It is not a half-baked todo-when-I-get-the-time fork.

As a professional sysadmin, I had used mytop for years. My gradual switch to Ubuntu Server 24.04 though left me with Innotop as the only available (maintained) choice, which simply does not work right, especially when it comes to explaining queries. Plus it never "clicked" as a utility. You had to devote way too many brain cells to configure Innotop just to get the basics that mytop provided out of the box (go figure...). As such, forking mytop was the only sensible thing to do. And as long as I'm active as a sysadmin (17+ years already), I'll keep it updated.

Yes, it has been "vibe coded" with the help of Anthropic's Claude (Perl was never my domain), but I have tested it extensively and since it's a daily tool for me, I'm gonna keep on maintaining it, as well as examine a possible rewrite to another language in the future.

Sincere thanks to Jeremy D. Zawodny (original author) & Mark Grennan (who updated mytop for MySQL 5.x).


## WHAT'S NEW

### MySQL 8.0 & MariaDB 10.3 (or newer) compatibility fixes

#### Query Cache Removal
- MySQL 8.0 completely removed the query cache feature
- Added intelligent detection that checks for `have_query_cache` variable
- Falls back to checking `Qcache_hits` status variable for older versions
- Safely defaults to disabled for MySQL 8.0 or newer

#### Safe Status Variables
- All `Qcache_*` status variable references now use null coalescing
- Prevents undefined variable warnings when query cache doesn't exist
- Cache hit ratio calculations won't crash on MySQL 8+

#### Enhanced EXPLAIN
- Wrapped EXPLAIN execution in eval block for proper error handling
- Catches non-explainable queries (DDL, some admin commands)
- Added support for new `filtered` column in MySQL 8+ EXPLAIN output
- Dynamic column detection for future MySQL versions

#### System Compatibility
- Fixed `/proc/loadavg` reading for non-Linux systems
- Added proper error handling with fallback to empty string

### User Experience Improvements

#### Dependency Checking
- Automatic detection of missing Perl modules (DBI, DBD::mysql or DBD::MariaDB, Term::ReadKey)
- Detects the `MariaDB-common`/`mysql-common` package conflict on RHEL-family systems and suggests the correct CPAN fix
- Provides exact installation commands based on your distribution

#### Better Defaults
- Default database changed from `test` to `mysql`
- Refresh delay reduced from 5 seconds to 1 second
- Idle thread display threshold set to 2

#### Code Quality
- Fixed all Perl syntax warnings
- Renamed conflicting variables to avoid masking
- Fixed operator typo (`=>` to `>=` in cache ratio comparison)
- Code formatted with Perl Tidy

---

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Prerequisites

mytop requires the following Perl modules:

#### On Debian 11+ or Ubuntu 22.04+
```bash
sudo apt install libdbi-perl libdbd-mysql-perl libterm-readkey-perl
```

#### On RHEL distros (v7 or newer)
```bash
sudo yum install perl-DBI perl-DBD-MySQL perl-TermReadKey
```
or

```bash
sudo dnf install perl-DBI perl-DBD-MySQL perl-TermReadKey
```

##### RHEL 9+ with MariaDB.org or cPanel repos (`MariaDB-common` installed)

If your system uses MariaDB's own repos (or cPanel's MariaDB packages) instead of the distro's stock MariaDB/MySQL packages, the commands above will fail: `perl-DBD-MySQL` depends on `mysql-common`, which conflicts with `MariaDB-common`. On top of that, the current `DBD::mysql` 5.x on CPAN no longer compiles against MariaDB's client library (it requires MySQL 8.x client headers). Check with `rpm -q MariaDB-common` - if it's installed, use CPAN with the MariaDB-native driver instead:

```bash
sudo dnf install gcc make MariaDB-devel   # build prerequisites
sudo cpan DBD::MariaDB
```

mytop detects and uses `DBD::MariaDB` automatically if `DBD::mysql` isn't available - no configuration needed.

#### Via CPAN (for the purists)
```bash
cpan DBI DBD::mysql Term::ReadKey
```

Or, if that fails to compile against your MariaDB client library (see above):
```bash
cpan DBI DBD::MariaDB Term::ReadKey
```

### 2. One-line installation

No need to run `make` and `make install`, clone the repo, or fetch a tarball as with previous versions - mytop is a standalone Perl script, so grab it directly:

```bash

# 1. Download mytop directly into /usr/local/bin/ and make it executable
curl -fsSL -o /usr/local/bin/mytop https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fevangelou/mytop/main/mytop && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mytop

# 2. Run anywhere (the defaults work just fine on Debian 11+, Ubuntu 22.04+ and RHEL distros v7 or newer)
mytop

```

---

## CONFIGURATION

### The .mytop Configuration File

When run as a root user, the defaults should work out of the box. Should you need to adjust them or allow regular system users to access mytop, create a config file at `~/.mytop` (either for root or for each user you want to allow using mytop) with your connection settings:

```bash
# Place at ~/.mytop - adjust as needed
host=localhost
port=3306
db=mysql
user=myuser
pass=mypassword
delay=1
socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
```

### Command Line Options

Run `mytop --help` to see all options:

- `-u <user>` - MySQL/MariaDB username (default: root)
- `-p <password>` - MySQL/MariaDB password
- `-h <host>` - MySQL/MariaDB server host (default: localhost)
- `-P <port>` - MySQL/MariaDB server port (default: 3306)

- `-d <database>` - Database to use (default: mysql)
- `-b` - Batch mode, print and exit
- `-s <seconds>` - Refresh delay in seconds (default: 1)
- `-i` - Idle mode - only show non-sleeping threads
- `-I` - Idle (big I) - mark idle threads with "." instead of full command
- `-o <field>` - Sort order (default: last_cputime)
  - `last_cputime` - Time spent
  - `user` - Username
  - `db` - Database name
  - `host` - Client host

## CHANGELOG

*This changelog also provides a historical record of all previous versions before 2.0.*

### Version 2.1 - July 5th, 2026
1. Dual DBD driver support added.

mytop now works with either `DBD::mysql` **or** `DBD::MariaDB` - whichever is installed. At startup it tries `DBD::mysql` first, then falls back to `DBD::MariaDB`, and builds the DSN and connection attributes (`mysql_*` vs `mariadb_*`) accordingly. This fixes a real-world case on **RHEL 9-family systems (AlmaLinux, Rocky, etc.) using MariaDB.org or cPanel's MariaDB repos**: the distro's `perl-DBD-MySQL` package conflicts with `MariaDB-common` (via its `mysql-common` dependency), so it can't be installed via `dnf`/`yum` at all, and installing the current `DBD::mysql` from CPAN fails to compile because DBD::mysql 5.x hard-requires MySQL 8.x client libraries, not MariaDB's connector.

The dependency checker now detects this exact conflict (`rpm -q MariaDB-common`) and points you at the CPAN-based fix instead of a `dnf` command that's guaranteed to fail. See [Prerequisites](#1-prerequisites) below for the commands.

2. Control character stripping fix.

Displayed query text is now stripped of any stray non-printing control bytes (e.g. embedded ESC sequences or NUL bytes from binary data stored in a column) before being printed to the terminal, preventing corrupted or hijacked terminal output when such data shows up in `SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST`. This was inspired by a similar-looking line in MariaDB's own bundled `mytop`, which turned out to be dead code - `tr/[[:cntrl:]]//` is a no-op in Perl since `tr///` doesn't expand POSIX bracket classes - so this is a working implementation via `s/[[:cntrl:]]//g` instead.

3. Fixed `localhost` connection failure under `DBD::MariaDB`.

The default connection settings (`host=localhost`) failed with `Connection error: port cannot be specified when host is localhost or embedded` on systems using the `DBD::MariaDB` fallback. `DBD::mysql` has always silently ignored a port specified alongside `host=localhost` (since "localhost" means "use the local socket" to every MySQL/MariaDB client), but `DBD::MariaDB` validates the DSN strictly and rejects the combination outright. The DSN builder now omits the port whenever `host` is `localhost`, regardless of which driver is active. Only affects systems where `DBD::MariaDB` is the active driver (e.g. RHEL 9+ with MariaDB.org/cPanel repos) - unaffected on systems using `DBD::mysql` (e.g. Ubuntu 22.04 with MySQL 8.0).

4. Fixed password default overriding `~/.my.cnf` credentials.

mytop always passed an explicit password to `DBI->connect()` - `''` (empty string) by default - which overrides whatever the MySQL/MariaDB client library would otherwise auto-load from `[client]` in `~/.my.cnf` (e.g. `/root/.my.cnf`, as cPanel-managed MySQL/MariaDB installs typically set up). This caused `Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)` on any system where root requires a real password, even though it was correctly configured in `.my.cnf`. The default password is now `undef` instead of `''`, so - unless you explicitly set one via `-p`, `--password`, `--prompt`, or `~/.mytop` - mytop now defers to `~/.my.cnf` exactly like the plain `mysql` CLI does when run without `-p`.

5. Cleaner header display: load average and server version.

The load average and uptime shown in the header are now labeled and clearly separated, e.g. `Load Avg.: 5.34 (1m) 4.53 (5m) 5.41 (15m) - Uptime: 285 days, 11:08`, instead of the old unlabeled `load 5.34 4.53 5.41  11/6259 2580836 up 3+12:55:33 [14:03:22]`, which also dumped the running/total process count and the last PID straight from the raw `/proc/loadavg` line. Uptime itself is now phrased like the classic `uptime` command (`285 days, 11:08`, or `5 min` when under an hour) rather than a raw `D+HH:MM:SS` counter. The current time now gets its own labeled line below (`Current Time: 14:03:22`) instead of being tacked on unlabeled at the end. Additionally, MariaDB's reported version string includes a redundant `-MariaDB` build suffix (e.g. `11.4.12-MariaDB`), which produced a duplicated `MariaDB 11.4.12-MariaDB` title; it's now stripped for display, matching MariaDB's own bundled `mytop`.
