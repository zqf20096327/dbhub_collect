## Run it

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v wds-data:/data \
  -e WDS_CONN_LOCAL="postgres://app:pw@db:5432/shop" \
  ghcr.io/fgilde/webdatastudio
```

Open <http://localhost:8080>. Without `WDS_USER` and `WDS_PASSWORD` there is **no login screen** —
the app opens straight into the studio.

### From a home-server app store

| Store | How |
|---|---|
| **CasaOS** | *App Store → Add source* with `https://github.com/fgilde/WebDataStudio/releases/download/store/casaos-appstore.zip` |
| **Umbrel** | *App Store → ⋯ → Community app stores* with `https://github.com/fgilde/WebDataStudio` |
| **Unraid** | Community Applications, or copy [`templates/webdatastudio.xml`](templates/webdatastudio.xml) into `/boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user/` |
| **Cosmos** | Market → ServApps |
| **Proxmox VE** | `bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fgilde/WebDataStudio/master/deploy/proxmox/webdatastudio.sh)"` on the host: an unprivileged Debian container, the studio as a systemd service, and a generated password. [`install.sh`](deploy/proxmox/install.sh) is the half that runs inside and works on any Debian machine |

Those packages set `WDS_USER` and `WDS_PASSWORD`, so the studio they install has a login screen.

```csharp
var db = builder.AddPostgres("db").AddDatabase("shop");

builder.AddContainer("studio", "ghcr.io/fgilde/webdatastudio")
       .WithHttpEndpoint(port: 8080, targetPort: 8080)
       .WithEnvironment("WDS_CONN_SHOP", db.Resource.ConnectionStringExpression)
       .WithVolume("wds-data", "/data");
```

Every connection string you can express as an environment variable is attached at startup, so a
studio for your development stack is one resource in the app host.

 Or with <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nextended.Aspire.Hosting.WebDataStudio/" target="_blank">Nextended.Aspire.Hosting.WebDataStudio</a>,
which wires the databases of your stack into the studio for you:
</span>

```csharp
builder.AddPostgres("pg").AddDatabase("shop").WithWebDataStudio();
builder.AddSqlServer("sql").AddDatabase("orders").WithWebDataStudio();
```

Both databases land in one studio; a second `studioName` gives you a second studio.

## Engines

PostgreSQL · MySQL and MariaDB · Microsoft SQL Server · SQLite · Oracle · DuckDB · ClickHouse ·
MongoDB · Redis · object storage (S3-compatible, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage, a folder) ·
OData services

Each driver declares what it can do, and the UI hides what an engine does not support instead of
offering a button that fails.

The two that have no SQL still browse. The data tab asks the driver for the page: a MongoDB collection
is read with `find().sort().skip().limit()` and your column filter is translated into the query, while
a Redis database, key prefix or single key is read as the table it makes — the keys with their types,
their expiry and their size, or a hash as field and value.

## What it does

- **Query editor** — Monaco with dialect-aware highlighting, schema-aware completion, formatting,
  the statement under the cursor highlighted, run selection with F5, bind parameters, snippets,
  saved queries with folders, and history that survives a restart.
- **Results** — a virtualised grid for hundreds of thousands of rows, grouping, a form view, a
  transposed view, charts, a map for geography, and a comparison between two results. Every
  per-column filter reads a small language: `^starts`, `$ends`, `~hasn't`, `>10`, `NULL`,
  `LAST MONTH`, a space for AND and a comma for OR.
- **Archives** — a result kept as a file the studio holds on to, reopened as a grid later, and
  scripted back out as inserts. NDJSON, so anything can read it.
- **Editing** — spreadsheet-style cell editing with a change-script preview before anything runs,
  foreign-key lookups, bulk updates, insert and delete, one step of undo, and generated test rows
  that respect the columns' types and foreign keys.
- **Export and import** — CSV, TSV, Excel, JSON, NDJSON, XML, YAML, Markdown, HTML, SQL inserts,
  SQL schema and Parquet, streamed rather than buffered; import from CSV, Excel, JSON and SQL with
  a column mapping; table-to-table copy across engines.
- **Schema** — a table designer, index and constraint management, view, procedure and trigger
  editing, and a migration script preview for every change. Per object: statistics, privileges,
  dependencies, its `CREATE` statement, row-level security policies, and the partitions of a
  partitioned table.
- **Following the data** — a column borrowed from the table a foreign key points at, shown next to
  the id; a perspective panel that opens one row into everything related to it, as deep as you care
  to look; and a table followed on a timer, with the rows that are new since the last read tinted.
- **Object storage** — S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage or a folder as a connection: containers
  and prefixes in the tree, an object previewed, a Parquet, CSV or JSON file — or a whole prefix —
  queried as a table through DuckDB, and a file turned into a real table in the database next to it.
- **A dashboard** — the statements somebody asks for every morning, side by side and running
  themselves: a number, a table, a bar per row. Each tile goes through the same endpoint, row cap,
  masking and audit line as a query tab.
- **What a row looked like before** — read from what the database itself kept: a system-versioned
  table on SQL Server, system versioning on MariaDB, flashback on Oracle. With what changed between
  the versions, and nothing invented where an engine keeps none.
- **A seatbelt for the editor** — hold a transaction open across statements: run the `UPDATE`, look
  at what it did while nobody else can see it, then commit or roll it back. Plus "keep going on
  error" for the script of a hundred inserts, a pivot over the rows on screen, and the plan of a
  statement held against the plan of its previous run.
- **Schema changes, previewed** — a table designer, and editors for the objects a designer never
  covered: a view's `SELECT`, a procedure's or trigger's source, a sequence including the restart
  after an import wrote its own ids, schemas, and the description the database itself keeps. Every
  one of them shows the statement — with what depends on the object — before anything runs.
- **Documents** — what is actually inside a JSON or JSONB column: which paths exist, how often, with
  which types and an example, plus the `SELECT` that flattens them into columns in this engine's own
  spelling.
- **MongoDB and Redis in the same grid** — a collection paged, sorted and filtered by the server with
  a `find`, nested values kept as JSON in their cell and a field the sample never saw marked as such;
  a key space as its keys with type, TTL, length and memory, and a key as field and value, member and
  score, or index and value. Read-only, and it names the command that writes instead.
- **Data quality** — rules about the rows rather than the catalogue: has a value, no duplicates, in
  a range, points at a row that exists, is recent, or a condition of your own. Each one counts the
  rows that break it, a failing rule joins the health findings and the alert webhook, every run is
  kept so a rule says "worse by 7" rather than only today's count, and the rules a deployment owns
  live in the repository as JSON.
- **Profiling** — what a table actually holds, counted in one statement: rows, empty values, distinct
  values, smallest and largest per column. Plus the columns whose values look like an email address,
  an IBAN, a card number or a street address, which is how a column nobody named helpfully gets
  masked — and one click turns any of it into a data quality rule.
- **A way back** — a statement that takes every row reads the table into an archive first, and a
  suggested index can be measured rather than trusted: created, the plan asked again, dropped.
- **Reports** — a saved query with a connection is a form: its bind parameters are the boxes, the
  link carries the values and runs by itself, and the answer downloads as a CSV. Reading only.
- **Notes** — what somebody worked out about a table, kept next to the table: a name, a date and a
  sentence, with no DDL right and no migration.
- **A development subset** — rows from one table, the rows they point at, and what is about people
  replaced, written as one SQL script that loads into an empty database. Keys are never touched and
  the same value always becomes the same pseudonym, so the tables still agree with each other.
- **Analysis** — estimated and actual execution plans with a cost heat map, an index advisor that
  writes the `CREATE INDEX` for you, a deep analyze for missing, unused and duplicate indexes,
  table statistics, slow queries and server metrics.
- **Comparison** — schema and data diffs between two connections, with a sync script in a diff
  editor.
- **Administration** — maintenance commands, sessions, databases, users and privileges, server
  logs, scheduled jobs, a captured minute of what the server runs and what the index advisor makes
  of it, how much every table grew since the studio last looked, a dashboard that draws its numbers
  over half an hour rather than only the last reading, and backup and restore through the engines'
  own tools with the format and flags they offer.
- **Who may, and who did** — accounts in the environment, or a sign-in with the identity provider
  you already have (Entra, Keycloak, Auth0, Okta) with its groups mapped to the studio's roles; and
  an audit trail of every statement, export and refused request, readable by an admin.
- **Diagrams** — an ER diagram per schema with automatic layout, a table picker, and PNG and SVG
  export.
- **The shell** — a command palette on Ctrl+K, keyboard shortcuts with a help overlay and a new
  binding for any command, preferences that live in the workspace, dockable panels, saved layout
  presets, deep links to an object, and 21 themes.
- **For agents** — an optional assistant, and the studio itself as an MCP server with the same rules
  a person gets.

[`docs/features.md`](docs/features.md) lists every feature with its status and the engines it
applies to; a test fails the build if that list falls behind.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `WDS_CONNECTIONS` | JSON array of connection objects, applied at startup |
| `WDS_CONN_<NAME>` | one connection as a URL, e.g. `postgres://user:pw@host:5432/db`, or a provider connection string |
| `WDS_CONN_<NAME>_ENGINE` | the engine for a `WDS_CONN_<NAME>` that holds a provider connection string instead of a URL |
| `WDS_CONN_<NAME>_READONLY`, `_GROUP`, `_COLOR` | per-connection flags for the variable of the same name |

| `WDS_MAX_SESSIONS` | open sessions per connection, default 8 |
| `WDS_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | how long an unused session stays open, default 300 |
| `WDS_READONLY` | when `true`, every connection is read-only regardless of its own flag |
| `ASPNETCORE_URLS` | listen address, default `http://0.0.0.0:8080` |

Everything optional is off until it is configured, one group at a time:

| Variables | What they turn on |
|---|---|
| `WDS_USERS` | several accounts, each with a role and the connections it may see |
| `WDS_OIDC_AUTHORITY`, `WDS_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `WDS_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | sign in with an identity provider instead |
| `WDS_OIDC_ADMINS`, `WDS_OIDC_EDITORS`, `WDS_OIDC_VIEWERS`, `WDS_OIDC_DEFAULT_ROLE` | which of its groups get which studio role |
| `WDS_AUDIT`, `WDS_AUDIT_DAYS` | who did what through this studio, and for how long that is kept |
| `WDS_MASK_EXTRA`, `WDS_MASK_NEVER`, `WDS_MASK_DEFAULT` | which columns are masked before they leave the server |
| `WDS_ASSIST_ENDPOINT`, `WDS_ASSIST_KEY`, `WDS_ASSIST_MODEL`, `WDS_ASSIST_TOOLS` | the optional assistant |
| `WDS_MCP_ENABLED`, `WDS_MCP_PATH`, `WDS_MCP_KEY`, `WDS_MCP_ALLOW_WRITE`, `WDS_MCP_TOOLS` | the studio as an MCP server |
| `WDS_SHARE_ENABLED`, `WDS_SHARE_PUBLIC`, `WDS_SHARE_TTL_HOURS`, `WDS_SHARE_MAX_ROWS` | a result shared as a link |
| `WDS_ARCHIVE_DIR`, `WDS_ARCHIVE_MAX_ROWS` | where kept results are written, and how big one gets |

| `WDS_SCHEMA_SNAPSHOT_DIR` | schema snapshots on start, and the drift since the last one |
| `WDS_ALERT_WEBHOOK`, `WDS_ALERT_INTERVAL_MINUTES`, `WDS_ALERT_MIN_SEVERITY`, `WDS_ALERT_CONNECTIONS` | new health findings posted to a webhook |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | the studio's own traces and metrics |

[`docs/guide/environment.md`](docs/guide/environment.md) is the complete table, with what each one
does and what happens when it is absent.

`WDS_CONNECTIONS` entry shape:

```json
[{
  "name": "prod-pg",
  "engine": "postgresql",
  "connectionString": "Host=db;Port=5432;Database=shop;Username=app;Password=secret",
  "readOnly": true,
  "color": "#e03131",
  "group": "Production"
}]
```

URL schemes map to engines: `postgres`, `postgresql`, `mysql`, `mariadb`, `sqlserver`, `mssql`,
`sqlite`, `oracle`, `duckdb`, `clickhouse`, `mongodb`, `redis`, and `s3`, `azblob`, `gs`, `file`
for object storage.

A `WDS_CONN_<NAME>` may also carry the provider's own connection string — the form an orchestrator
already has. Say which engine it is:

```bash
WDS_CONN_SHOP="Host=db;Port=5432;Username=app;Password=pw;Database=shop"
WDS_CONN_SHOP_ENGINE=postgresql
```

Connections defined in the environment are re-read on every start, are read-only in the UI, and
carry a badge. Connections added in the UI live in `/data` with their passwords encrypted at rest.

## Desktop

Prefer a local binary to a container? Each release ships a self-contained build for Windows, macOS
and Linux. It starts the same server and opens the studio in a window of its own — no address bar, an
icon in the task bar — using a Chromium that is already installed, and a plain browser tab when there
is none:

```bash
./webdatastudio                        # http://localhost:8080, in its own window
WDS_APP_WINDOW=false ./webdatastudio   # a normal browser tab instead
```

Downloads are on the [releases page](https://github.com/fgilde/WebDataStudio/releases).

A studio that is already running can also be installed straight from the browser — **Install
WebDataStudio** in Chrome's or Edge's address bar — which gives the same window without downloading
anything. Nothing is cached either way: the studio reads live databases.

## Develop

```bash
# API on :5000
ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://localhost:5000 DB_PATH=/tmp/wds.db dotnet run --project src/WebDataStudio.Server

# SPA on :5173, proxying /api to :5000
cd web && npm install && npm run dev
```

Tests:

```bash
dotnet test                       # server, including live databases through Testcontainers
cd web && npx vitest run          # SPA units
cd web && npm run smoke           # browser check against a running server
```
