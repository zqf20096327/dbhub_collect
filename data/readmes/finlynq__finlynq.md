# Finlynq

Two ways to use Finlynq: a free managed cloud at [finlynq.com/cloud](https://finlynq.com/cloud), or self-host with Docker.

Open-source personal finance with a first-party MCP server (54 HTTP / 89 stdio tools) so Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc. can query and manage your finances.

## Quick start — hosted

[**finlynq.com/cloud**](https://finlynq.com/cloud) — click, register, import a CSV. No infra to manage.

A public demo lives at [finlynq.com/cloud?demo=1](https://finlynq.com/cloud?demo=1) (credentials pre-filled, resets nightly). Connect it to Claude by pasting `https://finlynq.com/mcp` into Claude → Customize → Connectors.

## Quick start — self-hosted

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/finlynq/finlynq/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

Before the first `up`, create a sibling `.env` file with three secrets, each generated with `openssl rand -hex 32`: `PF_JWT_SECRET`, `PF_PEPPER` (≥32 chars), and `PF_STAGING_KEY` (≥32 chars). Compose fails fast with a clear message if any is missing. Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and register. App + PostgreSQL run in Docker; sensitive fields are encrypted at rest with a per-user key derived from the account password. Change the default PostgreSQL password (`POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in `.env`) before exposing the container to anything but localhost. Full setup notes at [finlynq.com/self-hosted](https://finlynq.com/self-hosted).

## MCP server

First-party Model Context Protocol server with 54 HTTP / 89 stdio tools covering accounts, transactions, budgets, goals, loans, portfolio, subscriptions, FX rates, rules, splits, bulk edits, and file imports.

- **Claude Web / Mobile / Cursor / Windsurf** — OAuth 2.1 + Dynamic Client Registration. Paste `https://finlynq.com/mcp` into the connector setup; no config file.
- **Claude Desktop (stdio)** — point at `mcp-server/index.ts` with `PF_USER_ID` in the env block.
- **Bearer API key** — generate a `pf_*` token in Settings → API Keys. Works for the MCP
  endpoint and for the REST routes under `/api/`. Note that a `pf_*` key is unscoped and
  does not expire until you regenerate it, so treat it as full access to your account; the
  REST surface is what the web and mobile apps consume and its response shapes are not a
  stability guarantee — MCP is the supported integration surface.
