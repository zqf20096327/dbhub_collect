*Deploy anywhere, from a single laptop to your own datacenter*
<br clear="all">

## Key Features

* 🚀 **Powerful.** Firebolt Core ships with all key performance and usability features of Firebolt's [managed Cloud data warehouse](https://www.firebolt.io/), including a state-of-the-art query optimizer, distributed query execution engine, Iceberg support, and many more.
* 🆓 **Free to use.** Firebolt Core is free to use, forever (see the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) for details).
* 📈 **No usage limits.** Firebolt Core has no usage limits. Process unlimited data, scale to as many nodes as you need, and run as many queries as you like.

* 🏠 **Self-hosted.** You can deploy Firebolt Core anywhere you want, from your personal workstation to large on-premise clusters or VPCs.
* 📊 **First-class support** with updates and active [community support via GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/firebolt-db/firebolt-core/discussions). We encourage you to join the conversation!
* 🤖 **AI-ready architecture** optimized for modern data and ML applications.
* 🎯 **Designed for demanding applications.** Powering real-time analytics, embedded analytics, and large-scale data processing workloads.
* 🔄 **Workload compatibility.** Many workloads run interchangeably with [managed Firebolt](https://www.firebolt.io/).

## Get Started

Start Core on your machine with:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.firebolt.io/ | bash
```

If you want to work with Docker directly, you can also run on Linux:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \
        --ulimit memlock=8589934592:8589934592 \
        --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
        -p 127.0.0.1:3473:3473 \
        -v ./firebolt-core-data:/var/lib/firebolt \
        ghcr.io/firebolt-db/engine:dev
```

Or on MacOS:

```bash
mkdir -p -m 777 firebolt-core-data
# On macOS the Docker Desktop file-sharing backend cannot stat the engine's Unix
# domain socket when it lives on the bind-mounted data directory, so relocate the
# socket onto an in-memory tmpfs at /run/firebolt via a config file.
cat > firebolt-core-data/config.yaml <<'EOF'
schema_version: "1.0"
endpoints:
  http:
    listeners:
      - type: tcp
        port: 3473
      - type: unix
        path: /run/firebolt/query_endpoint
EOF
docker run -i --rm \
        --user root \
        --ulimit memlock=8589934592:8589934592 \
        --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
        -p 127.0.0.1:3473:3473 \
        -v ./firebolt-core-data:/var/lib/firebolt \
        --tmpfs /run/firebolt:rw,mode=2770,uid=3473,gid=0 \
        ghcr.io/firebolt-db/engine:dev
```

> [!CAUTION]
> This will create a local `firebolt-core-data` directory, owned by root, where data, metadata, logs and diagnostic information are persisted.

> [!NOTE]
> The Firebolt Core image stores writable state under `/var/lib/firebolt`. If you use `docker run` directly, bind mount your local data directory to `/var/lib/firebolt` to persist data across container restarts.

You can also start a single node cluster by cloning this repository and then run the following command within the repository root directory:
```bash
docker compose up
```

### Multi-Node via Docker Compose

Use this setup if you want to leverage the computing power of multiple hosts.

1. Add in `config.json` one entry (either hostname or IP address) for each of the nodes; node 0 is the first node in the array:

    ```json
    {
        "nodes": [
            {
                "host": "ip-or-host-of-node-0"
            },
            {
                "host": "ip-or-host-of-node-1"
            },
            {
                "host": "ip-or-host-of-node-2"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

1. Make sure that this repository and your `config.json` are present on each of the nodes.

1. Create the volume directory and assign correct permissions:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ./firebolt-core-data
   sudo chown -R 3473:3473 ./firebolt-core-data
   ```

1. Activate node 0:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

1. Activate all further nodes by running on each host:

   ```bash
   NODE=1 docker compose up
   ```

   Increase `NODE` for each further node.

If your host is macOS then you will need to run the Core containers as `root`:
```bash
CORE_USER=root docker compose up
```

* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Multi-Node via Kubernetes

For Kubernetes-based deployments, see the [Firebolt self-managed documentation](https://docs.firebolt.io/self-managed).

## Requirements

Software for your host OS:

* **[Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)**, with the **[Docker Compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)** if you want to use `docker compose`; if you use `curl -fsSL https://get.firebolt.io/ | bash` the Docker engine will be installed automatically.
* **[cURL](https://curl.se/) or any other HTTP client** in order to send SQL queries to Firebolt Core.

Software for your Docker host:
* **Linux kernel version >= 6.1**. Firebolt Core internally uses the `io_uring` kernel API for fast network and disk I/O, and some required features of this API have only been released in Linux 6.1.

Resources for each node (either a local machine or a VM instance):

* **An amd64 CPU supporting at least SSE 4.2, or an arm64 CPU** All published Firebolt Core Docker images are multi-arch images suitable for both `amd64` and `arm64`.
* **At least 16 GB of RAM** are recommended in order to run basic queries.
* **At least 25 GB of SSD space** are recommended in order to run basic queries.
* **At least 10 GBit/s of inter-node network bandwidth** is recommended for multi-node deployments.
* TCP port `3473` open when using a single node.
* TCP ports `3473`, `1717`, `3434`, `5678`, `6500`, `8122`, `16000` open when using multiple nodes.

> [!NOTE]
> There is no universally correct amount of RAM and disk space for running Firebolt Core, and the above are simply rough guidelines for running some simple queries as a way to get started. The ideal amount of RAM and disk space depends heavily on the specific workload that you are running against a Firebolt Core deployment.

## Run Queries on Firebolt Core via CLI

You can submit queries to a Firebolt Core cluster using any HTTP client (like cURL), the official [Firebolt CLI](https://github.com/firebolt-db/fb-cli) as a standalone binary, or by invoking the CLI from within the Core Docker container.

```bash
# Use the firebolt CLI available within the container
docker exec -ti firebolt-core firebolt -c "SELECT 42;"
```

```bash
# Run the standalone fb CLI
fb --core "SELECT 42;"
```

```bash
# Use cURL 
curl -s "http://localhost:3473/?output_format=psql" --data-binary "SELECT 42";
```

* [Example Queries](examples/README.md)

## Run Queries on Firebolt Core via the web UI

1. Download the Firebolt Core UI Docker image:
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/firebolt-db/firebolt-core-ui
```

2. Run the UI container, linking it to your Firebolt Core instance:

```bash
FIREBOLT_CORE_URL="http://localhost:3473"
if [ "$(uname)" = "Darwin" ]; then
  FIREBOLT_CORE_URL="http://host.docker.internal:3473"
fi
docker run --rm --name firebolt-core-ui -p 9100:9100 -e FIREBOLT_CORE_URL=$FIREBOLT_CORE_URL ghcr.io/firebolt-db/firebolt-core-ui
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9100` to access the UI.
