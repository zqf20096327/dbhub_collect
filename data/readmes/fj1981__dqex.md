## 🚀 One Tool. Every Environment. Even the Air-Gapped Ones.

dqex is a cross-platform database workbench that ships as a **single static binary** — no JVM, no Electron, no installers, no network required. It packs **export, import, migration, comparison, snapshots, Excel data dictionaries, a full SQL terminal, and an AI assistant** into one tool, with both a polished Web UI and a scriptable CLI sharing one engine.

- 🪶 **Zero dependency** — one binary, no runtime to ship. Copy it to a USB stick and run it on a bank's air-gapped server.
- 🏢 **Built for restricted networks** — a built-in offline SQL template library, plus the compliance artifacts audits actually ask for (Excel data dictionaries, snapshot diff reports, exportable history) built in rather than bolted on.
- 🤖 **AI that cannot surprise you** — it reads your *real* schema before writing anything, generates dialect-correct SQL, and never executes a write without your confirmation. Leave it unconfigured and the AI entry point does not even render.
- 🌐 **MySQL · PostgreSQL · Oracle** with automatic dialect conversion for cross-database migration.

## ⚡ Quick Start

**1. Download the zip for your platform** from the [Releases page](https://github.com/fj1981/dqex/releases/latest) — macOS (Intel / Apple Silicon), Linux (x64 / arm64), Windows (x64). **No installation required.**

**2. Unzip and run**

```bash
unzip dqex-*.zip && cd dqex && ./start.sh
```

```bat
:: Windows
start.bat
```

**3. Open the Web UI**

```
http://127.0.0.1:8181
```

That's it — add a connection and start exporting, comparing or querying. Nothing leaves your machine.

<details>
<summary>Optional: install to PATH, run as a daemon, or stop it</summary>

```bash
./install.sh                    # install to /usr/local/bin (optional)
dqex                            # start Web UI at 127.0.0.1:8181
./start.sh -d                   # background daemon
./stop.sh                       # stop the daemon
```

```bat
install.bat                     :: install to %LOCALAPPDATA%\dqex and add to PATH
dqex                            :: start Web UI in a new terminal
start.bat -d                    :: background
stop.bat                        :: stop background service
```

</details>

> **Not a Web UI person?** Every capability below also exists as a CLI command, and every command can emit JSON — see the CLI section further down.

## ✨ Feature Highlights

| Feature | Web | CLI | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Export | ✅ | `export` (`exp`) | Schema + data → SQL file (zip / gzip), conditional & consistent |
| Import | ✅ | `import` (`imp`) | SQL / zip file → database, auto create tables, batch inserts |
| Migrate | ✅ | `migrate` (`mig`) | Database → database, **cross-dialect** (e.g. MySQL → PostgreSQL) |
| Compare | ✅ | `compare` (`cmp`) | Schema & data diff between two databases |
| Data Dictionary | ✅ | `dictionary` (`dict`) | Tables + comments → styled Excel (.xlsx), audit-ready |
| Snapshot | ✅ | `snapshot` (`snap`) | Full create / list / show / delete / compare lifecycle |
| SQL Query | ✅ | `sql` | Web query terminal + table browser; CLI interactive REPL with JSON output |
| AI-Assisted SQL | ✅ | `\ai` in `sql` | Agent probes real schema, generates SQL per dialect, requires confirmation |
| Connections | ✅ | `conn` (`cn`) | Save / test / delete database connections |
| Saved Tasks | ✅ | `task` (`tk`) | Reuse one-click task configs (`--task <ID>`) |
| History | ✅ | `history` (`his`) | Execution log for troubleshooting & audit export |
| Shell Completion | — | `completion` | zsh / bash completion scripts |

## 🤔 Why dqex — and why not DBeaver?

**If DBeaver works in your environment, use it.** It is a bigger, more mature tool and it is free. dqex is not trying to win on breadth — it is built for the environments DBeaver structurally cannot enter.

| | dqex | DBeaver | Navicat | DataGrip |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Install form | Single static binary | JVM + driver jars | Installer, licensed | IDE, licensed |
| Air-gapped deploy | Copy and run | Manual JVM + jars | License constrained | License constrained |
| Time to first query | Under a minute | Several minutes | Install + activate | Install + activate |
| Cross-dialect migration | Built in, automatic | No | Yes | Partial |
| Excel data dictionary | One command | Plugin | Yes | No |
| Snapshot diff | Built in | No | No | No |
| AI-assisted SQL | Built in, offline fallback | No | Limited | Limited |
| Database breadth | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle | Very wide | Wide | Wide |
| Price | Free, MIT | Free | Paid per seat | Paid |

**Where dqex is weaker:** it supports three database engines, not twenty. If you need SQL Server, ClickHouse, MongoDB or anything outside MySQL / PostgreSQL / Oracle, DBeaver is the better answer today. Additional drivers are explicitly welcome as contributions.

## 🧑‍💻 CLI in 30 seconds

```bash
# Save a connection once, reuse everywhere
dqex conn add --name prod --type mysql --host 10.20.16.170 --port 3317 --un root --pw 'xxx'

# Export with conditions & gzip → take it home
dqex exp camunda -s prod -o backup.sql.gz --table-cond "orders:created_at >= '2026-01-01'"

# Restore to your local test database
dqex imp -t local_test -i backup.sql.gz --reset drop-and-create

# Interactive SQL terminal (native dialect, runs on the target DB)
dqex sql -c prod
dqex sql -c prod --json "SELECT id, name FROM users LIMIT 10"   # agent-friendly JSON

# Snapshot & compare — the killer feature for incident tracing
dqex snapshot create -c prod -n baseline
dqex snapshot compare -c prod --a baseline --b after-deploy

# Compliance: one command → styled Excel data dictionary
dqex dict camunda -s prod -o data_dict.xlsx
```

## 🤖 AI-Assisted SQL (Optional, Offline-Safe)

- **Real schema, not guesses** — the agent queries your actual table structures before generating SQL (Web UI shows live progress)
- **Generate ≠ Execute** — AI only produces SQL text; write operations require confirmation, dangerous statements are blocked, and you can `\e`-edit before running
- **Full assist loop** — `\ai continue` for follow-ups; Web UI supports generate / explain / optimize / fix with side-by-side diff preview and one-click apply
- **Keys stay local** — API key stored on your machine; only masked endpoint & model name are shown
- **No config, no footprint** — the AI entry only appears after BaseURL / API Key / Model are all configured; everything else keeps working untouched
- **Offline fallback** — built-in SQL template library (`\template top_n orders amount 10`) works in fully isolated networks
