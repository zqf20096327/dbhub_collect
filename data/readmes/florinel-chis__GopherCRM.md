# GopherCRM

A comprehensive Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system built with Go (backend) and React TypeScript (frontend).

## Features

- 🔐 **Authentication**: JWT tokens and HMAC-SHA256 API Keys with role-based access control
- 🛡️ **Security**: Account lockout, password complexity, sort-column allowlists against SQL injection, rate limiting with trusted-proxy handling
- 🧹 **Right to Erasure**: Deleting a person overwrites their personal data before the row is soft-deleted (GDPR Art. 17)
- 👥 **Lead Management**: Lead tracking with conversion to customers
- 🏢 **Customer Management**: Complete customer lifecycle management
- 🏭 **Companies**: Organisation records that leads and customers link to, with domain de-duplication and per-company customer and lead views
- 💼 **Deals**: Sales opportunities with a five-stage pipeline, integer money per currency, per-stage probabilities and an append-only stage history
- 🎫 **Ticket System**: Support ticket management with assignments
- ✅ **Task Management**: Task tracking and assignment
- ⚙️ **Configuration Management**: System-wide settings with admin interface
- 🔎 **Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)**: Track how often LLM answer engines mention your brand — daily runs across Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Kimi, Perplexity and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, with visibility, share-of-voice and citation reporting
- 📝 **Forms**: Build contact, quote-request and lead-capture forms in the CRM and embed them on any website with one script tag — submissions land in the CRM, create leads, and can require double opt-in email confirmation before delivering gated content; layered spam protection (honeypot, time trap, rate limits, optional invisible reCAPTCHA v3)
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: React TypeScript frontend with Material-UI
- 📊 **Dashboard**: Analytics and activity overview
- 👤 **Role-Based Access**: Admin, Sales, Support, and Customer roles
- 🔌 **RESTful API**: Clean architecture with comprehensive endpoints

## ⚠️ Deletion is irreversible

`DELETE` on a **user, customer or lead** is an erasure, not a recoverable soft delete. Every
personal field on the row is overwritten in place — the email address is replaced with a random,
non-routable placeholder in the reserved `.invalid` domain — and the row is only then soft-deleted,
all in a single transaction. API keys and refresh tokens belonging to the account are purged with
it. The row itself is deliberately kept so foreign keys from tickets and tasks still resolve:
business records survive, the person does not.

Two consequences:

- **Nothing can be restored afterwards.** To suspend access reversibly, set `is_active = false`
  instead; deactivation never touches personal data.
- **The email address becomes reusable**, because the original no longer exists in the table.

Tickets and tasks are unaffected — deleting one is still an ordinary soft delete.

Rows soft-deleted *before* this behaviour existed still hold personal data;
`scripts/anonymize_legacy_deleted_pii.sql` remediates them. It is manual, irreversible, and
deliberately not wired into auto-migration.

Full rationale, the cascade rules for converted leads, and the operational caveats are in
[docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#deleting-personal-data).

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Go 1.25+** - Main backend language
- **Gin 1.10** - HTTP web framework
- **GORM 1.30** - ORM for database operations
- **MySQL 8.0+** - Default database; **SQLite** is a supported alternative via
  `DB_DRIVER` (pure-Go driver, no cgo) and is what the test suite runs on
- **JWT** (`golang-jwt/jwt/v5`) - Authentication tokens
- **Logrus** - Structured logging
- **Testify** - Unit and integration test suites

### Frontend
- **React 19** - UI framework
- **TypeScript 5.8** - Type safety
- **Material-UI (MUI) v7** - Component library
- **React Router 7** - Client-side routing
- **TanStack Query 5** - Data fetching and caching
- **React Hook Form + Zod** - Forms and validation
- **Axios** - HTTP client
- **Recharts** - Dashboard charts
- **Vite 6** - Build tool and dev server
- **Vitest 3 + Playwright** - Unit and end-to-end tests

## Prerequisites

### Backend
- Go 1.25 or higher
- MySQL 8.0 or higher — or nothing at all, if you run on SQLite
  (`DB_DRIVER=sqlite`, see [Choosing a database](#choosing-a-database))
- Make (optional, for using Makefile commands)

### Frontend
- Node.js 20 or newer (React Router 7 requires Node >= 20) and npm
- Modern web browser

## Quick Start with Docker

The whole stack (MySQL, API, UI) can run in containers, with database data
persisted in a named volume across restarts:

```bash
export JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"   # or put it in .env
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose exec backend create-admin          # first admin account
```

UI at http://localhost:3000, API at http://localhost:8080/api/v1. See
[docs/DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md) for configuration and persistence details.

To run the same stack without a database server, use the SQLite flavor instead —
`docker compose -f docker-compose.sqlite.yml up -d --build` starts two containers
with the database in a file on a named volume ([docs/DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md#sqlite-flavor-no-database-server)).

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/florinel-chis/gophercrm.git
cd gophercrm
```

### 2. Backend Setup

#### Choosing a database

`DB_DRIVER` selects the backend. It defaults to `mysql`, which is the production
dialect and the one the SQL files in `migrations/` are written for.

```bash
DB_DRIVER=mysql          # default: DB_HOST/DB_PORT/DB_NAME/DB_USER/DB_PASSWORD apply
DB_DRIVER=sqlite         # single file, no server
DB_PATH=gophercrm.db     # only read when DB_DRIVER=sqlite; relative to the working directory
```

On SQLite the server-connection settings — `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`,
`DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD` — are ignored.

SQLite needs no server and no `make create-db` — the file is created on first
start. It suits development, demos, CI and small single-instance deployments.
Things to know before relying on it:

- **Everything serializes on one connection.** SQLite takes a database-wide
  write lock, so the pool is deliberately capped at a single connection: within
  the backend process reads queue behind writes exactly as writes do, and there
  is no read concurrency to be had. What WAL mode buys here is that a *separate*
  reader — the `VACUUM INTO` snapshot below, or a `sqlite3` shell — is not
  blocked by the backend's writes. Run only one backend process against one
  file.
- **The file must live on a local filesystem.** WAL mode relies on shared-memory
  locking that NFS, SMB and similar network shares do not implement reliably;
  putting the database on one risks corruption.
- **The database is three files.** `gophercrm.db` plus the `-wal` and `-shm`
  siblings. A graceful shutdown checkpoints the WAL back into the main file; a
  process killed outright leaves it in place, which is normal and recovers on the
  next open.
- **Never copy a live database file.** To back it up, either stop the backend and
  copy all three files, or take an online snapshot with
  `sqlite3 gophercrm.db "VACUUM INTO 'backup.db'"`. A bare `cp` of `gophercrm.db`
  on a running system produces a stale or torn copy.
- **Back up before upgrading.** On SQLite the schema advances only through the
  auto-migration that runs at startup — the `migrations/` SQL is MySQL-only — and
  auto-migration is not reversible. Take the offline copy or the `VACUUM INTO`
  snapshot above first. Upgrading from v1.2.0 rewrites `leads` and `customers`
  in place (the driver drops and copies each table to add the company link).
  The two rebuilds run one after the other, each in its own transaction, so the
  first start needs free disk for a full copy of one table at a time, while the
  WAL accumulates both rebuilds until the next checkpoint. Auto-migration runs
  with foreign-key enforcement off, as SQLite prescribes for table rebuilds,
  checks every foreign key afterwards and refuses to start if the check finds a
  dangling reference. A refused start has already committed the schema change;
  only the data violation is left. Restore the backup, or fix the offending rows
  (the message names the tables as `child -> parent`), and start again. The
  v1.2.0 binary still opens the upgraded file — it ignores the extra tables and
  columns — so the binary can be rolled back even though the schema is not.
  The deals release adds the `deals` and `deal_stage_changes` tables only: it
  rebuilds no existing table, and the previous binary still opens the file.
- `DB_PATH` must not contain `?`; the connector appends its own pragma query
  string, so startup rejects a path that already carries one.

Docker users get this prewired in `docker-compose.sqlite.yml`; see
[docs/DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md#sqlite-flavor-no-database-server).

#### Create the Database

MySQL only — skip this on SQLite, where the file is created on first start.

```bash
# Using Make (recommended)
make create-db

# Or manually with MySQL
mysql -u root < scripts/create_database.sql
```

#### Configure Environment
```bash
# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env file with your database credentials
# JWT_SECRET is required and must be at least 32 characters
```

#### Install Go Dependencies
```bash
go mod download
```

#### Run Backend Server
```bash
# Using Make (recommended)
make run

# Or directly with Go
go run cmd/main.go
```

The backend server will start on `http://localhost:8080`. Schema auto-migration runs at startup.

#### Create the First Admin

Self-service registration always creates a `customer` account, so the first administrator has to be
created out of band:

```bash
make build-tools
make create-admin
```

`create-admin` also accepts `--non-interactive --email ... --name ... --password ...` for scripted
provisioning; that is how the E2E suite seeds its admin (`gocrm-ui/e2e/global-setup.ts`).

### 3. Frontend Setup

#### Navigate to Frontend Directory
```bash
cd gocrm-ui
```

#### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### Configure the API Base URL (optional)
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# VITE_API_BASE_URL defaults to http://localhost:8080/api/v1
```

#### Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173`

## Usage

### Default Access
1. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Register a new account** — self-service registration always creates a `customer` account
3. **Login** with your credentials

Elevated roles (admin, sales, support) are assignable only by an admin through `POST /users`, or by
the `create-admin` CLI. The registration endpoint ignores any role supplied by the client.

Tokens are stored in `sessionStorage` and expire with the browser tab unless you tick **Remember
me** at login, which moves them to `localStorage`.

### Admin Features
Admin users have access to additional features:
- User management
- System configuration
- All data access across the system

### Configuration Management

GopherCRM includes a powerful configuration management system that allows administrators to customize system behavior through a web interface.

![Configuration Management](docs/img/gophercrm-config.png)

#### Accessing Configuration Settings
1. Login as an admin user
2. Navigate to **Settings > Configuration**
3. Browse settings by category tabs:
   - **General**: Company information and basic settings
   - **UI & Theme**: User interface customization
   - **Security**: Security-related settings
   - **Leads**: Lead management behavior
   - **Customers**: Customer management settings
   - **Tickets**: Support ticket configuration
   - **Tasks**: Task management settings
   - **Integration**: Third-party integrations

#### Configuration Features
- **Type-Safe Editing**: Different input types based on configuration type (boolean, string, array, etc.)
- **Validation**: Built-in validation for configuration values
- **System Protection**: System configurations are protected from deletion
- **Read-Only Settings**: Some critical settings are read-only
- **Default Values**: Easy reset to default values
- **Real-Time Updates**: Changes take effect immediately

#### Lead Conversion Settings
The configuration system includes specific settings for lead conversion:
- `leads.conversion.allowed_statuses`: Which lead statuses allow conversion to customer
- `leads.conversion.require_notes`: Whether notes are required during conversion
- `leads.conversion.auto_assign_owner`: Auto-assign lead owner as customer owner

### Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)

![AEO dashboard](docs/img/gophercrm-aeo-dashboard.png)

AEO tracks how visible your brand is in the answers large language models give to buyer questions.
You describe the brand and its competitors once, track a list of prompts, and a daily run asks every
configured answer engine each prompt and records what came back: whether the brand was mentioned,
how early, which competitors appeared alongside it, and which sources were cited.

Available to **admin**, **sales** and **support** under **AEO** in the sidebar; `customer` cannot
reach it. Saving the profile, managing prompts and starting a run need admin or sales; deleting a
prompt needs admin.

1. **Settings** (`/aeo/settings`) — brand name, aliases, owned domains and competitors, the provider
   API keys (admin only; stored encrypted and never echoed back, so a chip per engine reports only
   whether a key is present) and which engine prompt generation runs on. Save the profile before
   anything else: a run has nothing to detect without it.
2. **Prompts** (`/aeo/prompts`) — the questions to track (up to 100 active). Add them by hand or ask
   the configured generation engine to suggest some. Each row shows the visibility percentage over
   the selected window; opening a row shows the recorded answers with every brand mention
   highlighted.
3. **Dashboard** (`/aeo`) — overall visibility, a per-engine timeline, share of voice against the
   competitors and their trend, over 7, 30 or 90 days.
4. **Citations** (`/aeo/citations`) — how often each company's domains are cited, and how often a
   citation coincides with a brand mention.

![AEO answer drawer](docs/img/gophercrm-aeo-answers.png)

Every recorded answer is kept verbatim — the drawer above shows one engine's answer with the brand
mentions highlighted and a selector to walk earlier runs. The full screen-by-screen tour lives in
[docs/SCREENSHOTS.md](docs/SCREENSHOTS.md#aeo).

Provider keys come from **Settings** (`/aeo/settings`) first and fall back to the environment
variables below when no key is stored, so a key entered in the UI takes effect from the next run
without restarting the process. An engine with no key from either source is simply skipped. Models,
the custom engine and the schedule are environment-only.

| Engine | Key | Model override |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `AEO_ANTHROPIC_MODEL` |
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `AEO_OPENAI_MODEL` |
| Gemini | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `AEO_GEMINI_MODEL` |
| Kimi (Moonshot) | `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` | `AEO_KIMI_MODEL` |
| Perplexity | `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` | `AEO_PERPLEXITY_MODEL` |
| Any OpenAI-compatible server (e.g. LM Studio) | `AEO_CUSTOM_BASE_URL` (+ optional `AEO_CUSTOM_API_KEY`) | `AEO_CUSTOM_MODEL`, `AEO_CUSTOM_NAME` |

`AEO_SCHEDULE_ENABLED` (default `true`) and `AEO_SCHEDULE_HOUR` (default `6`, server local time)
control the daily run. With no key set at all the module still boots; starting a run then returns
503 instead of recording a run that could never produce an answer.

Prompt generation (`POST /aeo/prompts/generate`) deliberately runs on one named engine rather than
whatever happens to be configured, so its output keeps a consistent shape. Anthropic is the default;
the `Settings` page selects any of Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Kimi or Perplexity instead. If the
selected engine has no key, generation answers 503 naming that engine rather than silently falling
back to another one.

**Cost.** One run is *active prompts × configured engines* API calls — 25 prompts across 5 engines
is 125 calls a day. The 100-prompt cap exists for this reason. Only one run may be in flight at a
time; a second request is refused with 409.

`scripts/aeo_live_smoke.sh` walks the whole module against real providers for manual verification.
It spends real credit, so it is never part of CI. Test cases: `docs/testing/11-aeo.md`.

## API Documentation

All application routes are mounted under `/api/v1` (configurable via `API_PREFIX`). Every endpoint
returns the unified envelope `{ success, data, error, meta }`.

`GET /health` is served outside the API prefix and needs no authentication.

### Authentication (public)
- `POST /api/v1/auth/register` - Register a new user. **Gated by the
  `security.allow_public_registration` configuration, which ships disabled** — while off, the
  endpoint answers `403` and the login page offers no sign-up (an administrator can turn it on
  under Settings > Configuration). **Always creates a `customer`**; a
  client-supplied role is ignored. Password policy: min 10 chars with upper, lower, digit and
  special character. A duplicate email returns `409`.
- `GET /api/v1/auth/registration` - Report whether public registration is currently open
  (`{"enabled": bool}`), for the login/register screens; no authentication required.
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - User login. Returns an access token and a rotating refresh token.
- `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` - Exchange a refresh token for a new token pair. Rotation is strict:
  the presented token is revoked, replaying it returns `401`.
- `POST /api/v1/auth/password-reset` - Request a password-reset email. Always answers `200`
  whether or not the account exists (anti-enumeration). Delivery goes through SMTP when
  `SMTP_HOST` is configured, otherwise a logging fallback.
- `POST /api/v1/auth/password-reset/confirm` - Redeem a single-use reset token (1 h expiry) and set
  a new password. Revokes all refresh tokens.

All of the above sit behind the strict rate-limit tier (10/min). Two more auth endpoints require
authentication and live on the moderate tier:

- `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` - Revoke the caller's refresh tokens (all of them, or just the one in
  the optional `{refresh_token}` body). The JWT itself stays valid until expiry.
- `POST /api/v1/auth/change-password` - Verify the current password, set a new one (same
  complexity policy), and revoke all refresh tokens.

### Users
- `GET /api/v1/users` - List all users *(admin)*
- `POST /api/v1/users` - Create a user with any role *(admin)*
- `GET /api/v1/users/me` - Get current user profile

- `GET /api/v1/users/:id` - Get specific user *(self or admin)*
- `PUT /api/v1/users/:id` - Update user *(self or admin; only admins may change `role` or `is_active`)*
- `DELETE /api/v1/users/:id` - **Erase** user *(admin; cannot delete yourself)*

### Leads *(entire group requires admin or sales)*
- `GET /api/v1/leads` - List leads (`page`, `limit`, `search`, `sort_by`, `sort_order`, `classification`)

- `POST /api/v1/leads/:id/convert` - Convert lead to customer
- `POST /api/v1/leads/bulk/status` - Set the status of up to 100 leads at once, all-or-nothing

- `POST /api/v1/customers` - Create new customer *(admin, sales)*
- `GET /api/v1/customers/:id` - Get specific customer *(admin, sales, support)*
- `PUT /api/v1/customers/:id` - Update customer *(admin, sales)*
- `DELETE /api/v1/customers/:id` - **Erase** customer *(admin; cascades to the lead it came from)*
- `GET /api/v1/customers/:id/tickets` - List that customer's tickets *(a customer-role user may only
  read their own)*
- `GET /api/v1/customers/export` - Download all matching customers as CSV *(admin only — mass PII
  egress; supports `search`, `sort_by`, `sort_order`)*
- `POST /api/v1/customers/:id/assign` - Assign the customer to an active admin or sales user
  *(admin, sales)*

### Companies *(read: admin, sales, support; write: admin, sales; delete: admin)*
- `GET /api/v1/companies` - List companies (`page`, `limit`, `search` over name/domain/industry/city,
  `sort_by` in `id, name, domain, industry, created_at, updated_at` — anything else is 400, `sort_order`);
  `data` is the array, `meta` the pagination
- `POST /api/v1/companies` - Create a company *(domain normalised and unique among live companies → 409;
  `owner_id` must be a live user → 400 `INVALID_REFERENCE`; sales may only own it themselves)*
- `GET /api/v1/companies/:id` - Get a company with its owner and live `customer_count` / `lead_count`
- `PUT /api/v1/companies/:id` - Replace a company's fields *(absent text fields are cleared; `owner_id`
  absent keeps, `0` clears — admin only)*
- `DELETE /api/v1/companies/:id` - Soft-delete a company and clear `company_id` on its leads and
  customers in one transaction *(not an erasure: companies hold no personal data)*
- `GET /api/v1/companies/:id/customers` - The company's customers, paginated
- `GET /api/v1/companies/:id/leads` - The company's leads, paginated *(admin and sales; sales sees only
  its own)*
- Leads and customers accept `company_id` on create and update *(unknown → 400 `INVALID_REFERENCE`;
  on update `0` clears, absent keeps)* and return `company_record` on their detail endpoints. The
  free-text `company` field is independent of the link.
- Companies also report a live `deal_count`, and `GET /api/v1/companies/:id/deals` lists their deals
  *(admin and sales; sales sees only its own)*

### Deals *(admin and sales; sales sees and edits its own deals; delete: admin)*
- `GET /api/v1/deals` - List deals (`page`, `limit`, `search` over title/notes, `stage`, `open=true`,
  `company_id`, `customer_id`, `owner_id` — admin only, sales is always narrowed to itself —
  `sort_by` in `id, title, stage, amount_cents, probability, expected_close_date, closed_at, created_at,
  updated_at`, anything else is 400, `sort_order`); `data` is the array, `meta` the pagination
- `POST /api/v1/deals` - Create a deal *(stage defaults to `qualification`, probability to the stage's
  10/40/70/100/0, currency to the `deals.default_currency` setting; every link must be a live row →
  400 `INVALID_REFERENCE`; `owner_id` defaults to the caller and sales may only own it themselves;
  the first history row is written in the same transaction)*
- `GET /api/v1/deals/pipeline` - The live deals per stage: all five stages in pipeline order, each with
  `count` and `totals` per currency (`amount_cents`, `weighted_cents` = round half up of
  Σ amount × probability / 100, rounded once per stage and currency); `owner_id` (admin only; sales
  is always narrowed to itself) and `company_id` filters
- `GET /api/v1/deals/:id` - Get a deal with its owner, company, customer and lead
- `PUT /api/v1/deals/:id` - Replace a deal's fields *(links: absent keeps, `0` clears; a stage change
  goes through the same rules as the stage endpoint and records history)*
- `POST /api/v1/deals/:id/stage` - Move a deal to a stage `{stage, probability?, lost_reason?}` *(won is
  always 100 and lost 0; `closed_at` set on won/lost and cleared on leaving them; `lost_reason` kept
  only on lost; the same stage again is a 200 that writes nothing)*
- `GET /api/v1/deals/:id/history` - The stage changes, oldest first, with the user who made each
- `DELETE /api/v1/deals/:id` - Soft-delete a deal; its history stays *(admin)*
- `GET /api/v1/customers/:id/deals` - The customer's deals, paginated *(admin and sales; sales sees
  only its own)*

### Tickets
- `GET /api/v1/tickets` - List tickets *(customers cannot list all tickets)*
- `POST /api/v1/tickets` - Create new ticket *(admin, support)*
- `GET /api/v1/tickets/my` - Get current user's tickets
- `GET /api/v1/tickets/:id` - Get specific ticket
- `PUT /api/v1/tickets/:id` - Update ticket *(admin any; support only their own assignments; sales
  is read-only)*
- `DELETE /api/v1/tickets/:id` - Delete ticket *(admin; ordinary soft delete)*
- `POST /api/v1/tickets/bulk/status` - Set the status of up to 100 tickets, all-or-nothing *(admin
  any; support only their assignments; a closed ticket cannot be reopened)*

### Tasks
- `GET /api/v1/tasks` - List tasks *(non-admins see their own)*
- `POST /api/v1/tasks` - Create new task *(admin, support, sales; non-admins may only assign to themselves)*
- `GET /api/v1/tasks/my` - Get current user's tasks
- `GET /api/v1/tasks/upcoming` - Tasks due within `days` (1-90, default 7) *(non-admins see their
  own assignments)*
- `GET /api/v1/tasks/:id` - Get specific task
- `PUT /api/v1/tasks/:id` - Update task *(only admins may reassign)*
- `DELETE /api/v1/tasks/:id` - Delete task *(admin; ordinary soft delete)*
- `POST /api/v1/tasks/bulk/status` - Set the status of up to 100 tasks, all-or-nothing *(non-admins
  only their own assignments; completed tasks cannot change status)*

### API Keys *(always scoped to the caller's own keys — no admin override)*
- `GET /api/v1/api-keys` - List user's API keys
- `POST /api/v1/api-keys` - Create new API key (optional RFC3339 `expires_at`; the plaintext key is
  returned only in this response)

- `PUT /api/v1/api-keys/:id` - Rename, deactivate or reactivate a key
- `DELETE /api/v1/api-keys/:id` - Revoke API key (marks inactive; the row is kept)

Keys authenticate via `Authorization: ApiKey gcrm_xxx`. A key is rejected if it is inactive or
expired, or if its owner has been deactivated or erased.

### Configuration
- `GET /api/v1/configurations/ui` - Get UI-safe configurations *(any authenticated user)*
- `GET /api/v1/configurations` - List all configurations *(admin)*
- `GET /api/v1/configurations/category/:category` - Get configurations by category *(admin)*
- `GET /api/v1/configurations/:key` - Get specific configuration *(admin)*
- `PUT /api/v1/configurations/:key` - Update configuration value *(admin)*
- `POST /api/v1/configurations/:key/reset` - Reset configuration to default *(admin)*

### Dashboard *(entire group requires admin, sales or support)*
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/stats` - Aggregate counts (total leads, customers, open tickets, pending tasks, conversion rate)
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/leads-by-status` / `tickets-by-priority` / `tasks-by-status` - Grouped
  counts in a chart-friendly `{labels, datasets}` shape
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/sales-performance?period=week|month|quarter|year` - Lead conversions over
  time, bucketed per period
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/activities` - Recent activity feed synthesized from lead/ticket/task events
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/upcoming-tasks` - Due-soonest tasks, including overdue *(non-admins see
  their own)*
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/recent-tickets` - Newest tickets
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/new-leads` - Newest leads *(sales sees only their own; support gets an
  empty list)*
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/pipeline` - The deal pipeline per stage (as `GET /deals/pipeline`) plus
  `won_this_month` (count and amounts per currency of the deals won in the current calendar month,
  UTC) *(admin sees all deals, sales its own; support and customer get 403 — no deal access)*

### Not currently exposed

The generic `/bulk/:resource` create/update/delete/action handlers in
`internal/handler/bulk_handler.go` remain unrouted; only the entity-specific `bulk/status`
endpoints listed above are reachable over HTTP.

A generated Swagger 2.0 spec is checked in at `api/swagger.json` / `api/swagger.yaml`. It is built
from swag annotations on the handlers — regenerate it with `make swagger` after changing a handler
or route. The spec is **not** served by the application; `internal/handler/routes.go` remains the
routing source of truth.

## Known Limitations

- **Access tokens cannot be revoked before expiry.** Logout and the refresh-token rotation revoke
  the *refresh* tokens, but an already-issued JWT stays valid until `JWT_EXPIRY_HOURS` elapses —
  there is no token blocklist.
- **Password-reset email needs SMTP configuration.** Without `SMTP_HOST` set, reset links go to the
  application log (redacted) instead of a mailbox — fine for development, useless in production.
- **CSRF middleware is not wired.** `internal/middleware/csrf.go` implements HMAC-SHA256 tokens with
  a 24h expiry and is unit-tested, but `cmd/main.go` never installs it, so no route currently
  requires a CSRF token.
- **Rate limiting does not distinguish reads from writes on authenticated routes.**
  `RateLimitModerate` (120/min, burst 30) is applied once to the whole protected group in
  `setupDependencies` (`cmd/main.go`) and covers reads and writes alike.
  `RateLimitStrict` (10/min, burst 5) guards the `/auth`
  group and, via `SetupFormPublicRoutes`, the public form submit and confirm routes;
  `RateLimitGenerous` (240/min, burst 40) is applied only to the public form *reads*
  (`embed.js`, the definition and the hosted view). `DISABLE_RATE_LIMIT=true` bypasses the strict
  tier alone — the check lives inside `RateLimitStrict` — so the moderate tier still applies to
  test traffic.
- **Bulk endpoints are unrouted** (see *Not currently exposed* above).
- **Erasure does not reach logs or issued tokens.** Application logs record the email address on
  login and on customer create/update, and issued JWTs embed it until they expire. Log retention
  needs its own policy alongside database erasure.
- **ESLint reports 40 errors and 137 warnings** in the frontend, mostly unused Playwright fixture
  arguments and `any` types. `tsc` is clean.

## Contributing

Read [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) first — it documents the layering and the patterns
the codebase enforces (unified response envelope, sentinel errors, sort allowlists, role assignment
rules, erasure-on-delete). Then:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
