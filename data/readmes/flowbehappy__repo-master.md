# Repo-Master (deephack)

Feishu bot that answers TiDB-related questions using chat context, TiDB.ai (docs-backed), and (optionally) local repo code/documents.

## Setup

1) Install deps

```bash
npm install
```

2) Configure env

- Option A: set env vars (recommended for deployment)
  - `APP_ID`/`APP_SECRET` take precedence over TOML.
- Option B: set `app_id`/`app_secret` in a per-instance TOML config file (do not commit secrets).

Create `.env` (or export env vars) based on `.env.example`.

3) Feishu developer console

- Enable **Bot** capability for the app.
- Use **long connection (WebSocket)** event receiving.
- Subscribe to `im.message.receive_v1`.
- Ensure permissions for history and group messages (typical):
  - `im:message.history:readonly`
  - `im:message.group_msg` (required to read group history)
- For progress updates (patching the “working…” card in place):
  - `im:message:update`
- For image understanding (downloading message resources):
  - `im:resource`

## Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Run with a config file (multiple instances)

You can run multiple bot instances on the same machine by giving each one its own TOML config:

```bash
npm run dev -- --config ./examples/myrepo.toml
```

Or after building:

```bash
npm run build
node dist/index.js --config ./examples/myrepo.toml
```

Or use the wrapper script (make it executable once):

```bash
chmod +x ./repo-master
./repo-master --config ./examples/myrepo.toml
```

### OpenAI config (Codex-style)

In the TOML config you can configure an OpenAI-compatible provider:

- `[openai]`
  - `model_provider` (e.g. `crs`)
  - `model` (e.g. `gpt-5.2`)
  - `model_reasoning_effort` (`low|medium|high|xlow|xhigh`; when using real OpenAI, `xlow/xhigh` map to `low/high`)
- `[openai.model_providers.<provider>]`
  - `base_url` (e.g. `https://right.codes/codex/v1`)
- API key: set `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable (recommended) or as a TOML top-level key.

### TiDB.ai config (optional)

Repo-Master can use `https://tidb.ai/` as an additional knowledge source for TiDB ecosystem questions.
It does not do general web search/browsing; TiDB.ai is the only external knowledge source.

- TOML: `[tidb_ai] enabled`, `base_url`, `timeout_ms`, `max_context_chars`, `max_sources`, `chat_engine`
- Env: `TIDB_AI_ENABLED`, `TIDB_AI_BASE_URL`, `TIDB_AI_TIMEOUT_MS`, `TIDB_AI_MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS`, `TIDB_AI_MAX_SOURCES`, `TIDB_AI_CHAT_ENGINE`

Notes:
- The bot may send the user’s question (and sometimes a small amount of chat context) to TiDB.ai to retrieve relevant docs-backed information.
- The final answer is produced by the bot model, which rewrites and sanity-checks TiDB.ai results and cross-checks against repo context when available.
- If TiDB.ai is unavailable (timeout/network/etc.), Repo-Master still answers without TiDB.ai context and shows a short warning in the reply.

### Vision config (optional)

If you want the bot to understand image messages, configure:

- TOML: `[vision] max_images`, `max_image_bytes`, `image_detail = "low"|"high"|"auto"`
- Env: `VISION_MAX_IMAGES`, `VISION_MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`, `VISION_IMAGE_DETAIL`

### Repo config (optional)

You can configure local code repos so Repo-Master can answer repo-specific questions with `path:line` citations.

**Recommended (named repos + optional branches):**

```toml
[repo.pd] # default: master
path = "/data/nvme0n1/github/pd"

[repo.ticdc.master]
path = "/data/nvme0n1/github/ticdc_master"

[repo.ticdc.v8.5]
path = "/data/nvme0n1/github/ticdc_v8.5"

[repo]
search_workers = 4
search_queue_max = 100
```

Repo-Master uses the repo names (e.g. `ticdc`, `pd`) and branch labels (e.g. `master`, `v8.5`) to pick the right repo(s) automatically (e.g. “CDC issue” → `ticdc`).

Notes for TiDB ecosystem repos:
- CDC: new architecture code starts from v8.5 in `ticdc`; older CDC (and DM) code lives in `tiflow`. Configure both if you need to answer questions across versions/architectures.

**Legacy (still supported):**

- TOML: `[repo] paths = ["/path/to/pd", "/path/to/ticdc"]` or `[repo] path = "/path/to/ticdc"`
- Env: `REPO_PATHS=/path/to/pd,/path/to/ticdc` or `REPO_PATH=/path/to/ticdc`

## Behavior

- `p2p`: replies to every user message.
- `group`: replies only when user `@deephack`.
- Identity: calls itself **Repo Master** (mention name may differ).
- Persona: a TiDB question assistant; answers are intentionally concise.
- Message types:
  - `text` and `post`: extracted to plain text.
  - `image` (and images embedded in `post`): downloaded and sent to a vision-capable model for understanding.
- History: first tries to answer from the latest message; if more context is needed → thread: all messages, otherwise: last 20 messages.
- Reply: interactive card, falling back to text on errors.
- Progress: sends a “Working on it…” card quickly and patch-updates it as work completes, then replaces it with the final answer.
- Research: may query TiDB.ai and scan repo(s) multiple times; if critical details are missing it asks 1–3 targeted questions.
- Repo awareness: if the message looks code-related and repos are configured, the bot selects the most relevant repo(s) (e.g. CDC → `ticdc`) and scans them; legacy `REPO_PATHS` / `[repo].paths` still works.
- Concurrency: repo scanning runs in a worker-thread pool (config: `REPO_SEARCH_WORKERS` / `[repo].search_workers`) with a bounded queue (`REPO_SEARCH_QUEUE_MAX` / `[repo].search_queue_max`).
- TiDB.ai: if the message is TiDB-related and not repo-code-specific, the bot queries TiDB.ai and includes its docs-backed context + URLs.
- TiDB.ai failures: if TiDB.ai queries fail, the bot proceeds without TiDB.ai and surfaces the failure as a note in the answer.
