## What it is

Moneta is a budgeting app in the spirit of YNAB and Actual Budget. You give every unit of
income a job: money lands in **Ready to Assign**, you move it into category envelopes, and
spending draws those envelopes down. When an envelope runs dry, you decide where the money
comes from, instead of finding out at the end of the month.

It runs entirely in your browser. There is no server, no account and no tracking: your
budget is a SQLite database stored on your device, and it stays there. Install it as an app
and it works offline, on your phone or your computer.

**[Try the demo](https://usemoneta.netlify.app)**: it opens a year of sample data, and
nothing you do there is saved. The **[user guide](https://usemoneta.netlify.app/guide/)**
explains how to budget with it, screen by screen.

## Features

- **Zero-based envelope budget.** Income lands in Ready to Assign and you spread it across
  categories, organized in groups. Groups, categories and accounts can wear an emoji from the
  whole Unicode set. Overspending carries over per category, and quick-assign
  fills a month for you: same as last month, the average spent over 3, 6 or 12 months, cover
  overspending, or clear.
- **Accounts and transactions.** Budget and tracking accounts, credit cards whose payments
  don't touch the budget, split transactions, transfers between accounts, and payees you can
  rename everywhere, merge, and give a default category. Select several transactions to set
  their category or date, clear or delete them at once, and undo a deletion, a money move or an
  import right after.
- **Bank statements.** Import OFX and CSV statements: lines you already entered are matched
  instead of doubled, a statement imported twice adds nothing, and each payee's usual category
  comes back by itself. Reconcile an account against the bank's balance to lock what was
  checked.
- **Scheduled transactions.** One-off, daily, weekly, monthly or yearly, with a rule for dates
  that fall on a weekend. They are entered by themselves or with a tap, and each account shows
  what is coming in the next 30 days.
- **Reports.** Spending by category and by payee, net worth, cash flow, spending trends,
  assets and debts by account, and Age of Money, on an overview whose cards you can reorder
  and hide.
- **Your data, on your device.** Several budgets side by side, backups in a single `.moneta`
  file (encrypted if you want), CSV and JSON exports, and automatic encrypted backups to your
  own Google Drive.
- **Made for every screen.** A phone layout with a bottom bar and sheets, a desktop layout
  with a sidebar and dialogs, light and dark themes, and ten accent colors.

The whole app is in English and Brazilian Portuguese.

## Where your data lives

Each budget is one SQLite file in your browser's private storage for the site (the Origin
Private File System). Nothing leaves your device unless you turn on automatic backups, and
then only encrypted.

Because the budget lives in the browser's storage, **clearing the site's data deletes it.**
Keep a backup somewhere you control.

### Backups

**Settings → Backup** saves every budget into one `.moneta` file in your downloads, and
restores the budgets you pick from one. Moneta reminds you when your last backup is more than
two weeks old.

- A `.moneta` file is a ZIP: `moneta.json` describes it, and `budgets/` holds each budget's
  SQLite file. Older `.sqlite` backups still restore.
- Restoring a budget that is already on the device replaces it, and keeps what it held as a
  saved copy.
- Before an update changes a budget's format, Moneta saves a copy of the old file (the last
  three), so an upgrade is never a one-way door.

### Encrypted backups

Turn on **Encrypt backups** to protect the files themselves. You pick a password and get a
recovery key to keep apart from your backups.

- Backing up never asks for anything: Moneta keeps the encryption key on the device.
  Restoring asks for the password or the recovery key.
- An encrypted `.moneta` holds only the encryption settings in `moneta.json`, and the whole
  backup, encrypted with AES-256-GCM, in `payload.bin`. The key comes from the password
  through PBKDF2-SHA256, or from the recovery key through HKDF.
- Lose both the password and the recovery key and nobody can open those backups, Moneta
  included.

### Automatic backups to Google Drive

Connect your Google Drive once, and Moneta saves an encrypted backup of every budget to a
Moneta folder there by itself.

- It backs up two minutes after changes stop, when you switch away with a change waiting, and
  at start when the last backup is a day old. It runs only while Moneta is open.
- Each device keeps one file per day, its newest and the five days before it, and deletes the
  older ones.
- Cloud backups are always encrypted, so it asks you to turn encryption on first. Restoring
  from Drive on another device asks for the password or the recovery key.
- Moneta can see only the files it created in your Drive.

## Run your own copy

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 24 or newer and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) 12 or newer.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build          # static build into ./build
pnpm preview        # serve that build at http://localhost:4173
```

`build/` is a plain static site: no server code, and no COOP/COEP headers needed. To host it:

- Use a host that serves `index.html` for unknown paths.
- Serve it from the root of a domain: the service worker that makes it work offline is
  registered at `/`.
- Give Moneta an origin of its own. Any other app on the same origin can read its storage
  (OPFS, IndexedDB, localStorage), budgets included.

### Security headers (optional)

The Content-Security-Policy ships inside `index.html` as a `<meta>` tag, so the page is
restricted on any host. A meta tag doesn't reach everything, though: workers follow the
headers of their own scripts, and only a header can forbid framing. If your host lets you set
headers, send:

- a Content-Security-Policy for the workers (`/_app/immutable/workers/*` and `/sw.js`);
- `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'` for everything else;
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`;
- `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=()`.

`netlify.toml` has them all, along with the `index.html` fallback rule. The page's own policy
can't be repeated there, since its script hashes change with every build.

### Backups to Google Drive (optional)

Automatic backups to Google Drive need one small serverless function,
`netlify/functions/oauth-token.mts`. Google gives a browser app only one-hour tokens unless
the token request carries the OAuth client secret, and that secret must not ship in the app.
The function adds it to the two token requests Moneta makes (signing in, and renewing the
hour-long token) and stores nothing: the long-lived token stays on the device, and backups go
from the browser straight to Drive. Without `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` in the build the option
doesn't appear, so any static host still works.

1. In the Google Cloud console, create a project, enable the **Google Drive API** and set up
   the OAuth consent screen with the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` scope.
   Publish it (**In production**): while it is in Testing, sign-ins expire after seven days.
   `drive.file` is a non-sensitive scope, so Google doesn't need to review the app.
2. Create an OAuth client of type **Web application**, with your site as an authorized
   JavaScript origin and `https://<your site>/oauth/callback` as a redirect URI.
3. In the Netlify site's environment variables, set `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` (the client id:
   public, read by the build and the function) and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (read only by the
   function), then deploy again.

To try it locally, put both in `.env` (see `.env.example`), run `npx netlify dev`, and add its
address (`http://localhost:8888`) to the client's origins and redirect URIs.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev            # dev server at http://localhost:5173
pnpm dev --open     # …and open it in the browser
```

| Command                  | What it does                                    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`               | Dev server at http://localhost:5173             |
| `pnpm build`             | Static production build into `./build`          |
| `pnpm guide`             | Write the user guide into `./build/guide`       |
| `pnpm guide:screenshots` | Retake the guide's screenshots from the demo    |
| `pnpm preview`           | Serve `./build` like a static host would        |
| `pnpm test`              | All unit tests once (Vitest, Node)              |
| `pnpm test:unit`         | The same tests in watch mode                    |
| `pnpm test:e2e`          | Build, then run Playwright in Chromium          |
| `pnpm lint`              | Prettier check + ESLint                         |
| `pnpm check`             | Type-check with svelte-check                    |
| `pnpm format`            | Fix formatting with Prettier                    |
| `pnpm i18n`              | Compile the Paraglide messages                  |
| `pnpm bench`             | Time the budget recompute on a large budget     |
| `pnpm icons`             | Regenerate the PWA icons from `static/icon.svg` |

Unit and integration tests run in Node with Vitest; the database tests use a real in-memory
SQLite, the same WASM build the app ships. End-to-end tests in `e2e/` run the production build
in Chromium:

```sh
pnpm exec playwright install chromium   # first time only
pnpm test:e2e
```

On a fresh Linux or WSL machine Chromium may fail to start because system libraries are
missing (for example `libnspr4.so`). Install them once from a regular terminal:

```sh
sudo pnpm exec playwright install-deps chromium
```

### Translations

UI text lives in `src/core/i18n/messages/en.json` and `pt-BR.json`, and
[Paraglide](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs) compiles it into
`src/core/i18n/paraglide/` (generated, not committed). `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build` and `pnpm check`
compile it for you; `pnpm i18n` does it on its own. The first compile downloads Paraglide's
message-format plugins from jsDelivr, so it needs a network connection once.

### The user guide

The guide at `/guide/` is written in Markdown, in `guide/content/en/` and
`guide/content/pt-BR/`, with the same pages and section ids in both. `pnpm build` turns it into
plain HTML (no JavaScript) after the app's own build, so the service worker never precaches it:
it is fetched from the host only when someone opens it, and an offline app can't show it.
`pnpm dev` serves it from the Markdown at http://localhost:5173/guide/, so an edit shows on
reload. Its screenshots in `guide/img/` come from the demo, in both languages and themes:
`pnpm guide:screenshots` takes them again after a change to one of those screens.

## About the name

[Moneta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneta) was a Roman goddess, an epithet of Juno as
protector of the city's funds. Her name comes from the Latin verb _monere_, "to remind, to
warn, to advise", and Romans honored her as the advisor who would see they never lacked
money as long as they stayed just. Money was coined in her temple, which is how her name
became the word for coinage itself: _money_ and _mint_ in English, _moeda_ in Portuguese and
_moneda_ in Spanish all trace back to her.

A budgeting app that reminds you where your money is meant to go seemed a fitting namesake.
