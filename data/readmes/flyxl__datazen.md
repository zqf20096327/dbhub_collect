## Why DataZen?

DataZen is a desktop database workspace built with **Tauri + Rust**. It keeps the everyday database loop in one place: connect, understand, change, and automate data.

- **Query** — write SQL, browse schemas, edit data, inspect ER diagrams, and work with Redis keys.
- **Diagnose** — generate SQL from natural language, explain errors, inspect EXPLAIN plans, and use safe read-only connections.
- **Visualize** — turn results into charts, export them, and build saved Ops Dashboards with refresh, history, and alerts.
- **Move data** — back up databases, sync same-family databases, transfer between different systems, or review and deploy schema changes.
- **Automate** — compose queries, AI steps, conditions, and loops in YAML Workflows; run the same capabilities from the UI, MCP, or headless mode.
- **Privacy-aware** — AI requests go only to the provider you configure.
- **Open source and extensible** — GPLv3 application, community Driver API, sandboxed Workspace Apps, and host extension points.

## Get started in three minutes

1. [Download DataZen](https://flyxl.github.io/datazen/download.html) — get the installer matched to your platform.
2. Open a local SQLite file or create a PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, or Redis connection.
3. Browse the schema, write a query or ask AI to generate one, then run it and switch the result to a chart.

No account is required. AI is optional: regular database browsing and querying work without an API key.

## One workspace, four database jobs

| Job | What DataZen brings together |
|---|---|
| **Understand** | SQL editor, schema browser, ER diagrams, query history, charts, and Redis tools |
| **Fix** | AI diagnosis, EXPLAIN analysis, read-only connections, SQL safety gates, and transaction-aware editing |
| **Move** | Backup, Data Sync, Data Transfer, and Schema Diff with reviewable plans |
| **Automate** | YAML Workflows, Ops Dashboards, MCP Server/Client, and headless `--mcp-stdio` mode |

## A database workspace built around real workflows

### SQL and data exploration

Write and run SQL in a modern editor, inspect results, browse tables, and move between query results and visualizations without leaving DataZen.

### Editor Pro — a smarter SQL editor

The **Basic** and **All** release packages include **SQL Editor Pro**, which adds deep database-aware editing features beyond basic syntax highlighting. A **Community** source build (see [Build from source](#build-from-source)) uses the built-in basic editor without the Pro extension. Driver selection (Basic / All) and editor edition (Community / Pro) are separate choices.

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Statement gutter** | Run any single statement from a multi-statement script independently |
| **Smart autocomplete** | Table, column, and keyword completions driven by live schema metadata |
| **Hover tooltips** | See column types, comments, and table structure on hover |
| **Signature help** | Inline function parameter hints while typing |
| **SQL linter** | Real-time syntax and semantic error feedback |
| **Intentions (Alt+Enter)** | Context-aware quick fixes and refactoring suggestions |
| **Transaction controls** | Auto-commit toggle and manual commit / rollback in the toolbar |
| **Paste as IN clause** | Automatically convert pasted CSV values into `IN (...)` expressions |
| **Format SQL** | One-click consistent code formatting |

### AI-assisted database work

DataZen puts AI next to the database instead of making you copy schema and errors into another application.

![AI natural-language SQL](site/assets/screenshots/03-ai-nl2sql.png)

**Natural language → SQL**

Describe what you need and DataZen uses the current database schema as context to generate executable SQL. Generated SQL can be executed immediately or inserted into the editor for further editing.

![AI error diagnosis](site/assets/screenshots/05-ai-diagnosis.png)

**SQL error diagnosis**

When a query fails, AI can combine the database error and schema context to explain the problem and propose corrected SQL.

![AI EXPLAIN analysis](site/assets/screenshots/06-ai-explain.png)

**EXPLAIN analysis**

Visualize execution plans and use AI to identify bottlenecks, scan strategies, and optimization opportunities.

![AI Chat](site/assets/screenshots/07-ai-chat.png)

**Database-aware AI Chat**

The AI sidebar can work with the current connection's schema and turn SQL from the conversation into editor-ready code.

Supported AI integrations include OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and compatible custom endpoints.

## Turn query results into charts

You should not need to export data to Excel just to understand it. DataZen can infer useful chart configurations from query results and switch between table and chart views.

![Chart types](site/assets/screenshots/10-chart-types.png)

Supported visualizations include line, bar, pie, scatter, and area charts, with aggregation, grouping, and PNG/SVG export.

![Chart export](site/assets/screenshots/11-chart-export.png)

## Move and monitor data safely

DataZen keeps data operations explicit and reviewable instead of hiding them behind a one-click promise.

- **Data Sync** compares and synchronizes rows between same-family databases when structure and primary keys match.
- **Data Transfer** moves structure and/or data between heterogeneous databases through a mapping and preview workflow.
- **Schema Diff** compares database structure and produces a controlled DDL deployment plan.
- **Ops Dashboards** refresh saved queries, retain run history, and surface threshold alerts.

![Data Sync — source and target selection (English UI)](site/assets/screenshots/26-data-sync-en.png)

## Automate database work with Workflows

DataZen Workflows describe reusable database operations in YAML. A workflow can combine queries, AI steps, conditions, and loops, with each step connected to the database it needs.

![Workflow editor](site/assets/screenshots/04-workflow.png)

For example, one workflow can query orders from PostgreSQL, fetch logistics from MySQL, and let AI summarize the combined result.

![Cross-database workflow](site/assets/screenshots/12-workflow-crossdb.png)

Workflows can be started from the UI, the AI sidebar, MCP, or generated with AI.

## MCP: connect DataZen to the AI tool ecosystem

DataZen works both as an **MCP Server** and an **MCP Client**.

### MCP Server

Expose database operations, schema inspection, EXPLAIN, and workflows to external AI agents. DataZen also provides a headless stdio mode for automation and agent integrations.

### MCP Client

Connect external MCP servers to DataZen AI Chat and bring additional tools and context into database conversations.

DataZen is more than a GUI: it can also serve as a database tool inside larger AI-assisted development workflows.

## Extensible database drivers

DataZen separates the application from database-specific implementation through the **DataZen Driver API**.

```

Drivers are **compiled into DataZen** rather than loaded through an unstable Rust dynamic-library ABI. This allows a driver to provide both Rust database functionality and frontend UI while still remaining in its own repository.

### Independent driver development

A driver can be developed in an independent repository next to a local DataZen checkout:

```text
workspace/
├── datazen/
└── datazen-driver-mydb/
```

During development, DataZen's driver registry can point to the local repository with `source: "path"`. The DataZen application is then built with the selected driver, giving plugin developers a real host for both backend and frontend debugging.

The Driver API itself is maintained in `packages/driver-api` and published as the MIT-licensed `datazen-driver-api` crate. Independent drivers normally consume the published crate and do not need to clone DataZen just to obtain the API.

See the complete guides:

- **[Independent Driver Development — English](docs/development/independent-driver-development.en.md)**
- **[独立驱动开发指南 — 中文](docs/development/independent-driver-development.zh-CN.md)**
- **[Driver API crate README](packages/driver-api/README.md)**
- **[Driver API dependency boundary](docs/development/driver-api-dependency-boundary.md)**
- **[datazen-driver-api on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/datazen-driver-api)**

## Supported databases

DataZen ships with a small default set and can be built with additional drivers.

| Database | Default / optional | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL | Basic | SQL, schema browser, EXPLAIN, AI context |
| MySQL / MariaDB | Basic | SQL, schema browser, EXPLAIN |
| SQLite | Basic | Embedded database workflow |
| Redis | Basic | Key browser, command console, monitoring, Pub/Sub |
| MongoDB | `all` | Native driver |
| ClickHouse | `all` | Native driver |
| DuckDB | `all` | Native driver |
| SQL Server | `all` | Native driver |
| Additional path drivers (e.g. Elasticsearch, Turso, InfluxDB) | `all` | See `drivers-registry.json` for the full list |
| Kiwi / OLAP / Superset and other Git drivers | Custom list | Not covered by `all`; add explicitly, e.g. `--drivers=basic,kiwi,superset` |

`basic` (the four core drivers) and `all` (all registered path drivers, excluding Git drivers) are build presets; the exact driver set is controlled at build time, so a distribution does not have to ship every database engine.

**More external drivers are being planned.** We are exploring support for database drivers implemented and integrated in languages such as Go, C++, Rust, and Java.

## Installation

Get the latest platform-matched installer from **[Download DataZen](https://flyxl.github.io/datazen/download.html)**. You can also browse **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/flyxl/datazen/releases)** directly.

| Platform | Package |
|---|---|
| macOS Apple Silicon | `.dmg` |
| macOS Intel | `.dmg` |
| Windows | NSIS `.exe` / portable `.zip` |
| Linux x86_64 | `.deb` / `.rpm` / `.AppImage` |

DataZen is free and does not require an account.

**macOS Gatekeeper:** If the app is blocked as damaged or from an unidentified developer, clear quarantine: `xattr -cr /Applications/DataZen.app`, or right-click → Open once. See [packaging.md](docs/development/packaging.md) for details and the notarization checklist.

Optional drivers (MongoDB, ClickHouse, DuckDB, SQL Server, …) are compile-time selections — see [optional-drivers.md](docs/development/optional-drivers.md).

## Build from source

### Prerequisites

- Node **24**, pnpm **11**, and Rust **stable** (the CI-tested toolchain)
- [Tauri v2 system dependencies](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [CI & test matrix](docs/development/ci-test-matrix.md) for development details. The commands below explicitly select Community so a public-source build does not require the separate Pro extension.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri:dev --edition=community --drivers=basic
```

Build only the drivers you need:

```bash
# Community with the four core drivers
pnpm tauri:build:community --drivers=basic

# Community with all registered path drivers (not Git drivers)
pnpm tauri:build:community --drivers=all

# Community with a custom driver set
pnpm tauri:build:community --drivers=postgres,mongodb
```

## Security and privacy

DataZen is designed around database access:

- AI requests are sent to the provider configured by the user.
- SSH connections can be established directly from the application.

Always review the privacy and security policies of the AI provider and endpoint you configure.
