BinWatch is a tool designed to subscribe to a MySQL database's binlog and track changes that occur in database tables.
These changes are processed and sent to supported connectors in real-time.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this tool stems from the need for a system that allows simple, real-time tracking of changes in
a MySQL database without requiring complex external tools that might complicate the process.

We use the [go-mysql](https://github.com/go-mysql-org/go-mysql) library to read MySQL binlogs, exactly the
[replication](https://github.com/go-mysql-org/go-mysql/tree/master/replication) library of this reposiotory. This library enables us
to monitor MySQL binlogs and capture changes occurring in database tables.

## Configuration

> [!NOTE]
> You can use environment variables in the configuration file. The environment variables must be written in the
> format `${ENV:<VAR_NAME>}$`. The environment variables will be replaced by their values in the initialzation.

## Standalone

This service is designed to be executed as a single instance.
Adding replication would cause the binlogs sent to lose their
order, which is crucial for this tool to function correctly.
Additionally, replication would negatively impact performance,
as the service would need to spend time synchronizing with
other replicas continuously. No standalone approach also
increases the risk of losing binlogs during the replicas
synchronization process.

### Cache

The cache can be enabled to ensure that, in the event of a
sudden stop, the instance can resume from where it left off.
This cache is updated with the binlog position after each
binlog is sent.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The config field `source.startLocation` overwrite the cache
> binlog location in the initialization. Remove this field from
> the configuration to use the cache location.

## Running BinWatch

For running binwatch you need to create a configuration file and run the binary with the configuration file as a parameter.

```shell
go run cmd/main.go sync --config config.yaml
```

## Deployment

We recommend to deploy BinWatch application with our [Helm registry](https://freepik-company.github.io/binwatch/).

```cmd
helm repo add binwatch https://freepik-company.github.io/binwatch/
```

```cmd
helm install binwatch binwatch/binwatch
