# PgLargeObjects

An Elixir library for working with [large
objects](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/largeobjects.html) in
PostgreSQL databases.

## Features

* Easy and memory-efficient streaming of large amounts of data (up to 4TB)
  using `PgLargeObjects` high-level API.
* Random-access reads and writes to data objects via low-level
  `PgLargeObjects.LargeObject` API.
* Extensions to Ecto query DSL for interacting with large objects as part of
  Ecto queries.
* Ready-made implementation of `Phoenix.LiveView.UploadWriter` for streaming
  client uploads straight into the database.

## Why Use Large Objects?

An application wishing to store larger amounts of data typically has two
options for doing so:

1. A new column on some table can be introduced; Postgres features a `bytea`
   type for this purpose. This is easy to implement but suffers from requiring
   to hold the complete data in memory when reading or writing, something which
   may not be viable beyond a few dozen megabytes. Efficient streaming or
   random-access operations are not practical.
2. A separate cloud storage (e.g. AWS S3) could be used. This permits streaming
   but requires complicating the tech stack by depending on a new service.
   Bridging the two systems (e.g. ‘Delete all uploads for a given user ID’)
    requires custom application code.

PostgreSQL features a ‘large objects’ facility which enables efficient
streaming access to large (up to 4TB) files. This solves these problems:

1. Unlike values in table columns, large objects can be streamed into/out of
   the database and permit random access operations.
2. Unlike e.g. S3, no new technology is needed. Large objects live side-by-side
   with the tables referencing them, operations like ‘Delete all uploads for a
   given user ID’ are just one `SELECT` statement.

However, there are trade-offs. See the [Considerations](CONSIDERATIONS.md)
document for aspects to take into account when deciding if large objects
are a good choice for your use case.

## Installation

Install the package by adding `pg_large_objects` to your list of dependencies
in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:pg_large_objects, "~> 0.1"}
  ]
end
```

Optional, but recommended: include `PgLargeObjects.Repo` in your `Ecto.Repo`
module to define convenience API:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Repo do
  use Ecto.Repo,
    otp_app: :my_app,
    adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Postgres

  use PgLargeObjects.Repo
end
```

## Database Configuration

Large objects are referenced by object IDs, modelled using the `oid` type in
PostgreSQL. `Ecto.Migration` has support for this type built-in, e.g.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Repo.Migrations.CreateUploadsTable do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def change do
    create table(:uploads) do
      add :user_id, references(:users), null: false
      add :object_id, :oid, null: false

      timestamps()
    end
  end
end
```

In the Ecto schema, use plain `:integer` fields for object IDs:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Upload do
  use Ecto.Schema

  schema "uploads" do
    belongs_to :user, MyApp.User
    field :object_id, :integer

    timestamps()
  end
end
```

## Usage

Use the high-level APIs `PgLargeObjects.import/3` and `PgLargeObjects.export/3`
(exposed as `import_large_object/2` and `export_large_object/2` on the
 application's repository module) for importing data into or exporting data out
of the database:

```elixir
# Import binary into large object
{:ok, object_id} = Repo.import_large_object("My payload.")

# Stream data into large object
{:ok, object_id} =
  "/tmp/recording.mov"
  |> File.stream!()
  |> Repo.import_large_object()

# ...store object_id somewhere to maintain reference to data.
```

```elixir
# Export binary from large object
{:ok, data} = Repo.export_large_object(object_id)

# Stream data of large object into Collectable
stream = File.stream!("/tmp/recording.mov")
:ok = Repo.export_large_object(object_id, into: stream)
```

Use the lower-level API in `PgLargeObjects.LargeObject` to interact with
individual object files on a more granular level.
