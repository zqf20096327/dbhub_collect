## 🚀 About The Project

This project is an **End-to-End AI-powered Personal Finance Management System** designed to bridge the gap between daily habit tracking and high-level data visualization. 

Architected for seamless user experience, it integrates a **LINE messaging chatbot** with Google's **Gemini LLM** to process natural language accounting inputs. The parsed data is persistently stored in a cloud-based **TiDB (MySQL)** database and visualized through an interactive, Morandi-themed **Streamlit** dashboard.

This tool goes beyond simple expense logging by offering **AI-driven burn rate projections**, multi-currency dynamic budgeting, and dual-axis financial modeling.

## ✨ Key Features & Business Value

* 🧠 **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Entry:** Users can input daily expenses via LINE casually (e.g., "Bought a coffee for 5 CAD"). The Gemini LLM automatically categorizes the item, extracts the amount, and identifies the currency.
* 📈 **Dynamic Burn Rate Projection:** Uses real-time data to calculate the daily burn rate and project month-end expenses, providing early warnings if the projected spend exceeds the budget threshold.
* 💱 **Multi-Currency Budgeting System:** Implemented a stateful architecture allowing users to set, save, and retrieve specific budgets for different currencies (e.g., CAD, TWD, EUR) persistently from the database.
* 🎨 **Interactive Dual-Axis Combo Charts:** Designed professional, Morandi-themed Plotly charts that overlay discrete daily events (Bar chart) against continuous cumulative trends (Line chart) to prevent visual distortion and scaling issues.
