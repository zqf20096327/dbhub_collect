</div>

---

rm-brain quietly syncs the notebooks you drop into a **Brain** folder on your reMarkable,
transcribes and classifies the handwriting with the Claude API, and stores everything in a
local SQLite database. You then **search and explore your notes as an ordinary conversation
in Claude Desktop** — no separate app, no hosted service, using your existing Claude
subscription.

> **You:** *"What did I decide about the Acme pricing model?"*
> **Claude:** *Pulls it from your notes and answers with receipts — notebook name, page
> number, date, and the scanned page.*

It's designed to feel less like a search box and more like a system that quietly organizes
itself and surfaces things you forgot about.

## Why it's different

- **Your handwriting, actually understood.** Claude vision transcribes messy handwriting and
  diagrams far better than built-in OCR, and classifies each page (journal / meeting / idea /
  decision / …), extracts people & projects, and flags open loops.
- **The interface is a conversation, not a dashboard.** Search happens inside Claude Desktop
  via [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) — you get a world-class chat UI for free.
- **Local-first and private by design.** The database, page images, and manifest never leave
  your machine. See [Privacy](#-privacy--safety).
- **Answers with receipts.** Every answer cites the notebook, page number, and date, and can
  show you the scanned page — so you verify, not trust blindly.

The MCP server speaks the open [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), so any
MCP-capable assistant can use your notes — Claude Desktop (the primary, best-tested target),
ChatGPT, Gemini, and others. See [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md).

reMarkable notebooks are stored as proprietary `.rm` v6 vector files (not PDFs), so pages are
rendered with [`rmc`](https://github.com/ricklupton/rmc) + `rsvg-convert`. See
[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full design.

## 🔒 Privacy & safety

- **Local-first, always.** `db.sqlite`, page images, and the manifest live in one folder
  (`~/.rm-brain` by default) and never leave your machine as a whole.
- **The only things that ever go over the network** are (a) individual page images sent to the
  Claude API during `sync`, and (b) individual queries + retrieved snippets sent through MCP
  while you search in Claude Desktop.
- **Opt-in by folder.** Nothing is indexed unless you put the notebook in your Brain folder.
- **The folder is the source of truth.** Remove a notebook from it and the next `sync` prunes
  it from your local index — pages and images included.
- **Hard exclusion always wins.** A notebook whose name matches `/^\./`, `/private/i`, or
  `/noindex/i` is skipped entirely, even inside the Brain folder — and so is anything filed under
  a **subfolder** with such a name (e.g. `Brain/private/…`).
- **Read-only cloud access.** rm-brain only ever *reads* from reMarkable (`list` / `stat` /
  `get`); it never uploads or modifies anything.
- **No telemetry.** rm-brain phones home to nobody. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

## Prerequisites

> ✅ **No jailbreak, rooting, developer mode, or SSH hacks — ever.** rm-brain works entirely
> through reMarkable's **official cloud sync** (via `rmapi`). Your tablet stays completely stock,
> stock firmware, and under warranty. Nothing is installed on or modified on the device.

| Tool | Why | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Node.js 20+** | runtime | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| **rmapi** (ddvk `sync15` build) | reMarkable Cloud CLI | [ddvk/rmapi releases](https://github.com/ddvk/rmapi/releases) — reMarkable's newer sync protocol returns HTTP 410 with older builds |
| **rmc** | renders `.rm` v6 pages | `pipx install rmc` |
| **librsvg** (`rsvg-convert`) | SVG → PNG | `brew install librsvg` |
| **Anthropic API key** | handwriting extraction (used only during `sync`) | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Install
git clone https://github.com/gabrielanhaia/remarkable-brain.git
cd remarkable-brain
npm install && npm run build
npm link            # puts `rm-brain` on your PATH

# 2. Guided setup (pairs rmapi, saves your API key, wires Claude Desktop)
rm-brain setup

# 3. On the tablet: create a "Brain" folder, move a notebook in, let it sync
rm-brain sync

# 4. Fully quit & reopen Claude Desktop, then just ask it about your notes
```

The `setup` wizard checks your tools, pairs rmapi, **prompts for your API key once and saves
it** (to `~/.rm-brain/config.json`, chmod 600 — no re-`export` needed), helps you pick the
Brain folder, offers to run the first sync, and can write your Claude Desktop config
automatically. Re-run it anytime — it's idempotent.

## Usage

Once a notebook is indexed and Claude Desktop is connected, just talk to Claude:

- *"What are my open loops?"* / *"What did I forget to follow up on?"*
- *"Search my notes for the Atlas pricing decision."*
- *"How has my thinking on the onboarding flow evolved?"* (entity timeline)
- *"Show me the page where I sketched the architecture."*

### Web interface

Prefer to *see* your notes? rm-brain ships a local-first, **read-only** web app — an alternative
way to **browse and search** your indexed notebooks and view the actual scanned handwriting in
the browser. Its design is a quiet, fountain-pen-ink-on-fine-paper reading room that follows your
system light/dark theme (scans always stay light paper, so handwriting never inverts). It
complements the conversation, it doesn't replace it: **asking questions still happens in Claude
Desktop** (over MCP); the web app is for seeing and searching.

  <img src="docs/screenshots/page-detail.png" width="49%" alt="rm-brain web — page detail: scanned handwriting beside the transcription" />
</p>

<sub>Screens shown with fictional example data. Everything runs on your machine.</sub>

```bash
rm-brain web                       # builds nothing — opens http://localhost:4123 in your browser
rm-brain web --port 8080           # pick a different port
rm-brain web --host 127.0.0.1      # bind address (localhost only, by design)
rm-brain web --no-open             # don't auto-open the browser
```

It serves the Dashboard (counts + recent open loops and pages), **forgiving search** — word forms
(meeting/meetings), partial words, and small misspellings all match — with filters (notebook, page
type, open-loop only), a Notebooks grid **grouped by reMarkable subfolder**, per-page detail
(scanned image side-by-side with the transcription), Open Loops, and Entity timelines.

Same guarantees as the rest of rm-brain: it binds `127.0.0.1` only, exposes GET endpoints only,
has no auth surface, and makes no outbound network calls. The **frontend ships prebuilt** (in
`web/dist`), so there's no build step for end users — just run `rm-brain web`.

### CLI reference

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `rm-brain setup` | Interactive setup wizard (start here) |
| `rm-brain sync` | Pull Brain-folder notebooks, render, extract, index |
| `rm-brain reindex` | Re-extract all indexed pages (after a prompt/model change) |
| `rm-brain search "<query>"` | Search from the terminal (keyword + local semantic) |
| `rm-brain embed` | Build local semantic-search vectors (optional; on-device, no API) |
| `rm-brain list` | Show indexed notebooks and page counts |
| `rm-brain info` | Where the data lives + stats |
| `rm-brain backup [dest]` | Write a portable `.tar.gz` of the whole index |
| `rm-brain exclude "<name>"` / `include "<name>"` | Exclude (purges) / re-include a notebook |
| `rm-brain purge` | Delete the entire local index |
| `rm-brain doctor` | Check dependencies |
| `rm-brain mcp` | Start the MCP server (Claude Desktop runs this) |
| `rm-brain web` | Open the local read-only web app to browse & search your notes (`--port` / `--host` / `--no-open`) |

### Configuration

All config is via environment variables (env wins) or the saved store (`~/.rm-brain/config.json`).

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RM_BRAIN_HOME` | `~/.rm-brain` | Where all local data lives |
| `RM_BRAIN_FOLDER` | `/Brain` | reMarkable folder whose notebooks get indexed (case-insensitive) |
| `RMAPI_BIN` | `rmapi` | Path/name of the rmapi binary (ddvk sync15 build) |
| `RMC_BIN` | `rmc` | Path/name of the rmc renderer |
| `RSVG_BIN` | `rsvg-convert` | Path/name of rsvg-convert |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | — | Required only for `sync` (extraction) |
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-5` | Vision model for extraction |
| `RM_BRAIN_SEARCH` | `auto` | `auto` uses local semantic search when available; `keyword` forces keyword-only |
| `RM_BRAIN_EMBED_MODEL` | `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | On-device model for semantic embeddings |

### Portability & backup

The whole index is one self-contained folder, so:

- **Back up:** `rm-brain backup [dest.tar.gz]`, or just copy `~/.rm-brain`.
- **Roam / auto-backup:** point `RM_BRAIN_HOME` at a Dropbox/iCloud/Syncthing folder.
- **Restore:** extract the archive anywhere and point `RM_BRAIN_HOME` at it.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>rmapi says "failed to build documents tree … status 410"</b></summary>

Your reMarkable account is on the newer sync protocol. Use the
[**ddvk `sync15` build**](https://github.com/ddvk/rmapi/releases) of rmapi (a release binary is
easiest), not the original `juruen/rmapi`. Then re-run `rm-brain doctor`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Desktop gives empty results even though the note exists</b></summary>

Claude Desktop launches the MCP server once at startup and keeps it running. After any
`rm-brain` update, **fully quit Claude Desktop (⌘Q, not just close the window)** and reopen it
so it reloads the server.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Claude answers from the calendar/memory instead of my notes</b></summary>

Add a one-line personal instruction in **Claude Desktop → Settings → Profile / Custom
Instructions**: *"I keep my handwritten notes in rm-brain. For anything about my tasks, plans,
or notes, use the rm-brain tools first."* The server also ships proactive instructions, but a
personal instruction is the most reliable nudge.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>My notebook isn't being indexed</b></summary>

Make sure it's **inside the Brain folder** (case-insensitive) and that the tablet has **synced
to the cloud** (Wi-Fi on). Then run `rm-brain sync`. Notebooks named `private`/`noindex`/dotted
are skipped by design.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>I changed the extraction prompt / model — old pages didn't update</b></summary>

A normal `sync` skips pages whose image is unchanged. Run `rm-brain reindex` to re-extract
everything.
</details>

## Roadmap / not in v1 (on purpose)

Search is FTS5 keyword by default (stemmed, typo-tolerant, order-independent), with **optional
on-device semantic search** you can turn on locally (see [docs/search.md](docs/search.md)) — no
cloud search, ever. No notifications or daily digests. The web app is a read-only way to *see and
search* your notes — asking questions stays in Claude Desktop, so this remains a tool you reach
for, not one that reaches for you. Ideas and PRs welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
