# 🎓 Student Management System & Analytics

An end-to-end data analytics and business intelligence solution designed to transform raw academic and financial records into actionable institutional insights. 

| Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **SQLite3** | Transactional relational database |
| **SQL** | Data transformation, views, and complex analytics |
| **Excel** | Baseline data ingestion and ad-hoc profiling |
| **Power BI** | Semantic modeling and interactive visualization |
| **DAX** | Advanced semantic calculations and filtering |

## 🏗️ System Architecture & Engineering

This project goes beyond standard visualization by establishing a robust backend data infrastructure before surface-level analytics.
