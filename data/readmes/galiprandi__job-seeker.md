**If this helps you find your next role, [give it a star](https://github.com/<your-username>/job-seeker).** It helps other devs discover it.

## First time here? No coding experience needed

If you use an AI coding agent like **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code)**, **[Codex](https://openai.com/codex)**, or **[Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/)** (download one if you don't have it yet, all have free options) and aren't sure how to get started, copy and paste this prompt into your agent:

```text
Clone the repository https://github.com/<your-username>/job-seeker, run npm install, then read AGENTS.md and .agents/skills/onboarding/SKILL.md and run the onboarding flow. Walk me through each step and ask for anything you need (LinkedIn/Gmail logins, a Neon Postgres connection string, etc.).
```

The agent will clone the repo, install dependencies, and start onboarding, which sets up your browser, database, and profile. You'll only be asked to log into LinkedIn and Gmail manually and to provide a Postgres connection string (Neon's free tier works).

Job Seeker is a set of **markdown skills** that any coding agent (Devin, Claude, Cursor, opencode) consumes to automate the entire job search:

- Searches LinkedIn with your Must-have filters
- Fills Easy Apply forms from your Postgres DB
- Tracks every application in a kanban pipeline
- Drafts recruiter replies in your writing style
- Runs a daily routine while you review and approve

Your data stays in your own DB. The repo is candidate-agnostic: clone it, run onboarding, and go.

## Demo

https://github.com/<your-username>/job-seeker/releases/download/v0.1.0/demo-terminal.webm

**Pipeline kanban** (`node scripts/pipeline.js`):

<img src="assets/pipeline-demo.png" width="640" alt="Pipeline Kanban" />

The CLI prints a terminal kanban grouped by pipeline stage (discovered → hired), with match indicators (★ Must, ◆ Strong, ○ Nice), interview dates, and a closed summary. Use `--closed` to include rejected/withdrawn/skipped columns, `--funnel` for a bar chart, `--move <id> <stage>` to move cards, and `--card <id>` for full card detail with linked messages.

**Local dashboard** (`node scripts/dashboard.js --open`):

<img src="assets/dashboard-light.png" width="720" alt="Dashboard" />

The dashboard visualizes your pipeline with a VitePress-inspired design, including KPI cards, a funnel chart, a kanban board, target-company groups, and recent messages. It also supports light and dark themes. The agent opens it at the end of each round so you can visually review the pipeline. It auto-refreshes every 30 seconds.

## Why Job Seeker?

The average job seeker spends **5-8 hours per week** scrolling job boards, filling repetitive forms, and tracking applications in spreadsheets. Job Seeker automates the boring part:

- **Search** your agent reads your profile and searches LinkedIn with your Must-have filters
- **Apply** Easy Apply forms filled automatically with your data from the DB (no guessing, no inventing)
- **Track** every application, message, and interview in a Postgres pipeline with a kanban view
- **Reply** recruiter messages drafted in your style, reviewed by you before sending
- **Remember** your preferences are detected automatically and stored for future sessions

You stay in control. The agent does the grunt work.

## How it works

```
You: "apply to 5 jobs"
  -> Agent loads your profile from DB
  -> Searches LinkedIn with your Must-have filters
  -> Applies via Easy Apply (form data from DB)
  -> Registers every application
  -> Shows you a summary
```

1. Clone the repo
2. Tell your agent: "run the onboarding skill"
3. The agent opens a browser, asks you to log into Gmail and LinkedIn, creates your DB, and profiles your CV
4. You say: "apply to 5 jobs" and the agent searches, filters, applies and records everything

Your profile, preferences, writing style and history live in Postgres (Neon). Your browser session persists in a dedicated profile. Nothing sensitive is committed to the repo. The repo is **candidate-agnostic**: clone it, run onboarding, and everything you need is stored in your DB. No file in the repo contains personal data.

## Flows

| Flow | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `onboarding` | `onboarding` | Bootstrap: browser with dedicated profile, Gmail + LinkedIn login, Neon DB, user data |
| `profile` | `profile` | Profiling: CV + questionnaire (30 preferences with weights) + voice/style + platform selection |
| `strategy` | `strategy` | Configure job search aggressiveness level. All flows respect it |
| `radar` | `radar` | Passive sourcing: register on job boards, configure alerts, Gmail filter to Job Alerts folder |
| `targets` | `targets` | Active direct sourcing: register and create standout profiles on target companies' career sites, then apply to matching positions |
| `news` | `news` | Review updates in Gmail, LinkedIn and platforms. Prepare drafts, executive summary by priority, hybrid validation and auto-send |
| `apply` | `apply` | Search jobs on LinkedIn, filter by Must-haves, apply via Easy Apply, register in DB |
| `referrals` | `referrals` | Warm sourcing: discover internal contacts, alumni, ex-colleagues, and recruiters at target companies, stage referral requests/outreach DMs, and micro-align CV keywords to JD |
| `daily` | `daily` | Periodic routine: runs `news` -> inbox cleanup -> applies if no recent activity |
| `memory` | (always on) | Autonomous preference detection, storage and injection. Detects preferences from conversation, saves to DB, loads active ones at the start of every flow |
| `dashboard` | `dashboard` | Opens a local web dashboard with kanban, funnel, stats, messages, and target companies. Auto-refreshes every 30s |

**Tools (not flows):**

| Tool | Location | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `playwright-cli` | `.agents/skills/browser-automation/scripts/browser.js` wrapper | Browser automation: open/close/goto/tabs/sessions via wrapper. Other commands (click, fill, snapshot) via `exec` or direct call |
| `db` | `scripts/db.js` | Safe Postgres CLI. Reads `DATABASE_URL` from `.env`, JSON output, read-only by default (`--write` for writes) |
| `linkedin-warm-sourcing` | `scripts/linkedin-warm-sourcing.js` | Discover internal contacts, alumni, ex-colleagues, and recruiters at target companies |
| `pipeline` | `scripts/pipeline.js` | Kanban board CLI for application tracking. Print board, move cards, view funnel, card details |
| `dashboard` | `scripts/dashboard.js` | Local web dashboard. Serves at `http://localhost:7531`. The agent opens it at the end of a round |

## Who is this for?

Works best for tech professionals who use LinkedIn as their primary job platform and Gmail for email. The system is designed to be extensible to other platforms.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- npx
- A LinkedIn account
- A Gmail account
- A Postgres database (Neon recommended, free tier works)

`npm install` handles all dependencies, including `playwright-cli` and `pg`.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/job-seeker.git
cd job-seeker
npm install
```

Create `.env` with your connection string:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@ep-xxx.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
```

Open your coding agent in the repo and say: "run the onboarding skill"

After onboarding, try:

- "profile" - set up your professional profile
- "strategy" - configure your search aggressiveness
- "apply to 5 jobs" - search and apply
- "news" - check for updates from recruiters

## Platforms

`PLATFORMS.md` is a catalog of 35 platforms in 5 categories (general, tech, AI, executive, latam), community-maintained. The agent consults it to decide where to search based on your profile. You don't choose platforms, the agent deduces them. See the [platforms reference](https://<your-username>.github.io/job-seeker/reference/platforms) in the docs.

## Stack

- **Browser:** `playwright-cli` (installed via `npm install`). Persistent profile, headless by default
- **DB:** PostgreSQL via Neon (cloud). Portable across machines
- **Node:** `pg` for DB access, `playwright-cli` for browser automation
- **Skills:** Markdown in `.agents/skills/`. Universal, not tied to one agent
- **Tests:** Vitest for browser wrapper and script tests

## Key decisions

See `ADR.md` for details, or the [architecture reference](https://<your-username>.github.io/job-seeker/reference/architecture) in the docs. Summary:

- **playwright-cli** over MCP: native CLI, no JSON config, token-efficient
- **Postgres** over Mongo: 70% of data is relational. JSONB for semi-structured
- **Neon** for portability: clone on another machine, same `DATABASE_URL`, same profile
- **npx** over global installs: zero friction on clone
- **Headless** by default: headed only for manual login and 2FA
- **Skills in `.agents/skills/`**: universal format, works with any agent
