A Docker image that supports remotely backing up MySQL and PostgreSQL databases to S3-compatible storage buckets (e.g. Amazon S3, Backblaze B2, etc.).

Timing of the backups are determined by a cron job installed inside of the Docker image (located at [`image/conf/cron.conf`](./image/conf/cron.conf)) that executes a backup script written in Bash ([`image/scripts/backup.sh`](./image/scripts/backup.sh)). The backup script dumps the database `$DB_NAME` using the user `$DB_USER` (identified by the password `$DB_PASS`) to `/tmp/$DB_NAME.sql`. Afterwards, it uploads the database dump to the S3 storage bucket using [Duplicity](https://duplicity.us/) and deletes the local database dump.

The custom Docker image files are stored inside of the [`image/`](./image) directory. There is also a Docker Compose application example you can refer to and use inside of the [`example/`](./example) directory which shows how to utilize this image.

## Building The Docker Image

The custom Docker image is stored inside of the [`image/`](./image) directory. You can use the `build_image.sh` Bash script to build the Docker image with customization support including the image name, tag, path, and more options.

The following arguments are supported when executing the script.

| Flag                 | Default      | Description                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--name=<NAME>`      | `db-backups` | The name of the Docker image.                                                                            |
| `--tag=<TAG>`        | `latest`     | The Docker image's tag.                                                                                  |
| `--path=<PATH>`      | `image/`     | Builds the Docker image inside of `<PATH>`.                                                              |
| `--base-name=<NAME>` | `debian`     | The base Docker image (recommend using `debian` or `ubuntu` since we rely on the `apt` package manager). |
| `--base-tag=<TAG>`   | `latest`     | The base Docker image tag to use.                                                                        |
| `--no-cache`         | -            | Builds the Docker image with no cache.                                                                   |
| `--help`             | -            | Prints the help menu.                                                                                    |

By default, the cron job that executes the backup script is ran every night at _12:00_ (midnight). However, you can easily change this by editing the [`image/conf/cron.conf`](./image/conf/cron.conf) file and rebuilding the image. You can use a cron generator tool such as [this](https://crontab.cronhub.io/) for assistance!

You may also build the image manually using the following command as root (or using `sudo`).

```bash
docker build -t db-backups:latest image/
```

## Utilizing The Docker Image

I'd recommend giving the ([`example/`](./example)) directory a look as it includes Docker Compose configuration files that shows how to use this custom Docker image.

I'd also recommend implementing this image using Docker Compose. For example, in your `docker-compose.yml` file, you can create the backups service like below.

```yaml
services:
  db-backups:
    image: db-backups:latest
    hostname: db-backups
    volumes:
      - ./backup-logs:/var/log/backups/
    env_file:
      - ./.env
```

📝**NOTE**: The above configuration expects you to store the project's env variables inside a separate file (`./env`). You can replace the `env_file` section with `environment` and pass the env variables inside of the `docker-compose.yml` file directly in `<env_var>: "<value>"` format.

## Environmental Configuration

All configuration for the backup script is set using environmental variables inside of the Docker container. In the Docker Compose application example inside this repository ([`example/`](./example)), we store the environmental variables inside of the [`example/.env`](./example/.env.example) file. By default, the file is called `.env.example`. Therefore, make sure to rename or copy it to `.env`.

Here are a list of environmental variables that are supported.

| Name                      | Default            | Description                                                                                                               |
