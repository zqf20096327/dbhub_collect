This project demonstrates how to use [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) for orchestrating a daily ETL pipeline that fetches weather data from the free OpenWeather API, cleans and transforms the data, and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. It provides a scalable and reproducible example that can be extended for machine learning tasks such as training predictive models on weather-related datasets.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gbazad93/AirFlow-ML-Data-Integration.git
cd AirFlow-ML-Data-Integration

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify the DAG parses - no API key or database required
pytest tests -q
```

Then work through the [Setup Instructions](#setup-instructions) to configure Airflow, PostgreSQL and a free OpenWeather API key, and trigger `weather_data_pipeline` from the Airflow UI.

### Run the whole stack with Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # add your free OpenWeather API key
docker compose up
```

Airflow is then available at http://localhost:8080 (default login `airflow` / `airflow`) with `weather_data_pipeline` already registered and both connections pre-configured. Prefer to install everything yourself? Follow the [Setup Instructions](#setup-instructions) below.

## Overview

This repository offers a sample Airflow project integrating a daily weather data fetch from OpenWeather’s free API into a PostgreSQL database. The data is cleaned, validated, and ready for further downstream tasks, such as ML model training or dashboard visualization.

To run this project:

1. Follow the steps in the Setup Instructions section in the specified order, as the sequence is crucial to properly configuring your environment, database, and connections.
2. Download or clone the DAG and related codes in the exact same structure as described in the **Project Structure** section.
3. Use the Airflow UI to trigger and monitor the pipeline execution.

## Screenshots

Below are some screenshots showcasing the Airflow UI and the `weather_data_pipeline` DAG in action. These visuals provide an overview of how the pipeline is orchestrated within Apache Airflow.

### Screenshot Descriptions:
1. **Airflow Dashboard (AirFlow01)**: Displays the main Airflow UI with an active `weather_data_pipeline` DAG.
2. **Pipeline Execution Logs (AirFlow02)**: Showcases task logs and data retrieved from the OpenWeather API.
3. **Pipeline Graph View (AirFlow03)**: Visualizes the flow of tasks in the pipeline, including `load_locations`, `fetch_weather_data`, and `insert_weather_data`.
4. **Pipeline DAG Details (AirFlow04)**: Summarizes DAG execution details such as run duration, task statuses, and DAG configuration.

## Setup Instructions

**⚠️ Important:**  
Apache Airflow is **not fully supported on Windows**. It is recommended to run Airflow on a Linux-based system.  
- If you're using Windows, you can install and run Airflow using the **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** feature.  
- Alternatively, you can use a **Linux virtual machine (VM)** or **Docker** for running Airflow on Windows.

To set up the project, please follow the instructions in the **Setup** folder in the following order listed below.

- **[Airflow Setup](./Setup/Airflow-Setup.md):**  
  Step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring Apache Airflow.

- **[Database Setup](./Setup/Database-Setup.md):**  
  Guide for setting up the PostgreSQL database, including creating schemas and tables.

- **[Folder Setup](./Setup/Folders-Setup.md):**
