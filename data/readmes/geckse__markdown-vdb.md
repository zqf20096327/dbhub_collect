A filesystem-native vector database built around Markdown files.
Zero infrastructure — no servers, no containers, everything lives on disk.

Three search modes out of the box: **hybrid** (semantic + lexical, fused via RRF), **semantic** (embedding similarity), and **lexical** (BM25 full-text). Designed for AI agents that need fast, flexible search over local knowledge bases.

## Built For

| Use Case | What mdvdb gives you | Workflow |
|---|---|---|
| **Knowledge Bases** | Hybrid search across docs, wikis, and runbooks. Section-level results link straight to the relevant heading — not just the file. Frontmatter filters let you scope queries by tag, status, or any custom field. | `mdvdb ingest` → `mdvdb search "deploy" --filter status=published` |
| **Agent Memory** | Two-layer memory model: daily logs (append-only) + curated topic files, connected by wikilinks and standard links. Frontmatter fields (`type`, `tags`, `status`, `confidence`, `source`) make memories filterable. Link graph lets agents traverse context chains via `links` / `backlinks`, and `orphans` surfaces disconnected notes. `--boost-links` re-ranks results using the agent's own cross-references. `--decay` applies exponential recency weighting — old logs fade naturally while actively maintained notes stay prominent, no manual archiving needed. Single-file ingest (`--file`) for near-instant indexing after writes. See the full [Agent Memory Graph guide](docs/guides/agent-memory-graph.md). | `mdvdb ingest` → `mdvdb search "auth" --decay --boost-links --filter type=topic` → `mdvdb links topics/auth.md` → `mdvdb orphans` |
| **Documentation Sites** | Index your docs repo and expose search via the library API. Auto-clustering surfaces topic groups without manual tagging. File watching keeps the index current as writers push changes. | `mdvdb watch` → `mdvdb clusters --json` → `mdvdb search "getting started"` |
| **Personal Zettelkasten** | Search your slip-box by meaning instead of exact keywords. Works with Obsidian vaults, Logseq graphs, or plain folders — anything that's `.md` files on disk. Non-destructive: never touches your notes. | `mdvdb ingest` → `mdvdb search "emergence in complex systems"` → `mdvdb links slip/note.md` |
| **RAG Pipelines** | Drop-in retrieval layer for retrieval-augmented generation. JSON output (`--json`) pipes directly into your LLM toolchain. Pluggable embeddings let you match the same model your generator uses. Switch to `--lexical` when you don't need embedding overhead. | `mdvdb ingest` → `mdvdb search "context" --json \| jq` |
| **Research & Literature Notes** | Filter by frontmatter fields like `author`, `year`, or `topic` while searching semantically. Clusters reveal thematic groupings across hundreds of papers or reading notes without manual curation. | `mdvdb ingest` → `mdvdb search "attention mechanism" --filter year=2024` → `mdvdb clusters` |

## Features

- **Three search modes** — hybrid (semantic + BM25 via RRF fusion), semantic, and lexical — switch with `--mode` or `--semantic`/`--lexical` flags
- **Section-level results** — returns the specific heading/section that matched, not just the file
- **Model-agnostic embeddings** — OpenAI, OpenRouter, Gemini, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Hugging Face, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Single index file** — portable, memory-mapped, sub-100ms queries
- **Link graph** — wikilinks and standard markdown links tracked in the index; `links`, `backlinks`, `orphans` commands; `--boost-links` re-ranks search results
- **Frontmatter relations** — `client: clients/acme.md` acts as a foreign key: auto-typed `relation` in the schema, first-class link-graph edges, and `--populate` on `get`/`collection`/`search` resolves the referenced doc inline (JOIN-like, plus `referenced_by` reverse lookups). Wiki-link values such as `"[[clients/acme]]"` remain supported.
- **Time decay** — `--decay` applies exponential recency weighting with configurable half-life
- **File watching** — automatic re-indexing on changes
- **Metadata filtering** — combine any search mode with frontmatter filters
- **Auto-clustering** — deterministic Leiden communities (with K-means fallback), stable IDs, and
  TF-IDF labels
- **Path-scoped search** — `--path` restricts results to a directory subtree
- **Named Shards** — reusable, nestable sub-collection scopes over one shared index; each Shard can
  compute its own finer graph clusters and own independent Topics
- **File tree** — `mdvdb tree` shows sync status of every file at a glance
- **Diagnostics** — `mdvdb doctor` checks config, provider connectivity, and index health
- **Preview mode** — `mdvdb ingest --preview` shows what would change without touching the index
- **Non-destructive** — never modifies your markdown files

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize config
mdvdb init

# Index your markdown files
mdvdb ingest

# Hybrid search (default — semantic + lexical fused via RRF)
mdvdb search "how to deploy to production"

# Semantic only
mdvdb search "how to deploy to production" --semantic

# Lexical only (no embedding API call needed)
mdvdb search "deploy" --lexical

# Search with filters and path scope
mdvdb search "authentication" --filter status=published --path docs/ --limit 5

# Reuse a folder as a named Shard and analyze its own local communities
mdvdb shards add research --path work/research
mdvdb graph --shard research --json
mdvdb clusters --shard research

# Time-decayed search (favor recent files)
mdvdb search "auth" --decay --decay-half-life 30

# Resolve frontmatter relations inline (client: clients/acme.md → title, path, frontmatter)
mdvdb get invoices/i1.md --populate --json

# Check index health
mdvdb doctor

# Watch for changes
mdvdb watch
```

## Installation

```bash
# Build from source
git clone https://github.com/geckse/markdown-vdb.git
cd markdown-vdb
cargo install --path .
```

Requires Rust 1.70+.

## Configuration

Create `.markdownvdb/config.yaml` in your project root (or run `mdvdb init`):

```yaml
embedding:
  provider: openrouter
  model: vendor/model-id
  dimensions: auto

sources:
  dirs: [docs, notes, wiki]

chunking:
  max_tokens: 512

search:
  mode: hybrid
```

Keep credentials in `.markdownvdb/.env`, or in `~/.mdvdb/.env` to share them across projects. Model IDs are unrestricted strings and dimensions are inferred by default.

Config resolution order: shell overrides → project YAML → user YAML → defaults. Secret resolution is shell → project `.env` → user `.env`.

See [Embedding providers](docs/embedding-providers.md) for connection, authentication, discovery, purpose, and Bedrock codec examples.

## Library Usage

```rust
use mdvdb::{MarkdownVdb, SearchQuery, SearchMode};

let vdb = MarkdownVdb::open_async(std::path::Path::new(".")).await?;

// Hybrid search (default)
let results = vdb.search(
    SearchQuery::new("deployment guide")
        .with_limit(10)
        .with_min_score(0.7)
).await?;

// Lexical-only search (no embedding call)
let results = vdb.search(
    SearchQuery::new("deploy")
        .with_mode(SearchMode::Lexical)
).await?;

// Semantic search with time decay and link boosting
let results = vdb.search(
    SearchQuery::new("authentication")
        .with_mode(SearchMode::Semantic)
        .with_decay(true)
        .with_boost_links(true)
        .with_filter("status", "published")
).await?;

for result in results {
    println!("{} (score: {:.2})", result.file.path, result.score);
    println!("  {}", result.chunk.heading_hierarchy.join(" > "));
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Scan** — recursively find `.md` files (respects `.gitignore`)
2. **Parse** — extract frontmatter, headings, and body content
3. **Chunk** — split by headings, with token-limit size guard
4. **Embed** — generate vectors through the configured transport/codec (batched, retried, adaptively split, with content-hash skip)
5. **Index** — store in a single memory-mapped file (usearch HNSW + rkyv metadata) plus Tantivy BM25 segments
6. **Search** — hybrid (embed query → HNSW + BM25 → RRF fusion), semantic (HNSW only), or lexical (BM25 only) → metadata filter → link boost → time decay → ranked results

## Architecture

```
Markdown files → Discovery → Parsing → Chunking → Embedding → Index (HNSW + BM25)
                                                                       ↓
                        Query → [Embed] → HNSW ─┐
                                          BM25 ──┤→ RRF Fusion → Filter → Decay → Results
                                     Link Graph ─┘
```

**Index format:** `[64B header][rkyv metadata][usearch HNSW]` (memory-mapped) + `fts/` directory (Tantivy BM25 segments).

**Key dependencies:** `usearch` (HNSW vectors), `tantivy` (BM25 lexical search), `rkyv`
(zero-copy serde), `memmap2` (memory mapping), `tiktoken-rs` (tokenization), `pulldown-cmark`
(Markdown parsing), `leiden-rs` (community detection), and `linfa` (K-means fallback).

## Comparison

How mdvdb compares to other tools in the Markdown knowledge-base space:

| Dimension | mdvdb | Obsidian | qmd (Markdown DB) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core role | CLI-first filesystem-native vector DB over Markdown; retrieval/memory layer for agents and RAG. Includes a decoupled desktop app. | Desktop editor and PKM app for local Markdown; search is for humans, not a standalone DB. | CLI + library that turns Markdown into a searchable BM25/vector DB on SQLite. |
| Storage model | Markdown on disk as source of truth; single memory-mapped index + BM25 segments, non-destructive. | Plain .md vault; no native vector index, only via plugins. | Collections in SQLite; Markdown content indexed into BM25 + vector tables. |
| Retrieval granularity | Section-level chunks by headings with token limits; results return heading hierarchy. | Mostly file-level; heading/block granularity only via plugins. | Primarily document-level; chunking depends on collection config. |
| Search modes | Built-in hybrid (RRF), semantic, and lexical modes via flags/API. | Keyword search + links; semantic only through plugins. | BM25, semantic, hybrid with LLM rerank. |
| Agent/LLM friendliness | Explicit agent focus: JSON everywhere, link-boosting, time-decay memory, Rust library API. | GUI-centric; agent use via ad-hoc plugins/integrations. | Built for CLI/skills; good for agents needing local semantic search. |
| Links & structure | Parses wikilinks/links into a graph; links, backlinks, orphans, link-aware re-ranking. | Strong backlinks/graph UI for humans; ranking not link-aware by default. | Treats files as docs; link structure not a primary concern. |
| Recency handling | Built-in exponential time decay with configurable half-life flags. | No formal time-decay; recency mostly via daily notes/sorting. | Quality via BM25/vector; no dedicated time-decay memory model. |
| Interface style | CLI-first and decoupled; desktop app possible but not required. | Desktop app (Win/macOS/Linux) with plugins. | Pure CLI and programmatic use. |
| Index lifecycle | mdvdb ingest/watch, preview, diagnostics; one portable index file per knowledge base. | Internal to app; vector index only if plugins add it. | qmd manages collections and embeddings locally, no extra infra. |
