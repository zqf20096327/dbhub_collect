## About Poka

Poka CE is a personal finance tracker with one core principle: **your financial data belongs to you, and only you.**
There is no account to create, no server to sync with, and no subscription to manage. Every transaction, balance, and
record lives exclusively in a local SQLite database on your device.

Unlike most finance apps that treat cloud sync as a default, Poka CE treats local-first storage as a hard architectural
constraint — not an optional mode. It is open-source, built with Flutter, and designed to be simple enough for daily use
without being stripped of the features that matter.

> [!NOTE]
> **Data Safety & Backups.** Because Poka CE stores 100% of your data locally on your device with zero cloud syncing,
> we strongly recommend creating periodic backups via **Settings → Backup & Export** to safeguard against device loss or replacement.

---

## Key Features

- **Multi-Account Management** — Track multiple accounts and sub-wallet pockets simultaneously with real-time balance updates.
- **Income, Expense & Transfer** — Record all transaction types with full history, search, and multidimensional filters.
- **Split Transactions** — Allocate a single receipt across multiple categories or pockets with automatic amount balance verification.
- **5-Second Undo Delete** — Instantly restore accidentally deleted transactions, line items, and balance mutations with a single tap.
- **Budgeting** — Set monthly spending limits per category or account and track actual progress directly from item receipts.
- **Goals** — Define savings targets linked to dedicated pockets and track progress automatically.
- **Debt & Loan Tracking** — Log borrowed or lent funds with paired wallet cashflow entries and installment tracking.
- **Smart Input Parsing** — Type arithmetic expressions directly into the amount field (e.g., `150000+50000*2`) with real-time evaluation.
- **Bilingual Support**: Fully localized interface in English and Bahasa Indonesia with seamless in-app language switching.
- **Multi-Sheet Data Export** — Export comprehensive financial records to Excel (`.xlsx`) or export/import JSON backups.
- **Android App Shortcuts** — Quick-action shortcuts from your home screen for rapid transaction entry.
- **Offline First & Private** — 100% local SQLite storage via Drift. No internet required, no analytics, no trackers.
- **Flat Design System** — Built strictly with [ForUI](https://github.com/forui-dev/forui); zero shadows, dual typography (Plus Jakarta Sans & Tabular Inter), clean and sharp.
