## 🧬 What is a Harness?

In AI, an LLM can *think*. A tool can *act*. But neither can **persist, recover, coordinate, or remember** on its own.

A **Harness** is the missing execution layer. It is the infrastructure that wraps around AI agents to give them:

- **Persistence** — Every task, every checkpoint, every event is written to a canonical SQLite store. If the agent dies, the work survives.
- **Lifecycle** — Tasks follow a strict state machine (`pending → ready → in_progress → done/failed`). Leases prevent two agents from claiming the same work. Stale leases are automatically recovered.
- **Memory** — Optional semantic memory powered by `mem0` allows agents to recall context across sessions, threads, and even projects — without polluting the canonical state.
- **Coordination** — Dependency chains between tasks are resolved automatically. When task A completes, its dependents are promoted to `ready`. No human intervention needed.
- **Portability** — The harness is agent-agnostic and IDE-agnostic. It works with Copilot, Gemini, Cursor, Windsurf, or any custom runtime. Set it up once, use it everywhere.

### Why does this matter?

Without a harness, every AI agent is a **stateless function call**. It forgets everything between sessions. It can't coordinate with other agents. It can't recover from crashes. It can't prove what it did or why.

**HarnessOS turns disposable AI into a persistent, self-healing, auditable system.**

Think of it this way:
- An LLM is a CPU.
- Tools are peripherals.
- **HarnessOS is the operating system that makes them work together reliably.**

---

## 🚀 Overview

**HarnessOS** provides the foundational execution framework for advanced autonomous agents. It focuses strictly on robust lifecycle management, leaving LLM inference and tool implementation to the consumer.

Latest release notes and breaking changes are tracked in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). The canonical hard-cut release checklist and fail-fast contract boundaries live in [docs/release-playbooks.md](docs/release-playbooks.md).

### Schema compatibility

- HarnessOS now enforces SQLite schema v5 as the only supported runtime store contract.
- Existing v2 databases are not migrated in place; opening them fails fast with an explicit recreate instruction.
- The runtime now persists `blocked_reason` on issues and milestones so dependency blockers are explicit, inspectable, and recomputed deterministically when queue state changes.
- The public package stays on the **2.x release line**; schema, contract, and bundled-skill versions are tracked independently per surface so runtime cuts remain explicit without forcing a new package major every time one internal contract moves.

### What it handles:
- **Zod Plan Contracts** — Strongly typed schema validation for robust planning.
- **Session Contracts** — Standardized agent execution lifecycles.
- **Skill-Policy Registry** — Dynamic management of agent capabilities and operational rules.
- **Canonical SQLite Store** — Robust, ACID-compliant state layer for leases, checkpoints, events, and task states.
- **Session Orchestration** — High-level inspection, queue promotion, and task lifecycle management.
- **Symphony-style Agentic Orchestration** — Fully agentic fan-out over ready issues, isolated worktree metadata/physical worktree adapters, `gpt-5-high` subagent routing, and deterministic evidence gates instead of human runtime checkpoints.

---

## ⚡ Key Features

### 🗄️ Canonical SQLite State
SQLite acts as the absolute source of truth for:
- **Leases** — Task-scoped locks to prevent concurrent race conditions.
- **Checkpoints** — Snapshot history of agent progress.
- **Events** — Immutable transaction logs.
- **Task State** — Workflow queues and resolutions.

### 📋 Batch-First Planning & Promotion
- `harness_orchestrator(action: "plan_issues")` accepts a canonical `milestones[]` batch only, even when importing a single milestone.
- `create_campaign` accepts an optional typed `policy` object with `owner`, `serviceLevel`, `escalationRules`, and `dispatch`, while `plan_issues` and the scheduler injector accept first-class workflow metadata on issues and milestones through `deadlineAt`, `recipients`, `approvals`, and `externalRefs`.
- Milestone hierarchy is preserved with `depends_on_milestone_keys` for in-batch edges and `depends_on_milestone_ids` for previously imported milestones.
- `promote_queue` advances work only when both issue-level and milestone-level dependencies are truly `done`.
- `harness_inspector(action: "next_action")` now returns a structured `context` block that points to the exact issue, milestone, blocker, lease, or policy escalation behind the recommendation, so queue decisions are auditable instead of heuristic black boxes.
- Campaign-level policy defaults still merge into issue-level overrides, and claim ordering now considers effective priority, policy breaches, issue deadlines, and the existing aging rules through one shared dispatch path.

### 🧠 Optional Memory Derivation
- Integrating `mem0-mcp` provides advanced semantic memory and context extraction.
- **Lazy Loading** — Derived memory is loaded *only* when needed to conserve resources.
- **Failsafe Operations** — If `mem0-mcp` is unavailable, the harness gracefully degrades without corrupting the canonical SQLite tasks.

### 🧭 Capability Discoverability
- `harness_inspector(action: "capabilities")` exposes the runtime tool surface, bundled skills, policy-driven skills, Symphony orchestration metadata, and mem0 state in an agent-readable format.
- The `orchestration` block advertises Symphony mode, the `harness_symphony` actions, the `gpt-5-high` default profile, four-agent fan-out defaults, required dispatch fields, worktree isolation responsibilities, Codex runner contracts, accepted evidence artifact kinds, and runtime metadata artifact kinds so hosts can discover support without hardcoded assumptions.
- The packaged skills under `.github/skills` mirror the canonical runtime contract, so prompts, docs, and MCP discovery stay aligned.
- The bundled skill manifest now publishes explicit workload profiles (`coding`, `research`, `ops`, `sales`, `support`, `assistant`) and per-skill `workloadProfileIds`, so hosts can specialize without hardcoding the core runtime to one domain.
- Human-facing discovery docs now live in one place per surface: [docs/mcp-tools.md](docs/mcp-tools.md) for MCP tools, [docs/cli-reference.md](docs/cli-reference.md) for the installable CLIs, [docs/workload-profiles.md](docs/workload-profiles.md) for workload selection, and [.github/skills/README.md](.github/skills/README.md) for the bundled skill index.

### 🧩 Workload-Aware Skill Sync
- `harness-setup` now records a canonical `selectedWorkloadProfile` for every registered host under `~/.agent-harness/config.json`.
- `harness-sync` installs only the skills required by that workload profile and prunes the rest atomically, instead of shipping one implicit all-skills pack to every host.
- `assistant` remains the explicit full-surface profile when a host must stay multi-domain; other profiles keep the runtime domain-agnostic while specializing guidance at the host edge.
- The repository now ships reference workspaces for `assistant`, `research`, `ops`, and `support` under [`examples/`](examples/) so non-coding teams can start from concrete queues, workflow metadata, and handoff assets instead of coding-only scaffolds.

### ⏱️ Reusable Scheduler Injector
A cron-aware, idempotent injector for scheduled work (`src/bin/scheduler-inject.ts`), supporting full 5-field cron expressions to safely trigger work without duplications.

### Agentic Symphony-Style Orchestration
- `loadSymphonyWorkflow()` resolves repo-owned `WORKFLOW.md` contracts with YAML front matter, typed defaults, `$VAR` path/secret resolution, strict prompt interpolation, and reload semantics that preserve the last known good workflow on invalid edits.
- `createSymphonyPhysicalWorktree()` and `cleanupSymphonyPhysicalWorktree()` let a host materialize an assigned worktree with safe refs, root containment, repo-owned hooks, timeouts, idempotent cleanup, and per-run evidence manifests/logs outside the removable checkout.
- `launchCodexAppServerRunner()` defines the opt-in Codex app-server runner boundary with fake-process coverage, `bash -lc` workflow command execution, runner/thread/turn identity, Symphony session-id derivation, read/turn timeout normalization, typed startup/turn error categories, and an additive `startTurnWithTelemetry()` envelope for event-capable transports with continuation recommendations, non-stall approval/user-input events, stall detection, token/rate-limit telemetry, and retry/backoff evidence.
- `harness_symphony(action: "compile_plan")` converts tracker-style milestones and slices into the canonical `plan_issues` batch without mutating state.
- `harness_symphony(action: "dispatch_ready")` assigns ready issues to one compatible subagent and one isolated worktree per issue, with `gpt-5-high` and four-agent fan-out as the discoverable defaults.
- `harness_symphony(action: "inspect_state")` reads leases, worktree artifacts, evidence references, recent events, and orchestration health flags.
- `runOrchestrationSupervisorTick()` executes one deterministic autonomous supervisor tick, while `runOrchestrationSupervisor()`, `harness-supervisor`, and `harness_symphony(action: "supervisor_run")` provide bounded autonomous polling with stop conditions and backoff.
- Completion remains no-human-checkpoint: the supervisor owns inspect/promote/dispatch and, in execute mode, requires an `assignmentRunner` command to run dispatched assignments and attach command-produced test, E2E, CSQR-lite, optional screenshot, state export, and codebase evidence before closing work.
- Copy/paste MCP payloads live in [`examples/orchestration-symphony/`](examples/orchestration-symphony/), and the runtime contract is documented in [docs/orchestration-no-schema-v1.md](docs/orchestration-no-schema-v1.md).

### Linear-Like Orchestration Dashboard
- A full Next.js dashboard lives in [`apps/dashboard`](apps/dashboard) and consumes the stable `harness-os/orchestration` dashboard view model.
- The app renders campaign metrics, ordered issue lanes, active leases, evidence summaries, CSQR-lite scorecards, recent events, and health flags without adding React/Next.js to the core package runtime dependencies.
- Run `npm run dashboard:install`, then start it with `HARNESS_DASHBOARD_DB_PATH` and `HARNESS_DASHBOARD_PROJECT_ID` to read a live HarnessOS SQLite database. Demo data is opt-in only via `HARNESS_DASHBOARD_DEMO=1`.
- Use `npm run dashboard:verify` after dashboard changes; it rebuilds the core package, installs app dependencies from lockfile, runs typecheck/tests, and executes `next build`.
- The operator runbook is documented in [docs/orchestration-dashboard.md](docs/orchestration-dashboard.md).

## 💻 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Installation & Multi-Host Setup

```bash
npm install -g harness-os mem0-mcp
```

HarnessOS targets **Node.js 22+** and ships with installable CLIs for runtime setup, scheduling, and MCP registration.

Register the lifecycle MCP server for Codex, Copilot CLI, and antigravity in one pass:

```bash
# Creates ~/.agent-harness/{harness.sqlite,mem0} if missing and configures the hosts
harness-install-mcp --host codex --host copilot --host antigravity

# Optional: bind a host to a specific workload profile
harness-install-mcp --host copilot --workload-profile research
harness-install-mcp --host codex --workload-profile ops
harness-install-mcp --host antigravity --workload-profile assistant

# Optional: inspect first without writing anything
harness-install-mcp --dry-run
```

You can still register extra host workspaces for skill sync:

```bash
harness-setup
harness-sync
```

`harness-setup` now persists a versioned host-sync config under `~/.agent-harness/config.json`. If you still have the legacy flat `{"hosts":["/path"]}` shape, rerun `harness-setup` once to rewrite it before `harness-sync`. Each sync writes `skills/bundle-manifest.json` to the host and explicitly replaces outdated or drifted bundled skill assets instead of tolerating them indefinitely.
The current host-sync schema is `3`: each host now stores an explicit `selectedWorkloadProfile`, and sync records the installed workload-profile version plus checksum alongside the bundle metadata.

## 🧩 Architecture

For an in-depth look at how HarnessOS works, refer to the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md). The Symphony-style no-schema orchestration boundary is documented in [docs/orchestration-no-schema-v1.md](docs/orchestration-no-schema-v1.md). Release highlights and migrations live in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

The typical execution flow:
1. `harness_orchestrator(action: "plan_issues")` — Imports a canonical milestone batch into the queue.
2. `runOrchestrationSupervisor()`, `harness-supervisor`, or `harness_symphony(action: "supervisor_run")` — Runs bounded supervisor polling that promotes eligible work, fans visible ready issues out to isolated worktree/subagent assignments, and executes them when `dispatch.assignmentRunner` is supplied.
3. `beginIncrementalSession()` — Claims a ready task when single-worker execution is preferred instead of the supervisor fan-out path.
4. `beginRecoverySession()` — Resolves and overrides a stuck or failed task.
5. `checkpoint()` — Writes immediate progress to SQLite.
6. `close()` — Releases the lease and promotes newly eligible work.
