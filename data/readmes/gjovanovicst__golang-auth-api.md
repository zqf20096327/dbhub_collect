## Features

- **Multi-Tenancy** -- Serve multiple organizations and applications from a single deployment with complete data isolation
- **Session Groups** -- Link applications into named groups with shared authentication state and configurable global logout (cross-app SSO within a tenant)
- **Authentication** -- Registration, login, JWT access/refresh tokens, token blacklisting, password reset, email verification, resend verification
- **WebAuthn/Passkeys** -- FIDO2 passkey registration, passkey as 2FA method, and fully passwordless login via discoverable credentials
- **Magic Link Login** -- Passwordless authentication via email magic links for both users and admin accounts
- **Two-Factor Authentication** -- TOTP with authenticator apps, SMS-based 2FA, email-based 2FA, passkey-based 2FA, backup email recovery, recovery codes, and trusted devices
- **Social Login** -- Google, Facebook, and GitHub OAuth2 with account linking and unlinking
- **OIDC Provider** -- Each application can act as a standards-compliant OpenID Connect issuer (Authorization Code + PKCE, RS256 ID tokens, JWKS, introspection, token revocation)
- **Webhook System** -- Register HTTP endpoints to receive HMAC-signed event notifications with delivery tracking and automatic retries
- **Brute-Force Protection** -- Per-application account lockout, progressive login delays, and CAPTCHA trigger thresholds
- **GeoIP & IP Rules** -- MaxMind GeoLite2-based IP access rules with CIDR/country allow-lists and block-lists per application
- **API Key Scopes & Usage** -- Granular permission scopes on API keys with per-key daily usage analytics and expiry notifications
- **Health & Metrics** -- `GET /health` liveness check and `GET /metrics` Prometheus endpoint with request and system metrics
- **Role-Based Access Control** -- Per-application roles and permissions with admin management and self-healing default role assignment
- **Session Management** -- List active sessions across devices, revoke individual sessions, and revoke all other sessions
- **Admin GUI** -- Built-in web panel for managing tenants, apps, users, OAuth configs, API keys, roles, permissions, sessions, webhooks, OIDC clients, IP rules, monitoring, and settings
- **Activity Logging** -- Smart event categorization, anomaly detection, CSV export, and automatic retention cleanup
- **User Import/Export** -- Bulk CSV export and import of user accounts via the admin panel
- **Security Hardening** -- Rate limiting, security headers, timing-safe CSRF, JWT token type enforcement, Redis session validation
- **API Documentation** -- Interactive Swagger UI

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Docker & Docker Compose (recommended), or Go 1.23+, PostgreSQL 13+, Redis 6+

```bash
# Clone and configure
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
cp .env.example .env        # Edit with your settings

# Start services
./setup-network.sh create   # First time only
make docker-dev              # Start PostgreSQL, Redis, and the API
make migrate-up              # Apply database migrations
```

The API is now running at `http://localhost:8080`
Swagger docs at `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html`

All API requests require the `X-App-ID` header. The default app ID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001` is created automatically.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/register \
  -H "X-App-ID: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"Pass123!@#"}'
```
