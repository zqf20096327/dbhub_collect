# Swig

> Job queues as refreshing as taking a swig 🍺

Swig is a robust, PostgreSQL-backed job queue system for Go applications, designed for developers who need reliable background job processing with minimal setup.

⚠️ **Alpha Status**: Swig is currently in alpha and actively being developed towards v1.0.0. The API may undergo changes during this phase. For stability in production environments, we strongly recommend pinning to a specific version:

```bash
go get github.com/glamboyosa/swig@v0.1.24-alpha
```
import it like: 
```go 
import "github.com/glamboyosa/swig"
```

## Why Transactional Integrity Matters

In distributed systems, especially job queues, transactional integrity is crucial. Swig offers three levels of transaction control:

1. **Bring Your Own Transaction** (Recommended): Use your existing database transaction:
```go
tx, _ := pool.Begin(ctx)
defer tx.Rollback(ctx)

// Create user
userID := createUser(tx)

// Enqueue welcome email in same transaction
err := swigClient.AddJobWithTx(ctx, tx, &EmailWorker{
    To: email,
    Subject: "Welcome!",
})
if err != nil {
    return err
}
return tx.Commit(ctx)
```

2. **Use Swig's Transaction Helper**: Let Swig manage the transaction:
```go
err := swigClient.driver.WithTx(ctx, func(tx Transaction) error {
    // Create user
    if err := createUser(tx); err != nil {
        return err // Triggers rollback
    }
    
    // Add job (auto rollback if this fails)
    return tx.Exec(ctx, insertJobSQL, ...)
})
```

3. **No Transaction** (Simple): Just enqueue a job:
```go
err := swigClient.AddJob(ctx, &EmailWorker{
    To: email,
    Subject: "Welcome!",
})
```

Choose the approach that best fits your needs:
- Use `AddJobWithTx` when you need to coordinate jobs with your application's data
- Use `WithTx` when you want automatic transaction management
- Use `AddJob` for simple, non-transactional job enqueueing

Benefits of transactional job enqueueing:
- **No Lost Jobs**: Jobs are either fully committed or not at all
- **Atomic Processing**: Jobs are processed exactly once using PostgreSQL's SKIP LOCK
- **Data Consistency**: Jobs can be part of your application's transactions

## Features

- **PostgreSQL-Powered**: Leverages PostgreSQL's SKIP LOCK for efficient job distribution
- **Transactional Integrity**: Jobs are processed exactly once with transactional guarantees
- **Leader Election**: Built-in leader election using advisory locks
- **Multiple Queue Support**: Priority and default queues out of the box
- **Type-Safe Job Arguments**: Strongly typed job arguments with Go generics
- **Simple API**: Intuitive API for enqueueing and processing jobs

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/glamboyosa/swig
```

## Supported Drivers

Swig supports two PostgreSQL driver implementations:
- `pgx` (Recommended) - Using the high-performance [pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) driver
  - Better performance
  - Native LISTEN/NOTIFY support
  - Real-time job notifications
- `database/sql` - Using Go's standard `database/sql` interface
  - **Important**: Requires `github.com/lib/pq` driver for LISTEN/NOTIFY support
  - Must import with: `import _ "github.com/lib/pq"`
  - Must use `postgres://` (not `postgresql://`) in connection strings

## Understanding Workers

Workers in Swig are structs that implement two key requirements:
1. The `JobName() string` method to identify the worker type
2. The `Process(context.Context) error` method to execute the job
3. Have JSON-serializable fields for job arguments

Example worker:
```go
type EmailWorker struct {
    To      string `json:"to"`
    Subject string `json:"subject"`
    Body    string `json:"body"`
}

func (w *EmailWorker) JobName() string {
    return "send_email"
}

func (w *EmailWorker) Process(ctx context.Context) error {
    return sendEmail(w.To, w.Subject, w.Body)
}
```

## Quick Start

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/pgxpool"
    "database/sql"
    _ "github.com/lib/pq"
    "github.com/swig/swig-go/drivers"
    import swig "github.com/glamboyosa/swig/swig-go"
)

// 1. Define your worker (as shown above in Understanding Workers)
type EmailWorker struct {
    To      string `json:"to"`
    Subject string `json:"subject"`
    Body    string `json:"body"`
}

func (w *EmailWorker) JobName() string {
    return "send_email"
}

func (w *EmailWorker) Process(ctx context.Context) error {
    return sendEmail(w.To, w.Subject, w.Body)
}

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()

    // Setup database connection (choose one)
    
    // Option A: Using pgx
    pgxConfig, _ := pgxpool.ParseConfig("postgres://localhost:5432/myapp")
    pgxPool, _ := pgxpool.NewWithConfig(ctx, pgxConfig)
    driver, _ := drivers.NewPgxDriver(pgxPool)
    
    // Option B: Using database/sql
    // db, _ := sql.Open("postgres", "postgres://localhost:5432/myapp")
    // driver, _ := drivers.NewSQLDriver(db, connString)
    
    // Create a worker registry and register your workers
    workers := swig.NewWorkerRegistry()
    workers.RegisterWorker(&EmailWorker{})
    
    // Configure queues (default setup)
    configs := []swig.SwigQueueConfig{
        {QueueType: swig.Default, MaxWorkers: 5},
    }
    
    // Create and start Swig with worker registry
    swigClient := swig.NewSwig(driver, configs, workers)
    swigClient.Start(ctx)
    
    // Add a job (uses default queue)
    err := swigClient.AddJob(ctx, &EmailWorker{
        To:      "user@example.com",
        Subject: "Welcome!",
        Body:    "Hello from Swig",
    })
}
```

## Queue Configuration

Swig supports multiple queues with different worker pools. While the default queue is sufficient for many applications, you can configure multiple queues for more complex scenarios:

```go
// Configure multiple queues
configs := []swig.SwigQueueConfig{
    {QueueType: swig.Default, MaxWorkers: 5},   // Default queue
    {QueueType: swig.Priority, MaxWorkers: 3},  // Priority queue
}

swigClient := swig.NewSwig(driver, configs)
```

Once you have multiple queues, you can specify which queue to use with JobOptions:

```go
// High priority email
err := swigClient.AddJob(ctx, &EmailWorker{
    To:      "urgent@example.com",
    Subject: "Urgent Notice!",
    Body:    "Priority message",
}, swig.JobOptions{
    Queue: swig.Priority,
    Priority: 5,
})

// Scheduled email in default queue
err = swigClient.AddJob(ctx, &EmailWorker{
    To:      "reminder@example.com",
    Subject: "Reminder",
    Body:    "Don't forget!",
}, swig.JobOptions{
    Queue: swig.Default,
    RunAt: time.Now().Add(24 * time.Hour),
})
```

Each queue operates independently with its own worker pool, allowing you to:
- Process priority jobs faster with dedicated workers
- Prevent low-priority jobs from blocking important tasks
- Scale worker pools based on queue requirements
## Worker Registration

Workers must be registered with Swig before they can process jobs:

```go
// Create workers registry
workers := swig.NewWorkerRegistry()

// Register workers
workers.RegisterWorker(&EmailWorker{})
workers.RegisterWorker(&ImageResizeWorker{})

// Pass workers to Swig
swigClient := swig.NewSwig(driver, configs, workers)
```

The registry ensures that:
- Only registered worker types can be processed
- Worker implementations are validated at startup
- Job payloads can be properly deserialized 
## Job Processing

Swig handles job processing with:
- Automatic retries
- Error tracking
- Job status management
- Scheduled jobs
- Priority queues

## Cleanup and Testing

Swig provides methods for both graceful shutdown and complete cleanup:

```go
// Graceful shutdown: Wait for jobs to complete
err := swigClient.Stop(ctx)

// Complete cleanup: Drop all Swig tables
err := swigClient.Close(ctx)
```

The `Close` method is particularly useful in:
- Testing environments to clean up after tests
- Development scenarios to reset state
- CI/CD pipelines needing clean slate between runs

Example usage in tests:
```go
func TestJobProcessing(t *testing.T) {
    // Setup Swig
    swigClient := swig.NewSwig(driver, configs, workers)
    defer swigClient.Close(ctx) // Clean up after test
    
    // Run your tests...
}
```

## Architecture

Swig uses PostgreSQL's SKIP LOCK for efficient job distribution across multiple processes. This, combined with advisory locks for leader election, ensures:

- No duplicate job processing
- Fair job distribution
- High availability
- Transactional integrity

## Batch Job Insertion

Swig supports efficient batch insertion of multiple jobs in a single database operation. This is particularly useful for:

- Bulk operations (e.g., data migrations)
- Atomic insertion of related jobs
- High-throughput scenarios
- Reducing database round trips

### Basic Usage

```go
// Create a slice of jobs to insert
jobs := []swig.BatchJob{
    {
        Worker: &EmailWorker{To: "user1@example.com", Subject: "Welcome"},
        Opts:   swig.JobOptions{Queue: swig.QueueTypes("default")},
    },
    {
        Worker: &EmailWorker{To: "user2@example.com", Subject: "Welcome"},
        Opts:   swig.JobOptions{Queue: swig.QueueTypes("default")},
    },
}

// Insert all jobs in a single operation
err := swig.AddJobs(ctx, jobs)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to add jobs: %v", err)
}
```

### Transactional Batch Insertion

Batch jobs can also be inserted as part of a transaction:

```go
// Start a transaction
tx, err := db.BeginTx(ctx, nil)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to begin transaction: %v", err)
}
defer tx.Rollback()

// Create and insert jobs
jobs := []swig.BatchJob{
    {
        Worker: &EmailWorker{To: "user1@example.com", Subject: "Welcome"},
        Opts:   swig.JobOptions{Queue: swig.QueueTypes("default")},
    },
    {
        Worker: &EmailWorker{To: "user2@example.com", Subject: "Welcome"},
        Opts:   swig.JobOptions{Queue: swig.QueueTypes("default")},
    },
}

// Insert all jobs in the transaction
err = swig.AddJobsWithTx(ctx, tx, jobs)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to add jobs: %v", err)
}

// Commit the transaction
if err := tx.Commit(); err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to commit transaction: %v", err)
}
```

### Performance Considerations

- Batch insertion is significantly faster than individual inserts for large numbers of jobs
- The optimal batch size depends on your database configuration and network conditions
- Consider using transactions for atomic operations
- Monitor memory usage when dealing with very large batches

## Batch Job Processing

Swig supports efficient batch job processing through two methods:

1. **Non-transactional Batch Insertion**:
```go
batchJobs := []drivers.BatchJob{
    {
        Worker: &EmailWorker{To: "user1@example.com", Subject: "Welcome"},
        Opts:   drivers.JobOptions{Queue: "default"},
    },
    {
        Worker: &EmailWorker{To: "user2@example.com", Subject: "Welcome"},
        Opts:   drivers.JobOptions{Queue: "default"},
    },
}

if err := swig.AddJobs(ctx, batchJobs); err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to add batch jobs: %v", err)
}
```

2. **Transactional Batch Insertion**:
```go
tx, err := db.BeginTx(ctx, nil)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to begin transaction: %v", err)
}
defer tx.Rollback()

if err := swig.AddJobsWithTx(ctx, tx, batchJobs); err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to add batch jobs: %v", err)
}

if err := tx.Commit(); err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to commit transaction: %v", err)
}
```

### Implementation Details

Swig supports two PostgreSQL drivers with different implementations:

1. **database/sql Driver**:
   - Uses standard Go database/sql interface
   - Implements batch insertion using a single SQL query with multiple VALUES clauses
   - Example SQL:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO swig_jobs (kind, queue, payload, status)
     VALUES 
         ('send_email', 'default', '{"to":"user1@example.com"}', 'pending'),
         ('send_email', 'default', '{"to":"user2@example.com"}', 'pending')
     ```

2. **pgx Driver**:
   - Uses jackc/pgx for better performance
   - Implements batch insertion using pgx's batch processing capabilities
   - Example SQL:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO swig_jobs (kind, queue, payload, status)
     VALUES ($1, $2, $3, 'pending')
     ```
   - Uses pgx's batch processing to execute multiple inserts efficiently

Both implementations provide the same functionality but with different performance characteristics:
- database/sql: Simpler implementation, good for most use cases
- pgx: Better performance for high-throughput scenarios, especially with batch operations

The choice between drivers depends on your specific needs:
- Use database/sql for simplicity and standard Go database access
- Use pgx for better performance and advanced PostgreSQL features
