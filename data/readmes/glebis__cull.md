# Cull

Fast local image review for artists, photographers, and people who produce at volume on macOS.

Official site: [cull.company](https://cull.company/)

Cull is a fast image review tool for people who shoot, generate, or produce at volume. Go from hundreds of images, sketches, SD-card dumps, or test shots to a final set without uploading your work or fighting a heavy creative suite.

Most tools are built for editing. Cull is built for the moment before that, when you have too many images and need to look carefully, decide clearly, and turn the pile into something useful: a portfolio edit, a client selection, a post, a book, an exhibition, a reference board, or the next agent-assisted step.

Made by artists for artists, Cull is open, local, and agent-friendly: closer to Obsidian for images than another locked creative suite.

## What It Is For

- **Culling large runs** — go from 500 images to 20 keepers.
- **Visual reference work** — build a local Pinterest-like archive for serious art direction, design research, and image memory.
- **Social and editorial output** — organize batches into Instagram posts, LinkedIn posts, books, magazines, essays, exhibitions, field guides, and client selects.
- **AI-generated image work** — keep prompts, variants, sources, and iterations attached to the images they produced.
- **Agent-assisted workflows** — sort a folder yourself, or hand work to an agent through CLI or MCP when you want help.
- **Second-screen review** — keep the main app private while a client, collaborator, projector, iPad, or browser sees only the current preview.

## What It Does

- Plug in an SD card or external drive and cull directly from it without copying originals.
- Drop in a folder to browse it in place, or use the explicit import commands when you want it added as a library root.
- Move quickly through Grid, Loupe, Compare, Canvas, Lineage, Embedding Explorer, Export, and Speed Review views.
- Rate, accept, reject, compare, collect, and filter without lifting your hands from the keyboard.
- Search by look and feel rather than filename.
- Surface the sharp ones, the warm ones, or the images that match a reference.
- Export picks for social, publishing, clients, contact sheets, PDFs, static reference sets, or the next agent-assisted step.
- Keep originals untouched and private by default.

## Under The Hood

- Local SQLite library with SHA-256 deduplication.
- Local CLIP/DINOv2 embeddings, UMAP visualization, image quality metrics, perceptual hashes, and histograms.
- Generation metadata from sidecar JSON, PNG text chunks, C2PA-style metadata, and filename evidence where available.
- Agent workflows through a local MCP server, MCP-aligned headless CLI commands, and `cull://` deep links.

## Principles

- **Local-first:** the library lives on your machine.
- **Non-destructive:** source files are not rewritten.
- **Keyboard-first:** common review actions are reachable without the mouse.
- **Agent-friendly:** work in the app, or let an agent operate the archive directly when that helps.
- **Open source:** Cull is Apache-2.0 software, not source-available software.
- **European-minded:** cloud/API features are explicit and optional; privacy, autonomy, and auditability matter.

## Download & Install

Quickest path, with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```sh
brew install --cask glebis/tap/cull
```

Prefer a manual download (no developer tools required):

1. Download the latest `.dmg` for your Mac from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/glebis/cull/releases).
2. Open the DMG and drag **Cull** into **Applications**.
3. Launch Cull normally. Current release artifacts are signed with Developer ID,
   notarized by Apple, and stapled; macOS Gatekeeper should accept them without
   the unsigned-app override.

Prefer building from source? See [Development](#development).

## Current Status

The shipping version is whatever the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/glebis/cull/releases/latest) says.

`bd` is the tracker of record for open work. The README intentionally does not duplicate the full roadmap, command list, or keyboard shortcut reference; those live in the docs and changelog.

Current high-level shape:

- macOS desktop app is the primary supported product.
- Windows and Linux distribution are planned, but not the main release target yet.
- MCP and CLI surfaces are usable and expanding, with explicit approval boundaries for destructive or sensitive operations.
- Optional model weights, cloud APIs, and third-party assets keep their own license and privacy boundaries.

## Agent CLI

Cull has an MCP-aligned headless CLI slice. Command names and JSON fields mirror the MCP tool model where possible.

The CLI is the same binary as the app, shipped inside the bundle. Getting `cull` onto your PATH:

- **Homebrew** — `brew install --cask glebis/tap/cull` links it for you; nothing else to do.
- **DMG install** — open Settings → General → Command line tool and switch it on. Cull symlinks itself into the first suitable directory on your PATH and tells you if that directory needs adding to your shell profile.
- **By hand** — `ln -s /Applications/Cull.app/Contents/MacOS/cull ~/.local/bin/cull`

```bash
cull ~/renders
cull --json get_library_stats
cull --json import_folder --folder_path ~/renders
cull --json import_files --file_paths ~/renders/a.png,~/renders/b.png
cull --json export_images --collection_id <id> --output_dir ~/Desktop/export --format original
cull --json call_tool import_folder --params_json '{"folder_path":"/Users/me/renders"}'
```

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/glebis/cull.git
cd cull
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

Prerequisites: Rust 1.95.0 and Node.js 20.20.2. The repository pins these versions in `rust-toolchain.toml`, `.node-version`, and `.nvmrc`; see [Toolchain](docs/toolchain.md).

Useful checks:

```bash
npm run preflight -- hook
npm run preflight -- quick
npm run preflight -- full
npm run audit:licenses
```

## Tech Stack

Tauri 2, Rust, Svelte 5, SQLite, ONNX Runtime, and a Tokyo Night-inspired interface.
