A small, self-hosted, **read-only dashboard for [TeslaMate](https://github.com/teslamate-org/teslamate)**.
It connects to your existing TeslaMate Postgres database and renders a clean, map-first view of your
driving and charging history. One static Go binary, one container, no second database, and nothing is
ever written back to TeslaMate.

**▶ [Try the live demo](https://demo.teslamate.maslowski.cloud)** — no install, running in demo mode with synthetic data.

## Features

- **Map-first.** Every drive is drawn from its GPS trace and **colored by speed** (a light-to-deep
  blue ramp with a white casing), so you can read where you go fast and where you crawl at a glance.
- **Presentation mode.** Tick any drives and charges in the activity feed to **isolate them on the
  map** — build the exact route you want to walk someone through, then Focus map to frame it.
  Shift-click range-selects; **Share** serializes the selection into a URL you can send around.
- **Detail panels.** Click any drive — in the feed, or its route on the map — for a stat grid,
  state-of-charge bar, and a **speed + battery chart** over the trip. Click a charge (or its marker)
  for the real **charging curve** (power vs. state of charge) with peak/avg/min power and range
  added. Step through activities with ‹ › without leaving the panel.
- **Trip summary.** Turn a selection into a route-planner-style itinerary: departure → drive legs →
  charge stops (with SoC bars and energy) → arrival, plus drive/charge time totals.
- **Activity feed.** Drives and charging sessions merged newest-first, with type filters
  (All / Drives / Charging) and an eye toggle that hides home & destination charging from both the
  list and the map.
- **Charge classification.** Supercharger stops (DC fast charging), home charging (inside a named
  geofence), and destination charging are told apart from the data, not hardcoded, and get distinct
  markers.
- **KPI cards.** Distance, drives, energy, and efficiency for the range — each with a delta against
  the prior period of equal length and a sparkline of the trend.
- **Any timeframe.** All time, last year, 90 days, 30 days, or a custom From/To range with quick
  presets.
- **Per-car.** Multi-car aware; pick a vehicle in the header and the whole dashboard filters to it.
- **Speaks your language.** The UI ships in 16 languages — English, German, French, Spanish,
  Italian, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Finnish, Polish, Portuguese, Simplified Chinese,
  Japanese, Korean, and Russian. It follows your browser on the first visit; a globe button in the
  header switches it and remembers your choice.


## Quick start (demo, no database)

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t teslamate-dash .
docker run --rm -p 4001:4001 teslamate-dash
# open http://localhost:4001  (DEMO mode with synthetic data)
```

Or with Go (1.22+) and Node (20+):

```bash
(cd src/web && npm install && npm run build)   # build the embedded UI first
go run ./src      # demo mode when no DATABASE_HOST/TC_DSN is set
```

### Published image

Multi-arch images (linux/amd64 and linux/arm64) are published to GHCR on every release:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 4001:4001 ghcr.io/gmaslowski/teslamate-dash:latest
# or pin a version: ghcr.io/gmaslowski/teslamate-dash:0.4.0
```

Tags: `latest` (tip of `main`), `X.Y.Z` / `X.Y` / `X` (semver from git tags), and `sha-<commit>`.

## Connect to your TeslaMate database

Run it on the same Docker network as TeslaMate so it can reach Postgres. It reuses TeslaMate's
`DATABASE_*` variables, so usually you only set the password.

```bash
docker run --rm -p 4001:4001 \
  --network teslamate_default \
  -e DATABASE_HOST=database \
  -e DATABASE_USER=teslamate_ro \
  -e DATABASE_PASS=secret \
  -e DATABASE_NAME=teslamate \
  teslamate-dash
```

Or add it to your existing TeslaMate `docker-compose.yml` as another service:

```yaml
  dash:
    build:                    # or image: ghcr.io/youruser/teslamate-dash
      context: ./teslamate-dash
      dockerfile: docker/Dockerfile
    environment:
      - DATABASE_HOST=database
      - DATABASE_USER=teslamate_ro
      - DATABASE_PASS=${TM_DB_PASS}
      - DATABASE_NAME=teslamate
      - TC_UNITS=km
    ports:
      - 4001:4001
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Use a read-only database role (recommended)

The app forces read-only sessions, but a dedicated read-only role is the right belt-and-braces move:

```sql
CREATE ROLE teslamate_ro WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'secret';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE teslamate TO teslamate_ro;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO teslamate_ro;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO teslamate_ro;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO teslamate_ro;
```

### Deploy with Helm (Kubernetes)

A minimal self-contained chart. Create a `teslamate-dash/` directory with these four files:

`teslamate-dash/Chart.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: teslamate-dash
description: Read-only dashboard for TeslaMate
type: application
version: 0.1.0
appVersion: "0.4.0"
```

`teslamate-dash/values.yaml`

```yaml
image:
  repository: ghcr.io/gmaslowski/teslamate-dash
  tag: "0.4.0"
service:
  port: 4001
# Non-secret settings (reuses TeslaMate's DATABASE_* names).
env:
  DATABASE_HOST: teslamate-db
  DATABASE_NAME: teslamate
  DATABASE_USER: teslamate_ro
  TC_UNITS: km
# DB password is read from an existing Secret (create it separately, see below).
dbPasswordSecret:
  name: teslamate-dash-db
  key: password
```

`teslamate-dash/templates/deployment.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels: { app: {{ .Release.Name }} }
  template:
    metadata:
      labels: { app: {{ .Release.Name }} }
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: teslamate-dash
          image: "{{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.image.tag }}"
          ports:
            - containerPort: 4001
          env:
            {{- range $k, $v := .Values.env }}
            - name: {{ $k }}
              value: {{ $v | quote }}
            {{- end }}
            - name: DATABASE_PASS
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: {{ .Values.dbPasswordSecret.name }}
                  key: {{ .Values.dbPasswordSecret.key }}
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet: { path: /, port: 4001 }
          securityContext:
            runAsNonRoot: true
            allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
            readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
            capabilities: { drop: ["ALL"] }
```

`teslamate-dash/templates/service.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}
spec:
  selector: { app: {{ .Release.Name }} }
  ports:
    - port: {{ .Values.service.port }}
      targetPort: 4001
```

Create the DB password Secret, then install (use the read-only role from above):

```bash
kubectl create secret generic teslamate-dash-db --from-literal=password='secret'
helm install teslamate-dash ./teslamate-dash
# reach it: kubectl port-forward svc/teslamate-dash 4001:4001
```

Add an Ingress (or set `service.type: LoadBalancer`) to expose it beyond the cluster. For SSL to the
database, set `TC_DSN` under `env` instead of the `DATABASE_*` parts.

### Not using Docker?

Any reachable Postgres works. For a database that lives elsewhere (a remote host, a Kubernetes
cluster, etc.), expose it to the dashboard however you normally would (for example a port-forward to
`localhost:5432`) and point the variables below at it. Use `TC_DSN` if you need SSL.

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables. `TC_`-prefixed names override the plain TeslaMate ones.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_HOST` / `TC_DATABASE_HOST` | (none) | TeslaMate Postgres host. Empty means demo mode. |
| `DATABASE_PORT` / `TC_DATABASE_PORT` | `5432` | Postgres port |
| `DATABASE_NAME` / `TC_DATABASE_NAME` | `teslamate` | Database name |
| `DATABASE_USER` / `TC_DATABASE_USER` | `teslamate` | DB user (use a read-only role) |
| `DATABASE_PASS` / `TC_DATABASE_PASS` | (none) | DB password |
| `TC_DSN` | (none) | Full `postgres://...` connection string, overrides the parts above (set `sslmode` here) |
| `TC_PORT` | `4001` | HTTP port |
| `TC_UNITS` | `km` | `km` or `mi` |
| `TC_TITLE` | `TeslaMate Dash` | Header title |
| `TC_MAP_STYLE_URL` | OpenFreeMap Positron | MapLibre style URL. Point at your own tiles for full privacy. |
| `TC_DEMO` | auto | Force synthetic data on or off |

### Languages

The UI ships in 16 languages, listed under [Features](#features). The first visit follows the browser
language; the globe button next to the theme toggle changes it and remembers the choice. Each
translation is its own JSON file under `src/web/src/locales/`, and English is the fallback, so an
untranslated key renders in English rather than as a missing label. Detection, plural forms, and
persistence are handled by a small built-in helper with no i18n dependency; changing the language
reloads the page.

## Privacy

This data is your home address, geofences, and full movement history. The app is built to keep it yours:

- **Read-only.** Sessions are forced read-only and it never writes to TeslaMate.
- **No telemetry, no analytics, no outbound calls from the server.**
- **Local rendering.** The one external request a browser makes is for **basemap tiles** from
  `TC_MAP_STYLE_URL`. Point that at a self-hosted tile server if you do not want a third party to see
  which areas you pan to.
- Coordinates are never logged. Keep your fork private if you commit any of your own data.

## How it works

A single Go binary embeds the built web UI and talks to Postgres over a read-only `pgx` pool. The
frontend is React + TypeScript (Vite) with MapLibre GL; position traces are simplified server-side
(Douglas-Peucker) so map payloads stay small even for six-hour drives.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/main.go` | HTTP server, graceful shutdown, embeds `src/web/dist` |
| `src/config.go` | Environment configuration |
| `src/model.go` | Types, the `Store` interface, trace simplification |
| `src/db.go` | Read-only pgx pool and all SQL (the only file that touches Postgres) |
| `src/demo.go` | Synthetic data so it runs with no database |
| `src/handlers.go` | JSON API (`/api/config`, `/api/cars`, `/api/summary`, `/api/activities`, `/api/activities/{id}`) |
| `src/web/` | React + Vite + TypeScript frontend, built to `src/web/dist` |
| `docker/` | Dockerfile and its dockerignore |

## Development

```bash
(cd src/web && npm install && npm run build)   # required once before go build/run
go mod tidy
go run ./src             # demo mode if no DATABASE_HOST
# point at a database:
DATABASE_HOST=localhost DATABASE_PASS=secret go run ./src
```

For frontend work, run the API and the Vite dev server side by side; Vite proxies `/api` to `:4001`:

```bash
go run ./src                 # terminal 1
cd src/web && npm run dev    # terminal 2, open the printed URL
```

The Docker image always builds with the **repo root as context** (`docker build -f docker/Dockerfile .`);
the frontend is built inside the image, so no local `npm` run is needed for container builds. BuildKit
(the default builder since Docker 23) automatically applies `docker/Dockerfile.dockerignore`.

Tested against the TeslaMate schema tables `drives`, `positions`, `charging_processes`, `charges`,
`addresses`, `geofences`, `cars`. The app checks these exist on startup and fails with a clear message
if your TeslaMate version differs.
