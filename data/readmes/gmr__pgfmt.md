# pgfmt

A PostgreSQL SQL formatter with multiple style options.

[![Testing](https://github.com/gmr/pgfmt/actions/workflows/testing.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gmr/pgfmt/actions/workflows/testing.yaml)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/gmr/pgfmt)](https://github.com/gmr/pgfmt/blob/main/LICENSE)

pgfmt is a small command-line wrapper around
[libpgfmt](https://crates.io/crates/libpgfmt), a Rust library that parses SQL
with [tree-sitter-postgres](https://crates.io/crates/tree-sitter-postgres) and
reformats it according to one of several well-known style guides.

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```bash
brew tap gmr/postgres
brew install pgfmt
```

> [!NOTE]
> Homebrew 6.0 added [tap trust](https://docs.brew.sh/Tap-Trust), and some
> versions fail to install third-party taps inside the build sandbox (the
> error mentions `build.rb ... exited with 1`). If you hit this, trust the
> formula first:
>
> ```bash
> brew trust --formula gmr/postgres/pgfmt
> ```
>
> or, as a temporary workaround, set `HOMEBREW_NO_REQUIRE_TAP_TRUST=1` for
> the install.

### Quick Install (Linux / macOS)

```

### Install a Specific Version

```bash
VERSION=v1.0.0 curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gmr/pgfmt/main/install.sh | sh
```

### Download Binaries

Pre-built binaries for Linux and macOS (x86_64 and aarch64) are available on
the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gmr/pgfmt/releases) page.

## Usage

```bash
# Format a file (default: aweber style)
pgfmt query.sql

# Format from stdin
echo "SELECT a,b FROM t WHERE x=1" | pgfmt

# Choose a style
pgfmt --style mozilla query.sql
pgfmt --style dbt query.sql

# Round-trip pg_dump / pg_get_viewdef output
pg_dump --schema-only mydb | pgfmt --style pg_dump

# Check if already formatted (exit 1 if not)
pgfmt --check query.sql
```

### aweber (default)

Based on river style with JOINs as river keywords. INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN,
etc. participate in river alignment. Uppercase keywords.

```sql
    SELECT r.last_name
      FROM riders AS r
INNER JOIN bikes AS b
        ON r.bike_vin_num = b.vin_num
       AND b.engines > 2;
```

### dbt

Based on [dbt Labs' SQL style](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/2-how-we-style-our-sql).
Lowercase keywords, 4-space indent, blank lines between clauses, generous
whitespace. Explicit join types.

```sql
select
    a.title,
    a.release_date

from albums as a

where
    a.title = 'Charcoal Lane'
    or a.title = 'The New Danger'
```

### gitlab

Based on the [GitLab SQL Style Guide](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/enterprise-data/platform/sql-style-guide/).
Uppercase keywords, 2-space indent, blank lines inside CTE bodies.

```sql
SELECT
  a.title,
  a.release_date
FROM albums AS a
WHERE
  a.title = 'Charcoal Lane'
  OR a.title = 'The New Danger';
```

### kickstarter

Based on the [Kickstarter SQL Style Guide](https://gist.github.com/fredbenenson/7bb92718e19138c20591).
Uppercase keywords, 2-space indent, JOIN ON on same line, compact CTE chaining.

```sql
SELECT
  a.title,
  a.release_date
FROM albums AS a
INNER JOIN orders AS o ON a.id = o.album_id
WHERE
  a.title = 'Charcoal Lane'
  AND a.year > 2000;
```

### mattmc3

Based on the [Modern SQL Style Guide](https://gist.github.com/mattmc3/38a85e6a4ca1093816c08d4815fbebfb)
by mattmc3. Lowercase river-style with leading commas. Uses plain `join`
instead of `inner join`.

```sql
select a.title
     , a.release_date
  from albums as a
  join orders as o
    on a.id = o.album_id
 where a.title = 'Charcoal Lane'
   and a.year > 2000;
```

### mozilla

Based on the [Mozilla SQL Style Guide](https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/concepts/sql_style).
Keywords left-aligned at column 0, content indented 4 spaces underneath.
One item per line. Uppercase keywords.

```sql
SELECT
    a.title,
    a.release_date
FROM albums AS a
WHERE
    a.title = 'Charcoal Lane'
    OR a.title = 'The New Danger';
```

### pg_dump

Mimics PostgreSQL's internal `ruleutils.c` deparser — the layout emitted by
`pg_dump`, `pg_get_viewdef`, and `pg_get_functiondef`. Uppercase keywords,
leading-space indentation, lowercase built-in functions. The correctness bar
is byte-identical round-tripping of genuine deparser output. Also accepts
`pgdump` and `postgres` as aliases.

```sql
 SELECT u.email,
    count(*) AS n,
    sum(o.total) AS revenue
   FROM app.users u
     JOIN app.orders o ON o.user_id = u.id
  WHERE o.placed_at > (now() - '30 days'::interval)
  GROUP BY u.email
 HAVING sum(o.total) > 100::numeric
  ORDER BY (sum(o.total)) DESC;
```

### river

Based on [sqlstyle.guide](https://www.sqlstyle.guide/) by Simon Holywell.
Keywords are right-aligned to form a visual "river" separating keywords from
content. Uppercase keywords.

```sql
SELECT a.title,
       a.release_date
  FROM albums AS a
 WHERE a.title = 'Charcoal Lane'
    OR a.title = 'The New Danger';
```
