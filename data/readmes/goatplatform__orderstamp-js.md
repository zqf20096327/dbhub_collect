# Orderstamp

Orderstamp is a TypeScript utility for maintaining large ordered lists in
databases with minimal write operations. It provides efficient, string-based
ordering suitable for any database supporting string sorting.

---
> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Ensure your database is configured to use _lexicographical_ (string) ordering on the order stamp column.**
>
> Orderstamp relies on string sorting for correct ordering. If your database uses numeric or other types of sorting on the order stamp column, the ordering will be incorrect. Always use a string/text/varchar type and verify that queries sort the column lexicographically.

## Overview

Traditional approaches to ordered lists in databases are inefficient:

- Storing the entire list as a single row does not scale.
- Using integer order columns requires O(n) writes for insertions.

Orderstamp addresses these issues by:

- Enabling O(1) writes for insertions, deletions, and moves.
- Requiring only a standard string index for ordered queries.
- Avoiding reindexing or mass updates when changing item positions.

Orderstamp is database-agnostic and works with any system that supports string
sorting.

## API Reference

| Function    | Purpose                           | Use Case                      |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `start()`   | Stamp for the start of the list   | Prepend item                  |
| `end()`     | Stamp for the end of the list     | Append item                   |
| `from()`    | Encode a number as an order stamp | Numeric ordering, custom keys |
| `between()` | Stamp between two existing stamps | Insert between two items      |

### `start()`

Returns a monotonically decreasing order stamp for the start of the list. Uses
the negative of the current timestamp to ensure new items are ordered before
existing ones.

### `end()`

Returns a monotonically increasing order stamp for the end of the list. Uses the
current timestamp to ensure new items are ordered after existing ones.

### `from(value: number, key?: string, collisionProbability: number = 64): string`

Encodes a numeric value (and optional key) as an order stamp. Maintains numeric
order in string form.

- `value`: Number to encode.
- `key`: Optional unique identifier. If omitted, a random suffix is generated.
- `collisionProbability`: Power-of-2 collision probability (default: 64, i.e.,
  2^-64).

### `between(prev: string, next: string, count: number = 1, index: number = 0, collisionProbability: number = 64): string`

Generates a stamp lexicographically between two existing stamps. Supports single
and bulk insertions.

- `prev`: First order stamp.
- `next`: Second order stamp.
- `count`: Number of stamps to generate (for bulk allocation, default: 1).
- `index`: Zero-based index for bulk allocation (default: 0).
- `collisionProbability`: Power-of-2 collision probability (default: 64).

Throws if `prev` and `next` are identical, or if `count`/`index` are out of
range.

#### Usage

- Single insertion: `between(prev, next)`
- Bulk allocation: `between(prev, next, N, i)` for `i` in `0..N-1`

## String Growth and Bulk Allocation

Repeated insertions between two stamps can increase stamp length. To manage
this:

- Use `start()` and `end()` periodically to reset boundaries and keep stamp
  lengths short.
- For many insertions between the same two points, use bulk allocation:

```ts
// Inefficient (causes stamp growth):
let s = prev;
for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  s = between(s, next);
}

// Efficient (prevents growth):
for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  const stamp = between(prev, next, N, i);
}
```

## Performance

Benchmarks (Deno, 1000 iterations):

| Operation                  | Avg Time | Description                    |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| `start()`                  | 20.10µs  | Generate start stamp           |
| `end()`                    | 16.22µs  | Generate end stamp             |
| `from()`                   | 16.36µs  | Encode number as stamp         |
| `between()` (close values) | 39.45µs  | Insert between adjacent stamps |

### Stamp Length (Best Practices)

| Metric       | Bulk (100) | Seq+Reset (1000) | Bulk+Reset (10×50) |
| ------------ | :--------: | :--------------: | :----------------: |
| Avg length   |     42     |      22.17       |         11         |
| Median (p50) |     42     |        20        |         11         |
| p90          |     42     |        38        |         11         |
| p95          |     42     |        41        |         11         |
| p99          |     42     |        48        |         11         |
| Min          |     42     |        11        |         11         |
| Max          |     42     |        52        |         11         |

- Bulk allocation keeps stamp lengths fixed.
- Periodic use of `start()`/`end()` prevents unbounded growth.
- `between()` is fast and suitable for frequent insertions.

```

### Benchmarks

Run benchmarks:

```bash
deno run benchmarks.ts
```

## Customizing the Clock Source

Orderstamp uses `Date.now()` by default to generate timestamps. For testing,
distributed systems, or advanced use cases, you can override the clock function.
This allows integration with distributed clocks (such as Google TrueTime or
other synchronized time sources) in backend environments, ensuring globally
consistent ordering:

```ts
import {
  getNowFunction,
  newTimestamp,
  setNowFunction,
} from "@goatdb/orderstamp";

// Save the original clock function
const originalNow = getNowFunction();

// Set a custom clock (e.g., from a distributed time API)
setNowFunction(() => getTrueTimeMillis());
console.log(newTimestamp()); // Uses your distributed clock

// Restore the original clock
setNowFunction(originalNow);
```

- `setNowFunction(fn: () => number)`: Sets the function used to get the current
  time (in ms).
- `getNowFunction()`: Returns the current clock function.

This is especially useful for deterministic tests, simulating time in
benchmarks, or integrating with distributed clocks in backend environments.
