MCP Toolbox for Databases is an open source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects your AI agents, IDEs, and applications directly to your enterprise databases. 

<p align="center">
<img src="docs/en/documentation/introduction/architecture.png" alt="architecture" width="50%"/>
</p>

It serves a **dual purpose**:
1. **Ready-to-use MCP Server (Build-Time):** Instantly connect Gemini CLI, Google Antigravity, Claude Code, Codex, or other MCP clients to your databases using our *prebuilt generic tools*. Talk to your data, explore schemas, and generate code without writing boilerplate.
2. **Custom Tools Framework (Run-Time):** A robust framework to build specialized, highly secure AI tools for your production agents. Define structured queries, semantic search, and NL2SQL capabilities safely and easily.


This README provides a brief overview. For comprehensive details, see the [full documentation](https://mcp-toolbox.dev/).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Repository Name Update:** The `genai-toolbox` repository has been officially renamed to `mcp-toolbox`. To ensure your local environment reflects the new name, you may update your remote:
> `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/googleapis/mcp-toolbox.git`

> [!NOTE]
> This solution was originally named “Gen AI Toolbox for Databases” (github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox) as its initial development predated MCP, but was renamed to align with the MCP compatibility.

## Why MCP Toolbox?

- **Out-of-the-Box Database Access:** Prebuilt generic tools for instant data exploration (e.g., `list_tables`, `execute_sql`) directly from your IDE or CLI.
- **Custom Tools Framework:** Build production-ready tools with your own predefined logic, ensuring safety through Restricted Access, Structured Queries, and Semantic Search.
- **Simplified Development:** Integrate tools into your Agent Development Kit (ADK), LangChain, LlamaIndex, or custom agents in less than 10 lines of code.
- **Better Performance:** Handles connection pooling, integrated auth (IAM), and end-to-end observability (OpenTelemetry) out of the box.
- **Enhanced Security**: Integrated authentication for more secure access to your data.
- **End-to-end Observability**: Out of the box metrics and tracing with built-in support for OpenTelemetry.

---

## Quick Start: Prebuilt Tools

Stop context-switching and let your AI assistant become a true co-developer. By connecting your IDE to your databases with MCP Toolbox, you can query your data in plain English, automate schema discovery and management, and generate database-aware code.

You can use the Toolbox in any MCP-compatible IDE or client (e.g., Gemini CLI, Google Antigravity, Claude Code, Codex, etc.) by configuring the MCP server.

**Prebuilt tools are also conveniently available via the [Google Antigravity MCP Store](https://antigravity.google/docs/mcp) with a simple click-to-install experience.**

1. Add the following to your client's MCP configuration file (usually `mcp.json` or `claude_desktop_config.json`):

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "toolbox-postgres": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "-y",
            "@toolbox-sdk/server",
            "--prebuilt=postgres",
            "--stdio"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

2. Set the appropriate environment variables to connect, see the [Prebuilt Tools Reference](https://mcp-toolbox.dev/documentation/configuration/prebuilt-configs/).

When you run Toolbox with a `--prebuilt=<database>` flag, you instantly get access to standard tools to interact with that database. You can also specify a specific toolset using the `--prebuilt=<database>/<toolset>` syntax (e.g., `--prebuilt=postgres/data` to only load SQL tools). 

Supported databases currently include:
- **Google Cloud:** AlloyDB, BigQuery, Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server), Spanner, Firestore, Knowledge Catalog (formerly known as Dataplex).
- **Other Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, [MariaDB](https://mcp-toolbox.dev/integrations/mariadb/source/), SQL Server, Oracle, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, CockroachDB, ClickHouse, Couchbase, Neo4j, Snowflake, Trino, and more.

For a full list of available tools and their capabilities across all supported databases, see the [Prebuilt Tools Reference](https://mcp-toolbox.dev/documentation/configuration/prebuilt-configs/).

*See the [Install & Run the Toolbox server](#install--run-the-toolbox-server) section for different execution methods like Docker or binaries.*


> [!TIP]
> For users looking for a managed solution, [Google Cloud MCP Servers](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/managed-mcp-servers-for-google-cloud-databases) 
> provide a managed MCP experience with prebuilt tools; you can [learn more about the differences here](https://mcp-toolbox.dev/dev/reference/faq/).

<a id="configuration"></a>
## Quick Start: Custom Tools

Toolbox can also be used as a framework for customized tools.
The primary way to configure Toolbox is through the `tools.yaml` file. If you
have multiple files, you can tell Toolbox which to load with the `--config
tools.yaml` flag.

You can find more detailed reference documentation to all resource types in the
[Resources](https://mcp-toolbox.dev/documentation/configuration/).

### Sources

The `sources` section of your `tools.yaml` defines what data sources your
Toolbox should have access to. Most tools will have at least one source to
execute against.

```yaml
kind: source
name: my-pg-source
type: postgres
host: 127.0.0.1
port: 5432
database: toolbox_db
user: toolbox_user
password: my-password
```

For more details on configuring different types of sources, see the
[Sources](https://mcp-toolbox.dev/documentation/configuration/sources/).

### Tools

The `tools` section of a `tools.yaml` define the actions an agent can take: what
type of tool it is, which source(s) it affects, what parameters it uses, etc.

```yaml
kind: tool
name: search-hotels-by-name
type: postgres-sql
source: my-pg-source
description: Search for hotels based on name.
parameters:
  - name: name
    type: string
    description: The name of the hotel.
statement: SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE name ILIKE '%' || $1 || '%';
```

For more details on configuring different types of tools, see the
[Tools](https://mcp-toolbox.dev/documentation/configuration/tools/).

### Toolsets

The `toolsets` section of your `tools.yaml` allows you to define groups of tools
that you want to be able to load together. This can be useful for defining
different groups based on agent or application.

```yaml
kind: toolset
name: my_first_toolset
tools:
    - my_first_tool
    - my_second_tool
---
kind: toolset
name: my_second_toolset
tools:
    - my_second_tool
    - my_third_tool
```

### Prompts

The `prompts` section of a `tools.yaml` defines prompts that can be used for
interactions with LLMs.

```yaml
kind: prompt
name: code_review
description: "Asks the LLM to analyze code quality and suggest improvements."
messages:
  - content: >
         Please review the following code for quality, correctness,
         and potential improvements: \n\n{{.code}}
arguments:
  - name: "code"
    description: "The code to review"
```

For more details on configuring prompts, see the
[Prompts](https://mcp-toolbox.dev/documentation/configuration/prompts/).

### Resources

The `resources` and `resourceTemplates` sections of your `tools.yaml` define read-only
content, files, or parameterized directory trees that can be discovered and retrieved
by MCP clients:

```yaml
kind: resource
name: database_schema_ddl
type: text
description: "Core table definitions and constraints."
mimeType: text/x-sql
text: |
  CREATE TABLE customers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL
  );
---
kind: resource
name: database_schema
type: file
description: "PostgreSQL schema definition."
path: "./schema.sql"
---
kind: resourceTemplate
name: server_logs
type: file
description: "Application log files."
uriTemplate: "file:///var/log/{path}"
allowedPaths:
  - "/var/log"
```

For more details on configuring resources and resource templates, see
[Resources](https://mcp-toolbox.dev/documentation/configuration/resources/).

---

## Install & Run the Toolbox server

You can run Toolbox directly with a [configuration file](#quick-start-custom-tools):

```sh
npx @toolbox-sdk/server --config tools.yaml
```

This runs the latest version of the Toolbox server with your configuration file.

> [!NOTE]
> This method is optimized for convenience rather than performance. 
> For a more standard and reliable installation, please use the binary
> or container image as described in [Install & Run the Toolbox server](#install--run-the-toolbox-server).

execute `toolbox` to start the server:

<details open>
<summary>Binary</summary>

To run Toolbox from binary:

```sh
./toolbox --config "tools.yaml"
```

> ⓘ Note  
> Toolbox enables dynamic reloading by default. To disable, use the
> `--disable-reload` flag.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Container image</summary>

To run the server after pulling the [container image](#install-toolbox):

```sh
export VERSION=0.24.0 # Use the version you pulled
docker run -p 5000:5000 \
-v $(pwd)/tools.yaml:/app/tools.yaml \
us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/database-toolbox/toolbox/toolbox:$VERSION \
--config "/app/tools.yaml"
```

> ⓘ Note  
> The `-v` flag mounts your local `tools.yaml` into the container, and `-p` maps
> the container's port `5000` to your host's port `5000`.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Source</summary>

To run the server directly from source, navigate to the project root directory
and run:

```sh
go run .
```

> ⓘ Note  
> This command runs the project from source, and is more suitable for development
> and testing. It does **not** compile a binary into your `$GOPATH`. If you want
> to compile a binary instead, refer the [Developer
> Documentation](./DEVELOPER.md#building-the-binary).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Homebrew</summary>

If you installed Toolbox using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), the `toolbox`
binary is available in your system path. You can start the server with the same
command:

```sh
toolbox --config "tools.yaml"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>NPM</summary>

To run Toolbox directly without manually downloading the binary (requires Node.js):
```sh
npx @toolbox-sdk/server --config tools.yaml
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>Gemini CLI</summary>
After installing a [Gemini CLI extensions](https://geminicli.com/extensions/), the prebuilt tools will be available during use.

```sh
# Run Gemini CLI
gemini

# List extensions

## Connect to Toolbox

Once your Toolbox server is up and running, you can load tools into your MCP-compatible client or
application. 

### MCP Client

Add the following configuration to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "toolbox": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:5000/mcp",
    }
  }
}
```

If you would like to connect to a specific toolset, replace url with "http://127.0.0.1:5000/mcp/{toolset_name}".

## Additional Features

### Test tools with the Toolbox UI

To launch Toolbox's interactive UI, use the `--ui` flag. This allows you to test
tools and toolsets with features such as authorized parameters. To learn more,
visit [Toolbox UI](https://mcp-toolbox.dev/documentation/configuration/toolbox-ui/).

```sh
./toolbox --ui
```

### Telemetry

Toolbox emits traces and metrics via OpenTelemetry. Use `--telemetry-otlp=<endpoint>` 
to export to any OTLP-compatible backend like Google Cloud Monitoring, Agnost AI, or 
others. See the [telemetry docs](https://mcp-toolbox.dev/documentation/monitoring/export_telemetry/) for details.

### Generate Agent Skills

The `skills-generate` command allows you to convert a **toolset** into an **Agent Skill** compatible with the [Agent Skill specification](https://agentskills.io/specification). This is useful for distributing tools as portable skill packages.

```bash
toolbox --config tools.yaml skills-generate \
  --name "my-skill" \
  --toolset "my_toolset" \
  --description "A skill containing multiple tools"
```

Once generated, you can install the skill into the Gemini CLI:

```bash
gemini skills install ./skills/my-skill
```

For more details, see the [Generate Agent Skills guide](https://mcp-toolbox.dev/documentation/configuration/skills/).

The repository also ships ready-to-use Agent Skills (e.g. maintainer workflows). See [`skills/`](./skills/README.md) for the catalog and install instructions.
