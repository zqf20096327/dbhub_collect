_A town full of busy little guys who do things_

**busytown** is a multi-agent factory built around a SQLite event queue. It can be used standalone, or as a [Pi](https://github.com/nichochar/pi-coding-agent) extension.

Agents listen for events, react to them, and publish new events, forming asynchronous assembly lines. Agents don't need to know about other agents, just about events.

<p><img src="./busytown.png" src="A town full of busy little guys who do things" /></p>

## How it works

Everything is stored in a single SQLite database (`.pi/busytown/events.db`).
Events are simple JSON objects:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "type": "plan.request",
  "timestamp": 1709568000,
  "agent_id": "user",
  "payload": { "prd_path": "docs/feature.md" }
}
```

The agent system polls the queue and dispatches events to matching agents.
Agents run in parallel, processesing the events they care about, one at a time,
in order. Each agent:

- **Listens** for specific event types (exact match or glob like `task.*`)
- **Reacts** by reading files, writing code, producing artifacts
- **Publishes** new events to notify other agents of what it did
- **Claims** events when needed, so only one agent acts on a given event

## Getting started

### Install as a pi package

```bash
# Project-local (shared with your team via .pi/settings.json)
pi install -l npm:busytown-pi

# Global (available in all projects)
pi install npm:busytown-pi

# Or try it for a single session
pi -e npm:busytown-pi
```

### Install via npm (standalone CLI)

```bash
npm install -g busytown-pi
```

### Directory structure

```
your-project/
├── .pi/
│   ├── settings.json    # Package config (if using pi install -l)
│   ├── agents/          # Agent definitions (markdown files)
│   └── busytown/
│       ├── events.db    # SQLite event queue (auto-created)
│       └── memory_blocks/  # Persistent memory (per-agent, per-block)
```

## Building an agent factory

The Busytown package comes with a handful of agent factories in the `examples` directory.

To get started with the plan → code → review ralph loop example, copy the agents from `examples/ralph/agents` to `.pi/agents/`:

```bash
cp -r node_modules/busytown-pi/examples/ralph/agents .pi/agents
```

Then open Pi. You'll see your agents listed above the input field.

```
pi
```

Ask the agent to fire off an event:

```
Publish a "plan.request" message with payload '{"prd_path": "docs/add-auth.md"}'
```

This triggers the ralph loop: plan → code → review → plan... repeat until approved.

### Writing your own agents

An agent is just a markdown file in `.pi/agents/`. The filename becomes the agent's
ID (e.g., `summarizer.md` → agent ID `summarizer`).

```markdown
---
listen:
  - "task.created"
tools:
  - read
  - write
---

When you receive a `task.created` event, read the file at
`payload.file_path` and summarize it to `summaries/<name>.md`.

Then publish a `task.summarized` event.
```

### Frontmatter fields

| Field         | Type                                            | Default | Description                                          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`        | `"pi"` \| `"pi-rpc"` \| `"shell"` \| `"claude"` | `"pi"`  | Agent type                                           |
| `name`        | `string`                                        | ""      | Name of the agent                                    |
| `description` | `string`                                        | `""`    | What this agent does                                 |
| `listen`      | `string[]`                                      | `[]`    | Event patterns to listen for                         |
| `emits`       | `string[]`                                      | `[]`    | Event types this agent can emit (documentation only) |
| `ignore_self` | `boolean`                                       | `true`  | Ignore events this agent emitted                     |
| `tools`       | `string[]`                                      | `[]`    | Pi tools available to the agent                      |
| `model`       | `string`                                        | —       | Model override (e.g., `"opus"`, `"sonnet:high"`)     |
| `hooks`       | `Record<string, string>`                        | —       | Shell scripts to run during pi lifecycle events      |

### Agent types

All agent types share a common `AgentProcess` interface—`stream(event)` returns a `ReadableStream` of response events, `disposed` signals teardown, and `[Symbol.asyncDispose]()` cleans up. This means short-lived and long-lived agents are interchangeable within the system.

**Pi agents** (`type: "pi"`, the default) are short-lived: a fresh `pi --mode json`
subprocess is spawned for each event. The event JSON is piped to stdin, and the
agent's markdown body becomes its system prompt. The process exits after
responding. Pi agents have no memory of previous invocations beyond their
memory blocks.

**Pi RPC agents** (`type: "pi-rpc"`) are long-lived: a single Pi process is
spawned and kept alive across invocations. Events are sent as RPC commands over
stdin, and responses stream back. This preserves the full conversation context
between events, making it suitable for agents that need continuity.

**Shell agents** (`type: "shell"`) run the body as a shell script via `sh -c`.
The body is rendered as a Mustache-style template with access to the triggering
event:

- `{{event.type}}` — shell-escaped value (safe by default)
- `{{{event.payload.path}}}` — raw value (no escaping)
- Dot paths walk nested objects. Missing keys resolve to empty string.

**Claude agents** (`type: "claude"`) spawn the `claude` CLI in headless mode.
The agent's markdown body becomes the system prompt, and the triggering event JSON is
passed as the user prompt on stdin. Tools are allow-listed through the `tools` field, just like with Pi agents, but use the Claude tool set and tool name conventions (uppercase tool names).

### Event patterns

The `listen` field supports:

- `"task.created"` — exact match
- `"task.*"` — prefix match (matches `task.created`, `task.updated`, etc.)
- `"*"` — match all events

### Hooks

Pi agents can run shell commands at specific points in the Pi lifecycle. Add a
`hooks` map to the agent's frontmatter, keyed by the lifecycle event name:

```markdown
---
listen:
  - "task.*"
hooks:
  session_start: echo "session started at $(date)"
  before_agent_start: cat context.json
  tool_call: |
    if [ "{{{toolName}}}" = "bash" ]; then
      echo "blocked" >&2; exit 1
    fi
---
```

Hook values are shell commands executed via `sh -c`. They support Mustache-style
template variables (`{{{var}}}` for raw, `{{var}}` for shell-escaped) with
access to context like `cwd`, `model`, `timestamp`, and hook-specific extras
(e.g., `turnIndex`, `toolName`, `prompt`).

| Hook                     | Behavior        | Extras                                        |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `session_start`          | fire-and-forget |                                               |
| `session_shutdown`       | fire-and-forget |                                               |
| `session_before_switch`  | cancellation    | `reason`                                      |
| `session_switch`         | fire-and-forget | `reason`, `previousSessionFile`               |
| `session_before_fork`    | cancellation    | `entryId`                                     |
| `session_fork`           | fire-and-forget | `previousSessionFile`                         |
| `session_before_compact` | cancellation    |                                               |
| `session_compact`        | fire-and-forget |                                               |
| `session_before_tree`    | cancellation    |                                               |
| `session_tree`           | fire-and-forget |                                               |
| `before_agent_start`     | inject message  | `prompt`                                      |
| `agent_start`            | fire-and-forget |                                               |
| `agent_end`              | fire-and-forget |                                               |
| `turn_start`             | fire-and-forget | `turnIndex`                                   |
| `turn_end`               | fire-and-forget | `turnIndex`                                   |
| `tool_call`              | blocking        | `toolName`, `toolCallId`                      |
| `tool_result`            | fire-and-forget | `toolName`, `toolCallId`, `isError`           |
| `input`                  | fire-and-forget | `text`, `source`, `prompt`                    |
| `model_select`           | fire-and-forget | `source`, `previousModel`, `previousProvider` |

- **fire-and-forget** — The command runs; its exit code is ignored.
- **cancellation** — A non-zero exit code cancels the operation.
- **blocking** — A non-zero exit code blocks the tool call. The stderr output
  is returned as the block reason.
- **inject message** — If the command exits 0, its stdout is injected as a
  custom message into the conversation.

All hooks share a base set of template variables: `cwd`, `sessionFile`, `model`,
`provider`, and `timestamp`.

### Memory blocks

Agents can have [Letta-style](https://docs.letta.com/guides/core-concepts/memory/memory-blocks/) memory blocks that persist across invocations. This lets the agent learn and grow a personality over time. Memory block schemas are defined in agent frontmatter, and block values are stored as separate files under `.pi/busytown/memory_blocks/<agent_id>/<block_key>.md`.

You can define any number of custom memory blocks. Two common blocks are `user` and `agent`, which help the agent learn about the user and grow a personality:

```markdown
---
name: "wintermute"
listen:
  - "task.*"
memory_blocks:
  user:
    description: "Key facts about the user and their preferences"
    char_limit: 2000
  agent:
    description: "Your role, personality, and preferences"
    char_limit: 4000
---

You are an AI at Tessier-Ashpool...
```

The block values live at `.pi/busytown/memory_blocks/wintermute/user.md` and
`.pi/busytown/memory_blocks/wintermute/agent.md`. They’re created automatically
on first run and updated as the agent learns.

Memory block fields (frontmatter):

| Field         | Type     | Default | Description                            |
| ------------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `description` | `string` | `""`    | What this block is for                 |
| `char_limit`  | `number` | `2000`  | Maximum characters stored in the block |

Block values are stored separately at `.pi/busytown/memory_blocks/<agent_id>/<block_key>.md`, keeping agent definition files clean and making blocks easy to inspect or edit directly.

## Tools & commands

Busytown registers several additional tools for agents:

| Tool               | Description                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `busytown-publish` | Publish an event to the queue       |
| `busytown-events`  | List recent events (with filtering) |
| `busytown-claim`   | Claim an event for exclusive access |

You can manually call these tools, plus a few additional commands, from the Pi console.

| Command             | Detail                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/busytown-publish` | `/busytown-publish plan.request '{"prd_path": "docs/feature.md"}'` |
| `/busytown-events`  | `/busytown-events --tail 10 --type plan.*`                         |
| `/busytown-claim`   | `/busytown-claim 42 my-agent`                                      |
| `/busytown-console` | Display the event console                                          |
| `/busytown-start`   | Start the daemon (run automatically when Pi starts)                |
| `/busytown-stop`    | Stop the daemon                                                    |
| `/busytown-reload`  | Reload agent definitions (sends `sys.reload` event)                |

## Interactive agent mode

You can boot Pi as a specific agent persona using the `--agent` flag:

```bash
pi --agent code
```

This loads the agent definition from `.pi/agents/code.md` and:

- **Injects the agent's system prompt** (body + memory blocks) on every turn
- **Switches the model** to the agent's configured model (e.g. `sonnet`)
- **Registers the `update-memory` tool** if the agent has memory blocks
- **Wires up lifecycle hooks** defined in the agent's frontmatter
- **Shows a status indicator** (`🤖 code`) so you know which persona is active

All standard Pi tools remain available alongside the busytown tools. This is
useful for debugging an agent interactively, or for working as a specific
persona with its own memory and system prompt.

```bash
# Work as the plan agent
pi --agent plan

# Work as the review agent
pi --agent review
```

## Standalone CLI

Busytown also includes a standalone CLI. This lets you drive Busytown outside of Pi. You can use the CLI to script agent factories via cron, email, git hooks, etc.

```bash
# Start the agent system (daemon)
busytown start

# Publish an event
busytown publish --agent my-script --type plan.request --payload '{"key":"value"}'

# List events
busytown events --tail 10 --type plan.*

# List loaded agents
busytown agents

# Claim an event
busytown claim --agent my-agent --event 42

# Check who claimed an event
busytown check-claim --event 42
```

## Key concepts

- **Cursor-based delivery** — Each agent maintains its own cursor. The cursor
  advances before processing, giving at-most-once delivery.
- **First-claim-wins** — When multiple agents listen for the same event type,
  `claimEvent()` ensures only one processes a given event.
- **Namespace wildcards** — Event types use dot-separated namespaces. Listen for
  `file.*` to catch `file.create`, `file.modify`, etc.
- **Agents are just markdown** — Agent definitions are markdown files with YAML
  frontmatter. Easy to version, review, and iterate on.
- **No agent coupling** — Agents don't know about each other. They only know
  about events. Add, remove, or swap agents without changing anything else.
