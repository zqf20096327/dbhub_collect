# Second Brain

Persistent memory and a working protocol for **any AI agent**: an
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)-compatible vault of Markdown notes plus a small,
standard-library-only Python engine with a SQLite FTS5 search index and a git-synced repo.
Notes survive across sessions and machines, and a lightweight protocol tells the agent how
to search that memory, isolate its work and write back what it learned.

It is **agent-agnostic**. The knowledge and the engine are plain files and stdlib Python;
agents connect through thin integrations: an MCP server, a CLI, or a native Claude Code
layer. Swap the agent, keep the brain.

## Why

Agents start every session with a blank slate. They forget the decision you made last
week, the convention this repo follows, and who the people and systems in your world are.
This project gives an agent two things:

- **Persistent memory**: durable notes (decisions, conventions, how-tos, project state,
  people and systems) that outlive any single session.
- **A working protocol**: a repeatable loop that searches the vault for context first,
  works in isolation, then saves what changed.

## Ways to connect your agent

The vault is the same for all of them; pick whichever your assistant speaks.

| Integration | For | Setup |
|---|---|---|
| **[MCP server](integrations/mcp/)** | Any MCP agent: Claude Desktop, Cline, Cursor, Continue, Zed, Windsurf, OpenCode, your own client | Point it at `integrations/mcp/server.py` (the first run prints the snippets) |
| **[CLI](integrations/cli/)** | Any agent that can run a shell, and you at a terminal | Put `integrations/cli/brain` on your `PATH` |
| **[Claude Code](integrations/claude-code/)** | Automatic recall, agents, skills | `bash integrations/claude-code/install.sh` |

All of them drive the **same** `_bin/` engine, so redaction, locking, indexing and the
frontmatter contract hold no matter which agent is writing. Avoid running two write-back
integrations at once. [OpenCode](integrations/opencode/) has a worked example.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gotoalberto/second-brain-cc.git ~/Brain
bash ~/Brain/bootstrap.sh
```

`bootstrap.sh` checks Python and SQLite/FTS5 (the only hard requirement), notes which
optional tools are present, builds the index, runs a health check and offers the
[first run](#first-run). It installs nothing into any agent and schedules nothing.

If you clone somewhere other than `~/Brain`, export `BRAIN_VAULT=/path/to/vault` (the first
run offers to add it to your shell profile); the MCP server and the CLI also detect it.

**Requirements:** Python 3.9 or newer with SQLite/FTS5 (bundled with CPython) and `git`, on
macOS or Linux. Optional: [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org) for credentials and Obsidian as a
GUI.

## First run

```bash
bash integrations/first-run/setup.sh          # ask what is left, one yes at a time
python3 integrations/first-run/first_run.py status
```

The first run asks, step by step, whether to connect each optional piece, and installs
nothing without a yes: a KeePass database, Google accounts, an alert email for the guardian,
the MCP server for your agents, scheduled jobs (launchd on macOS, systemd user units on Linux,
cron where systemd is absent), the Remote Control server that makes the machine reachable from
the Claude app, and CLI-agent routines with a token pool. It also asks where to
keep files, proposing `~/BrainFiles`. That step is required: the directory is created and
recorded before the run can complete.
Answers are remembered in `<brain state>/first-run.json`, so re-running resumes where it
stopped. Every agent that reads the generated `AGENTS.md` is told to offer it in its first
session on a machine that has not had one. Details:
[`integrations/first-run/README.md`](integrations/first-run/README.md).

`<brain state>` is `BRAIN_STATE` when set, otherwise `~/Library/Application Support/brain` on
macOS and `~/.local/state/brain` on Linux (`_bin/brain_paths.py`).

Files (deliverables, intermediate steps, source material) live in that directory, outside the
vault, and the note that explains each one keeps its key. `BRAIN_FILES_DIR` overrides the
directory chosen in the first run (`_bin/brain_files.py`).

```bash
python3 _bin/files.py put report.pdf --to 30-Knowledge/<note>.md --project <slug> \
  --kind deliverable --caption "what it is"      # kinds: deliverable, intermediate, material
python3 _bin/files.py ls --project <slug>
python3 _bin/files.py get <key> --out <dir>
python3 _bin/files.py check                      # broken references and orphaned files
```

## Multiple machines

By default everything above is single-machine: one vault, one local KeePass database, one
files directory. If you run this on more than one machine and already sync a folder between
them — Dropbox, iCloud Drive, a NAS mount, a USB drive — the first run's `multi_machine` step
can point at it, and two things start coordinating over it:

- **Presence.** Each machine's heartbeat also lands at
  `<shared>/presence/<project>/<machine key>__<sid>`, so `presence.py view` (and anything that
  reads its cache) can tell you someone on ANOTHER machine has the same project open, not just
  this one.
- **File claims.** When `claim.py` records or releases a session's claims, a detached
  `_bin/claims_sync.py` worker publishes that session's whole claim set to the shared folder, so
  another machine can see which files are being edited (`claims_sync.py view`). The write gate
  reads only the local cache that worker leaves and warns when another machine claims the same
  repo file; it blocks only under `strict_claims`, as it does for a claim on this machine. The CLI
  (`claims_sync.py claim|release <path...> --sid <sid>`) is still there for a deliberate call.

The machine identity behind both is `_bin/machine_identity.py`: a hostname plus the first 8 hex
characters of a hardware/boot UUID (`ioreg` on macOS, `/etc/machine-id` or
`/sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid` on Linux), so two machines that happen to share a hostname do
not collide. Only that short derived key is ever written anywhere; the full UUID never is.

**The harness never syncs this folder itself.** It only reads and writes files under the path
you give it — keeping that path synced between your machines (Dropbox, iCloud, your NAS's own
mechanism) is entirely up to whatever already syncs it for you.

```bash
python3 _bin/claims_sync.py claim src/x.ts --sid <sid>    # declare a claim
python3 _bin/claims_sync.py view                          # fresh claims held by OTHER machines
python3 _bin/claims_sync.py reap                           # clean up claims nobody is renewing
```

- The shared path is `BRAIN_SHARED_DIR`, else what the first run's `multi_machine` step
  recorded in `<brain state>/shared-dir.json` (`_bin/brain_shared.py`). Unconfigured (the
  default), nothing above does anything extra: single-machine behaviour is unchanged, byte for
  byte.
- Declining the `multi_machine` step (or skipping it with `first_run.py skip-all`) is the
  default and always allowed — unlike the files step, it is never required.
- A claim nobody renews for longer than 15 minutes plus a 2-minute margin is treated as
  orphaned (a crashed session, a machine that vanished) and reaped automatically, piggybacked
  on the same 120 s cadence the presence heartbeat already runs on — no separate scheduled job.

### A second KeePass client: `kpcli`

If two machines share a `.kdbx` over that same synced path, both need a way to read it.
`keepassxc-cli` (the default `kp.py` already speaks) is not installable everywhere; a machine
that has Perl instead can use `kpcli`'s underlying module, `File::KDBX`, through
`_bin/kp_kdbx.pl`:

```bash
cpanm --local-lib=~/perl5 File::KDBX     # optional: only for the kpcli backend
BRAIN_KP_BACKEND=kpcli python3 _bin/kp.py ls
```

- Set with `BRAIN_KP_BACKEND=kpcli`, or leave it unset: `kp.py` prefers `keepassxc-cli` and
  only falls back to `kpcli` when nothing finds it. The default stays `keepassxc-cli`, unchanged.
- `_bin/kp_backend.py` covers exactly what `kp.py` actually issues through its central `cli()`
  function: `ls`, `search`, `show`, `mkdir`, `add`, `edit`. Everything else the kpcli backend
  does not cover (`clip`, `kp.py init --create`, the `.lock`-file checks under `kp.py locks`)
  refuses with a clear message instead of guessing or silently doing nothing — use
  `keepassxc-cli` for those, or `--show`/`--info`/`--pipe` in place of the clipboard.
- `File::KDBX` is not a Perl core module and is never required for the default backend: only
  install it if `BRAIN_KP_BACKEND=kpcli` is what you actually want.
- A key file works on this backend too. `kp.py` passes its path to `kp_kdbx.pl` in the
  environment (`BRAIN_KP_KEYFILE`; it is a path, not a secret), and the helper opens the store
  with the master and the key file together, or with the key file alone for a keyfile-only store.

## Adding a new machine

A new machine needs the KeePass keyfile (when the database uses one), sometimes the `.kdbx`
itself, and a few settings. `_bin/handoff.py` moves them once, without SSH and without any
cloud service:

```bash
python3 ~/Brain/_bin/handoff.py issue                # on a machine that already works
python3 ~/Brain/_bin/handoff.py redeem '<TOKEN>'     # on the new machine, from any directory
```

`issue` prints one token and the exact redeem command. With a shared directory configured the
encrypted payload goes through `<shared>/handoff/`; without one the token carries it; `--to PATH`
uses a USB stick or any synced folder, and `--with-db` adds the `.kdbx`. `redeem` writes the
files mode 600, never over existing ones without `--force`, and records them with `kp.py init`.

The security model, plainly: the handoff is time boxed (20 minutes by default), encrypted with
a random one-time passphrase (`openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2`, the passphrase never in argv),
authenticated with an HMAC checked before decrypting, and single use when it goes through a
file, which redeem deletes. An inline token is the payload itself, so it is as sensitive as the
keyfile: paste it once into a terminal, never into a chat, a note, a ticket or git. The master
password never travels; you type it where `kp.py` asks. The whole install is
`30-Knowledge/2026-09-21-runbook-install-on-a-new-machine.md`.

## Remote Control: every machine is reachable from the Claude app

Every machine Brain is installed on is a Remote Control machine. It appears in the Claude app
(phone, desktop or claude.ai) under **Remote Control**, and a session opened there runs *on that
machine*, with its vault, credentials, files and browser. A cloud session is something else: it
runs on Anthropic's infrastructure and has none of them. An install that does not end with the
machine listed there is not finished. The first run's `remote_control` step sets it up; the
full checklist for a new machine is
[`30-Knowledge/2026-09-21-runbook-install-on-a-new-machine.md`](30-Knowledge/2026-09-21-runbook-install-on-a-new-machine.md).

### Supported environments

macOS and Linux, and nothing else. Skills, routines and scheduled tasks are written to work on
both, and generic content never names a particular machine: a rule reads "on a Linux machine",
not "on the server in the closet". Every machine registers itself in `_bin/machines.py` (at the
end of its first run, then once a day from the guardian's scheduled repair), every session
is told which machine it is on and what that machine has (`_bin/machine_caps.py`, the
`## This machine` block at session start) instead of guessing from the operating system, and a
scheduled task is moved to a machine only after `_bin/routine_requires.py here --fix` finds its
repos, programs and paths there. A task's `machine` cell is `*`, the machine's label or its key
(`_bin/machine_identity.py`).

### What each machine needs

- **A normal user, never root.** Claude Code refuses to bypass permissions under root, and
  driving a machine from a phone through a permission prompt per command is not practical. Brain
  machines set `"permissions": {"defaultMode": "bypassPermissions"}` and
  `"skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt": true` in `~/.claude/settings.json`. If the machine is
  administered from its sessions, give that user sudo, so escalation stays a deliberate `sudo`.
- **The `claude` CLI logged in with a claude.ai account.** `claude auth login`, then
  `claude auth status` must show `"loggedIn": true` and `"authMethod": "claude.ai"`. API keys and
  `claude setup-token` tokens do not work: Remote Control refuses them, and Chrome stays off with
  them even under `--chrome`. On a Mac the desktop app keeps its own credentials, so the CLI can
  be logged out on a machine you use every day; a launchd agent inherits none of the app's login.
  A machine signed into an organisation's account also inherits that organisation's managed
  settings.
- **A recent CLI.** An old one rejects `remote-control --chrome`; `claude update` fixes it.
- **No telemetry switches.** `DISABLE_TELEMETRY`, `DO_NOT_TRACK`,
  `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` and `DISABLE_GROWTHBOOK` each turn off the feature
  flags Remote Control depends on. `_bin/remote_control.py` starts the server without them (and
  without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, which would replace the claude.ai
  login); the first run refuses them in the `env` block of `~/.claude/settings.json`, which the
  server would read anyway.
- **Chrome with the Claude extension, on each machine.** Browser tools use the Chrome of the
  machine the session runs on. On macOS that is your usual Chrome. On Linux it needs an X desktop
  that starts at boot, not at login (for example xfce under TigerVNC, as a system service bound
  to localhost), with Chrome started by the desktop and restarted whenever it exits; install the
  extension and sign it in once, by hand, through VNC. Reach VNC only through an SSH tunnel
  (`ssh -L 5901:localhost:5901 <user>@<machine>`), never through an open port. Pair and check
  with `claude --chrome` and `/chrome`. Browsers are discovered per account, not per machine, so
  a session may offer to drive the Chrome of another machine on the same account.

### The server

`_bin/remote_control.py serve` runs

```bash
claude remote-control --chrome --name <name>
```

from the home directory, or from a folder of its own if you choose one. The first run's
`remote_control` step checks the machine first, starts the server once on your terminal from that
directory, records the directory and name in `<brain state>/remote-control.json`, and installs its
supervisor.

- **`--chrome` is mandatory, and always passed.** The `claudeInChromeDefaultEnabled` setting does
  not cover server mode: without the flag every session has no browser tools, and tends to
  describe itself as running "in a cloud container". Do not decide whether a CLI supports it
  from `remote-control --help`, which can hide it; an old CLI answers `Unknown argument`, and
  `claude update` fixes that.
- **The CLI itself, not a wrapper.** `remote_control.py` looks on `PATH`, then in `~/.local/bin`
  (the native installer), `/opt/homebrew/bin` and `/usr/local/bin`, and prefers a real CLI over a
  shell script standing in for it; it warns when a wrapper is all there is. Install Claude Code
  with the native installer rather than Homebrew, whose cask can lag several releases behind. A
  wrapper you keep for your own shell must pass `"$@"` through, or flags like `--chrome` vanish.
- **A worktree spawn mode is forbidden** (`--spawn worktree`, or answering `worktree` at the
  prompt). Brain's `WorktreeCreate` hook (`seed_worktree.py`) seeds a worktree but does not
  create one, and with both in play every session dies at birth while the app hangs on
  "Connecting...". Use `same-dir`.
- **The working directory is the home directory by default**, so a session started from the app
  opens where you would open a terminal. It needs no git repository, because the spawn mode stays
  `same-dir`; only a worktree spawn mode would need one, and that is forbidden above. A dedicated
  folder or repository works too; the vault does not. Workspace trust is kept per directory, the
  home directory included (`projects["$HOME"].hasTrustDialogAccepted` in `~/.claude.json`).
- **The label the app groups sessions under is the server's environment**, which the server is
  assigned and which you rename from the app. `--name` titles the sessions inside it.
- **Three prompts are answered once, interactively:** trust the workspace, `Enable Remote
  Control? (y/n)`, and the spawn mode (`same-dir`). The first run offers to start the server on
  your terminal for exactly that; stop it with Ctrl+C once it says Connected. Trust and spawn
  mode are kept per absolute path in `~/.claude.json`, so moving the directory asks them again.
  Do not edit `~/.claude.json` by hand while a `claude` session is running on the machine: one
  write clobbers the other.
- **Supervised, never left in tmux.** The server exits after about ten minutes without network.
  On macOS `_bin/com.secondbrain.remote-control.plist` is a launchd agent with `RunAtLoad` and
  `KeepAlive` and no `StartInterval`, logging to
  `~/Library/Application Support/brain/logs/remote-control.log`. On Linux
  `_bin/systemd/second-brain-remote-control.service` is a systemd user unit with
  `Restart=always` and no timer, logging to the journal; a user unit only runs at boot with no
  one logged in when lingering is on, which the first run turns on
  (`sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER` if it is refused). The guardian keeps it installed and
  loaded like the other jobs. Cron cannot supervise a server, so there is no cron variant.
- **Restart it after any change** to the login, settings or Chrome pairing: the server keeps the
  configuration it started with. `systemctl --user restart second-brain-remote-control`, or
  `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.secondbrain.remote-control`.

`python3 _bin/remote_control.py show` prints the recorded directory, the command and anything
that would stop it. The server is not a scheduled task, so it has no row in
`90-Meta/scheduled-tasks.md`.

### Several machines, several Claude accounts, one vault

The Claude account a machine is logged into decides one thing: which account's Claude app lists
it under Remote Control. It does not decide what the machine can read. The vault travels over
git with a credential that belongs to the repository, the `.kdbx` is a file each machine reads
locally (its own, or a copy in a folder you sync), and cross-machine coordination goes through
`BRAIN_SHARED_DIR`. None of that is tied to a Claude account, so a work machine on a work account
and a personal one on a personal account read the same notes and the same credentials.
`_bin/machines.py` records each machine's account, which answers "which machine ran this, and
under which account".

### Verifying a machine, from the phone

1. `claude auth status`: the right account, so the right app.
2. `git -C ~/Brain pull` and `python3 _bin/kp.py get <some entry> --pipe 'wc -c'`: the shared
   context, which works whatever the answer to 1 was.
3. The server log shows it Connected: `journalctl --user -u second-brain-remote-control` on
   Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/brain/logs/remote-control.log` on macOS.
4. On the phone, open the Claude app, choose **Remote Control** and the machine's name, start a
   session with **+**, and ask it something only that machine could answer. A session that hangs
   on "Connecting..." means the server refused it: read the server log, the app will not say
   why. Trust the log and the environment picker (Local, Cloud, Remote Control, SSH) over a
   session's own account of where it runs.

## How it works

- **Folders.** Memory is plain Markdown with YAML frontmatter in numbered folders (see
  [Layout](#layout)). Each note declares its `id`, `type`, `tags`, `status` and provenance,
  and links to others with `[[wikilinks]]`, forming a graph.
- **Search.** `_bin/index_vault.py` builds a SQLite database with an FTS5 full-text index;
  `_bin/query.py` searches it and `_bin/retrieve_core.py` renders what the prompt hook, the
  MCP `recall` tool and `brain recall` inject. No embeddings, no external service, no API key.
- **Write path.** Every write to shared notes goes through `_bin/vw.py`: it redacts
  credentials, serialises with a per-file lock, writes atomically and reindexes.
- **Git sync.** `_bin/vault_sync.py` keeps the vault in a git repo so memory travels between
  machines.
- **Events.** [`90-Meta/events.json`](90-Meta/events.json) is the registry of every event
  (session start, prompt, write gate, sync, reindex, link repair) and every trigger wired to
  it: Claude Code hooks, git hooks, the file watch, scheduled jobs, CLI and MCP.
  `hooks.json`, `githooks/` and `AGENTS.md` are generated from it;
  [`90-Meta/HOOKS-WITHOUT-CLAUDE.md`](90-Meta/HOOKS-WITHOUT-CLAUDE.md) lists how to fire each
  event without Claude Code.
- **Protocol.** [`90-Meta/AGENT-PROTOCOL.md`](90-Meta/AGENT-PROTOCOL.md) is the contract any
  agent follows; [`90-Meta/PROTOCOL-COMPACT.md`](90-Meta/PROTOCOL-COMPACT.md) is the short
  version, and [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) is generated from it for agents with no adapter.

## Credentials: a local KeePass database

The vault never stores a credential. Secrets live in a KeePass database (`.kdbx`) on your
own disk or synced folder, read with `keepassxc-cli` through `_bin/kp.py`, and notes carry
only references such as `kp://apis/example-service-api-key#password`.

```bash
python3 _bin/kp.py init --db ~/Documents/brain.kdbx --create   # what the first run does
python3 _bin/kp.py status
python3 _bin/kp.py put apis/example-service-api-key --stdin      # file a secret from stdin
python3 _bin/kp.py get apis/example-service-api-key --pipe 'python3 script.py'
python3 _bin/kp.py unlock --ttl 30d                             # arm the master cache
```

- The database path is `BRAIN_KP_DB`, else what `kp.py init` recorded in
  `<brain state>/kp-config.json`. There is no guessed default.
- Everything an agent writes goes inside one group, `Brain` by default (`BRAIN_KP_GROUP`);
  your own entries elsewhere are never reorganised.
- The master password never passes through argv, the environment or a plain file. It is
  asked in a dialog (osascript on macOS, zenity on a Linux desktop) or on the terminal, and
  can be cached in the OS keyring (the Keychain on macOS, libsecret's `secret-tool` on Linux)
  with `kp.py unlock`.
- A key file is recorded with `kp.py init --db PATH --keyfile PATH` (no prompt, so a setup
  script can run it) or set with `BRAIN_KP_KEYFILE`. A store can also be **keyfile-only**, with
  no master at all, for a machine where nobody can type one: create it with
  `kp.py init --db PATH --keyfile PATH --create --no-password`. With a key file configured,
  `kp.py` tries once to open the store with the key file alone; when that works it never asks
  for a master or caches one, and `kp.py status` says the keyfile is the whole key
  (`BRAIN_KP_NO_PASSWORD=1` skips that probe). The key file is then as sensitive as the database:
  mode 600, copied only over a channel you trust, never into the vault or git.
- Scheduled jobs read headless (`BRAIN_KP_NOPROMPT=1`): no prompt, and exit 4 when the master
  is not cached. Exit 5 is a database open elsewhere, 6 a database not configured or found.
- A secret is never printed unless you pass `--show`: it goes to the clipboard or into another
  process's stdin. Every write takes a backup first and verifies the database afterwards.

## Google accounts

`_bin/google.py` reaches Gmail, Calendar and Drive, read and write, through Google's REST APIs
for any number of named accounts, with no connector and no third-party library.

```bash
python3 _bin/google.py add --account personal --client-id <id> --login-hint me@example.com  # secret on stdin
python3 _bin/google.py auth --account personal        # browser consent on 127.0.0.1
python3 _bin/google.py api --account personal "https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/users/me/calendarList"
python3 _bin/google.py send --account personal --to me@example.com --subject "Digest" --body-file digest.txt
python3 _bin/google.py slots --account personal --start 2030-01-07T16:30:00+01:00 --minutes 45 --with b@example.com
```

Creating or moving a Calendar event through `api` is checked for conflicts first
(`_bin/google_core/calendar_guard.py`): when the slot overlaps an event or a busy attendee,
nothing is written, the conflicts and free alternatives are printed and the exit status is 3.
Show them to the user and rerun with the chosen slot, or with `--force` once the overlap is
accepted. `slots` runs the same check without writing. The rule it enforces:
[`30-Knowledge/2026-09-24-convention-check-calendar-conflicts-before-booking.md`](30-Knowledge/2026-09-24-convention-check-calendar-conflicts-before-booking.md).

Each account has its own OAuth client ("Desktop app" client in a Google Cloud project with the
Gmail, Calendar and Drive APIs enabled) and refresh token, both in KeePass under
`google/<account>/`. `api` prints Google's reply and exits 1 on an HTTP error; `token`, `api`
and `send` never prompt. Every delivered message is logged (never its body) to
`<brain state>/logs/mail-sent.jsonl`, which the routine runner checks.

An OAuth app left in Testing publishing status gets refresh tokens that die 7 days after
consent. `auth` stamps the consent instant, and `_bin/google_token_watch.py` (run daily) mails
a warning three days before the deadline, through another account when you give it one
(`--via`): [`30-Knowledge/2026-09-23-reference-google-oauth-testing-mode-7-day-refresh-token-expiry.md`](30-Knowledge/2026-09-23-reference-google-oauth-testing-mode-7-day-refresh-token-expiry.md).

## Guardian and scheduled jobs

`_bin/guardian.py` keeps the machinery wired with no AI agent involved. When you accept it in
the first run it runs `repair` every 15 minutes: it merges the vault's hooks into each agent's
config (backing it up, removing only Brain hooks whose script no longer exists), syncs skills
and agents, sets `core.hooksPath` to the vault's `githooks/`, reinstalls or reloads the
scheduled jobs you accepted, probes that the hooks actually fire, and alerts you (desktop
notification, email if configured, log) about what it could not fix. A repair run exits 0 when
it completed, whatever it found. `guardian.py status` shows everything it watches.

The jobs it can manage are the guardian itself, the git sync, the task runner, the file watch and
the Remote Control server. Their templates live in `_bin/` (`com.secondbrain.*.plist`,
`systemd/second-brain-*`, `cron/second-brain-*`); only the ones accepted in the first run are ever
installed. A systemd job is a `.service` with its `.timer`, or a `.service` alone when it is a
long-lived server kept up by `Restart=always` (the Remote Control server, which has no cron
template).

## Routines and the two schedulers

- **`_bin/tasks.py`** runs the table in [`90-Meta/scheduled-tasks.md`](90-Meta/scheduled-tasks.md):
  `shell` commands and `agent` routines, pinned to machines. An `agent` routine
  (`90-Meta/routines/`, see the [example](90-Meta/routines/example-routine.md)) runs through the
  CLI agent named in [`90-Meta/agent-command.txt`](90-Meta/agent-command.txt), with a token from
  the pool in `90-Meta/routine-tokens.json` (KeePass references only, never committed), a narrow
  tool allowlist, a private scratch directory per run, a prompt framed as an order to run now, and
  a success contract checked against the send log rather than the model's last words. Failures
  raise guardian alerts.
- **[`integrations/scheduler/`](integrations/scheduler/)** is the simplest option: Markdown tasks
  with a cron expression and a prompt, handed to any agent command on stdin.

They coexist; a task belongs in one of them.

| Skill | What it does | What it needs |
|---|---|---|
| `task` | Runs a task end to end: context, worktree, plan, implementation, verification, write-back | The vault and Python |
| `ctx` | Gathers a task's context into a Context Pack before any work | The vault |
| `recall` | Searches the vault for past decisions and conventions | The vault |
| `save` | Writes what a session learned into the vault | The vault, and the files directory chosen in the first run, where `files.py` stores the session's files |
| `vault-doctor` | Diagnoses the vault and the memory system | The vault; reads `guardian.py status` when the guardian is installed |
| `kp` | Reads and files credentials in your KeePass database | KeePassXC (`keepassxc-cli`) and a database connected in the first run |
| `dev` | The development pipeline: hexagonal architecture, tests first, design and review gates for anything with an interface | The third-party skills below, and a browser or preview tool for the rendered checks |
| `job-search` | Finds and ranks openings against your own profile (remote, plus on-site or hybrid in an area you name) and LinkedIn posts from people who are hiring; report only | A Google account connected with the send scope; your own `profile.md`, `preferences.md` (recipient address, account name) and `search-queries.md` created from the skill's `templates/` under `80-Private/job-search/` (local, never pushed); `curl` and `jq`; for the LinkedIn posts step, Claude in Chrome with a browser signed in to LinkedIn (without it the report says the step was skipped) |
| `machine-update` | Updates Claude Code on this machine and says what is stale: the CLI, the Remote Control server still running an old binary, the desktop app's copy | `_bin/machine_update.py`; restarts the server by itself only on macOS and only when no session is open |

## Agent orchestration

How a task is split across subagents, and how to change it. The reasoning behind it:
[`30-Knowledge/2026-09-15-convention-agent-orchestration-per-task.md`](30-Knowledge/2026-09-15-convention-agent-orchestration-per-task.md).

**The roster** (`integrations/claude-code/plugin/brain/agents/*.md`):

| Agent | Model | Effort | Tools |
|---|---|---|---|
| `context-scout` | haiku | medium | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Write |
| `planner` | sonnet | high | Read, Grep, Glob, Write, Bash |
| `implementer` | the session's model | inherited | all tools |
| `verifier` | sonnet | high | read and execute only |
| `librarian` | sonnet | medium | Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob |
| `skill-forge` | sonnet | medium | the librarian's tools plus Skill |

To change a model, effort or tool list, edit that agent's frontmatter and run
`python3 _bin/install_plugin.py sync`.

**The pipeline per task:**

1. `context-scout` distils the context into a Context Pack.
2. `planner` turns it into a plan with the files to touch, for tasks that span more than one file.
3. `implementer` works in a git worktree, never the main checkout.
4. `verifier` checks that it builds, passes and does what it claims. At most two rounds of fixes;
   if it still fails, stop and tell the user.
5. Integration: rebase on the target branch and verify again.
6. `librarian` writes what was learned back to the vault.

One subagent per step, in the foreground, unless steps are genuinely independent. When
parallelising: one worktree per implementer with explicit file ownership, files registered with
`_bin/claim.py`, a verifier per branch, then rebase, run the suite on every supported interpreter
and fast-forward merge. Keep a single multi-agent workflow under about 15 agents unless the user
asks for more.

**The development gates** (the `dev` skill): hexagonal structure (a pure domain, use cases on
ports, adapters at the edge), tests written and seen failing before the implementation, the
standard library unless a dependency is agreed, and for anything with an interface, the design
and review steps of the skill.

**Headless routines** use the agent command in `90-Meta/agent-command.txt` and the token pool
described above, so they run with no desktop app open and on no particular logged-in account.

## What is tied to Claude Code, and what is not

- **Agent-agnostic:** the vault, the search index and every `_bin/` tool; the MCP server and the
  CLI; `kp.py`, `google.py` and `files.py`; the event registry, git hooks and the file watch; the
  guardian's scheduled jobs and alerts; the task runner (any CLI agent through
  `agent-command.txt`); the first run; `AGENTS.md`.
- **Claude Code only:** automatic recall on every prompt, the stop gates (memory and style) and the other hooks; the
  subagent roster and skills; the guardian's hook liveness probe, which reads Claude Code's
  transcripts. Other agents get the manual equivalents listed in `AGENTS.md` and
  `90-Meta/HOOKS-WITHOUT-CLAUDE.md`.

The deepest experience today is Claude Code with the plugin; nothing in the vault requires it.

## The engine (`_bin/`)

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index_vault.py`, `query.py`, `retrieve.py` / `retrieve_core.py` | Index, search and per-prompt retrieval. |
| `linkfix.py` | Find broken `[[links]]` and fix the ones with a safe fix; runs on every search. |
| `vw.py` | The only write path for shared notes (redact, lock, atomic, reindex). |
| `vault_sync.py` | Commit and push over git. |
| `doctor.py` | Health report. |
| `kp.py` | Credentials in a local KeePass database. |
| `handoff.py` | One-time handoff of a new machine's keyfile, database and settings. |
| `google.py` | Named Google accounts: Gmail, Calendar, Drive. |
| `google_token_watch.py` | Warns before a Testing-mode Google refresh token expires. |
| `files.py` / `files_core.py`, `brain_files.py` | The file store: deliverables, intermediates and material in a local directory, anchored to notes; where that directory is. |
| `guardian.py` | Keeps hooks, git hooks and scheduled jobs wired, and alerts. |
| `brain_watch.py` | The file watch and the generated hooks. |
| `tasks.py` | The periodic task and routine runner. |
| `machine_identity.py`, `machines.py`, `machine_caps.py` | Which machine this is; the registry of machines and their Claude accounts; the `## This machine` block, including which connected Chrome is this machine's own (`machine_caps.py learn-chrome`). |
| `machine_update.py` | What needs updating for Claude on this machine (CLI, Remote Control server, desktop app) and the safe part of doing it (`/machine-update`). |
| `routine_requires.py` | Preflight: the repos, programs and paths a routine needs on this machine. |
| `remote_control.py` | Starts the supervised Remote Control server from its recorded working directory. |
| `gen_instructions.py` | Generates `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and `90-Meta/HOOKS-WITHOUT-CLAUDE.md`. |
| `install_plugin.py`, `claude_settings.py` | Skills and agents sync; recommended Claude Code settings. |
| `brain_paths.py`, `migrate_state.py`, `pywrap.sh` | Where state lives; moving it out of `~/.claude`; the interpreter picker jobs start through. |
| `style_check.py`, `style_gate.py` | The writing check: finds dashes and AI-sounding shapes (English and Spanish) in a file, stdin or a Google Doc; the Stop hook runs it on every reply and asks for a rewrite. |
| `mail_body.py` | Composes every outgoing mail as HTML with a plain text fallback, so paragraphs flow instead of arriving as a narrow column. |
| `run_all_tests.py` | Every test, each in a scratch HOME. |
| `bilingual_eval.py` | Whether a Spanish question finds what its English twin finds, on a fitted and a held-out set; `--from-misses` lists the words real misses could not reach. |
| `pipeline_acceptance.py` | By hand, in a fresh Claude Code session: `setup` builds a small repo and plants a convention only in the vault, `check` verifies it reached the generated code, `cleanup` removes both. |

## Conventions that ship with it

`30-Knowledge/` carries working conventions the protocol links to. They are generic and meant to
be edited to your taste: the vault is written in one language because search is lexical; replies
and documents read like a person wrote them (checked mechanically by `style_check.py` and the `style_gate.py` Stop hook); a change is done when it is verified; one worktree
per deliverable; smoke checks isolate all state; a headless agent prompt is framed as an order; a
routine's success is checked in its log, not in the model's last words; scheduled jobs exit
non-zero for a crash, not for findings; no hosted connectors, only mechanisms you control.

## Tests and CI

```bash
python3 _bin/run_all_tests.py            # every *_test.py, each with its own HOME and BRAIN_STATE
```

No test reaches the real machine: KeePass, Google, launchctl, systemctl, crontab and agent CLIs are
fakes, and state lives in temporary directories. CI runs the suite on macOS and Linux with Python
3.9 and 3.14 ([`.github/workflows/tests.yml`](.github/workflows/tests.yml)).

## Portability

To run under a different provider or write your own integration, see
[`90-Meta/PORTABILITY.md`](90-Meta/PORTABILITY.md): search with `query.py`, write with `vw.py`,
sync with `vault_sync.py`.
