# Readr
A self-hosted, AI-native read-it-later app and knowledge graph engine powered by Vue, Tailwind, and Go. Articles are saved as clean markdown files on disk and tracked in a SQLite database.

## Features
* **AI-Native Chat**: Query your reading collection using OpenRouter models. Reference notes directly with `@` mentions to feed full article text into the conversation.
* **Autonomous Background Agents**:
  * **OKF Frontmatter Enricher**: Automatically extracts clean, standardized Open Knowledge Format (OKF) YAML frontmatter (`type`, `title`, `description`, `resource`, `tags`, `generated` audit metadata) when articles are ingested.
  * **Autonomous Graph Linker**: Discovers semantic connections between incoming articles and your existing vault, automatically injecting aliased `[[Wikilinks]]` and weaving nodes into the graph.
  * **On-Demand Reparsing**: Trigger or re-run background agents on any article at any time with live toast progress notifications.
  * **Configurable Worker Pipeline**: Toggle agents individually from the settings view to tailor background processing to your workflow.
* **Knowledge Graph Engine**: Global and per-article force-directed graph views mapping relationships between articles, tags, and wikilinks.
* **Real-Time Event Stream (SSE)**: Live server-sent event updates push background agent completions and graph changes straight to the browser without page refreshes.
* **1-Hop Graph Context Expansion**: Optional setting that allows the AI to automatically traverse your graph edges and include connected notes and backlinks in its context.
* **Wikilinks & Backlinks**: Bidirectional links between articles using `[[Title]]` and `[[Title|Alias]]` syntax, with edge tracking and floating hover previews.
* **Portable Markdown Storage**: All articles, OKF metadata, and chat histories are saved locally as markdown files, making your data easy to back up or sync with Obsidian and Logseq.
* **Custom Jinja Templates**: Customize how saved articles are structured with site-specific Jinja templates located in `$DATA_DIR/templates/` with automatic domain matching and rich context variables.
* **Lightweight and Fast**: Compact Go backend and Vue frontend with full dark mode support.

## Docker Compose
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  readr:
    image: "gjames8/readr:latest"
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    container_name: readr
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Custom Markdown Templates (Jinja)

Readr supports custom Jinja templates for controlling the formatting, frontmatter, and layout of ingested markdown articles. Place template files in `$DATA_DIR/templates/` (e.g. `./data/templates/` in Docker volume mounts).

### Domain Resolution Hierarchy
When an article is ingested from a URL (e.g., `https://gist.github.com/...`), Readr resolves templates in the following order:
1. **Explicit Template Selection**: Chosen template from ingest options (if specified).
2. **Subdomain Match**: E.g., `gist.github.com.jinja`.
3. **Parent Domain Match**: E.g., `github.com.jinja`.
4. **Default Built-in Template**: Used if no domain-specific template is found.

### Template Context Variables
The following variables are available inside Jinja templates:

| Variable | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `title` | `string` | Title of the article or page |
| `source` / `url` | `string` | Canonical source URL |
| `domain` | `string` | Extracted hostname / domain name |
| `content` | `string` | Clean converted Markdown content of the article |
| `tags` | `[]string` | Array of extracted or assigned tags |
| `tags_str` | `string` | Comma-separated tag string |
| `cover_image` | `string` | URL of the cover or lead image |
| `saved_date` | `string` | Formatted UTC date string (`YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| `timestamp` | `int64` | Unix timestamp in milliseconds |
| `author` | `string` | Article author (from metadata or OpenGraph) |
| `description` | `string` | Article summary or OpenGraph description |
| `site_name` | `string` | Publication or site name |
| `og` | `map[string]string` | Raw OpenGraph and meta properties (e.g. `og.title`, `og.image`) |

### Example Template (`github.com.jinja`)
Create `$DATA_DIR/templates/github.com.jinja`:

```jinja
---
title: {{ title | tojson }}
source: {{ source | tojson }}
tags: {{ tags | tojson }}
cover: {{ cover_image | tojson }}
saved: {{ saved_date | tojson }}
type: github-repo
---

{% if summary %}
> 💡 **Summary:** {{ summary }}
{% elif description %}
> {{ description }}
{% endif %}

---

{{ content }}
```

## Design choices
### Why markdown?
Saving as markdown keeps the library portable and easy to sync with tools like Obsidian.

### Why the knowledge graph?
Articles rarely exist in isolation. Connecting notes with wikilinks and visualizing them in a graph helps surface connections between concepts across long reading lists.
