# Garuda

Garuda is a Swift web framework and the HTTP server underneath it. It is my attempt to create a spiritual successor to [Kitura](https://github.com/Kitura/Kitura): a server written in Swift, with its own HTTP engine, for the protocols and the application features a production service needs today.

The application API is modelled after [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum). Routes, typed extractors, and the set of features a production framework is expected to offer follow axum's shape. [Garuda and axum](#garuda-and-axum) compares the two area by area. The HTTP engine is Garuda's own.

The same route in each. axum names the parameter in braces; Garuda uses a colon. Both take it as a typed `Path` and answer JSON.

```rust
// axum
async fn person(Path(id): Path<i32>) -> Json<Person> {
    Json(Person { id, name: "Ada".into() })
}

let app = Router::new().route("/person/{id}", get(person));
```

```swift
// Garuda
app.get("/person/:id") { (id: Path<Int>) async in
    JSON(Person(id: id.value, name: "Ada"))
}
```

The key difference is where the handler runs. axum makes every handler a future and runs it on Tokio, a work-stealing scheduler: an idle thread takes a waiting task from a busy one. SwiftNIO is that design in Swift. An event loop owns the socket, and the handler is a task the runtime resumes.

Garuda does not use either. The worker thread that read the request runs the handler, and a response that can be sent at once is written on that thread. There is no hop onto a scheduler before those bytes go out, which is what SwiftNIO would insert between the read and the write. The engine parses HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 itself.

A worker is one process and one thread. Nothing is shared across workers, so nothing is locked, and a crash takes only that worker's connections. That boundary matters more in Swift than in Rust: a force-unwrapped `nil` ends the process, where Tokio catches a panic inside the task that raised it. Processes cannot steal tasks from each other. A worker that is ahead leaves new connections to the others, and can hand idle HTTP/1 keep-alive connections to a worker where they would not wait (`--balance`). [One process per worker](#one-process-per-worker) has the rest.

Swift 6.2 or newer. No Foundation, no SwiftNIO.

This project is an independent effort. It is not an IBM product, and it is not a continuation maintained by the Kitura project.

</p>

**Released: 1.0.** The surface below is implemented and tested. [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md) says what a release may change, and [Status](#status) below lists what is missing.

## Features

| Area | What Garuda provides |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP | HTTP/1.1 with a parser strict where that prevents request smuggling, HTTP/2 over TLS and in cleartext, and HTTP/3 over QUIC |
| TLS and certificates | TLS 1.2 and 1.3, several certificates chosen by SNI, and ACME renewal with tls-alpn-01 on the port already served |
| Handlers | Routes, groups, and middleware. A synchronous handler is a direct call on the worker thread. An async handler runs on a task reused from that worker's pool |
| Typed API | Extractors for path, query, JSON body, form, and multipart. Answers as JSON, HTML, text, bytes, or a redirect. A type can validate its values; every broken rule is returned together as 422 |
| OpenAPI | An OpenAPI 3.1 document generated from the routes, and Swagger UI |
| Application middleware | Deadlines, CORS, bearer and basic authentication, authorization policies, CSRF protection, security headers, signed and encrypted cookies, and sessions in memory, Redis, or SQLite |
| Identity | JWT (HS, RS, PS, ES, and EdDSA), JWKS verification, rotating refresh tokens, and PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 password hashing |
| HTTP client | HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, redirects by policy, decompression, streamed bodies, and server-sent events |
| Data | PostgreSQL and Redis on the worker's poller, including Redis Cluster and Sentinel, and SQLite through the system's libsqlite3 |
| Streaming | Streamed responses and request bodies, server-sent events, broadcast across worker processes, and interim 1xx responses such as 103 Early Hints |
| WebSockets | WebSockets over HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3. The engine joins fragments, checks UTF-8, answers pings, and supports permessage-deflate |
| WebTransport | WebTransport over HTTP/3 on the same port and routes, with bidirectional and unidirectional streams and datagrams |
| IETF Resumable Uploads | The IETF resumable upload protocol (draft-ietf-httpbis-resumable-upload, interop version 9). A client cut off mid-upload resumes on any worker and over any of the three HTTP protocols |
| Files and compression | Static files with sendfile, ETag, and byte ranges, including precompressed copies. Response and request compression with brotli, zstd, and gzip |
| Request limits | A body limit and a concurrency limit on a group of routes. Rate limiting counted across workers |
| Edge policy | HTTPS redirect, HSTS, trusted proxy headers, allowed hosts, and client address allow and deny lists |
| Operations | Prometheus metrics, health checks, request IDs, W3C trace context, an access log, a shared response cache, graceful shutdown, and reload on SIGHUP. Unix sockets and more than one worker |
| Tracing | Spans through swift-distributed-tracing for the request, outbound HTTP, PostgreSQL, and Redis |
| Tests | `app.test` runs the real engine in the test process, over a socket pair |
| Process model | A supervisor accepts connections and forks one process per worker. In-memory state is per worker |
| Platforms | Linux and macOS 15, on Swift 6.2 or newer |

Outside this release: QUIC 0-RTT and QUIC session resumption, kernel TLS, `multipart/byteranges`, reads from Redis replicas, and Windows other than through WSL 2.

Every server runs the same three-route application and the same load command,
each in an invocation of its own, and the six rotate so that no server is
always measured last. **Garuda's range and axum's overlap, so these rounds do
not separate them**; ntex is ahead of both, and Garuda is 2.8x Hummingbird and
3.6x Vapor. [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md) has the method, the rounds behind
each bar, and the runs where Garuda is slower.

External benchmark: [the-benchmarker](https://web-frameworks-benchmark.netlify.app/result?l=swift&f=garuda) measures Garuda on its own hardware and load command. The chart above is a separate run on our hardware.

## Quick start

```bash
swift build -c release
.build/release/garuda --port 8000 --workers 0
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8000/user/42
```

The `garuda` binary serves a small benchmark application. Your own application
depends on the `Garuda` library:

```swift
// Package.swift
dependencies: [.package(url: "https://github.com/grepjava/garuda", from: "1.1.0")],
targets: [.executableTarget(name: "app", dependencies: [.product(name: "Garuda", package: "garuda")])]
```

```swift
// Sources/app/main.swift
import Glibc   // Darwin on macOS
import Garuda

struct Person: Codable { let id: Int; let name: String }

let app = Application()
app.get("/person/:id") { (id: Path<Int>) async in
    JSON(Person(id: id.value, name: "Ada"))
}
exit(app.run())
```

`app.run()` reads the same command-line flags as the `garuda` binary. Swift 6.2
or newer, on Linux or macOS 15 -- 6.2 because a borrowed body is a `Span`. [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) lists the
system packages, certificates and running as a service.

[Examples/](Examples/README.md) has complete applications to run and copy
from: a CRUD API on SQLite, accounts with hashed passwords and sessions,
streaming both ways, chat rooms over WebSockets across workers, a file service
with resumable uploads and ranged downloads, per-user photo uploads that are
authenticated and resumable, a network probe over WebTransport, and a whole
starter application on PostgreSQL.

## Writing handlers

### Routes and typed handlers

Routes are registered with `get`, `head`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, `patch`, `options`, or `on`. A path segment is a literal, a parameter (`:param`), or a trailing rest segment (`*rest`). HEAD falls back to GET, and a known path under the wrong method is 405 with `Allow`.

A handler declares what it needs and returns what it means:

```swift
app.get("/search") { (query: Query<Search>) async in JSON(results(for: query.value)) }
app.post("/people") { (body: Body<NewPerson>) async in JSON(create(body.value), status: .created) }
app.post("/login") { (form: Form<Credentials>) async in Redirect(to: "/") }
```

- **Extractors:** `Path<T>` (the next path parameter, percent-decoded),
  `Query<T>`, `Body<T>` (JSON), `Form<T>`, `Multipart`, `State<T>`,
  `Context<Key>`, or your own `RequestExtractor`. An `AsyncRequestExtractor`
  may await, to load the signed-in user from a database, for an async handler.
  `E?` is nil where `E` would refuse, and `Result<E, any Error>` hands the
  handler the refusal. A value that will not decode is a 400 that says what
  was wrong.
- **Answers:** `JSON`, `HTML`, `Text`, `Bytes`, `Redirect`, a `String`, an
  `HTTPStatus`, or an Optional whose `nil` is a 404.
- **Errors:** a thrown `ResponseError` is the response.
  `throw HTTPError(.conflict, "the name is taken")` answers 409 with
  `{"error":"the name is taken"}`. Anything else thrown is a 500 and a log line.
- **Rules:** a type saying what its values have to be, beyond their shape, conforms to `Validated`, and whatever is decoded from a request is held to them before the handler runs.

```swift
struct NewOrder: Decodable, Validated {
    let quantity: Int
    let email: String

    func validate(_ check: inout Validation) {
        check.range("quantity", quantity, atLeast: 1, atMost: 100)
        check.email("email", email)
    }
}
```

Every broken rule is answered at once, as 422 with the fields named: `{"error":"quantity must be at least 1","fields":[{"field":"quantity","message":"must be at least 1"}]}`. A decoding failure fills `fields` the same way, from the path it already reports, so one answer tells a form where each message goes whichever of the two refused the request.

JSON goes through Garuda's own coder over `Encodable` and `Decodable`, which
reads only the keys a type asks for, straight from the request bytes. `@JSON`
takes a type off `Codable` altogether:

```swift
import GarudaJSON

@JSON struct Order: Codable {
    let id: Int
    let name: String
    let tags: [String]
}
```

Nothing at the call site changes -- the same `Body<Order>`, the same
`JSON(order)` -- and the type keeps `Codable` for everything else.
`@PostgresRow`, from `GarudaSQL`, does the same for a database row: a
property is read from the column of its own name, and `first(Item.self, ...)`
is written the same way either way. The macro
writes the reading and the writing out longhand; the bytes are the same ones
Codable sent, and the `json` workload's request went from 15.6 microseconds to
13.2 on one worker. It lives in its own module because it is the only part of
Garuda that needs swift-syntax.

### The raw layer

Under the typed API, a handler can take the request and response directly:

```swift
app.onAsync(.get, "/user/:id") { request, response in
    request.withParameter(0) { response.send($0) }   // lent bytes, no copy
}
```

`Request` and `Response` are `~Copyable`. The request lends its bytes to a
closure as a `Span`, which the compiler keeps from escaping (`withPath`,
`withHeader`, `withBody` and others). `path`, `header(_:)`, `body` and the rest
return owned copies.

### Async handlers, deadlines and the HTTP client

A closure that awaits is an async handler. It runs on a task reused from the
worker's pool, on the worker's own thread, and allocates nothing per request
once warm.

```swift
app.deadline(milliseconds: 500) {
    app.onAsync(.get, "/weather/:city") { request, response in
        let client = request.client              // read before the first await
        let city = request.parameter(0)
        let answer = try await client.get("https://api.example.com/\(city)")
        response.send(bytes: answer.body, contentType: "application/json")
    }
}
```

A request still unanswered at its deadline is answered 504. A closed connection
or reset stream cancels a handler waiting on the engine. `request.client`
speaks HTTP/1.1, and HTTP/2 over TLS when the server offers it. It resolves
names on the worker's poller and keeps connections for reuse. It asks for
gzip, deflate, brotli and zstd and decodes what comes back, and it follows
redirects only when `client.redirects` says to: `.sameOrigin()`, `.any()` or
`.matching { url in … }`. `client.timeoutMilliseconds` bounds each wait;
`client.totalTimeoutMilliseconds` bounds the whole exchange, redirects included,
for work no route deadline covers.

`client.stream` returns once the response head is in, and the body is read as
it arrives -- a large file relayed on, an upstream's server-sent events, a
model's tokens -- rather than held whole:

```swift
app.onAsync(.get, "/relay") { request, response in
    let client = request.client                  // read before the first await
    let upstream = try await client.stream(.get, "https://llm.example/v1/stream")
    let body = response.stream(contentType: "text/event-stream")
    while let event = try await upstream.nextEvent() {
        try await body.write("data: \(event.data)\n\n")
    }
}
```

A streamed body is not held to `maxBodyBytes`. A caller that stops reading
stops the upstream: over HTTP/1.1 by TCP's window, over HTTP/2 because the
stream's window opens only as the caller reads. `cancel()` gives up the rest.

### State, groups and middleware

```swift
app.state { _ in PostgresPool(PostgresConfiguration(host: "db", user: "app", password: secret)) }

app.group("/api") {
    app.cors(CORSPolicy(origins: ["https://app.example.com"], allowCredentials: true))
    app.authenticate(bearer: CurrentUser.self) { token in try await sessions.user(token) }
    app.use { request, response async throws -> (any ResponseConvertible)? in
        response.onSend { outgoing in outgoing.addHeader("cache-control", "no-store") }
        return nil
    }
    app.get("/user/:id") { (id: Path<Int>, db: State<PostgresPool>) async throws in
        try await db.value.first(User.self, "select id, name from users where id = $1", id.value).map { JSON($0) }
    }
}
```

- `app.state` builds a value once in each worker process, after the fork. One
  value per type; registering a type twice is refused.
- `app.problems()` is what the routes cannot do, found before serving: a
  handler taking more `Path` extractors than its pattern has parameters, or
  asking for a `State<T>` nothing registered. `run()` prints them and exits 2
  instead of starting, and a test can assert `app.problems().isEmpty`.
- `app.use` runs before every route in its scope, whether it is called before
  or after the routes. It returns `nil` to carry on or an answer to send
  instead, and can be async. `response.onSend` sees and changes the final
  response, whoever answered.
- `request[context: Key.self]` carries values from middleware to the handler,
  which reads them with `Context<Key>`.
- `app.cors` sets the scope's CORS policy. It answers preflights, including to
  paths routed only for other methods, and runs ahead of the scope's
  middleware, so a preflight never meets authentication and a 401 still
  reaches the page.
- `app.authenticate(bearer:)` and `app.authenticate(basic:)` read the
  Authorization header and keep who it belongs to in the context, or answer
  401 with the challenge. With `state:`, the check is handed what `app.state`
  built, such as the database sessions live in. `BearerToken` and
  `BasicCredentials` are the same as extractors, and `constantTimeEquals`
  compares secrets.
- `app.authorize(CurrentUser.self, .admin)` requires a named rule of every
  route in the scope, once `authenticate` has said whose request it is. A
  `Policy` is `(Value) -> Bool` with a name, combined with `and`, `or` and
  `about`, and callable in a test without a request. A rule that does not hold
  is 403 saying what would have been enough; nobody under the key is 401.
  `authorize(jwt:)` reads the claims a scope verified, and
  `Policy.scope("orders:write")` an OAuth 2.0 scope in them. Both
  `authenticate` and `authorize` add what they can answer, and the security
  scheme, to every route of the scope in the OpenAPI document.
- `JWT<Claims>` takes a verified JSON Web Token (HS, RS, PS, ES or EdDSA),
  keys from PEM, JWK or a secret, with `exp`, `nbf`, `iss` and `aud` checked;
  `keys.sign(claims)` issues one and `keys.publicJWKS` publishes the key set.
  `JWKSVerifier` checks tokens from an identity provider against its JWK Set.
  `TokenIssuer` pairs short-lived access tokens with refresh tokens that rotate
  on every use and revoke their whole chain when a spent one is reused.
- `Passwords.hash` and `Passwords.verify` use PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 on the
  blocking pool. `Tokens.random()` makes a session token and `Tokens.digest`
  what to store in its place.
- `request.log.info("order placed", ["order": "\(id)"])` writes to the
  application log with the request's method, path, request ID and trace
  context on the line. `AppLog` is the same log outside a request.
  `--log-format json` makes every line one JSON object.
- `app.onResponse { done in … }` sees every request once it is answered: the
  matched route's pattern, status, duration, request ID and trace, and why a
  route failed. This is what per-route metrics or error reporting hang from.
- `app.maxBodySize(64 << 20) { … }` gives a scope's routes a body limit of
  their own in place of `--max-body`, applied before the body is read.
  `app.concurrencyLimit(8) { … }` lets that many of a scope's handlers run at
  once in each worker, and answers the next 503.
- `request.cookie("theme")` and `response.setCookie(Cookie("theme", "dark"))`
  read and set cookies. A cookie is `Path=/`, `HttpOnly` and `SameSite=Lax`
  unless it says otherwise, and `Secure` over HTTPS. With a `CookieKey`, a
  cookie is signed (HMAC-SHA256) or encrypted (AES-256-GCM), and one that was
  tampered with reads as absent. The key takes previous secrets for rotation.
- `app.sessions(store: …)` gives a scope's routes a `Session`: a map of strings
  kept in memory, Redis or SQLite, found by a random ID in a cookie.
  `try await session.set("user", id)` writes it to the store before it returns.
  `session.renew()` moves it to a new ID at login, and `session.destroy()`
  deletes it and its cookie.
- `app.csrfProtection()` refuses, with 403, a POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE that
  the browser says another site's page started, from Sec-Fetch-Site or else
  Origin against Host. It needs no tokens in forms. `trustedOrigins` lets a
  front end on another origin through.
- `app.securityHeaders()` puts nosniff, frame, referrer and cross-origin
  policies on every answer in its scope, and Strict-Transport-Security on
  those over HTTPS. A Content-Security-Policy is one field away, and a header a
  route sets itself is kept.
- `app.trailingSlash(.redirect)` answers `/users/` with a 308 to `/users` when
  only that is routed, and `.ignore` serves it from `/users` directly. Routes
  match exactly by default.
- `app.requestDecompression()` decodes a gzip, deflate, br or zstd request body
  before the handler reads it, held to the route's body limit as it inflates.
- `app.allowedHosts(["example.com", "*.example.com"])` answers 400 to a request
  for any other Host, and `app.addressFilter(allow: ["10.0.0.0/8"])` answers
  403 to a client address outside the list or on a `deny` list.

### Tracing

`app.tracing()` traces through
[swift-distributed-tracing](https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing),
so any tracer written for it records the spans, the OpenTelemetry exporters
among them:

```swift
import Tracing

app.onWorkerStart { _ in
    InstrumentationSystem.bootstrap(makeTracer())   // any Tracer
}
app.tracing()
```

Each request is a server span named for its route, `GET /users/:id`,
continuing the trace its headers carry. Under it are child spans for every
call `request.client` makes, which passes the trace on in its headers, and for
every PostgreSQL statement and Redis round trip. Spans a handler starts with
`withSpan` go under it too. The attributes follow OpenTelemetry's HTTP and
database conventions. SQL is recorded as written; bound values, Redis keys and
values, and query-string values in URLs are not. A streamed response's span
ends with its last byte, not its head.

Workers are processes, and an exporter's threads do not survive the fork, so
the tracer is made in each worker: bootstrap it in `onWorkerStart`, or pass
`app.tracing { worker in … }` a closure that returns one. With tracing off,
each request pays one check.

### OpenAPI

`app.openAPI(OpenAPIInfo(title: "Shop", version: "1.0.0"))` serves an OpenAPI
3.1 document at `/openapi.json`, and `app.swaggerUI()` serves Swagger UI at
`/docs`. The document comes from the routes: a typed route's extractors and
return type give its parameters, request body, security and response, with
JSON Schemas read from the `Decodable` types, so nothing needs annotating.
Every route method returns an `OpenAPIOperation` for what types cannot say:

```swift
app.get("/orders/:id") { (id: Path<Int>) async throws in JSON(try await order(id.value)) }
    .summary("An order by its number")
    .tags("orders")
    .response(.notFound, "No order has that number")
```

### PostgreSQL

A native driver runs on the worker's poller. It supports SCRAM-SHA-256, TLS
(required by default) and a pool per worker with an acquire timeout. Rows decode
into `Decodable` types by column name. `db.transaction { tx in … }` commits or
rolls back. Statements stay prepared on each connection, and values are read in
binary after the first run. `UUID`, `Timestamp`, `PostgresDate`,
`PostgresTime`, `PostgresInterval`, `PostgresNumeric` (exact, kept as its
digits) and `PostgresJSON<T>` come without Foundation. An array column is a
Swift list -- `[String]` for `text[]` -- and a list binds as one. `app.listen`
hears `NOTIFY` in each worker, on a connection of its own, reconnecting with
its channels when the server restarts. `copyIn` and `copyOut` are `COPY` in
both directions, a chunk at a time; a composite type is a `PostgresRecord` and
an enum is a Swift enum; and a server on this machine is reached over its unix
socket.

### Redis

```swift
app.state { _ in RedisPool(RedisConfiguration(host: "cache", password: secret)) }

app.get("/visits/:page") { (page: Path<String>, redis: State<RedisPool>) async throws in
    String(try await redis.value.incr("visits:\(page.value)"))
}
```

A native driver runs on the worker's poller, speaking RESP3 through HELLO and
RESP2 to servers older than Redis 6; Valkey works the same. TLS is required by
default, and ACL users, databases and unix sockets are supported. Commands come
with typed replies (`get`, `set` with expiry and NX/XX, hashes, lists, sets,
`getJSON`), and `send` takes any other. `pipeline` and `transaction` go in one
round trip, `session` holds one connection for WATCH, and `subscribe` listens
to channels and patterns on a connection of its own.

`RedisCluster` is the same API across a cluster: a pool per node, a slot map
learned from the cluster, and every command aimed at the node that owns its
key -- following `MOVED` and `ASK` when the map is behind. `RedisSentinelPool`
asks a set of sentinels where the master is, checks what they name with `ROLE`,
and asks again when a failover takes it away. Garuda's session and
refresh-token stores work on either.

### SQLite

```swift
app.state { _ in
    let db = try SQLiteDatabase(SQLiteConfiguration(path: "/var/lib/app/app.db"))
    try db.migrate(["create table notes (id integer primary key, text text not null)"])
    return db
}

app.get("/note/:id") { (id: Path<Int>, db: State<SQLiteDatabase>) async throws in
    try await db.value.first(Note.self, "select id, text from notes where id = ?", id.value).map { JSON($0) }
}
```

The system's libsqlite3 is loaded at run time, and every statement runs on the
worker's blocking pool, so a worker keeps serving while SQLite reads the disk
or waits for another process's lock. Each worker has one connection that
writes and up to four that read, in write-ahead-log mode; a statement moves to
a reader once SQLite has said it cannot write. Rows decode into `Decodable`
types, `transaction` begins IMMEDIATE, and `migrate` brings the schema up to
date by `user_version` when each worker starts.

### Streaming, server-sent events, WebSockets and WebTransport

```swift
app.get("/export") { () async in
    StreamingBody(contentType: "text/csv") { body in
        for row in rows { try await body.write(row.csv) }   // waits while the client is behind
    }
}

app.get("/ticks") { () async in
    EventStream { events in
        for i in 0... { try await events.send("tick \(i)"); try await events.sleep(milliseconds: 1000) }
    }
}

app.webSocket("/chat/:room") { (ws: WebSocket, room: Path<String>) async throws in
    for try await message in ws { try await ws.send(message) }   // whole messages
}

struct Said: Codable { var text: String }
let lobby = Topic("lobby")
app.post("/say") { (said: Body<Said>) async in
    try lobby.publish(said.value.text, event: "said")   // heard by subscribers on every worker
    return HTTPStatus.noContent
}
app.get("/lobby") { (last: LastEventID) async in
    EventStream { events in try await events.forward(lobby, after: last) }   // replays what a reconnect missed
}

app.webTransport("/room/:id") { (session: WebTransportSession, id: Path<Int>) async throws in
    while let stream = try await session.acceptStream() { /* read and write */ }
}
```

A streamed body is chunked on HTTP/1.1 and DATA frames on HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.
A write waits while more than 512 KiB is queued (`writeHighWaterMark`), and a throw part-way resets the
stream rather than ending it cleanly. A WebSocket handler sees whole messages:
the engine joins fragments, checks UTF-8, answers pings, sends keepalive pings,
runs the close handshake and, with `--ws-compress`, permessage-deflate. Messages
the handler has not read wait in a bounded queue, and past it the socket is not
read, so a fast sender is slowed. A send on a socket whose connection has
ended throws `WebSocketError.closed`, so a room holding sockets learns who has
gone rather than writing to them. The same route serves WebSockets over
HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3; on the last two, flow control slows just that
stream. WebTransport runs over HTTP/3 on the same
port and routes, with bidirectional and unidirectional streams, datagrams and
close codes. The [webtransport example](Examples/Sources/WebTransportExample/WebTransportApp.swift)
uses all of them, with a page that runs it from a browser.

### Streamed request bodies and resumable uploads

```swift
app.onStreamingBody(.put, "/files/:name", maxBodySize: 10 << 30) { request, response, body in
    while let bytes = try await body.read() { try file.write(bytes) }   // as it arrives
    response.send(status: .created)
}

import GarudaUploads

app.resumableUploads("/uploads", store: try FileUploadStore(directory: "/var/lib/app/uploads"),
                     limits: UploadLimits(maxSize: 10 << 30)) { upload in
    try moveIntoPlace(upload.path)
    try upload.remove()
    return HTTPStatus.created
}
```

A route registered with `onStreamingBody` runs as soon as the request's head
arrives, and reads the body as it comes, with its own size limit. Reading is
flow control: bytes the handler has not read hold back the client over
HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, so a slow disk slows only its own upload. If the
client goes away part-way, the handler still reads everything that arrived and
then gets `RequestBodyError.incomplete`.

`GarudaUploads` implements the IETF resumable upload protocol
(draft-ietf-httpbis-resumable-upload, interop version 9). A client cut off
mid-upload asks how much arrived and sends the rest, over any protocol and on
any worker. `response.sendInterim` sends 1xx responses such as 103 Early Hints.

The request that creates an upload and the request that completes it are
different requests -- often minutes apart, and on any worker -- so `onCreate`
is given the creating one, already through whatever middleware guards the
routes, and what it returns is kept on the upload for the completion handler:

```swift
app.authenticate(jwt: Claims.self)
app.resumableUploads("/photos", store: store, onCreate: { request in
    var parameter = 0
    let jwt = try JWT<Claims>.extract(from: request, parameter: &parameter)
    return ["user": jwt.claims.sub]                    // server-set metadata
}) { upload in
    try record(upload.path, owner: upload.metadata["user"])
    return HTTPStatus.created
}
```

The server writes that metadata and no client can reach it, which is what makes
it the place for whose upload this is -- `Content-Type` and
`Content-Disposition` come from the client and are not. A throw from `onCreate`
refuses the upload before anything is written, so a request turned away leaves
nothing behind to expire.

`uploads` is relative to wherever the routes are mounted, so a group carries
them whole: inside `group("/api")` the uploads live at `/api/uploads/:id` and
that is what the `Location` says, and inside `group("/users/:user")` each
upload's URL sits under the user whose request created it.

The answer to the request that completes an upload is kept, `Location`
included, and a GET of the upload's URL gives it again until `maxAge`: a
client whose connection died as the upload finished still learns what became
of it. An answer whose body is streamed is not kept, since its bytes are
written after it has gone; return one whole if it should survive. The
[uploads example](Examples/Sources/UploadsExample/UploadsApp.swift) puts
this together: per-user photos, owned through `onCreate`, checked before
they are kept, and resumable under a group.

A 104 is an interim response, and an intermediary is free to drop one: a CDN or
a reverse proxy in front of the server may give the client only the final 201.
A client should read the upload's URL from the 104 when it arrives and from the
`Location` of the 201 when it does not, which is what a client creating an
upload with an empty body does anyway.

### Testing

```swift
@Test func personIsFound() throws {
    let response = try app.test.get("/person/1")
    #expect(response.status == .ok)
    #expect(try response.json(Person.self).name == "Ada")
}
```

`app.test` runs the real engine in the test process over a socket pair, with no
port: parsing, routing, middleware, handlers, timers and the response path.

## Garuda and axum

The application API is modelled after [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum).
axum is a mature, widely used framework, so this is where Garuda stands against
it, area by area.

| Area | axum (Tokio) | Garuda |
|---|---|---|
| Route dispatch | Every handler is a future the runtime polls | A synchronous handler is a direct call on the worker thread |
| Async handlers | `async fn` on a work-stealing pool | Reused tasks on the worker's own executor, no allocation per request |
| Spreading load over cores | Idle threads steal tasks from busy ones | A worker ahead of the others leaves new connections to them; quick connections stuck behind slow requests move to a worker where they would not wait ([differs](#one-process-per-worker)) |
| Typed extraction | `Path`, `Query`, `Json`, `Form`, `Multipart` | `Path`, `Query`, `Body`, `Form`, `Multipart` |
| Custom extractors | `FromRequestParts`, `FromRequest`, `Option<T>`, `Result<T, E>` | `RequestExtractor`, `AsyncRequestExtractor`, `E?`, `Result<E, any Error>` |
| OpenAPI | utoipa or aide, with derive macros | `app.openAPI`, `app.swaggerUI`; schemas read from `Decodable` types |
| State | `State<T>`, one `Arc` shared by every thread | `State<T>`, built in each worker process ([differs](#one-process-per-worker)) |
| Request-scoped values | `Extension<T>` | `request[context:]`, `Context<Key>` |
| Errors as responses | `IntoResponse` | `ResponseError`, `HTTPError` |
| Protocols | HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 through hyper | HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 |
| TLS | rustls or OpenSSL via `axum-server`; ACME from another crate | Built in, with ACME |
| Nesting and 405 | `nest`, `merge`, `fallback`, 405 with `Allow` | `group`, `Router` with `nest` and `merge`, `fallback` per scope, 405 with `Allow` |
| Middleware | Tower layers that wrap the handler | `use` before the handler; `onSend` on the response ([differs](#middleware-does-not-wrap-the-handler)) |
| Ready-made middleware | tower-http, tower-sessions, axum-extra | Server flags for compression, rate limits, request IDs, trace context, access log; `app.deadline`, `app.cors`, `app.authenticate`, `JWT<Claims>`, `request.log`, `app.onResponse`, `app.maxBodySize`, `app.concurrencyLimit`, cookies, `app.sessions`, `app.csrfProtection`, `app.securityHeaders`, `app.trailingSlash`, `app.requestDecompression`, `app.allowedHosts`, `app.addressFilter` |
| Streaming responses | `Body::from_stream` | `response.stream()`, `StreamingBody`, with backpressure |
| Server-sent events | `Sse`, with keep-alive | `EventStream`, with keep-alive comments and `Last-Event-ID` |
| Broadcast | `tokio::sync::broadcast`, within one process | `Topic`, across worker processes, to event streams, WebSockets and long polls, with replay |
| Streaming request bodies | `Body::into_data_stream` | `onStreamingBody`, with a limit per route and flow control back to the client |
| Resumable uploads | None built in; tus through other crates | `GarudaUploads`: the IETF resumable upload protocol |
| Interim responses | None: hyper sends only 100 Continue | `response.sendInterim`, such as 103 Early Hints |
| WebSockets | `WebSocketUpgrade` | `app.webSocket`, whole messages, pings and permessage-deflate by the engine (over HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3) |
| WebTransport | None in hyper | `app.webTransport` |
| HTTP client | reqwest | `request.client`, HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, redirects by policy, decompression, streamed responses and server-sent events, a whole-exchange budget |
| PostgreSQL | sqlx, tokio-postgres | Native driver on the poller |
| Redis | redis-rs, fred | Native driver on the poller: RESP3 and RESP2, TLS, ACL, pipelines, transactions, pub/sub |
| SQLite | sqlx, rusqlite | The system's libsqlite3 on the blocking pool: a writer and readers per worker, WAL, migrations |
| Blocking work | `spawn_blocking` | `blocking { … }` on a bounded pool of threads per worker |
| Testing | `tower::ServiceExt::oneshot` | `app.test`, the real engine |

Every row is implemented and tested.

For performance, [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md) has the method and every run,
including hello-world comparisons with axum that measure what the server adds to
a request.

### Where Garuda differs, and why

#### Middleware does not wrap the handler

A Tower layer awaits the handler and gets its response back as a value. A
Garuda handler writes its answer straight into the connection's buffer, so
there is no response value to hand back without building and copying one on
every request. Middleware runs **before** the handler, and `response.onSend`
lets it see and change the response just before the head is written. The hook
runs for every way a request is answered: the handler, a thrown error, a
middleware's refusal and a deadline's 504. Hooks run last-added first, so they
nest the way layers do.

What that rules out: retrying the handler from middleware, or holding a scope
open around its run. Retry inside the handler or around `pool.transaction`, and
use `app.deadline` for timeouts. Hooks do not run for static files, cache hits,
or the 404 before any route matches.

#### Middleware covers its whole scope

An axum `layer` applies only to routes added before it. Garuda's `use` covers
every route in its group or application wherever the call is, so moving a line
cannot leave a route unguarded. A route that must skip a middleware goes outside
the group.

#### One process per worker

A worker is a process with one thread. Nothing is shared, so nothing is locked,
a crash takes only that worker's connections, and `SIGHUP` replaces workers one
at a time. The cost: in-memory state is per worker, and a pool of 8 database
connections is 8 per worker. Keep shared state in a database, and size pools as
the total divided by `--workers`.

A crash staying in one worker matters more in Swift than in Rust: a
force-unwrapped `nil` or an index out of range ends a Swift process on the
spot, where Tokio catches a Rust panic in the task that raised it.

Processes cannot steal work from each other the way Tokio's threads do.
Instead a worker ahead of the others leaves new connections to them, and a
worker where quick requests would wait behind slow ones hands idle HTTP/1
keep-alive connections to one where they would not (`--balance`). When every
worker holds a slow client, the slow ones are gathered onto fewer workers to
free the rest. With 8 slow connections among 64 on 8 workers, starting a
second in, the quick requests' p99 was 2.4–2.8 ms and axum's 3.0–3.1 ms, where
the kernel's hash alone let it reach 7.6 ms. HTTPS connections do not move:
the record layer is BoringSSL and encrypts in the process, so the session
cannot travel with the descriptor. HTTP/2 connections, WebSockets and requests
in progress stay on the worker that has them.

#### A handler that computes without awaiting holds its worker

A worker is one thread, and staying on it is what removes the scheduling hop. A
loop that never awaits holds the worker until it ends. A deadline bounds
waiting, not computing. Run more workers than busy cores, and hand a call that
blocks or computes for long to `try await blocking { … }`, which runs it on the
worker's blocking pool while the worker serves other requests. Waiting on an
external program is such a call. A handler that holds its worker for
`--slow-handler-ms` (100 by default) is warned about with its route, so such a
loop shows up in the log rather than only in the latency of its neighbours:
an async handler always, a synchronous one with `--metrics-port`.

#### On macOS 15, `Task.yield()` leaves the worker

Swift 6.1's concurrency runtime, the one macOS 15 has, sends a task that calls
`Task.yield()` to the global executor whatever executor it prefers. The
handler still resumes on its worker, but only once a thread of the global
pool is free to hand it back. Linux, and the runtime in newer macOS, keep it
on the worker. A handler that wants to let others run is better served by an
await on the engine, such as `response.sleep(milliseconds:)`.

#### No Foundation

Garuda brings its own JSON coder, `UUID` and `Timestamp`. If your code imports
Foundation too, write `Garuda.UUID` where both are in scope.

#### PostgreSQL prepares statements on its own

Every connection keeps up to 256 statements prepared, with no opt-in per query.
Behind PgBouncer in transaction pooling mode, set `statementCacheCapacity = 0`.

## The server

These work without any handler code, set by flags:

- **HTTP/1.1** with a parser strict where it prevents request smuggling,
  **HTTP/2** over TLS and cleartext, and **HTTP/3** over QUIC (`--http3`).
  QUIC, TLS 1.3 key schedule and QPACK are Swift, over OpenSSL's crypto
  primitives.
- **TLS** on a vendored BoringSSL, with several certificates chosen by SNI on
  both TCP and QUIC. OpenSSL is still linked for cryptography, ACME and QUIC.
  There is no kernel TLS, so `--ktls` is accepted and ignored.
- **ACME** certificates (`--acme-domain`), obtained and renewed with tls-alpn-01
  on the port already served.
- **Static files** (`--static-dir`) with `sendfile`, `ETag` and byte ranges,
  pre-compressed copies (`--compress-static`), and directories answered by
  their `index.html` (`--static-index`) or listed (`--static-listing`).
- **Rate limiting** (`--rate-limit`) counted across workers.
- **HTTPS redirects** (`--redirect-http`), **HSTS**, **request IDs**, **W3C
  trace context**, an **access log**, **Prometheus metrics** and a **health
  check**.
- **Graceful shutdown** with `--drain-delay`, and **zero-downtime reload** on
  `SIGHUP` or when the executable is rebuilt (`--reload`).
- **Unix sockets**, multiple **workers**, and **trusted proxy headers**
  (`--forwarded-allow-ips`).
- **Compression** of handler responses (`--compress`) and a **response cache**
  shared by the workers (`--cache-size`).

`garuda --help` lists every flag, and [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md) explains them.

### Signals

| Signal | Effect |
|---|---|
| `SIGTERM` | Stop accepting, finish in-flight requests within `--graceful-timeout`. With `--drain-delay`, keep serving first while the health check answers 503. |
| `SIGINT`, `SIGQUIT` | Shut down without the drain delay. |
| `SIGHUP` | Replace every worker one at a time, rereading certificates, without refusing a connection. |

## Tests

```bash
swift test                                   # 1132 unit tests, and the fuzz corpus
(cd Examples && swift test)                  # 41  the examples, through app.test
bash scripts/compile-fail-test.sh            # 18  handler code that must not compile
```

The end-to-end suites run against a release build. Each takes a binary path as
its first argument. Most use `.build/release/garuda`; `handler-test.py`,
`websocket-test.py`, `webtransport-test.py`, `upload-test.py` and `broadcast-test.py` use
`.build/release/garuda-conformance`, whose routes exist only for the tests.

python3 scripts/broadcast-test.py            # 36  topics across workers, Last-Event-ID, keep-alive
```

The shell suites need `curl` and `openssl`. The Python suites are clients only,
using `h2` and `aioquic`, which share no code with the server. Two unit tests
want a second loopback address, which Linux has and macOS has to be asked for
(`sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.2 up`); without it they say so and skip,
rather than failing as though something were wrong. Every parser that
reads network bytes is fuzzed with `swift run -c release pgfuzz`
([fuzz/README.md](fuzz/README.md)). CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on
every push and pull request: the build and unit tests on Ubuntu 24.04 and
macOS 15, the handler code that must not compile, the connectors against a
real PostgreSQL and Redis, and the end-to-end suites. The protocol suites and
a sanitizer fuzz run on every push to `main`, nightly and on demand, but not
on a pull request: they are slow and want a QUIC stack.

## Status

Garuda is past 1.0, so a breaking change to the public API needs a major
version. 1.1.0 made one exception, one word long: `CompletedUpload.digest()`
must now be awaited, and [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md#110--2026-09-30) says why.
[COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md) says what that covers and how much notice
a change gets. Pin with `from: "1.1.0"`.

### Known limits

A handler waiting on something other than the engine -- its own continuation,
say -- is not unwound when its request is cancelled. It resumes to find
`response.isCancelled` set, and anything it sends is dropped. Wrap the wait in
`response.cancellable { … }` and it is given up on when the request ends. What
that cannot do is stop work which ignores cancellation; the worker counts such
work and reports it on the health check instead.

### Not supported

- Reads from Redis replicas: every command goes to the master, or to the node
  that owns the slot. [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md) has the rest of the
  driver's limits.
- `multipart/byteranges`: a request for several ranges at once is answered
  with the whole file.
- QUIC session resumption and 0-RTT.
- TLS over TCP in Swift: the record layer is BoringSSL.
- Kernel TLS: BoringSSL has none, so `--ktls` is accepted and ignored.
- Windows, except through WSL 2.
