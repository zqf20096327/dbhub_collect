## Getting Started

You can use Dash straight from the browser (👉 https://app.dash.builders/) or install it as a DuckDB community extension:

```
INSTALL dash FROM community;
LOAD dash;
PRAGMA dash;
```

That's it. Dash opens directly from within DuckDB.

### Advanced Usage

```sql
-- Starts the http server
CALL start_dash('127.0.0.1', 4200)

-- Enable cors (false by default)
CALL start_dash('127.0.0.1', 4200, enable_cors=true);

-- Require authentication (off by default)
CALL start_dash('127.0.0.1', 4200, api_key='abc123');

-- Proxy the web UI from a different location
CALL start_dash('127.0.0.1', 4200, ui_proxy='https://gropaul.github.io/dash-ui/');
```

Once the _dash_ is running, access the WebUI by opening http://127.0.0.1:4200 in your browser.

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description                     | Parameters                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|----------|--------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/`      | GET    | View the integrated web UI.     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `/query` | POST   | Execute an SQL query.           | **Header:** <br> - `X-Api-Key` (optional) – API key for authentication. <br><br> **Body (JSON):** <br> - `query` (string, required) – The SQL query to be executed. <br> - `format` (string, required) – Response format (`compact_json` | `json`). |
| `/ping`  | GET    | Check if the server is running. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

For detailed schema definitions refer to the [API documentation](openapi.yaml).
This also contains instructions on querying and uploading files using the HTTP API. For worked examples of
every endpoint, including file uploads, see the tests in [`test/sql/http/`](./test/sql/http).

## Serialization pragmas

The extension provides a set of pragmas to control the serialization of queries. These **SHOULD** be used independently
of the web UI or the HTTP API and using them in a statement sent to the HTTP API is not advised, as the HTTP API already
serializes the results using the same format.

```sql
-- Default format is JSON
PRAGMA AS_JSON('SELECT {''key1'': range} as map, range FROM range(2)');

PRAGMA AS_JSON('SELECT {''key1'': range} as map, range FROM range(2)', format='JSON');
-- Output:
-- [
--   {"map":{"key1":0},"range":0},
--   {"map":{"key1":1},"range":1}
-- ]
       
PRAGMA AS_JSON('SELECT {''key1'': range} as map, range FROM range(2)', format='COMPACT_JSON');
-- Output:       
-- {
--   "meta": [
--     {"name": "map","type": "STRUCT(key1 BIGINT)"},
--     {"name": "range","type": "BIGINT"}
--   ],
--   "data": [
--     [{"key1": 0},0],
--     [{"key1": 1},1]
--   ],
--   "statistics": {
--     "rows": 2
--   }
-- }
```

## Development

### Setting up the Repository

Clone the repository and all its submodules

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url>
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**Build the UI:** Change into the _dash-ui_ directory and build the UI

```bash
cd dash-ui
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="" pnpm run build
```

**Generate source files:** Change back to the root directory and generate the source files containing the UI

```bash
python3 scripts/gen_ui_files.py
```

### Setting up CLion

**Opening project:**
Configuring CLion with the extension template requires a little work. Firstly, make sure that the DuckDB submodule is
available.
Then make sure to open `./duckdb/CMakeLists.txt` (so not the top level `CMakeLists.txt` file from this repo) as a
project in CLion.
Now to fix your project path go to
`tools->CMake->Change Project Root`([docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/change-project-root-directory.html)) to
set the project root to the root dir of this repo.

**Debugging:**
To set up debugging in CLion, there are two simple steps required. Firstly, in
`CLion -> Settings / Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deploy -> CMake` you will need to add the desired builds (e.g.
Debug, Release, RelDebug, etc). There's different ways to configure this, but the easiest is to leave all empty, except
the `build path`, which needs to be set to `../build/{build type}`. Now on a clean repository you will first need to run
`make {build type}` to initialize the CMake build directory. After running make, you will be able to (re)build from
CLion by using the build target we just created. If you use the CLion editor, you can create a CLion CMake profiles
matching the CMake variables that are described in the makefile, and then you don't need to invoke the Makefile.

The second step is to configure the unittest runner as a run/debug configuration. To do this, go to
`Run -> Edit Configurations` and click `+ -> Cmake Application`. The target and executable should be `unittest`. This
will run all the DuckDB tests. To specify only running the extension specific tests, add `--test-dir ../../.. [sql]` to
the `Program Arguments`. Note that it is recommended to use the `unittest` executable for testing/development within
CLion. The actual DuckDB CLI currently does not reliably work as a run target in CLion.

### Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
make test_debug
```

The tests are [SQLLogicTests](https://duckdb.org/dev/sqllogictest/intro.html). The ones in
`test/sql/http/` start the server and send it real HTTP requests; see
[`test/README.md`](./test/README.md).
