Cloudberry Monitor

About:
========================================================================

Cloudberry Monitor is a set of scripts & schema to permit observability
of one or many Apache Cloudberry (incubating) clusters in the abscence
of Greenplum Command Center (GPCC). Very likely can also monitor
Greenplum (Broadcom) however equally likely to be compatibility issues
as one is now closed source.

Benefits, unlike GPCC, are that this system will catch up even when the
database is down. It leverages sar logs specifically those created by
sysstat 11.7 found in RHEL 8 and variants. As long as those files are
being written to host metrics will eventually appear.

Included is a sample Grafana dashboard. Grafana is not necessary however
due to ease of installation, configuration, flexibility and alerting it
is recommended.

Why not Prometheus? It's a fine product designed to do many things.
Desire was ease of extensibility without having to learn other tech's
or languages, maintainable, & live data direct from Cloudberry cluster.
Tradeoffs.

Working Configurations:
========================================================================
 * RHEL 8 hosts
 * pre-Apache Cloudberry 1.6.0 & Apache Cloudberry (incubating) main branch
 * RHEL 8 based CBmon PostgreSQL

Untested & needs work:
 * RHEL 9 hosts
 * Greenplum 6 & 7


Features:
========================================================================

 * Provides database on which any dashboard can be built (prefer grafana)

 * Ability to house data from one or many clusters

 * Remote access to Cloudberry catalogs

 * Method to collect host performance metrics stored in sar files

 * Remote execution of functions in Cloudberry

 * Easily extensible to pull additional information from remote Cloudberry
   cluster

 * Post data load functionality to create summaries or specific data points

 * Data kept as long as necessary or wanted

 * Requires only 2 scheduled jobs: data gathering, historical data management


Host Configuration:
========================================================================

More frequent intervals for sysstat is recommended otherwise metrics get watered
down as many from the system are averages between collection periods.

1. Install sysstat everywhere
```
gpssh -f allhosts sudo dnf -y install sysstat
```

2. Modify all cluster hosts to override sysstat-collect.timer to once/minute.
This creates ```/etc/systemd/system/sysstat-collect.timer.d/override.conf```.
```
sudo systemctl edit sysstat-collect.timer
```
Paste in editor:
```
[Timer]
OnCalendar=*:00/1
```
 
3. Reload, enable and start
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now sysstat
```

Alternative useful for larger clusters:
```
cat << EOL > override.conf
[Timer]
OnCalendar=*:00/1
EOL

gpsync -f allhosts override.conf =:/tmp
gpssh -f allhosts sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/sysstat-collect.timer.d
gpssh -f allhosts sudo install -o root -g root -m 0644 /tmp/override.conf /etc/systemd/system/sysstat-collect.timer.d
gpssh -f allhosts rm -f /tmp/override.conf
gpssh -f allhosts sudo systemctl daemon-reload
gpssh -f allhosts sudo systemctl start sysstat-collect.timer
gpssh -f allhosts sudo systemctl enable sysstat-collect.timer
```
NOTE for RHEL 9 variants:
```
gpssh -f allhosts sudo systemctl start sysstat
gpssh -f allhosts sudo systemctl enable sysstat
```
RHEL 8/9 verify: Files should grow once/minute in ```/var/log/sa```
```
ls -l /var/log/sa
sar -f /var/log/sa/saDD -b
```

4. Create cbmon RPM
```
cd cloudberry-mon/pkg
./build_rpm -r X -v Y.Z -d el8
```

4. Copy RPM to all hosts
```
gpsync -f allhosts cbmon-Y.Z-X.el8.noarch.rpm =:/tmp
```

5. Install on all cluster hosts
```
gpssh -f allhosts sudo rpm -ivh /tmp/cbmon-Y.Z-X.el8.noarch.rpm
```

6. Verify & change ownership
```
gpssh -f allhosts sudo chown -R gpadmin:gpadmin /usr/local/cbmon
```


Cloudberry Configuration:
========================================================================
On the mdw host only, perform the following steps:

1. Set MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY in /usr/local/cbmon/etc/config

2. Load each alter in numerical order
```
/usr/local/cbmon/bin/load_cbalters -d MYDB -p PORT -U gpadmin
```

3. Configure pg_hba.conf to allow remote connections from PostgreSQL host
   & reload
```
gpstop -u
```


PostgreSQL Metrics Database Host Only
========================================================================

1. Install same RPM created above on cbmon host
```
sudo rpm -ivh cloudberry-mon/pkg/cbmon-Y.Z-X.el8.noarch.rpm
```

2. Change ownership to postgres
```
sudo chown -R postgres:postgres /usr/local/cbmon
```

3. Install prerequisites for PostgreSQL, pg_partman and grafana packages. No conceivable reason a version of PostgreSQL >=16 would not work.
Prerequsites:
```
rpm -ivh https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/reporpms/EL-8-x86_64/pgdg-redhat-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
dnf install perl libxslt libicu-devel clang-devel llvm-devel
dnf install python3-psycopg2
dnf --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=powertools install perl-IPC-Run
dnf -y update
```

```
sudo rpm -ivh https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/reporpms/EL-8-x86_64/pgdg-redhat-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
sudo dnf --nogpgcheck --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=pgdg16 -y install postgresql16 postgresql16-contrib postgresql16-server grafana pg_partman_16
```

4. Initialize PostgreSQL

5. Create ```cbmon``` role with SUPERUSER privs

6. Create ```cbmon``` database owned by role ```cbmon```

7. Load alters in order
```
/usr/local/cbmon/bin/load_pgalters -d cbmon -p PORT -U cbmon
```
    
8. Configure ```postgresql.conf``` per alter output permitting ```pg_partman``` usage
```
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_partman_bgw'
pg_partman_bgw.interval = '3600'
pg_partman_bgw.role = 'partman'
pg_partman_bgw.dbname = 'cbmon'
pg_partman_bgw.analyze = 'on'
```
7. Configure pg_hba.conf to permit grafana & cbmon user access & restart
```
systemctl restart postgresql-16
```

8. Configure grafana for your environment & start
```
systemctl start grafana-server
```

9. Enable PostgreSQL & grafana to start on reboot
```
systemctl enable postgresql-16
systemctl enable grafana-server
```

Creating clusters
========================================================================
Tenancy in cbmon PostgreSQL database is done via schemas where a cluster
schema is named ```metrics_CLUSTER_ID``` where CLUSTER_ID is from
```public.clusters```.

To create a cluster, perform the following in the cbmon database:

```
SELECT public.create_cluster(
        v_name        varchar(256),  -- Cluster name
        v_mdwname     varchar(256),  -- Cluster mdw hostname
        v_mdwip       varchar(16),   -- Cluster mdw IP
        v_port        int,           -- Cluster mdw port
        v_cbmondb     varchar(256),  -- Database where cbmon schema has been loaded
        v_cbmonschema varchar(256),  -- Name of schema in database, typically cbmon
        v_user        varchar(256),  -- Superuser to connect as
        v_pass        varchar(256)   -- Superuser password
);
```

This function will create and populate ```metrics``` schema as well as
several other tables.

IMPORTANT: Review ```public.cluster_hosts```. Values in ```hostname``` column
must match each host actual hostname, that is output of ```hostname``` command.
For display purposes, populate ```public.cluster_hosts.display_name``` with
preferred name such as ```sdw1```, ```sdw2```, and so on.

When changes are made to ```public.cluster_hosts```, the clusters corresponding
```metrics_X.data_storage_summary_mv``` materialized view must be refreshed.
```
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW metrics_X.data_storage_summary_mv WITH DATA;
```

Equally important, cluster ```metrics_X``` schema will not yet contain
tables with historical data. This will occur once loader process has
initially run.


Option 1 - Enabling old systemd loader process
========================================================================
Initially, all loading was done via a loader script. Early on it was noticed
this script would fall behind due to its serial execution nature and certain
load functions taking a long time. It is kept here simply to document as an
option. The parallel loader process below is recommended as this will no
longer be maintained.

1. Edit ```etc/config``` and ```cbmon_loader.service``` to reflect cluster ID

2. Install service file replacing <<CLUSTER_ID>> with cluster ID
```
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0644 \
     /usr/local/cbmon/etc/cbmon_loader.service \
     /etc/systemd/system/cbmon_loader-c<<CLUSTER_ID>>.service
```
3. Reload
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

4. Start, verify and enable replacing <<CLUSTER_ID>> with cluster ID
```
sudo systemctl start cbmon_loader-c<<CLUSTER_ID>>
sudo systemctl status cbmon_loader-c<<CLUSTER_ID>>
sudo systemctl enable cbmon_loader-c<<CLUSTER_ID>>
```

Option 2 - Enabling Message Driven Loader
========================================================================

Cloudberry clusters can be large with high core counts and with sysstat-collect.timer tuned
running once/minute, files in ```/var/log/sa``` can become large. This can delay delivering
metrics to ```cbmon``` database and ultimately grafana or whatever visualization tech is used.

Implementing a loader process capable of performing metrics load work in parallel is ncessary
versus the original systemd loader running serially.

Unlike systemd method, ```parallel_loader``` is not configured to a specific cluster
therefore services requests for any cluster.

1. Install RabbitMQ & configure adding users, vhost and queues. Example:
```
sudo -s

dnf install epel-release curl -y

curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/script.rpm.sh | bash
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/rabbitmq/erlang/script.rpm.sh | bash

dnf -y install erlang rabbitmq-server

systemctl start rabbitmq-server
systemctl enable rabbitmq-server

rabbitmqctl add_user admin
rabbitmqctl set_user_tags admin administrator
rabbitmqctl list_users

# Enable web console
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
systemctl restart rabbitmq-server
rabbitmqctl status

rabbitmqctl add_user cbmon
rabbitmqctl add_vhost /cbmon_ploader
rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p /cbmon_ploader cbmon ".*" ".*" ".*"
```

2. Install python3 modules
```
sudo pip3 install pika psycopg2
```
3. Configure ```etc/config.ini``` for RabbitMQ instance

4. Install ```parallel_loader.service``` in ```/etc/systemd/system```
```
install -o root -g root -m 0644 /usr/local/cbmon/etc/parallel_loader.service /etc/systemd/system
```

5. Reload systemd, start and enable new service
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start parallel_loader.service
sudo systemctl enable parallel_loader.service
```

6. Create cron jobs for each cluster sending load messages for all enabled metric types
```
* * * * * PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/cbmon/bin/pylib /usr/local/cbmon/bin/send_loader_request --config /usr/local/cbmon/etc/config.ini -C <<CLUSTER_ID>> --load-all
```

#### Recommendations:

File ```etc/config.ini cbmon_load.max_workers``` should not exceed the number of connections wanted
in Cloudberry database. Also keep in mind if Grafana or whatever dashboard & alerting implemented
querying PostgreSQL cbmon database will also consume connections.

To alleviate connection consumption, recommend creating a pgbouncer instance or creating a pool
in an existing pgbouncer. Once set up, ```ALTER SERVER``` setting host, port and any other relevant
options to use pgbouncer.

When using any connection pooler, important for pool size to be equal to ```config.ini```
``cbmon_load.max_workers``` plus adequate spares for dashboard and alerting.


Enabling summaries process
========================================================================
NOTE:
If alter-1064.sql is loaded, this process should not be used. Summaries
process will eventually be deprecated.


Summaries service execute functions responsible for generating periodic
summarization of gathered performance metrics. It is useful for faster
dashboard loads and permitting drill-down capabilities.

1. Edit ```etc/config``` and ```cbmon_summaries.service``` to reflect cluster ID

2. Install service file replacing <<CLUSTER_ID>> with cluster ID
```
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0644 \
     /usr/local/cbmon/etc/cbmon_summaries.service \
     /etc/systemd/system/cbmon_summaries-c<<CLUSTER_ID>>.service
```

3. Reload
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

4. Start, verify and enable replacing <<CLUSTER_ID>> with cluster ID
```
sudo systemctl start cbmon_summaries-c<<CLUSTER_ID>>
sudo systemctl status cbmon_summaries-c<<CLUSTER_ID>>
sudo systemctl enable cbmon_summaries-c<<CLUSTER_ID>>
```
