This project is a custom implementation of the Google Cloud Datastore emulator, written in Rust. It is designed to be a lightweight, high-performance alternative to the official Google emulator for local development and testing.

The repository includes a comprehensive test suite that runs against both this custom emulator and the official Google Datastore emulator to ensure a high degree of API compatibility.

## Features

*   **Core Datastore API**: Supports standard gRPC operations like `Lookup`, `RunQuery`, and `Commit`.
*   **Mutations**: Full support for `Insert`, `Update`, `Upsert`, and `Delete` operations.
*   **Transactions**: Implements `BeginTransaction`, `Commit`, and `Rollback`.
*   **Querying**: Supports property filters (`=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, etc.) and composite filters.
*   **Aggregation Queries**: Supports `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG` aggregations.
*   **ID Management**: Implements `AllocateIds` and `ReserveIds`.
*   **Data Import**: An HTTP endpoint to import data from official Datastore exports.
*   **HTTP REST API**: Implements the public Google Datastore REST API v1 at `POST /v1/projects/{projectId}:{method}` for `lookup`, `runQuery`, `runAggregationQuery`, `commit`, `beginTransaction`, `rollback`, `allocateIds`, `reserveIds`, and `import` (`export` currently returns `501 Not Implemented`). Browser clients are supported via permissive CORS.


## How to use

### Using Cargo
Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. You can install the Rust toolchain by following the instructions at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/). Then, you can install the Rust Datastore emulator using Cargo:

```bash
cargo install datastore-emulator
```

### Using Homebrew

After a stable release is published:

```bash
brew tap guibeira/datastore-emulator https://github.com/guibeira/datastore-emulator
brew install datastore-emulator
```

### Using Docker Compose
You can use the following `docker-compose.yml` file to run the Rust Datastore emulator: 

```yaml
services:
  datastore-emulator:
    image: guibeira/datastore-emulator:latest
    command: [
      "--host-port", "0.0.0.0:8042",
      "--no-store-on-disk",
    ]
    ports:
      - "8042:8042"
```

### Using the pre-built Docker image
You can run the Rust Datastore emulator using the pre-built Docker image available on Docker Hub.   

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name datastore-emulator \
  -p 8042:8042 \
  guibeira/datastore-emulator:latest \
  --host-port 0.0.0.0:8042 \
  --no-store-on-disk
```


## Browser Admin UI

Once the HTTP REST API is running, you can manage the emulator with a Google Cloud Datastore browser admin UI. [DSAdmin](https://github.com/remko/dsadmin) is the recommended option: it talks to the emulator over the same REST API used in production and supports browsing, editing, creating, deleting, and running GQL queries from the browser.

To run the emulator alongside DSAdmin with Docker Compose, save the following as `docker-compose.yml` and run `docker compose up`:

```yaml
services:
  # DSAdmin (browser UI). Runs via npx in a node image so the same compose works
  # on amd64 and arm64; the official ghcr.io/remko/dsadmin image is amd64-only
  # and currently crashes on Apple Silicon under qemu.
  dsadmin:
    image: node:20-alpine
    depends_on:
      - datastore
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      DATASTORE_PROJECT_ID: my-datastore-project
      DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST: "datastore:8042"
    command: >
      sh -c "npx -y dsadmin@latest --project=my-datastore-project
             --datastore-emulator-host=datastore:8042"

  # Rust Datastore Emulator
  datastore:
    image: guibeira/datastore-emulator:latest
    working_dir: /data
    volumes:
      - datastore_data:/data
    ports:
      - "8042:8042"
    command: ["--host-port", "0.0.0.0:8042"]

volumes:
  datastore_data:
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` once both containers report ready. The emulator persists data under the named volume `datastore_data` and serves the same REST endpoints documented above.


## Building from source

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
 * Rust toolchain (using `rustup`)
 * protobuf compiler (`protoc`)

### Run the Rust Emulator
To build the Rust emulator, navigate to the project root and run:

```bash
cargo run --release
```


## Testing

See the [test](https://github.com/guibeira/datastore-emulator/blob/main/tests/README.md) instructions

## Releasing

1. Open GitHub Actions.
2. Run `Manual Release`.
3. Use a version without leading `v`, for example `0.1.1`.
4. Run first with `dry_run=true`.
5. If the diff is correct, run again with `dry_run=false`.
6. The pushed tag `vX.Y.Z` triggers the release pipeline.

Stable releases publish GitHub Release assets, crates.io, Homebrew and Docker Hub.
Prereleases publish GitHub Release assets and Docker prerelease tags, but skip crates.io and Homebrew.


## Benchmarks

Here are some results with 30 clients and 10 runs each:

| Operation | Total Time (Rust) | Total Time (Java) | Avg Time/Client (Rust) | Avg Time/Client (Java) | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Single Insert | 1.6883s | 95.1637s | 0.0563s | 3.1721s | Rust 56.37x faster |
| Bulk Insert (50) | 17.7474s | 375.3370s | 0.5916s | 12.5112s | Rust 21.15x faster |
| Simple Query | 20.5427s | 62.8813s | 0.6848s | 2.0960s | Rust 3.06x faster |
