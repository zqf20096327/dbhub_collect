# TrustID : Smart Identity Verification 

TrustID is an AI-assisted identity and document screening platform for Smart India Hackathon problem statement 26188: **AI-Based Fake Identity & Document Screening System**. The product promise is **Verify. Detect. Protect.** It is decision support for authorized personnel, not an autonomous legal or criminality determination system.

We will make the verification process smarter than ever.
## Project status

**PHASE 12 COMPLETE — final hardening and SIH demo readiness.** The repository contains secure ingestion, OCR, technical tampering signals, photo-based demo face comparison, deterministic document validation, idempotent verification-level orchestration, persisted lifecycle state, explainable persisted risk factors, auditable officer case operations, consistently filtered UTC analytics, paginated audit exploration, and deterministic verification/case PDF reports. These capabilities summarize existing evidence; they do not establish legal identity, fraud, criminality, immigration eligibility, or an automatic decision.

## Authoritative source of truth

Use both master documents together for all TrustID product, UX, architecture, and implementation work:

| Document | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [`TRUSTID_MASTER_SPEC.md`](./TRUSTID_MASTER_SPEC.md) | Product and engineering requirements, workflows, routes, data models, safety boundaries, and acceptance criteria. |
| [`MANUS_MASTER_CONTEXT_PROMPT.md`](./MANUS_MASTER_CONTEXT_PROMPT.md) | Implementation context covering design direction, architecture, demo scenarios, risk semantics, frontend/backend expectations, and delivery standards. |

The master specification defines **what TrustID must be**. The master context prompt defines **how TrustID should be designed and implemented**.

## Architecture

```text
apps/web (Next.js + React + TypeScript)
        ↓
apps/api (FastAPI modular monolith, /api/v1)
        ↓
auth service · permission dependencies · provider-neutral services
        ↓
PostgreSQL · Redis · MinIO
packages/shared (cross-layer domain contracts)
```

The API exposes `GET /api/v1/health`, authentication, document endpoints, OCR, tampering analysis, face-verification execution/results, verification-level analysis/risk results, cases, analytics, audit events, and secure report generation. See [`docs/document-upload.md`](./docs/document-upload.md), [`docs/ocr.md`](./docs/ocr.md), [`docs/tampering-detection.md`](./docs/tampering-detection.md), [`docs/face-verification.md`](./docs/face-verification.md), [`docs/verification-intelligence.md`](./docs/verification-intelligence.md), [`docs/cases-investigation.md`](./docs/cases-investigation.md), and [`docs/analytics-audit-reports.md`](./docs/analytics-audit-reports.md).

## Local development

Requirements are Node.js 22+, npm, Python 3.11+, Docker, and Docker Compose. Start local infrastructure from the repository root with `docker compose up -d postgres redis minio`. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if local configuration overrides are needed. Never commit real secrets or identity data.

To enable fictional demo users locally, set `DEMO_PASSWORD` to a private development-only value of at least ten characters. The password is not committed or embedded in the frontend. Run the API on port 8000 and the web application on port 3000.

### Frontend

```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. Protected console destinations include `/console/dashboard`, `/console/verify`, `/console/verifications`, `/console/cases`, `/console/investigation`, `/console/analytics`, `/console/audit`, `/console/reports`, and `/console/settings`.

### Backend

```bash
cd apps/api
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Check `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health`. Backend quality commands are `.venv/bin/pytest`, `.venv/bin/ruff check app tests migrations`, `.venv/bin/mypy app`, and `.venv/bin/alembic upgrade --sql head`.

## Scope boundaries

Phase 12 is the final planned implementation phase. Analytics count distinct persisted verification records, use the latest persisted risk assessment, derive failed counts from persisted verification lifecycle state, and apply risk, case, priority, document, and UTC date filters to one shared cohort. Repeated analysis returns the latest persisted result rather than creating duplicate risk records. The `/console/demo` route identifies the five fictional deterministic scenarios and links to the real workflow. Liveness detection, blockchain, government biometric/identity integration, production providers, automatic fraud classification, demographic or emotion inference, surveillance, hidden AI prioritization, automatic approval/rejection, and fabricated metrics remain deferred. Console dashboard metrics and records are fictional display data; upload, OCR, technical-analysis, face-verification, risk, case, analytics, and report success is never fabricated when prerequisites or configured providers are unavailable.
