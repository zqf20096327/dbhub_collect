This project is an advanced, multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for real-world applications. It's built to be flexible and scalable, enabling users to ask complex questions in natural language and receive answers synthesized from diverse databases: **SQLite, MongoDB, MeiliSearch, and Neo4j**.

The core architecture is a practical implementation inspired by the concepts presented in the research paper: **["A Collaborative Multi-Agent Approach to Retrieval-Augmented Generation Across Diverse Data."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05838)**

## 🏛️ Architecture Overview

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

- **`agents/`**: Contains the core logic for each agent (Router, Refiner, etc.).
  - `router.py`
  - `...`
- **`database/`**: Scripts for creating and populating the databases.
  - `populate_db.py`
- **`graph/`**: Defines the structure and flow of the agentic graph.
  - `builder.py`
- **`tools/`**: Contains tools for database-specific query generation.
  - `db_tools.py`
- **`ui/`**: The Streamlit user interface code.
  - `app_ui.py`
- **`.env.example`**: Example environment variables file.
- **`app.py`**: Main entry point for the command-line application.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Project dependencies.


The system leverages `LangGraph` to create a stateful, cyclical graph of agents that work collaboratively to answer queries.

1.  **Router Agent**: First, a router agent analyzes the user's question to determine the most appropriate database (or databases) to query.
2.  **Specialized Agents**: The query is then passed to one or more specialized agents, each an expert in generating queries for a specific database (SQL, Cypher, etc.).
3.  **Query Execution**: The generated query is executed against the corresponding database.
4.  **Answer Synthesis**: The results are synthesized into a coherent, human-readable answer.
5.  **Self-Correction Loop**: If a query fails or returns no results, a **Refiner Agent** attempts to rewrite the query and retry the process, creating a self-correcting loop.
6.  **Clarification Questions**: If the initial question is ambiguous, the system can ask the user for clarification before proceeding.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Multi-Database Support**: Simultaneously query relational, document, search, and graph databases.
* **Intelligent Routing**: Automatically selects the best data source for a given question.
* **Self-Correcting Agents**: Agents can refine and correct their own queries upon failure.
* **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit to visualize the process.
* **Modular Design**: Easily extendable to include new agents and data sources.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Orchestration**: LangChain & LangGraph
* **LLMs**: OpenAI
* **Databases**:
    * Relational: SQLite
    * Document: MongoDB
    * Search: MeiliSearch
    * Graph: Neo4j
* **UI**: Streamlit
* **Environment Management**: python-dotenv

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.9 or higher
* An OpenAI API Key | I recommend TogeterAPIs

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hamed-nhi/Multi-Agent-RAG.git
cd Multi-Agent-RAG
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, open the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

### 4. Populate Databases

Run the `populate_db.py` script to create and fill the databases with sample data.

```bash
python -m database.populate_db
```

### 5. Usage

You can interact with the system in two ways:

**A) Interactive Streamlit UI (Recommended)**

Launch the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run ui/app_ui.py
```

Open your browser to the local URL provided to start asking questions.

**B) Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

Run the main application script:

```bash
python app.py
```

You will be prompted to enter your questions in the terminal.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

The core architecture of this project is heavily inspired by the insightful work presented in the research paper "A Collaborative Multi-Agent Approach to Retrieval-Augmented Generation Across Diverse Data."

The **Refiner Agent**, which provides a self-correction loop for failed queries, is an original contribution to this project and was not part of the initial paper's design. This feature was added to enhance the system's robustness and error handling.
