<p align="center"><em>Your AI coding tools keep a tab. OpenTab opens it.</em></p>

<p align="center"><strong>See where your coding agents spent their tokens, time, and money.</strong></p>

OpenTab brings the history your tools already keep into one interactive browser.
Follow a busy month into a project, a session, its subagents, and individual turns.
See what filled the context window. Compare the same token usage at another model's prices.

Works with **Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Copilot, [and more](#the-tools-it-reads)**.
Runs locally, in your **terminal or web browser**. No account, no telemetry, and your
agents' history stays read-only.

## Try it on your own history

<a id="install"></a>

```sh
pipx install opentab-ai
opentab
```

OpenTab discovers supported tools' local records and brings them together automatically.
Start with a recent day, open **Sessions**, and pick one you remember. Press **Enter** to
drill in, **Esc** to step back, and **?** for the keys that work where you are. The mouse
works too.

On a subscription? You can still explore your usage: OpenTab starts with clearly labeled
API-equivalent estimates for tokens that have no recorded cost. **`$`** switches to
recorded spend. [How the money works](#about-the-money).

Python **3.9+** · macOS · Linux · WSL · native Windows.

<details>
<summary><strong>More ways to install and upgrade</strong></summary>

The PyPI package is **`opentab-ai`**; the command is **`opentab`**.

```sh
brew install hamidi-dev/tap/opentab         # Homebrew (macOS / Linux)
pip install --user opentab-ai               # pip
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamidi-dev/opentab/main/install.sh | bash
```

Upgrade with `pipx upgrade opentab-ai`, `brew upgrade opentab`, or
`pip install -U --user opentab-ai`.

The runtime uses Python's standard library, with `windows-curses` added automatically
on native Windows. [Windows & WSL setup](docs/windows.md).

</details>

<a id="usage"></a>

Prefer a browser? Run **`opentab web`**. Showing someone your screen? **`opentab --demo`**
anonymizes your existing history in memory. If a tool is missing, **`opentab doctor`**
explains what was found and what needs attention.

**`opentab --help`** is the quick guide. Add **`--help-all`** to any command for
every option, including source paths and compatibility flags.

Automating it? OpenTab also provides versioned JSON resource commands and a local
stdio MCP server: `opentab usage summary --range 30d` and `opentab mcp`. See
[Programmatic access](docs/programmatic.md) for commands, schemas, and privacy gates.

## Follow the work behind the numbers

<a id="what-you-get"></a>

### Follow an expensive session down to the turn

Pick a day on the spend heatmap. Open its sessions, sort by cost, and follow the largest
one. The **Subagents** view shows how the work's cost splits between the main agent and
its delegates, including nested subagents. You can see whether one delegate accounts for
most of the total or the cost is spread across the team.

Then open **Turns**: prompts, the steps that followed, and their token usage and cost in
order. On supported tools, inspect a turn's recorded narration, reasoning, and exact tool
calls and results right in the terminal.
Use **`[` / `]`** to move between turns. Tool results start as compact previews;
click a result or press **Enter** to expand the output marked `▸` (the section at
the top of the viewport, or the next below it). **`z`** expands the whole turn,
including full arguments and output.

The **Tools** view groups usage by tool and MCP server. Its treemap separates tools that
ran often from those associated with expensive calls, with exact figures underneath.
Attribution comes from the model turns that used each tool; calls in the same turn share
that turn's usage.

### Understand why token counts and costs tell different stories

A large token count is only the beginning. **Token economics** puts each token type's
share of the volume beside its share of the cost at API list rates: uncached input,
output, reasoning, cache reads, and cache writes.

See how much of your usage is cached, and which token types account for the money.
Drill into a model within a month or project, or in Trends over the active date range,
to see its own economics and the sessions that used it, ranked by that model's contribution.

### See what filled the context window

The **Context** view follows the window as it grows, marks compactions, and estimates
what went into it: tool results, call arguments, assistant text, prompts, and more.
See when the context shrank and what it grew back to.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/context-tab.png" alt="Context growth over 684 turns, with two compactions and an estimated breakdown led by tool results" width="900">
  <br><sub><b>Two compactions, and the context fills again.</b> The curve shows when; the breakdown shows what was sent. Anonymized demo data.</sub>
</p>

Session lists also show **Worked** time where the records support it: the agent's
working bursts, with idle waits for your next prompt removed.

### Put another model's prices against your actual usage

Press **`w`**, choose a model, and open a session. Compare the list-price cost of the
models it used with the cost of those same tokens at your chosen model's rates. Sessions
with subagents also show the target price beside each agent's usage.

Explore models you've used or the full bundled catalog. **`P`** compares model and
provider rates using **your token mix**, including cache usage, and lets you pin a
shortlist. Both sides of a session comparison use list rates; it holds token usage fixed
and makes no prediction about another model's output quality or how many tokens it would use.

Detail views depend on what each tool records. [Compare support below](#the-tools-it-reads).

## Built to be poked at

Move between daily, weekly, and monthly trends, a calendar heatmap, and rankings of
models, providers, projects, and coding tools. Follow a chart or a ranking into the
sessions behind it. Filter as you type, change the date range, and keep exploring.

- **Find your way back.** Bookmark sessions, add searchable notes, and reopen supported
  sessions in their original coding tool with **`L`**. Launch through tmux, Herdr, or a
  custom launcher, or copy a ready-to-run resume command.
- **Make it yours.** Keyboard and mouse navigation, 30 bundled themes, and remappable
  keys. Your sort, selected tool, theme, bookmarks, and pricing view are remembered; the
  date range is not, so every launch starts on the default window.
- **Take a view with you.** Press **`e`** to export the current list to CSV, including
  the filters and scope you've chosen.

## Search past conversations

Find what you discussed across local **OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, pi and
omp** sessions.
Search matches recorded user/assistant text, not just session titles, and returns
excerpts with message anchors so you or your agent can read the surrounding context.
This is keyword search, not semantic memory. Press **`Ctrl-F`** in the TUI, or use
the CLI or MCP.
Tool outputs, reasoning, and attachments are not indexed.

**Enable it explicitly after installing or upgrading.** Building the index stores
sensitive conversation text in plaintext on your machine; it makes no provider calls
and leaves the original records untouched.

```sh
opentab conversations index --allow-raw-content
opentab conversations search "sqlite locking" --allow-raw-content
opentab conversations status
```

Add `--project /path/to/project` to index and search only that project. Saved session
and project ignores apply by default. **Rerun the index command when you want to
include new or changed conversations.** Startup, search, and reload never refresh it
automatically; stale source evidence is withheld until refreshed.

For agent access, add the optional `--allow-raw-content` flag to your MCP server's
arguments: `"args": ["mcp", "--allow-raw-content"]`. Without it, ordinary usage queries
work, but conversation reads, search, and indexing are disabled. Restart the MCP
server after changing its configuration.

**You can also ask your agent to build or refresh the index.** It uses
`opentab_index_conversations` with `confirm_index: true` after your explicit request;
search and conversation reads require `confirm_raw: true`. Enabling raw access alone
does not build or refresh anything. Retrieved text can enter the agent's model context.
[Search setup, limits, and clearing the index](docs/conversation-search.md) ·
[MCP configuration](docs/programmatic.md#mcp-server)

## In your terminal. In your browser. In one file.

```sh
opentab web                        # open the live browser on localhost
opentab --html report.html          # write a self-contained report
opentab --demo --html demo.html    # anonymize it for sharing
```

The web browser shares the TUI's navigation, themes, trends, and model comparisons.
The live version fetches Turns, Tools, and Context on demand where supported. The HTML
export packages the overview and comparison views into **one file you can open offline**,
with no server or dependencies. Links to months, days, and sessions let someone open the
part you want to show them.

  <br><sub><b>Keep exploring in the browser.</b> The same history, with familiar keys and clickable tables.</sub>
</p>

Turn traces and personal notes are absent from web reports; the TUI and gated
[CLI/MCP API](docs/programmatic.md#raw-content) provide separate access. The static
HTML report omits the live Turns, Tools, and Context tabs.
[Web browser & exports](docs/web.md).

## Every machine, one tab

Your laptop, workstation, and remote box can all contribute to the same view.
**`opentab pull`** gathers their usage summaries over SSH and opens them together with
this machine's history. Filter any view by machine, compare projects across boxes, or
reopen a supported session on the machine where it ran.

```sh
opentab pull laptop workstation gpu-box
opentab pull                              # refresh your saved machines next time
opentab remote                            # browse the last pull without reconnecting
```

Each remote needs `opentab` on its `PATH`. **No background agent or listening service**
is needed for SSH pulls. Summaries contain no raw traces. Opening a supported remote
turn in the TUI explicitly fetches just that turn over SSH; `Esc` cancels, and closing
and reopening retries a failed read. Ordinary browsing stays offline. Remote traces
need a managed cached summary, saved SSH connection and compatible remote OpenTab CLI.

[SSH setup, portable exports, and managing machines](docs/machines.md).

## Live prices in your sidebar

Keep an eye on a session while it runs. [**herdr-opentab**](https://github.com/hamidi-dev/herdr-opentab)
puts each running agent's cost beside it in the [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) sidebar,
subagents included.

For your own status bar or script, **`opentab cost "$PWD"`** prints the latest session's
cost for that project. **`opentab --goto "$PWD"`** opens that session for inspection.

such as Copilot CLI's opt-in telemetry export; `opentab doctor` helps you find the gaps.

## About the money

**Recorded spend** comes from your tools' own records. A subscription session can record
millions of tokens and `$0.00` of per-token cost; your subscription is billed elsewhere.

**API-equivalent estimates** add list-price costs for that unpriced usage. This view is
on by default and your choice is remembered; **`$`** toggles it. Model rates ship in a
bundled models.dev catalog, so ordinary browsing works offline. Refresh them when you
choose with **`r`** in the **`P`** price table or `opentab --refresh-models`.

Estimates help you compare usage. Your provider's invoice may include subscriptions,
discounts, credits, or markups that local records cannot tell OpenTab about.
[Pricing explained](docs/pricing.md).

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Does any of this leave my machine?</strong></summary>

Local browsing needs no cloud service or account and sends no telemetry. Your agents'
files are opened read-only; OpenTab writes its own preferences, notes, caches, and the
exports you request.

You control transfers: remote pulls fetch summaries from machines you choose, a price
refresh fetches the models.dev catalog, and exports go wherever you put them. The live
web browser binds to localhost by default. [Privacy details](docs/privacy.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I show it without exposing my project names and prompts?</strong></summary>

Use `opentab --demo`, or **`D`** in-app, to anonymize titles, paths, prompt text, and
absolute spend/token numbers in memory. The shape of the data stays real. Demo mode
never writes those changes back to your history or saves your browsing state.

`opentab --demo --html demo.html` creates an anonymized report. You can also choose
which categories to scramble; [demo mode details](docs/privacy.md#demo-mode).

</details>

<a id="keep-your-history"></a>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I keep a longer history?</strong></summary>

Claude Code deletes local transcripts after **30 days** by default, and Gemini CLI's
default retention removes chat recordings older than **30 days** on launch. Once the
source record disappears, its usage disappears from OpenTab too. OpenTab warns about
these settings; `opentab doctor` reports them.

For long history:

- Claude Code: add `"cleanupPeriodDays": 3650` to `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/settings.json`
  (default `~/.claude/settings.json`).
- Gemini CLI: set `"general": {"sessionRetention": {"enabled": false}}` in
  `~/.gemini/settings.json`, merging it with any existing `general` settings.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>My tool isn't supported. Can I still use OpenTab?</strong></summary>

If it can log API requests, point OpenTab at a CSV or JSONL of them. Turns, Tools, and
Context become available when the log carries the relevant optional fields.
[Request log schema](docs/sources.md#schema).

For another native integration, open an issue describing the tool and its record format.

</details>

## Something looks off?

Run **`opentab doctor`**. It reports which tools it found, why others are missing, and
what to fix, along with terminal support and the price catalog. It diagnoses without
repairing or reading transcript content.
