**Final Year Project · BSCS · Hamza Shahzad**

*SmartCity is an AI-powered urban issue reporting platform that helps citizens submit reports with photos and GPS, while city teams manage, classify, and resolve them through a unified dashboard.*

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hamza01055/smartcity-ai.git
cd smartcity-ai
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

Open the app once the containers are running:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:3333
- ML docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

For full setup steps, environment variables, and troubleshooting, see [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md).

## Overview

SmartCity replaces the slow, manual complaint workflow found in most municipal systems. A citizen photographs a pothole, a broken traffic light, or an overflowing garbage bin — the system detects and categorizes the issue with computer vision and routes it to the appropriate city department within seconds.

### The Problem

Traditional municipal complaint systems are slow: a citizen files a complaint, someone reads it, someone categorizes it, and someone routes it. Each hand-off adds delay and opportunity for error.

### The Solution

SmartCity automates the detection and categorization step, so every report is classified the moment it is submitted:

1. **Report** — a citizen uploads a photo with GPS location
2. **Classify** — YOLOv8 instantly identifies and categorizes the issue
3. **Dispatch** — an administrator sees it on a live map dashboard and assigns a worker
4. **Resolve** — the field worker completes the task and updates the status in real time

## Architecture

```
  Citizen / Field Worker
    (React + Tailwind)
          │
          │  POST /api/report  (photo + GPS)
          ▼
  ┌─────────────────────┐
  │  Backend            │──── PostgreSQL + PostGIS  (reports, geo-queries)
  │  (Node.js/Express)  │──── Redis + BullMQ        (inference job queue)
  └─────────────────────┘
          │  enqueue job
          ▼
  ┌─────────────────────┐
  │  ML Worker          │
  │  (Node.js/BullMQ)   │
  └─────────────────────┘
          │  POST /predict
          ▼
  ┌─────────────────────┐
  │  ML Service         │──── category + confidence + bounding box
  │  (FastAPI/YOLOv8)   │
  └─────────────────────┘
          │
          ▼
  Report Updated → Admin Dashboard
  (Live map · Analytics · Dispatch)
```

**Flow:** the backend accepts a report and enqueues an inference job in Redis. The worker consumes the job, calls the ML service's `/predict` endpoint, and writes the classification (category, confidence, bounding box) back to PostgreSQL. The admin dashboard reads the updated report and displays it on the live map.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| **Frontend** | React 18, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v3 |
| **UI Style** | Dark cyberpunk / glassmorphism with custom Tailwind color tokens |
| **Maps** | React-Leaflet, OpenStreetMap tiles, CircleMarker heat overlays |
| **Forms** | Formik + Yup validation |
| **Backend** | Node.js 20, Express 4, Multer (file uploads) |
| **Queue** | Redis + BullMQ (producer in backend, consumer in worker) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 15 + PostGIS extension |
| **ML Service** | Python 3.11, FastAPI, Ultralytics YOLOv8 |
| **Model** | YOLOv8m, custom-trained on 3 urban classes |
| **Deployment** | Docker Compose (6 containers) |

---

## Machine Learning Model

The detection model is a **YOLOv8m** network trained on a custom dataset of roughly 1,500 labeled images across three urban issue classes:

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Pothole` | Damaged road surfaces |
| `Traffic_Light` | Traffic signal infrastructure |
| `Waste_Container` | Garbage bins and waste accumulation |

**Training:** 100 epochs on a Google Colab T4 GPU.

### Validation Results

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| mAP@50 | **0.73** |
| mAP@50–95 | 0.41 |
| Precision | **0.82** |
| Recall | 0.70 |

> To retrain the model or add new classes, use `notebooks/yolov8_training.ipynb`, replace `best.pt` in `ml_service/weights/`, and restart the ML container.

- http://localhost:8000/docs — ML service docs

### Manual setup

If you prefer to run the services locally, follow the detailed steps in [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md).

### Environment configuration

```env
DB_HOST=postgres
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=smartcity
DB_PASSWORD=smartcity
DB_DATABASE=smartcity

REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PORT=6379

ML_SERVICE_URL=http://ml_service:8000
USE_REAL_MODEL=true
MODEL_PATH=/app/weights/best.pt

VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3333
```

> ⚠️ Never commit your `.env` file. Use `.env.example` as a template.
