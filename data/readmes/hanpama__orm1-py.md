# orm1

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/hanpama/orm1-py/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/hanpama/orm1-py)

orm1 is a minimal asynchronous Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python that makes it easy to map your Python classes to PostgreSQL database tables. Built on top of [asyncpg](https://github.com/MagicStack/asyncpg), orm1 provides a minimal yet powerful API for CRUD operations, complex query building, and relationship management – all with full async support.

---

## Features

- **Asynchronous by Design**  
  Leverage Python’s `async`/`await` syntax with an asyncpg backend for high-performance, non-blocking database operations.

- **Auto-mapping with Type Hints**  
  Automatically generate entity mappings from your class type hints. orm1 infers column names (using snake_case conversion) and even detects relationships (both singular and plural) based on your annotations—greatly reducing boilerplate.

- **Aggregate Support (Parent-Child Relationship)**  
  Define aggregates naturally by specifying child entities that are part of an aggregate. For instance, a `Post` aggregate can include multiple `PostAttachment` instances.

- **Fluent Query Builder**  
  Construct complex SQL queries using a Pythonic API. orm1 supports filtering, joins, ordering, and pagination, all while keeping your code readable.

- **Raw SQL Queries with Safe Parameter Binding**  
  Execute raw SQL queries while benefitting from an internal SQL Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that safely binds parameters, protecting against SQL injection.

- **Flexible Transaction Management**  
  Start and commit transactions with ease, using the session’s transaction context manager `tx`. Nested transactions are implemented using savepoints.

- **Composite Key Support**  
  orm1 supports both single and composite keys for primary and parental keys. When multiple fields are specified, orm1 automatically combines them into a tuple key for consistent entity identification.

## Installation

Install orm1 from PyPI with pip:

```bash
pip install orm1
```

---

## Getting Started

### Defining Your Entities

Define your entity classes with type hints to describe fields and relationships. Use the `auto.mapped` decorator from the AutoMappingBuilder to register your classes with orm1. Column names are automatically generated (using snake_case conversion) unless overridden in the configuration.

Below is an example using a `Post` aggregate with its child `PostAttachment`:

```python
from orm1 import auto

@auto.mapped()
class Post:
    id: int
    title: str
    content: str
    # Define the aggregate relationship: a post has many attachments.
    attachments: list["PostAttachment"]

@auto.mapped(
    parental_key="post_id",  # Indicates this entity belongs to a Post aggregate.
)
class PostAttachment:
    id: int
    post_id: int
    file_name: str
    url: str
```

The mappings above assume that you have a PostgreSQL database with tables `post` and `post_attachment`. The `post_attachment` table has a foreign key `post_id` that references the `id` column of the `post` table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE post (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE post_attachment (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    post_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES post(id),
    file_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    url TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

### Composite Key Example

orm1 also supports composite keys. Simply provide a list of field names for `primary_key` (or `parental_key`) in your mapping configuration:

```python
@auto.mapped(
    table="user_roles",
    primary_key=["user_id", "role_id"]
)
class UserRole:
    user_id: int
    role_id: int
    # additional fields...
```

In this case, orm1 will combine `user_id` and `role_id` into a tuple key for entity identification.

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_roles (
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    role_id INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, role_id)
);
```

### Building Mappings

After decorating your entity classes, build the mappings. This process collects the configuration and type hints to create the internal mapping definitions used by orm1.

```python
from orm1 import auto

mappings = auto.build()
```

### Creating a Session

Create a session to interact with your database. The session uses a backend (such as `AsyncPGSessionBackend`) for executing SQL statements.

```python
import asyncpg
from orm1 import Session, AsyncPGSessionBackend

async def main():
    # Create an asyncpg connection pool.
    pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(dsn="postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname")
    
    # Initialize the backend and session.
    backend = AsyncPGSessionBackend(pool)
    session = Session(backend, mappings)
    
    # Now you can perform CRUD operations with your session.
```

---

## CRUD Operations

### Inserting and Saving Entities

To insert a new entity or update an existing one, simply call `save` on your session. orm1 will determine whether to insert or update based on whether the entity is already tracked.

```python
# Create a new post with an attachment.
post = Post()
post.title = "Introducing orm1"
post.content = "orm1 is a lightweight asynchronous ORM for Python."

attachment = PostAttachment()
attachment.file_name = "diagram.png"
attachment.url = "http://example.com/diagram.png"

post.attachments = [attachment]

# Save the post (and cascade save the attachment as part of the aggregate).
await session.save(post)
```

### Querying Entities

Use the query builder to fetch entities with filtering, joins, and ordering.

```python
# Query for a post by title.
query = session.query(Post, alias="p")
query = query.where('p."title" = :title', title="Introducing orm1")
posts = await query.fetch()

# Get a single post.
post = await query.fetch_one()
```

### Updating Entities

Modify the attributes of an entity and call `save` again. orm1 will automatically update the corresponding database record.

```python
# Update the post's title.
post.title = "Introducing orm1 - A Lightweight Async ORM"
post.attachments[0].file_name = "diagram_v2.png"
post.attachments.append(
    PostAttachment(file_name="code.py", url="http://example.com/code.py")
)

await session.save(post)
```

Any changes to the entity’s children (e.g., `attachments`) will be cascaded and saved as part of the aggregate.

### Deleting Entities

Remove an entity by calling `delete` on the session. Deleting an aggregate root will cascade and remove its child entities as needed.

```python
await session.delete(post)
```

---

## Transactions

Use the session’s transaction context manager `tx` to start and commit transactions.

```python
async with session.tx():
    post = await session.get(Post, 1)
    post.title = "Transaction Test"
    await session.save(post)
```

---

## Advanced Querying

### Joining Related Entities

Join related tables by using the `join` or `left_join` methods on a query. This is useful when you need to filter or retrieve data based on relationships.

```python
# Join post attachments with their parent posts.
query = session.query(PostAttachment, "a")
query = query.join(Post, "p", 'a.post_id = p.id')
query = query.where('p.title = :title', title="Introducing orm1")
attachments = await query.fetch()
```

### Ordering and Pagination

Sort your query results and paginate them easily.

```python
# Ordering: specify ascending or descending order.
query = session.query(PostAttachment, "a")
query = query.order_by(query.asc('a.file_name'))
attachments = await query.fetch(limit=10, offset=0)

# Pagination: use paginate to get page information.
page = await query.paginate(first=10)
print("Attachment cursors on current page:", page.cursors)
print("Has next page?", page.has_next_page)
```

### Executing Raw SQL Queries

If you need more control, execute raw SQL statements while still benefiting from safe parameter binding.

```python
raw_query = session.raw("SELECT * FROM post_attachments WHERE file_name LIKE :pattern", pattern="%diagram%")
results = await raw_query.fetch()
```

## Auto-mapping and Relationship Detection

orm1’s auto-mapping leverages Python’s type hints to automatically generate entity mappings:
- **Field Mapping**: Fields without explicit configuration are automatically mapped to columns using a snake_case conversion.
- **Relationship Detection**: 
  - If an attribute is annotated as a list of another mapped entity, orm1 interprets it as a one-to-many relationship.
  - If an attribute is annotated as an optional entity (e.g., `Optional[Entity]`), it’s treated as a singular relationship.
  
This auto-detection reduces manual configuration and simplifies managing aggregate entities and their children.
