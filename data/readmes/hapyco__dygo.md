dygo is a source-available Go framework for building serious business software.

It gives business apps a conventional platform foundation: metadata-driven PostgreSQL schema, encrypted configuration, session auth, permissions, generic Record APIs, Record hooks, durable Jobs, recurring Schedules, and a first-party Studio UI.

## Status

dygo is in early framework development. The repository contains the framework module, CLI, project generator, metadata validators, PostgreSQL schema sync, Core metadata registry, session auth, generic Record APIs, Record permission enforcement, compiled Record hooks, durable Jobs, recurring Schedules, and worker runtime.

Framework APIs and file formats may still change before the first stable release.

## Quick Start

Install dygo:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://dygo.dev/install | sh
```

Create and run a project:

```sh
dygo new my-system
cd my-system
dygo db prepare
dygo setup
dygo dev
```

`dygo dev` starts the local server on `http://localhost:6790/`. In this source checkout it also starts the Studio Vite server and proxies Studio through the same dygo origin.

## What You Build With

- Apps live under `apps/<app>` and describe business modules.
- Entities define metadata-backed Records, fields, indexes, constraints, permissions, hooks, fixtures, and route slugs.
- `dygo db migrate` applies App lifecycle changes, patches, metadata, access, and Fixtures atomically, then refreshes `db/schema.sql`.
- `dygo db prepare` creates the database when needed, then runs the same migration lifecycle.
- Studio renders global app surfaces from metadata.
- Jobs run durable background work through PostgreSQL-backed Job Executions.
- Schedules create Job Executions from app-owned cron metadata.

## Common Commands

```sh
dygo generate app crm
dygo generate entity crm/contact
dygo generate job crm/send-welcome-email

dygo app validate
dygo app install https://github.com/acme/dygo-crm.git
dygo entity validate
dygo doctor

dygo db migrate
dygo dev
dygo serve
dygo worker
```

See [CLI](docs/cli.md) for the full command surface.

## Documentation

See the [Documentation Index](docs/index.md) for the full reference.

## Repository Development

Requirements:

- Go 1.26.2+
- PostgreSQL for database-backed commands and runtime tests
- Node.js only when working on Studio UI assets

Useful focused checks:

```sh
go test ./cmd/dygo ./pkg/... ./internal/... ./schemas
go vet ./...
```
