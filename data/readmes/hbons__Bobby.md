*View SQLite databases*

<img src="data/screenshots/screenshot-readme.png">

Bobby lets you open `SQLite` database files (`.db`, `.sqlite`) and browse the tables inside. Handy for app development or inspecting downloaded databases.

* Scroll and search tables and views of any size
* Copy rows or cells to the clipboard
* Made with care by a human

Have fun, and don't forget to sanitize your database inputs! :)

> Hello! Hylke here. I was recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/13/microsoft-layoffs" target="_blank">laid off</a>. I'd love to work full-time creating **apps for Linux** and contributing **design for FOSS projects**. I hope to gather enough [monthly sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hbons) for a minimum wage. Every little helps. Thank you.
