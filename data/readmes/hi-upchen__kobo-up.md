## 📖 FAQ

### Why doesn't Kobo's official export work with my sideloaded books?
Kobo's built-in export only works with books purchased from their store. Sideloaded content (PDFs, EPUBs you added manually) is ignored. Kobo Note Up solves this by reading directly from your Kobo's database.

### Is it safe to use? Will it damage my Kobo?
Absolutely safe! We only READ your database, never write to it. Your Kobo device remains untouched. All processing happens in your browser.

### How do I use this with Firefox or Safari?
Firefox and Safari are fully supported! When prompted, select the `.kobo` folder inside your Kobo device (press ⌘+Shift+. on Mac or Ctrl+H on Windows to show hidden folders). Chrome and Edge can select the root folder directly.

### Can I export highlights from specific books only?
Yes! You can browse your library and export individual books or export your entire library at once.

### What formats can I export to?
Currently Markdown (.md) and plain text (.txt). Markdown works great with note-taking apps like Obsidian and Notion.

### Do you store my highlights or personal data?
No! Everything happens locally in your browser. We cannot see your highlights, books, or any personal information. Your privacy is guaranteed.
