# DuckDB MSSQL Extension

A DuckDB extension for connecting to Microsoft SQL Server databases using native TDS protocol - no ODBC, JDBC, or external drivers required.

## Documentation

**Full documentation lives at [hugr-lab.github.io/mssql-extension](https://hugr-lab.github.io/mssql-extension/)** —
connections and authentication (SQL, Azure AD / Entra ID, Kerberos, Windows SSPI),
catalog integration, query pushdown, bulk loading over BCP, DML, transactions,
the complete settings reference, and performance tuning.

## Features

- Native TDS protocol implementation (no external dependencies)
- Stream query results directly into DuckDB without buffering
- Full DuckDB catalog integration with three-part naming and lazy metadata loading
- **Filter pushdown**: `WHERE` clauses are translated to T-SQL and evaluated by SQL Server, including mapped functions (`year`, `lower`, `LIKE` patterns, arithmetic). Anything the translator declines is applied locally instead — with the string-comparison caveat below
- Row-count estimates reported to the DuckDB optimizer, so join order around an MSSQL scan is planned rather than guessed
- Row identity (`rowid`) for tables with a primary key or a usable unique index, which is what `UPDATE`/`DELETE` target rows by
- Connection pooling with configurable limits and automatic session reset
- TLS with the server certificate verified by default; `Encrypt`, `TrustServerCertificate` and `HostNameInCertificate` mean what they mean in the Microsoft drivers
- Full DML support: INSERT (with RETURNING), UPDATE, DELETE — every statement atomic; an INSERT above 1000 rows loads through the BCP protocol
- CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) with streaming and type mapping
- High-performance COPY TO via TDS BulkLoadBCP protocol
- Transaction support: BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK with connection pinning
- Multi-statement SQL batches via `mssql_scan()` (e.g., temp table workflows)
- DuckDB secret management for secure credential storage
- [Azure AD authentication](AZURE.md) (service principal, CLI, interactive device code flow)
- [Kerberos / Windows SSPI integrated authentication](Kerberos.md) — POSIX (`kinit` / keytab / raw credentials) and Windows (current logon session via `secur32.dll`)
- Custom `Application Name` propagated to SQL Server `APP_NAME()` / `sys.dm_exec_sessions.program_name`
- ATTACH-time credential validation (opt-out via `lazy_validation true`)
- **Experimental**: ORDER BY pushdown to SQL Server (opt-in via `mssql_order_pushdown` setting)

> **A note on string comparisons.** A pushed predicate is evaluated by SQL
> Server, so it follows the **column's collation**, not DuckDB's byte
> comparison: on a case-insensitive collation `WHERE name = 'abc'` matches
> `'ABC'` — the same answer SSMS gives. This applies to `UPDATE` and `DELETE`
> too, where it changes which rows are *modified*. It also means a predicate
> that pushes and the same predicate evaluated locally can disagree on a
> case-insensitive column ([#272](https://github.com/hugr-lab/mssql-extension/issues/272)).
> See [String comparisons and collation](https://hugr-lab.github.io/docs/writing/dml/#collation).


## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- DuckDB v1.4.1 or later (minimum supported version)
- SQL Server 2019 or later accessible on network

### Step 1: Install Extension

```sql
INSTALL mssql FROM community;
LOAD mssql;
```

### Step 2: Connect to SQL Server

#### Option A: Using a Secret (Recommended)

```sql
CREATE SECRET my_sqlserver (
    TYPE mssql,
    host 'localhost',
    port 1433,
    database 'master',
    user 'sa',
    password 'YourPassword123'
);

ATTACH '' AS sqlserver (TYPE mssql, SECRET my_sqlserver);
```

#### Option B: Using Connection String

```sql
ATTACH 'Server=localhost,1433;Database=master;User Id=sa;Password=YourPassword123'
    AS sqlserver (TYPE mssql);
```

### Step 3: Query Data

```sql
-- List schemas
SELECT schema_name FROM duckdb_schemas() WHERE database_name = 'sqlserver';

-- List tables in dbo schema
SELECT table_name FROM duckdb_tables() WHERE database_name = 'sqlserver' AND schema_name = 'dbo';

-- Query a table
FROM sqlserver.dbo.my_table LIMIT 10;
```

### Step 4: Disconnect

```sql
DETACH sqlserver;
DROP SECRET my_sqlserver;
```
