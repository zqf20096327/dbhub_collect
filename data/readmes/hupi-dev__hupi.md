# HUPI

HUPI is a **memory gateway**: a small, self-hosted service that sits between
your existing AI client and whichever LLM vendor you use. It speaks the
OpenAI Chat Completions API on both sides, so any existing client works
unmodified — point its `base_url` at HUPI instead of OpenAI/Anthropic/etc.
Underneath, every turn is enriched with relevant memory before being
forwarded to the real AI, and durably recorded afterward for future turns to
draw on — encrypted, multi-tenant, provider-independent, and auditable.

Three properties it's built around:

1. **Provider-independence** — switch from GPT to Claude to a locally hosted
   model without migrating or re-indexing your memory.
2. **Integrity over convenience** — every "memory" is independently
   fact-checked against its source before being trusted, rather than
   confidently made up.
3. **Auditability** — every retrieval decision is recorded and later
   inspectable: what exactly was remembered, and from where.

See [docs/BUSINESS_PROCESS.md](docs/BUSINESS_PROCESS.md) for the full
non-technical explanation, or [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the
design.

## Licensing: what's free, what isn't

Tier 1 (Personal) and Tier 2 (Professional Single) — everything in this
repo — are free and MIT-licensed, permanently. That's the single-user
gateway, retrieval, consolidation, encryption, the admin UI and CLI
tooling, all of it.

Tier 3 (Professional Shared — teams, shared workspaces, and real
multi-user authentication, either API keys or OpenID Connect against an
external identity provider — see [docs/OIDC.md](docs/OIDC.md)) is a
separate, commercially-licensed
extension, developed in a private repo
([hupi-t3](https://github.com/hupi-dev/hupi-t3)) and not included
here. This repo compiles and runs completely standalone without it —
Tier 1/2 has no dependency on hupi-t3 at all, not even at build time.
The two connect only through a handful of nil-by-default extension
points (e.g. `gateway.MountTeamRoutes`, `auth.NewTeamAuthenticator` —
see [ARCHITECTURE.md § Licensing and the open-core split](ARCHITECTURE.md)
for the full mechanism); with hupi-t3 absent, those stay nil and every Tier-3
code path — the `/v1/team/...` routes, `HUPI_REQUIRE_AUTH`, team CLI
subcommands — is simply not present in the binary, not just disabled.

If you need Tier 3, contact the repository owner for a commercial
license.

## Repository layout

```
cmd/                  Go binaries — the gateway, cron jobs, and CLIs
  hupi/                 the gateway server itself (long-lived, serves the HTTP API)
  hupi-demo/             the public hosted anonymous demo — its own long-lived server, own listen address, capped guest sessions
  hupi-demo-sweep/       delete expired demo guest sessions (cron)
  hupi-admin-ui/         operator admin console — JSON API (Go) + React frontend
    web/                   the React admin console source (Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind)
  hupi-consolidate/      nightly consolidation + rollups (cron)
  hupi-selfcheck/        retrieval regression checks (cron)
  hupi-admin/            CLI: provision users/teams/API keys/operators
  hupi-audit/            CLI: query the audit log
  hupi-export/           CLI: write a portable, encrypted memory snapshot
  hupi-import/           CLI: load a snapshot back in
  hupi-rotate-key/       CLI: online, resumable per-scope key rotation
  hupi-reembed/          CLI: online, resumable per-scope re-embedding after an embedding model change
  hupi-trace/            CLI: inspect one episode's retrieval trace
  hupi-correct/          CLI: write a corrected, superseding summary
  hupi-bench/            CLI: LoCoMo/LongMemEval benchmark harness — see bench/ and docs/BENCHMARKS.md
  hupi-ingest-turns/     CLI: EvalMem adapter — replay a flat turn list into a fresh scope + consolidate
  hupi-export-memory/    CLI: EvalMem adapter — dump a scope's entire decrypted memory for diagnostics
  hupi-answer-question/  CLI: EvalMem adapter — answer one question, native or oracle mode
internal/             Go packages implementing the gateway, storage, crypto, etc.
schema/               numbered Postgres migrations, applied in order
bench/                LoCoMo/LongMemEval data-fetch scripts, each benchmark's own unmodified scoring code, the EvalMem adapter, and archived run results — see docs/BENCHMARKS.md
deploy/k8s/           plain Kubernetes manifests
deploy/helm/hupi/     the same, as a Helm chart
site/                 marketing/landing website (Astro + Tailwind) — see site/README.md
vscode-extension/     VS Code extension: chat sidebar + inline edit, backed by HUPI
docs/                 design docs, install guide, API reference, code guide
install.sh            interactive/scriptable bare-metal installer
Dockerfile            one image containing every Go binary above
docker-compose.yml    quick-start deployment — bundles Postgres, unlike the other paths
deploy/compose/       docker-compose's migrate service entrypoint script
```

**Marketing website code**: [site/](site/) — an independent Astro +
Tailwind static site, not part of the Go build. See
[site/README.md](site/README.md) for how to run, build, and deploy it.

**Admin UI code**: [cmd/hupi-admin-ui/](cmd/hupi-admin-ui/) — the Go JSON
API backend, with its React frontend in
[cmd/hupi-admin-ui/web/](cmd/hupi-admin-ui/web/). The frontend is built
separately (`npm run build`) and embedded into the Go binary via
`go:embed`; see [docs/ADMIN_UI.md](docs/ADMIN_UI.md) for the full picture.

**VS Code extension code**: [vscode-extension/](vscode-extension/) — a
plain VS Code extension (not a fork of VS Code), using the official
`openai` npm SDK pointed at a HUPI gateway instead of a vendor directly.
See [vscode-extension/README.md](vscode-extension/README.md) for setup and
how to run it locally.

## Getting started

```bash
./install.sh          # interactive: sets up Postgres, schema, keys, binaries
```

Or, with Docker Compose (bundles Postgres for you — the fastest way to
get a real instance running):

```bash
cp .env.example .env                       # fill in the three required secrets
cp providers.yaml.example providers.yaml   # pick/configure your LLM provider(s)
docker compose up -d --build
```

See [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for the full manual walkthrough
(bare-metal), the Docker Compose details, or containerized deployment on
Kubernetes/Helm.
