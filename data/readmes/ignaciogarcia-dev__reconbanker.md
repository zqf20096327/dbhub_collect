ReconBanker is a self-hosted reconciliation engine that scrapes bank transactions using browser automation, polls pending orders from customer ERP systems, and matches them using a deterministic + heuristic engine. When a match is found, it notifies the customer system via configurable webhooks.

## What it does

- **Scrapes bank transactions** from customer bank accounts using Playwright browser automation (Mi Dinero, Banco Pichincha Empresas, and more)
- **Polls pending orders** from customer ERP or order-management systems via HTTP
- **Reconciles transactions to orders** using a rule-based engine (exact amount + date window) and a fuzzy sender-name heuristic
- **Notifies customers** via webhook when a match is found, including match type and transaction detail
- Operates in a **multi-account, multi-bank** model - each account has its own config, scrape schedule, and webhook

## Feature surface

### Reconciliation engine

- Exact amount matching (configurable currency support)
- 5-day date window rule
- Fuzzy sender-name heuristic scoring (0–1)
- Ambiguity detection when multiple candidates score equally
- Per-request attempt history with unmatched reasons

### Account management

- Register accounts linked to supported banks
- Per-account configuration: polling endpoint, webhook URL, authentication headers
- Manual or scheduled scraping and polling triggers
- Script versioning: promote bank scripts from `review` → `active`

### Bank session management

- **One-shot scrapes** (open → scrape → close, run periodically) or long-lived **persistent sessions** (a browser monitor kept open per account), selectable per account via `session_type`
- **Login mode** per account (`login_mode`): `simple` logs in unattended, `assisted` waits for a human to complete 2FA
- **Needs attention**: an assisted persistent session that cannot keep itself authenticated (auth timeout, lost session, watchdog, crash) is parked in `needs_attention`, surfacing a badge in the UI and an alert, until an operator reactivates it
- **Failure diagnostics**: every execution records its stages, failure category and stop reason, with the pre-failure event trail written to the logs — searchable via `pnpm failures` (see [architecture](docs/architecture.md#failure-diagnostics))

### Async job processing

- Six BullMQ queues: `order-ingestion`, `bank-scrape`, `conciliation`, `tx-conciliation`, `webhook`, `bank-movement-webhook`
- Domain event bus: `TransactionIngested` → conciliation and movement notification, `ConciliationMatched` → webhook
- Configurable polling, scraping, and stale-request expiry intervals via env vars

### Frontend dashboard

- Login / register
- Account list with a "needs attention" badge for accounts blocked by a fatal failure
- Per-account config, including session settings (`session_type` / `login_mode`) and a restart action to unblock a fatally failed account
- Conciliation requests with status, attempt history, and matched transaction detail
- Bank movement passthrough mode
- Bank and script management
- Feature-scoped i18n support (i18next)

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd reconbanker

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values

./setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` pulls the latest git changes, installs all dependencies, starts Docker (PostgreSQL + Redis), runs migrations, and launches both backend and frontend.

- Backend API: `http://localhost:3000/api`
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`

See [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md) for manual setup and environment variable reference.
