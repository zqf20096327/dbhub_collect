`air_orchestrator` is the central backend service of the AiR platform. It provides HTTP/gRPC APIs, manages users, conversations, AI models and integrations, and coordinates communication channels and supporting microservices.

## Features

- authentication, sessions, JWT, TOTP and access recovery;
- user, AI model, provider and conversation management;
- Telegram, WhatsApp, Avito and operator service integrations;
- Google OAuth, Calendar, Sheets and CRM integrations;
- MCP server with tools for AI models;
- realtime communication through WebSocket;
- internal gRPC API and voice-call proxy;
- MinIO/S3 file storage and Redis caching;
- Swagger/OpenAPI, Prometheus metrics and `pprof` profiling.

## User Data Protection

Each user receives an individual `MasterKey`. It is protected by the user's password and encrypts API keys, channel settings, conversations, Google tokens, CRM configurations, embeddings and file-storage settings. This data can only be decrypted after the user authenticates in the system with their individual password. Even if the database is compromised or leaked, all user data remains inaccessible both to attackers and to the service administration.

System secrets and sensitive `app_config` values are encrypted with a separate application master key using AES-GCM. The key is loaded from `APP_MASTER_KEY_FILE`; transactional key rotation is supported through `NEW_APP_MASTER_KEY_FILE` and `APP_CONFIG_REKEY`.

Channel, CRM, payment and lead-hunting services communicate with the orchestrator through HTTP/gRPC contracts. The exact set of services depends on the deployment environment and Docker networks `air_shared`, `app_internal` and `monitoring_shared`.

## Technologies

Go 1.25, Gin, gRPC, Protocol Buffers, WebSocket, MariaDB/MySQL, Redis, MinIO/S3, AES-GCM, JWT, TOTP, Google OAuth, MCP Streamable HTTP, Docker, Envoy, Swagger/OpenAPI, VictoriaMetrics, VictoriaLogs, Perses, Vector and cAdvisor.

## Running

Create the external networks and prepare secrets:

```bash
docker network create air_shared
docker network create app_internal
docker network create monitoring_shared
```

For development:

```bash
docker compose -f air-db.yml up -d
docker compose -f air-redis.yml up -d
docker compose -f air-s3.yml up -d
docker compose -f air-vm.yml up -d
docker compose -f air-vlogs.yml up -d
docker compose -f air-vector.yml up -d
docker compose -f air-mon.yml up -d
docker compose -f air-perses.yml up -d
docker compose -f dev.yml up -d
```

Use `prod.yml` for production. Secrets are mounted from `secrets/` and must not be committed.

## Monitoring

`air-vm.yml` starts VictoriaMetrics, which collects orchestrator, related-service, container (cAdvisor via `air-mon.yml`) and MinIO metrics every 30 seconds. `air-vlogs.yml` stores logs, `air-vector.yml` collects Docker container logs through docker.sock and ships them to VictoriaLogs. Visualization is provided by Perses (`air-perses.yml`, UI at `/perses/`, dashboards provisioned from `monitoring/perses`).
