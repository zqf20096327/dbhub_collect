# TernaryGrid

**A lightweight SQL database client, written entirely in Rust.**

TernaryGrid is a native alternative to DBeaver for SQL databases on macOS, Windows and Linux: one small
binary, no JVM, no Electron.
It opens in about 0.1 s, idles at 0 % CPU and uses around 90 MB of memory — and result sets of
millions of rows never have to fit in memory.

## Highlights

- **Many databases, one interface**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, SQL Server, Oracle,
  CockroachDB, ClickHouse, Cassandra / ScyllaDB, Redis, MongoDB and Elasticsearch / OpenSearch, all
  with drivers written in Rust (no Java, no Oracle Client). Compatible products have their own entry
  with the right defaults: YugabyteDB, TimescaleDB, Supabase, Neon, Redshift, AlloyDB, Greenplum,
  QuestDB, CrateDB, TiDB, OceanBase, Doris, StarRocks, SingleStore, PlanetScale, Azure SQL Database,
  Amazon Keyspaces, Valkey, Dragonfly, KeyDB, MongoDB Atlas, FerretDB, Amazon DocumentDB, Azure
  Cosmos DB for MongoDB and Amazon OpenSearch Service.
- **Redis, MongoDB and Elasticsearch** in the same editor and grid: Redis commands (keys by type in
  the navigator, big hashes and lists read page by page), `mongosh` statements
  (`db.users.find({age: {$gt: 30}})`, aggregations, the data tab's filter takes a query document),
  and Elasticsearch SQL or Kibana-style requests (`GET /logs/_search` + JSON) with hits as rows.
- **SQL editor** with schema-aware autocomplete (tables, columns, joins, aliases, CTEs), templates,
  `:name` / `${name}` parameters, `@set` / `@include` / `@export`, formatter, outline, error markers,
  explain plans (text, tree, diagram) and a searchable query history.
- **Data grid** that scrolls 1 M rows at under 1 ms per frame: inline editing saved in one
  transaction, foreign key navigation, server- or client-side filter and sort, record / JSON / XML
  views, value panels, charts and a map for geometry columns.
- **Safe by default**: development / test / production connection types, confirmations for
  `DELETE`/`UPDATE` without `WHERE` and `DROP`, read-only connections, a separate session per editor.
- **Connections** through SSH tunnels, SOCKS5 / HTTP proxies and SSL. Passwords live in the system's
  keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, GNOME Keyring / KWallet) or an encrypted vault
  with a master password — never in a file. A connection dropped while the computer slept or the
  network was away connects again by itself.
- **Import** connections from DBeaver, `~/.pgpass` and URLs.
- **Everything else DBeaver users expect**: export / import (CSV, JSON, SQL, XLSX, XML, Parquet …),
  migration between databases, mock data, ER diagrams, visual query builder, schema and data compare
  (with Liquibase output), table designer, tasks and scheduler, backup / restore, session and lock
  manager, server dashboard and PostgreSQL debugger.
- **AI assistant** (optional, with your own API key: Anthropic, OpenAI or any compatible service) in a
  side panel: it knows the schema, writes and explains SQL, keeps its conversations and, if you
  allow it, reads data with read-only queries. It asks before each statement that changes anything.
- A quiet, modern interface shared with TernaryWire and TernaryShell: a top bar with the active
  connection › schema and a search box for every command, object and script (`⇧⌘P`), an icon rail
  (navigator, projects, history, tasks), and a status bar with the transaction mode. Light and dark
  themes (View → Theme or the sun / moon button in the top bar), customisable shortcuts, no telemetry.
- **Automatic updates** from GitHub releases (optional), with one click to install, and release notes after every update.

## Install

Every [release](https://github.com/ilhamnadhif/ternarygrid/releases/latest) is built for macOS, Windows and
Linux:

| System | Download |
| --- | --- |
| macOS 12 or later (Apple Silicon, Intel) | `TernaryGrid-<version>.dmg`, or the [one-line installer](#macos) / [Homebrew](#homebrew) |
| Windows 10 / 11 (x64) | `TernaryGrid-<version>-windows-x64-setup.exe` (installer) or `-windows-x64.zip` (portable) |
| Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS | `TernaryGrid-<version>-linux-amd64.deb` (`arm64` on ARM) |
| Fedora, RHEL / Rocky / Alma 9+, openSUSE | `TernaryGrid-<version>-linux-x86_64.rpm` (`aarch64` on ARM) |
| Arch Linux, Manjaro, EndeavourOS | `TernaryGrid-<version>-linux-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst` (`aarch64` on ARM) |
| Any other Linux | `TernaryGrid-<version>-linux-x86_64.AppImage` or `.tar.gz` (`aarch64` on ARM) |

### macOS

**One-line installer** (recommended):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilhamnadhif/ternarygrid/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

The script downloads the latest release, checks it (the SHA-256 GitHub publishes, the code
signature, the bundle id and version), installs `TernaryGrid.app` into `/Applications`, and opens it. Run
it again to update. To install a specific version, pass it as an argument: `… | bash -s -- v0.6.5`.

**Disk image**: download **`TernaryGrid-<version>.dmg`**, open it and drag **TernaryGrid** onto **Applications**.

> **“TernaryGrid” Not Opened / “Apple could not verify…”?** Release builds are not notarized by Apple yet,
> so macOS blocks apps downloaded with a browser. Do one of these:
>
> - **Use the one-line installer** above. Nothing downloaded with `curl` is blocked.
> - **Allow it once in Settings**: click **Done** in the warning, open **System Settings → Privacy &
>   Security**, and click **Open Anyway** next to “TernaryGrid was blocked…”.
> - **In Terminal**: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/TernaryGrid.app`

### Homebrew

From a clone of this repository (the cask follows every release):

```sh
brew install --cask ./packaging/homebrew/ternarygrid.rb
```

### Windows

Run **`TernaryGrid-<version>-windows-x64-setup.exe`**. It installs TernaryGrid for your user (no administrator
rights; pick “all users” in its first dialog to install it for everyone), adds it to the Start menu
and can be removed in **Settings → Apps**. To update, run the installer of the new version.

For a **portable** copy, unzip `TernaryGrid-<version>-windows-x64.zip` and run `ternarygrid.exe` (with
`--portable <DIR>` to keep its settings and data in that folder).

> **“Windows protected your PC”?** The builds are not code-signed yet, so SmartScreen warns about a
> new download: click **More info → Run anyway**.

### Linux

Download the package for your distribution and install it:

```sh
# Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS
sudo apt install ./TernaryGrid-<version>-linux-amd64.deb
# Fedora, RHEL / Rocky / Alma
sudo dnf install ./TernaryGrid-<version>-linux-x86_64.rpm
# openSUSE
sudo zypper install --allow-unsigned-rpm ./TernaryGrid-<version>-linux-x86_64.rpm
# Arch Linux, Manjaro, EndeavourOS
sudo pacman -U ./TernaryGrid-<version>-linux-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
```

On any other distribution, use the **AppImage** (`chmod +x TernaryGrid-*.AppImage`, then run it) or unpack
the **tar.gz** into `~/.local` (the program, its menu entry and icon):
`tar -xzf TernaryGrid-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz -C ~/.local --strip-components=1`.

TernaryGrid then is in the applications menu (or run `ternarygrid`). It needs glibc 2.34 or later (Ubuntu 22.04,
Debian 12, Fedora 35, RHEL 9 and newer), X11 or Wayland with OpenGL. Passwords are kept in the
desktop's keyring through the Secret Service (GNOME Keyring, KWallet) and file dialogs use the XDG
desktop portal — GNOME, KDE and most desktops have both; without a keyring, TernaryGrid keeps passwords in
its vault with a master password. To update, install the package of the new version.

### From source

```sh
cargo build --release -p ternarygrid-app                     # target/release/ternarygrid (ternarygrid.exe)
scripts/bundle-macos.sh                                # macOS: dist/TernaryGrid.app, TernaryGrid-<version>.dmg and .zip
scripts/bundle-linux.sh                                # Linux: .deb, .rpm, Arch package, AppImage and .tar.gz
pwsh scripts/bundle-windows.ps1                        # Windows: installer and .zip (needs Inno Setup 6)
```

## Getting started

1. **New connection** (or **Import connections from DBeaver**) on the welcome page — or click
   **Create sample database** to try everything on a small SQLite shop database.
2. Open a SQL editor with `⌘]`, type a query and press `⌘↩`.
3. Double-click a table in the navigator to edit its data; click a column header to sort it
   (ascending → descending → off); `⌘S` saves the changes.

## Updates

If you allow it, TernaryGrid looks for a new release when it starts and every 6 hours. A new version
opens a dialog with the current and new version and what's new (found later, it lights up an
**Update** button in the top bar instead of interrupting you). On Windows, **Download** gets the new
installer (run it over the installed version); on Linux it opens the release page with the packages.
On macOS, **Install update**:

1. downloads the new version and verifies it (size, the SHA-256 GitHub publishes, bundle id,
   version and code signature);
2. after **Restart now**, quits TernaryGrid (asking about unsaved scripts first), swaps in the new app and
   opens it again; the previous copy is put back if anything goes wrong.

macOS asks for an administrator password only when your user cannot replace the app. Help → Check
for updates… checks right away; **Skip this version** and **Remind me later** are there too. After an
update TernaryGrid shows what changed (also in Help → What's new; all notes are in
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)). The one-line installer above also updates, and Homebrew users update
with `brew upgrade --cask ternarygrid`. The update check is one anonymous request to GitHub; nothing about
you or your databases is sent.

Installing in place needs TernaryGrid in `/Applications` (or another folder it can write to); version
0.3.0 is the first with the updater.

## Command line

```text
ternarygrid [FILE.sql | DATABASE.db ...]   open scripts and SQLite files
ternarygrid --execute FILE.db FILE.sql     open and run the script on the database
ternarygrid --run-task <id|name>           run a saved task without a window (exit code 0/1/2/3)
ternarygrid --portable <DIR>               keep all settings and data in DIR
ternarygrid --bench all                    startup, memory, grid and editor benchmarks
```

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| Execute statement / selection | `⌘↩` |
| Execute script | `⌥X` |
| Execute in a new result tab | `⇧⌘↩` |
| Explain plan | `⇧⌘E` |
| Cancel query | `⌘.` |
| New SQL editor | `⌘]` |
| Active connection / schema | `⌘9` / `⌘0` |
| Format SQL | `⇧⌘F` |
| Autocomplete | `⌃Space` |
| Command palette | `⇧⌘P` |
| Save script / data | `⌘S` |

On Windows and Linux, `⌘` is `Ctrl`, `⌥` is `Alt` and `⌃` is `Ctrl` as well. Every shortcut can be
changed in **Settings → Keyboard shortcuts** (TernaryGrid or DBeaver preset).

## Performance

Measured on the release build (Apple M1 Pro) with `ternarygrid --bench all`:

| | Target | Measured |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Binary size (macOS) | no limit | 59 MB |
| Cold start to first frame | < 1 s | ≈ 0.12 s |
| Idle memory | < 120 MB | ≈ 88 MB |
| 3 connections + 5 result tabs | < 250 MB | ≈ 94 MB |
| 1 M rows scroll | < 16 ms / frame | p95 0.5 ms |
| Typing in a 50 000-line script | < 16 ms / frame | p95 0.5 ms |

## Security and data

- No telemetry. TernaryGrid only connects to the servers you configure and, if you enable them, to your AI
  provider and to GitHub for the update check (one anonymous request for the latest release when
  TernaryGrid starts and every 6 hours; asked once, changeable in Settings → General).
- Passwords and API keys are stored in the system's credential store (macOS Keychain, Windows
  Credential Manager, the Secret Service on Linux) or in `vault.bin` (Argon2id +
  XChaCha20-Poly1305); configuration files are written with mode 0600.
- Settings, connections, scripts, history and tasks live in
  `~/Library/Application Support/dev.ternarygrid.TernaryGrid/` on macOS, `%APPDATA%\ternarygrid\TernaryGrid\` on Windows and
  `~/.config/ternarygrid/` + `~/.local/share/ternarygrid/` on Linux (or `TERNARYGRID_HOME` / `--portable`).

[docs/PARITY.md](docs/PARITY.md).

## Known limitations

- Only databases with a driver written in Rust are supported: Db2, Teradata, Informix, Snowflake,
  BigQuery and DuckDB are not, nor Neo4j (its Rust driver brings a second TLS crypto library).
  Oracle uses Oracle's own Rust driver, still a beta.
- Redis, MongoDB and Elasticsearch results are read-only in the grid: change data with commands.
- Kerberos and MySQL multi-factor authentication are not supported.
- Release builds are not notarized (macOS) or code-signed (Windows) yet.
