SteamBee is a self-hosted operations console for managing your own Steam
accounts through a Docker-friendly, single-user interface.

Legacy playtime boosting remains available for compatibility, but it is a
high-risk capability rather than the product direction. It may violate Steam
or game-service rules; operational safety controls do not make automation
compliant. Review [Product Context](PRODUCT.md) before using it.

Steam login prioritizes QR/mobile approval. A one-time credential fallback is
available only to obtain an encrypted refresh token; SteamBee does not store
Steam passwords or Steam Guard shared secrets.

The repository and container image keep the stable technical slug `steam-bee`
for package names, Compose services, volumes, and image tags. The public product
name is `SteamBee`.

SteamBee is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Valve Corporation
or Steam.

## ✨ Features

- One-time-token-protected admin setup with a cookie-based management UI.
- Multiple own Steam accounts in one container.
- QR login via `steam-session`.
- One-time username/password + Steam Guard fallback without password
  persistence.
- Encrypted refresh-token storage in `/data`.
- Library import with manual AppID fallback.
- Start, pause, resume, and stop per account.
- Persona state and optional custom game title.
- Presets, schedules, session history, and local logs.
- Recovery health with last Steam contact, retry timing, error class, token
  expiry, and library-snapshot age.
- Automatic recovery when another Steam session temporarily owns the account:
  two retries five minutes apart, then a 60-minute cooldown, repeated until
  Steam reports the account free. A restart begins a fresh retry cycle.
- Session safety limits with a fail-closed disconnect fallback; limits can
  pause but never start a session, and daily/weekly limits use explicit UTC
  calendar boundaries.
- Seven-day schedule preview, overlap winners, skip-next, and pause-until.
- Account groups with per-account bulk results for pause and stop only.
- Local browser notifications and optional generic webhooks with private-network
  target blocking, bounded retries, and redacted payloads.
- Read-only playtime goals based on manually refreshed library snapshots.
- Passphrase-encrypted recovery exports and a preflighted offline restore tool.
- A single-instance lease that prevents two processes from operating the same
  `/data` directory.
- SSE status/log updates.
- Docker Compose setup for a VPS, Unraid, or any generic Docker host.
- Optional prebuilt image deployment through GitHub Container Registry.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Requirements:

- Docker Engine with the Docker Compose v2 plugin.
- A Docker host capable of running `linux/amd64` or `linux/arm64` images.
- An HTTPS reverse proxy when SteamBee is exposed beyond a trusted LAN or VPN;
  see [Deployment and Configuration](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

### Prebuilt Image (Recommended)

The public GHCR image is the shortest path for VPS and Unraid deployments. The
included image Compose file follows the mutable `latest` stable channel and
works without a `.env` file. Pin an exact version for repeatable deployments:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ill-yes/steam-bee.git
cd steam-bee
docker compose -f compose.image.yml up -d
```

SteamBee is available on `http://127.0.0.1:3000` by default. Compose binds to
localhost so a host-based reverse proxy can publish it safely.

### First-Time Setup

The commands below use `compose.image.yml`. If you built from source, omit
`-f compose.image.yml`.

On a fresh instance, read the one-time setup token from the logs and enter it
with the new admin password:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.image.yml logs steam-bee | grep "SteamBee setup token"
```

The generated token is also stored as `/data/setup.token` with mode `0600` and
is removed after successful setup. It is printed only when first generated;
read the file after a later restart with:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.image.yml exec steam-bee cat /data/setup.token
```

Set `SETUP_TOKEN` only for automated provisioning. Configured tokens must have
8 to 256 characters and are deliberately not printed.

SteamBee stores its database, encryption secret, encrypted refresh tokens, and
Steam client data in persistent `/data` storage. The default Compose setup uses
the named volume `steam-bee-data`; preserve it across updates, include it in
your backup plan, and never bind `/data` to the checked-out repository. See
[Operations and Data](docs/OPERATIONS.md) for storage and backup guidance.

## 📚 Documentation

- [Deployment and Configuration](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) covers source builds,
  image tags and verification, environment settings, and reverse proxies.
- [Operations and Data](docs/OPERATIONS.md) covers runtime commands, persistent
  storage, Unraid, backups, restores, and updates.
- [Back Up and Restore](docs/OPERATIONS.md#back-up-and-restore) links directly
  to the recovery procedures.
- [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) documents supported deployment boundaries and
  vulnerability reporting.
- [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) covers repository hygiene, local checks, and
  contribution licensing.
- [Translations](docs/TRANSLATIONS.md) explains locale ownership and the
  community-translation status.
- [Product Context](PRODUCT.md) and [Design](DESIGN.md) define the product
  boundaries and visual system.

## Development & Contributing

### Local Development

Requirements:

- Node.js 26.8.1 (matching CI and the container image).
- Corepack with the repository-pinned pnpm version.
- Docker Engine with Docker Compose v2 for container-related changes.

```bash
npm install --global corepack@0.36.0
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The server listens on `http://localhost:3000` and serves the built web app in
production. In development, run the web app separately if you want Vite HMR:

```bash
pnpm --filter @steam-bee/web dev
```

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for repository hygiene and local checks,
and [CLA.md](CLA.md) before opening a pull request.

## 🔒 Security

Read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before exposing SteamBee outside localhost.

Security boundaries:

- No hosted multi-user mode.
- No Steam password persistence.
- No Steam Guard shared-secret persistence.
- No Docker socket or shell command surface.
- No forced kicking of real Steam sessions.
