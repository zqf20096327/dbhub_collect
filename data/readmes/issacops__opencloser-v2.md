## ⚡ What is OpenCloser?

OpenCloser is an **open-source, AI-powered sales development platform** that runs entirely on your desktop. It gives you an **autonomous AI sales team**: a strategist to build your ICP, a researcher to hunt leads, a voice caller to dial prospects, a coach to train your rebuttals, and a manager to analyze every call — all running locally. No SaaS fees. No cloud dependency. No data ever leaves your machine.

| | Traditional Sales Team | **OpenCloser** |
|---|---|---|
| **Strategy** | Hire a consultant ($5K+/mo) | AI Strategist generates ICP using SPIN & Challenger in minutes |
| **Research** | SDR manually Googles leads (hours) | AI Researcher hunts, scores & qualifies leads automatically |
| **Cold Calling** | SDR dials 50 calls/day, burns out | AI Caller dials with perfect pitch, never tired |
| **Coaching** | Manager reviews recordings (hours) | AI Coach gives instant post-call analysis |
| **Training** | Roleplay sessions (awkward, infrequent) | AI Sparring Partner available 24/7, adjustable difficulty |
| **Analytics** | Spreadsheets and gut feelings | Real-time dashboards, sentiment analysis, pipeline tracking |
| **Cost** | $15K–50K+/mo in salaries | **Free. Open source.** |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20+)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable)
- [Tauri prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) (system dependencies per platform)

### Run the Desktop App

```bash
git clone https://github.com/issacops/opencloser-v2.git
cd opencloser-v2
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

### No API Key? No Problem.

OpenCloser works fully in **demo mode** with no API key — 10 realistic seed leads, simulated AI calls, and all features functioning with fallback data. Perfect for evaluation.

### Enable Real AI

Add any of these in Settings → Voice Engine:

| Provider | Key |
|----------|-----|
| Google Gemini | `GEMINI_API_KEY` for onboarding, lead hunting, call analysis |
| OpenAI Realtime | `openai_api_key` for voice calling through the built-in relay |
| ElevenLabs ConvAI | `elevenlabs_api_key` + Agent ID for the most human-like voice |

## 🎙️ Audio Bridge Setup

For AI-to-phone calling, OpenCloser uses a virtual audio cable:

- **Windows:** [VB-Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) (free)
- **macOS:** [BlackHole](https://existential.audio/blackhole/) (free)
- **Linux:** Use PulseAudio's `null-sink` module

The built-in Audio Setup Wizard guides you through configuration, or skip entirely for VoIP-only mode.
