**Live demo: [fomopulse.app](https://fomopulse.app)**

A live tape of what the top fomo.family traders buy and sell on Robinhood Chain: every
fill, priced, about a second after it lands. Same idea as robinhoodtrenches.com, rebuilt so
anyone can run it — adding a wallet or a chain is a pull request, not a code change.

Read-only. It holds no keys, signs nothing, and none of it is advice.

## Run it

```bash
bun install
bun run build                        # the web app into apps/web/dist
bun run ingest --once --tail 3000    # ~5 minutes of real fills, public RPC, no account anywhere
bun run ingest                       # catch up, serve http://localhost:8080, follow the chain live
```

Live mode follows PublicNode's public socket by default; set `RPC_WS_URL` for your
own endpoint, or `bun run ingest --poll 12` to re-read the chain every 12 seconds instead.

| in `.env` | what it is |
|---|---|
| `RPC_WS_URL` | websocket endpoint for live mode; defaults to PublicNode's public socket |
| `RPC_HTTP_URL` | endpoint for catch-up and receipts; defaults to the chain's public RPC, with wide log scans falling back to a second public endpoint when the first refuses the range |
| `FOMO_ACCESS_TOKEN` | a fomo session, only for the handles and avatars; every number on every screen is measured here, so the tape runs without it |
| `FOMO_PRIVY_PAT`, `FOMO_REFRESH_TOKEN` | the rest of that session, from the same browser; with them it renews itself instead of expiring in an hour |

## Deploy

One Cloudflare Worker at the edge, one Durable Object holding the tape, the built web app
as static assets. Live at [fomopulse.app](https://fomopulse.app); `routes` in
`apps/worker/wrangler.jsonc` names that domain, so point it at your own or drop it and take
the `workers.dev` address instead.

```bash
cd apps/worker
bunx wrangler secret put RPC_WS_URL          # optional: your own subscription
bunx wrangler secret put RPC_HTTP_URL        # https://… receipts and catch-up
bunx wrangler secret put FOMO_ACCESS_TOKEN   # optional: PnL, avatars, positions
bunx wrangler secret put FOMO_PRIVY_PAT      # …and the two that keep it alive
bunx wrangler secret put FOMO_REFRESH_TOKEN
cd ../.. && bun run cf:deploy
```

`bun run cf:dev` runs that same stack on your machine, with the secrets in
`apps/worker/.dev.vars`. The `Dockerfile` builds the single-process version for anywhere else:

```bash
docker build -t fomopulse .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v fomopulse-data:/data -e RPC_WS_URL=wss://... fomopulse
```

## What it serves

| | |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/status` | chain, wallets, block, source, latency, lag, uptime |
| `GET /api/tape?window=&limit=&stocks=&dust=&before=&beforeId=` | the tape in the shape robinhoodtrenches.com serves, plus the token's card from the feed and the trader's standing in this tape's own books. `before`/`beforeId` are the time and id of a row already held, and answer with the page before it |
| `GET /api/overview?window=` | the window in a line: volume, buys and sells, wallets, tokens, pace, the biggest buy |
| `GET /api/traders?window=&limit=` | every tracked wallet: what it did here, and what its books made — realized in the window, what is still open, round trips, win rate, rank |
| `GET /api/bags?window=&limit=` | what the tracked traders are sitting in, by token: positions and profit, the feed's quote, the tape's flow |
| `GET /api/discover?window=&limit=` | tokens whose pool opened in the last three days and a tracked wallet bought: who is in, what they put in, the multiple since the first of them, and the wash and spray counts. Pools too thin to be a market, or turning over more than twenty times their own depth in a day, are left out |
| `WS /ws` | `{type:"fills", data:[…]}` as they land |
| `GET /api/alive` | the fomo session — deployed, renewing, when it expires — and the uptime; on Cloudflare also what the pulse last did: which step, how long it took, what failed |

## What you see

Four screens, `[` and `]` between them. **tape** is the fills as they land; **traders** is
every tracked wallet with what it did here and what its books made; **bags** is what
those wallets are still long, by token, marked at the feed's price; **discover** is the
tokens whose pool opened in the last three days, ordered by how many of those wallets
bought in. It says who bought, not that a token is safe: there is no contract analysis
behind it, only this tape and the pool's own depth.

Each screen has its own address — `/`, `/traders`, `/bags`, `/discover` — and the window and
the filter travel with it, so `/discover?window=7d` and `/bags?q=MARS` are links you can send.
Back and forward walk them, and typing in the filter does not fill the history with an entry
per letter.

`1`–`5` pick the window every screen counts in, `t` shows or hides tokenised stocks, `d`
the dusting — tokens nobody paid for, pushed to every tracked wallet — and `/` filters by
trader or token. A phone has no hover, so a tap opens the token and trader cards under the
row.

The one column worth naming: **vs now** is the trade against the token's price now, not the
token's own move. A buy is green when the token trades higher than it was bought at, a sell
when it trades lower than it was sold at — so a large sell that moved the price is usually
green, because it sold above where the token trades after it. The token's own move is `1h`
and `24h` on its card.

The bar across the top counts the window: `vol` is what the tracked wallets traded, `buys`
is the share of fills that were buys against sells, then how many wallets traded how many
tokens, and the pace in trades a minute.

The tape holds the last four hundred fills, which at this pace is about half an hour — the
counters above it still cover the whole window, so **older** at the foot of the table asks
for the page before the oldest row and keeps going. What the database itself keeps is
longer and finite: fills for ninety days, the receipts they were derived from for fourteen,
and a snapshot of every bag for ninety. Nothing pruned any of it before 2026-09-05, when
the store was growing 62 MB a day and the object's SQLite stops at ten gigabytes.

Two things are deliberately not trades. A quote from a pool with less than $1 000 in it is
not a price — an almost-empty pool prices whatever dust last crossed it, and on 2026-09-06
one of them had the tape reporting $132.9 billion of volume in a day — so those tokens are
left unpriced, which the tape shows as a dash. And the same amount, from one sender, to
five wallets or more in a single transaction is a handout however much the pool says it is
worth: nobody buys the identical quantity as seventy other people at the same instant.
A token that turns out to trade for real pardons its own dusting — one paid buy brings its
whole cheap history back — but never a handout: fomocat has a live pool, fifteen honest
buys in it, and a spray to seventy-three wallets at a time, and the three are separate
facts. Both rules are why the receipts are kept. `bun run rebuild` replays them through the
current reconstruction without touching the chain, and a deployment whose rules have moved
on replays its own once, a couple of thousand receipts per pass, on the next few ticks.

Every number on every screen is measured here, from this tape's own fills: fills,
volume and share, and the books behind the traders and bags screens — average cost per
wallet and token, a round trip counted in the window it closed in, what is still held
marked at the feed's price, and what was handed over rather than bought kept out of the
profit. A pass over the tape rewrites them every ten minutes.

fomo is left with the handle, the avatar, the clan and the tick — the only things it
knows that the chain does not. Those need `FOMO_ACCESS_TOKEN`, a read-only Privy
session from a logged-in browser, which lives for an hour and renews itself for as long
as Privy keeps the session behind `FOMO_REFRESH_TOKEN`. That session is your own account's,
it reads what your own login already sees, and it is yours to keep within fomo.family's
terms — the leaderboard is asked for once every ten minutes, and nothing here logs in for
you, holds anyone else's session, or writes anything back. Without it the screens keep
every figure and lose the faces. Tracked wallets live in
[config/wallets.json](config/wallets.json), the chain in
[config/chains/robinhood.json](config/chains/robinhood.json), and the service those
handles come from — its API, its site, the public identifiers of its Privy app — in
[config/fomo.json](config/fomo.json).
