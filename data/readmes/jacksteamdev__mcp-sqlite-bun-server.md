## Installation

1. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh) if you haven't already
2. Clone this repository
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
4. Run the setup script to configure the server in Claude Desktop:
   ```bash
   bun run setup
   ```

The setup script will automatically add the server configuration to your Claude Desktop config file, located at:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

## Components

### Resources
The server exposes a single dynamic resource:
- `memo://insights`: A continuously updated business insights memo that aggregates discovered insights during analysis
  - Auto-updates as new insights are discovered via the append-insight tool

### Prompts
The server provides a demonstration prompt:
- `mcp-demo`: Interactive prompt that guides users through database operations
  - Required argument: `topic` - The business domain to analyze
  - Generates appropriate database schemas and sample data
  - Guides users through analysis and insight generation
  - Integrates with the business insights memo

### Tools
The server offers six core tools:

#### Query Tools
- `read-query`
   - Execute SELECT queries to read data from the database
   - Input:
     - `query` (string): The SELECT SQL query to execute
   - Returns: Query results as array of objects

- `write-query`
   - Execute INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE queries
   - Input:
     - `query` (string): The SQL modification query
   - Returns: `{ affected_rows: number }`

- `create-table`
   - Create new tables in the database
   - Input:
     - `query` (string): CREATE TABLE SQL statement
   - Returns: Confirmation of table creation

#### Schema Tools
- `list-tables`
   - Get a list of all tables in the database
   - No input required
   - Returns: Array of table names

- `describe-table`
   - View schema information for a specific table
   - Input:
     - `table_name` (string): Name of table to describe
   - Returns: Array of column definitions with names and types

#### Analysis Tools
- `append-insight`
   - Add new business insights to the memo resource
   - Input:
     - `insight` (string): Business insight discovered from data analysis
   - Returns: Confirmation of insight addition
   - Triggers update of memo://insights resource

## Development

### Project Structure
- `src/index.ts`: Main server implementation
- `src/logger.ts`: Logging utility
- `scripts/setup.ts`: Claude Desktop configuration script

### Logging
The server maintains detailed logs in:
- `server.log`: Located in the project root directory
- Logs include timestamps, log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL), and structured metadata

### Database
The SQLite database file is created at:
- `data.sqlite`: Located in the project root directory
- Created automatically if it doesn't exist

### Available Scripts
- `bun run setup`: Configure the server in Claude Desktop
- `bun run lint`: Run ESLint checks
- `bun run lint:fix`: Fix ESLint issues automatically
- `bun run inspect`: Run the MCP inspector
