# memo

**Your coding agent starts every session with amnesia. memo fixes that — 100% on your own machine.**

Persistent, searchable memory for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Cline, Devin, and OpenCode. No cloud, no API keys, no Ollama, no vector DB to run. And it spends *fewer* tokens, not more.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jagoff/memo/v4.16.0/install.sh | bash
```

<sub>Prefer a package manager? `uv tool install mlx-memo` · `pipx install mlx-memo` · `brew tap jagoff/memo && brew install mlx-memo`</sub>

Then:

```bash
memo doctor                                   # self-check
memo save 'we use Postgres, not Mongo'        # save a decision
memo search 'what database did we pick?'      # search by meaning
```

That's it. Your agents pick it up over MCP automatically — the installer wires every client it finds.

<summary>Installing on another Mac or handing setup to an agent?</summary>

New Mac:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jagoff/memo/v4.16.0/install.sh | bash
memo sync bootstrap git@github.com:yourname/memo-sync.git
```

Agent-managed setup:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jagoff/memo/v4.16.0/install.sh | bash
memo doctor --strict-runtime
```

</details>

**On Linux or just want to look around first?**

```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/jagoff/memo:latest memo doctor
```

## Why this saves you money

Most memory servers *add* context. memo is built to remove it.

| Profile | Tools | Schema tokens |
|---|---:|---:|
| `agent` (default) | 43 | ~9.7k |
| `core` / `slim` | 60 | ~13.2k |
| `full` / `default` | 165 | ~30.6k |

The default MCP surface is 43 tools, not 165 — 74% fewer tools, and about 68% less schema context: **43 tools / ~9.7k schema tokens** versus **165 tools / ~30.6k tokens** on the full surface — overhead paid every session, in every client.

Ambient recall injects one relevant memory before the model answers. The bundled Claude Code hook caps that injection at ~160 tokens. `memo roi` reports the real grounding and re-ask counts — the estimated-savings figure it used to print was removed in 4.14.0, because multiplying those counts by hardcoded constants was a savings claim memo could not support. For measured savings, `memo tokens` reads the provider's own usage counters through the context-compression proxy.

```bash
memo roi       # value from grounded recalls and avoided re-asks
memo tokens    # usage-savings ledger
```

## Three things nothing else does

### 🕰️ Time-machine — query your knowledge as it was

```bash
memo as-of ask "what was the deploy strategy?" --date 2026-02-01
memo diff --from 2026-01-01 --to 2026-03-01
```

Full historical reconstruction by reverse-replaying `history.db`. Useful when you need to know *why* past-you made a call, not just what past-you decided.

### ⚡ Contradiction radar — memory that notices when you change your mind

```bash
memo contradict scan      # find conflicting facts corpus-wide
memo contradict triage    # resolve: fuse / newer-wins / dismiss
```

Change a decision and memo flags the now-stale version, so the agent stops reintroducing what you already threw out.

### 🔮 Dream — it optimizes itself while you sleep

```bash
memo dream run
```

A 7-phase nightly pipeline: inventory → mine signals → resolve conflicts → prune stale → synthesize cross-cluster insights → optimize → pre-warm the top-100 query embeddings so tomorrow's recall stays under 200 ms. Every run writes a receipt you can audit. Zero intervention.

## How it works

**Hybrid retrieval.** A vector leg (MLX on Apple Silicon, `sentence-transformers` on CPU) and a BM25 leg (FTS5, diacritic-folding for Spanish) run in parallel, fuse via Reciprocal Rank Fusion, then go through an optional MLX cross-encoder rerank.

![vector + keyword search in parallel, fused, reranked, top memory injected](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jagoff/memo/master/docs/diagram-recall.svg)

**Markdown is the source of truth.** Every memory is a plain `.md` file you can read, grep, and version-control. SQLite is a derived index that rebuilds from the files at any time — hand-edit in Obsidian and your edit wins on the next `memo reindex`. Nothing is locked in a database you can't open.

**Prompts and memories stay on your machine.** Embedder, reranker, and LLM all run in-process. No telemetry. Memory travels only if *you* point `memo sync` at a git remote you own. Normal startup is fully offline; remote update checks and auto-update require an explicit opt-in. → **[Privacy and network policy](https://github.com/jagoff/memo/blob/master/PRIVACY.md)**

Also in the box: cross-agent `memo resume` (reopen any session from any agent), cross-Mac git sync, a knowledge graph with optional codegraph symbol edges, encrypted secret storage, OCR/audio ingestion, evidence packs, outcome learning, signed federation, and a local chat UI over your memory (`memo chat serve`). → **[Full feature reference](https://github.com/jagoff/memo/blob/master/docs/reference.md)**

## Requirements

| | Support |
|---|---|
| **macOS, Apple Silicon (M1–M4)** | Full — MLX embedder + reranker + `ask`/`synthesize`/`dream` |
| **Linux / Ubuntu** | Standalone CPU backend — search, recall, save. `pipx install "mlx-memo[cpu]"` · [docs/ubuntu.md](https://github.com/jagoff/memo/blob/master/docs/ubuntu.md) |
| **Intel Mac** | Unsupported — current PyTorch releases do not ship Python 3.13 wheels for this platform |
| **Docker** | Cross-platform, CPU backend · [docs/docker.md](https://github.com/jagoff/memo/blob/master/docs/docker.md) |

Python ≥ 3.13 (the installer handles this via `uv` if you don't have it). First install pulls ~8 GB of models, 5–15 min. Optional: an Obsidian vault — without one, memo uses `~/Documents/memo/`.
