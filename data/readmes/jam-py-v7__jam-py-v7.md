## With Jam.py, build business software - not technology stacks.

Jam.py lets a single developer build an entire [business](https://northwind.pythonanywhere.com/) application 
without having a complex web technology stack. It does that due to:

1. A full developer framework, not only a low-code tool. 
2. Deployment model is simple. Suitable even for Windows or offline / air-gapped networks.
3. Modern application layer suitable to modernize existing systems without rebuilding everything.
4. Runs accross desktop browsers and mobile devices while keeping a single application codebase.

## Main features



Jam.py is an object oriented, event driven framework with hierarchical structure, modular design
and very tight DB/GUI coupling. The server side of Jam.py is written in [Python](https://www.python.org),
the client utilizes [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript),
[jQuery](https://jquery.com) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/).

* Simple, clear and efficient IDE. The development takes place in the
  Application builder, an application written completely in Jam.py.

* “All in the browser” framework. With Jam.py, all you need are two pages
  in the browser, one for the project, the other for the Application builder.
  Make changes in the Application builder, go to the project, refresh the page,
  and see the results.

* Supports SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firebird, MSSQL and
  Oracle databases. The concept of the framework allows you to migrate from
  one database to another without changing the project.

* Authentication, authorization, session management, roles and permissions.

* Automatic creation and modification of database tables and SQL queries generation.

* Data-aware controls.

* Open framework. You can use any Javascript/Python libraries.

* Rich, informative reports. Band-oriented report generation based on
  [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org) templates.

* Charts. You can use free [jsCharts](http://www.jscharts.com) library
  or any javascript charting library to create charts to represent and analyze your application data.

* Allows to save audit trail/change history made by users

* Predefined css themes.

* Develop and test locally update remotely. Jam.py has Export and Import
  utilities that allow developer to store all metadata (database structures,
  project parameters and code) in a file that can be loaded by another
  application to apply all the changes.
