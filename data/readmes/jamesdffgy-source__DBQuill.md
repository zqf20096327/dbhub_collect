![Hand-drawn overview of the DBQuill workflow](docs/assets/dbquill-handdrawn-workflow.png)

DBQuill turns a request into a typed, reviewable database operation before anything reaches the database. Read paths are physically read-only and bounded. Write paths stop at validation and a change preview until the user explicitly confirms them.

- **Ask naturally:** inspect schemas, search rows, calculate grouped metrics, compare periods, and continue with follow-up questions.
- **Bring a file and a task:** attach SQLite, CSV, or `.xlsx` in the composer and describe the query, analysis, cleanup, or controlled edit in the same message.
- **See useful results:** follow the public intent/action/observation stages, then inspect tables, charts, evidence, and expandable audit details.
- **Write deliberately:** use a schema-based form or validate a multi-sheet Excel workbook, preview the change, then confirm one transactional write.
- **Learn from verified reads:** completed read paths become scoped, redacted execution episodes; repeated successful routes can be promoted into typed read-only strategies, while corrections demote them and users can disable or clear them.
- **Keep control locally:** database credentials, model profiles, sessions, audit records, and uploads stay outside the source tree.

1. Attach SQLite, CSV, or `.xlsx` beside a natural-language instruction, or add a read-only or controlled-write MySQL/PostgreSQL connection.
2. Ask a question such as `Which products grew fastest this quarter?`; the file is attached first and the instruction continues against that data source.
3. Review the interpreted operation, relationship path, result table, and charts.
4. For an insert, choose the table and complete the generated form, or merge a workbook whose sheets and headers match existing tables and columns.
5. Export the current authorized database view as a multi-sheet `.xlsx`; DBQuill exports can be edited and validated for import again.

## Quick start on Windows

Requirements:

- Windows 10 or 11, x64;
- CPython 3.12 (CI selects an available 3.12 patch release);
- Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime;
- Git for cloning and release verification.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/jamesdffgy-source/DBQuill.git
cd DBQuill
.\scripts\install_and_start.cmd
```

The command creates an isolated `.venv`, installs the hash-locked dependency set, runs environment diagnostics, and opens the desktop app. Add any OpenAI-compatible text-model endpoint in Settings. The application does not require a specific model vendor.

To explore without using a real database:

```powershell
.\scripts\run_python.cmd scripts\create_demo_database.py
.\scripts\start_dbquill.cmd
```

Attach `demo_data/dbquill_demo.sqlite`, then follow the [demo guide](docs/DEMO_TEST_GUIDE.md). For manual setup, offline constraints, WebView2 help, and clean-machine verification, read the [installation guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

## What is verified

| Data source | Verified path | Current boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SQLite | Schema, retrieval, metrics, charts, semantics, scheduling, and confirmed writes | Complete MVP path |
| CSV / `.xlsx` | Attach with a natural-language task and convert into a local SQLite database | Legacy `.xls` is not supported; merging into an existing database uses `.xlsx` preflight and confirmation |
| MySQL 8.4 | Schema, PK/FK discovery, bounded queries, grouped metrics, timeout and physical read-only enforcement | Controlled `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` is opt-in; live vendor write matrix is pending |
| PostgreSQL 17 | Schema, PK/FK discovery, bounded queries, grouped metrics, timeout and physical read-only enforcement | Controlled `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` is opt-in; live vendor write matrix is pending |

The source setup is continuously checked on a clean GitHub-hosted Windows environment. A release badge or source archive is not a claim of a signed native installer; the current distribution is source-first and requires Python 3.12.

## Why the architecture is different

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Q[Question] --> P[Operation planner]
    P --> C[Typed relational contract]
    C --> N[Deterministic native plan]
    C --> M[Bounded model candidate]
    N --> G[Authorization and semantic gates]
    M --> G
    G --> R[Read-only executor]
    R --> E[Scoped execution memory]
    E -. verified route hints .-> P
    G --> W[Write validation and preview]
    W --> U[Explicit confirmation]
    U --> T[Transaction]
```

The model is a planner input, not the authority. Deterministic schema operations and proven relational plans bypass model-generated SQL when possible. Every candidate still crosses the same authorization, single-statement, row-limit, semantic, and execution gates.

The desktop client talks only to a loopback `aiohttp` service protected by a local token and same-origin checks. SQLite reads use physical read-only connections plus `query_only`; remote reads use a separate read-only session even when controlled writes are enabled. Write confirmation is bound to one database, one reviewed plan, and one use.

## Verification

Run the same gate used in CI:

```powershell
.\scripts\check_project.cmd
```

Useful release checks:

```powershell
.\scripts\doctor.cmd
.\scripts\run_python.cmd scripts\smoke_startup.py
```

The project gate checks repository hygiene and credentials, compiles critical modules, runs the full security and functional regression suite, validates the fixed offline evaluation set, checks frontend JavaScript, and verifies the recorded source fingerprint.

Public benchmarks are diagnostic evidence, not templates for hard-coded SQL. The [benchmark report](docs/BENCHMARK_REPORT.md) separates model behavior, infrastructure failures, single-database execution, and multi-database Test Suite Accuracy.

## Security and privacy

- Queries are read-only by default, single-statement, and row-bounded.
- Writes require validation, a change preview, and explicit confirmation.
- Remote writes require an explicit controlled-write connection; only DML is enabled, while remote DDL remains blocked.
- Scheduled natural-language work cannot approve writes automatically.
- Audit records retain controlled metadata and hashes, not raw prompts, SQL, credentials, or result rows.
- Layered memory stages completed reads for asynchronous model reflection. The model may propose discard, L4, L2, L3, or L2+L3, but a deterministic local evidence gate controls the effective write. Memories remain isolated by database, access scope, and schema fingerprint, and never store SQL, result rows, credentials, connection details, or model prompts.
- Model credentials are stored in ignored local configuration and are never required in repository files.
