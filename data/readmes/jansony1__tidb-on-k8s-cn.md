#	How to setup TiDB on kubernetes cluster by kops in AWS China 

This document provides guides to deploy TiDB in k8s in AWS China using [kops-cn](https://github.com/nwcdlabs/kops-cn). 

##	Pre-requisites
1.  Have a AWS China account. If you don't have one, [click here to register](https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/sign-up/)
1.  Launch an EC2 (recommend selecting Amazon Linux 2 AMI) as a kubernetes management machine, and configure it as below.
    1. Login [AWS China console](https://console.amazonaws.cn/console/home)  
   
    1. (Optional: group setting) Go to Services->IAM->Group, add a new group (e.g kubernetes) with necessary permissions attached (we simply use “AdministratorAccess” in this blog for quick start, but it's not recommended in production environment. Better follow [least privileges rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) in policy setting).

    1. Go to Services->IAM->Users, create a new user (e.g. kops) with "Programmatic access" enabled and add it into the newly created group (e.g. kubernetes). After that, you will get the “Access key ID” and “Secret access key”. Download the credential document or write them down for future use;

    1. Login the EC2, and perform the “**aws configure**”. It will ask you to input the following information. 
        - AWS Access key ID: <created above>
        - AWS Secret access key: <created above>
        - Default Region name: cn-north-1  
        - Default output format: none
        >Note: cn-north-1 is the region code for Beijing region, for Ningxia, it's cn-northwest-1  
1. Make sure you have **enough instances capacity** before doing the test. For example, if your account is a new registered one, by default the limitation is that you could only launch one c5.2xlarge instance. Thus, it would definitely fails if you are trying to deploy on multi instances.


## Step 1: Setup a kubernete cluster uing kops-cn

We have a well-written document by Pahud about how to set kubernete cluster using kops in China.  
1. For Chinese version, go to [kops-cn-chinese-version](https://github.com/nwcdlabs/kops-cn) 
1. For English version, go to [kops-cn-english-version](https://github.com/nwcdlabs/kops-cn/blob/master/README_en.md)
   > Note: For kops and kubectl package, remember to replace the binary download link with China S3 bucket address to avoid suffering from low speed issue.
   > It is noted in kops-cn document [HOW TO section step 2](https://github.com/nwcdlabs/kops-cn/blob/master/README_en.md#HOWTO) .

1. If you wish to deploy the cluster into a single AZ where you could enjoy lower latency and fewer data transfer cost, you could revise the following file.
```
make edit-cluster
##find create-cluster part and edit "zones", "subnet" etc. 
create-cluster:
	@KOPS_STATE_STORE=$(KOPS_STATE_STORE) \
	AWS_PROFILE=$(AWS_PROFILE) \
	AWS_REGION=$(AWS_REGION) \
	AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=$(AWS_DEFAULT_REGION) \
	kops create cluster \
     --cloud=aws \
     --name=$(CLUSTER_NAME) \
     --image=$(AMI) \
     --zones=cn-northwest-1a \
     --master-count=$(MASTER_COUNT) \
     --master-size=$(MASTER_SIZE) \
     --node-count=$(NODE_COUNT) \
     --node-size=$(NODE_SIZE)  \
     --vpc=$(VPCID) \
     --kubernetes-version=$(KUBERNETES_VERSION_URI) \
     --networking=amazon-vpc-routed-eni \
     --subnets=subnet-xxxxxxxxxxxx \
     --ssh-public-key=$(SSH_PUBLIC_KEY)

make update-cluster
```

1. (Optional) If your AWS account hasn't finished **ICP recordal whitelist** for the public web service which is required by China government, you still need to perform the following steps. **Skip this part if your AWS account has been added to ICP whitelisted**.

   1. Login AWS China console and go to Services->EC2->Load Balancer, and select the the load balancer according to the .kube/config and make some changes:
      1. Add a rule into the security group to allow 8443 TCP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 source;
      1. Click on the “Listeners” tab and change the “Load Balancer Port” from 443 to 8443
   1. Edit .kube/config by appending “:8443” at end of line “server: https://xxxx”

1. Now, the kubernetes cluster is ready, and you can operate it by kubectl

1. You will also need to install extra tools like helm & tiller. Check here for [detailed installation steps](https://github.com/nwcdlabs/kops-cn/blob/master/doc/Helm.md).
>Note : If you meet error 'cannot find tiller', after unzip helm.tgz, move tiller to lo /usr/local/bin/ too.

## Step 2: install TiDB on kubernetes cluster

1. Ssh to the bastion server. If you are using Amazon AMI,  ssh -i < name-of-your-private-key >.pem  ec2-user@< ip-address > . For other linux type, try centos or ubuntu for the username.

1. Add Pingcap into the Helm repo list.
    ```
    helm repo add pingcap https://charts.pingcap.org/
    helm repo update
    helm search tidb
    ```
    
1. Install Tidb Operator

   ```
   #to create TidbCluster customized resource type:
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/master/manifests/crd.yaml && \
   kubectl get crd tidbclusters.pingcap.com
   
   #to get chart yaml file of tidb-operator
   #you could customize your folder location by chaging mkdir command
   mkdir -p ~/tidb-operator && \
   helm inspect values pingcap/tidb-operator --version=v1.0.0 > ~/tidb-operator/values-tidb-operator.yaml
   
   #to modify the yaml file and specify local image repo:
   vim ~/tidb-operator/values-tidb-operator.yaml
   ```
1. set the value of 'scheduler.kubeSchedulerImage' to 'gcr.azk8s.cn/google-containers/kube-scheduler', and save the file.  
   ![](img/yaml-file.png)
   
   ```
   #set the value of 'scheduler.kubeSchedulerImage' to 'gcr.azk8s.cn/google-containers/kube-scheduler', and save the file.
   #install tidb-operator:
   helm install pingcap/tidb-operator --name=tidb-operator --namespace=tidb-admin --version=v1.0.0  -f ~/tidb-operator/values-tidb-operator.yaml
   
   #verify the installation:
   kubectl get po -n tidb-admin -l app.kubernetes.io/name=tidb-operator

   ```
1. Run the following command to get the configuration file

    ```
    # fetch Tidb cluster package  
    helm fetch pingcap/tidb-cluster   

    # unzip it to get the config file
    tar -zxvf tidb-cluster-v1.0.0.tgz

    cd tidb-cluster
    ```
    
1. There is a values.yaml file in this folder which contains the configuration set for components like TiKV, pd, TiDB etc. **Custom your own configuration by revising the yml file** before you install TiDB, examples of changes includes revise replica set, set a ELB, change pvReclaimPolicy or revise the storageClassName etc.    

    - Changing storageclass to gp2, AWS EBS volume General SSD.For more choices, click [EBS Volume type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/zh_cn/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html) .  

        ![](img/storage-class.png)
        
        >**【IMPORTANT】** There are serveral places for storageclass defination for different components in the yaml file, like TiDB, TiKV etc. If you are using **EBS-only instances** like c4 and c5 instance types, you must **replace all storageclass to one of the EBS types**. Or the PV creation would fail (no instance storage available). Click [instance type introduction](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) if you have any questions.

    - changing component replica number   
        ![](img/replica-number.png)

    - change nodeport to AWS Load balancer
        ![](img/load-balancer.png)
       
1. After everything is set, run the following command.

    ```
    helm install pingcap/tidb-cluster --name=tidb-cluster-test --namespace=tidbtest -f values.yaml 
    ```

1. Check the cluster configuration. For example, you will see the storageClass applies succesfully to gp2 and **PV has automatically been provisioned dynamically**. Click here for more introduction upon [PV provision](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/).
Also, if you go to [AWS Console](https://console.amazonaws.cn/ec2/autoscaling/home) now , you will find EBS GP2 volumes provisioned automatically.
    ```
    kubectl get pv | grep tidbtest
    ```

   ![](img/get-pv.png)


## Step3. Scale on kubernete cluster
This section enables you to scale the cluster up or down. And for each new instance, PV would be automatically created. 


1. **Manually Scale Kubernetes Worker Node**   
   For scaling up or down your Node nunber, go to [AWS EC2 Console](https://console.amazonaws.cn/ec2/autoscaling/home) and **Configure your auto scaling group**. You could edit the min, max and desired number for current state and also configure metircs to let the node scale automatically. For example, scale when CPU reaches 80%.
   ![](img/scale-node.png)
   
1. **Manually Scale Pod Number**   
   For scaling up your pod replica number, simple revise the values.yaml and run the following command. For more guide upon scaling, refer to [this page](https://github.com/pingcap/docs-cn/blob/master/v3.0/tidb-in-kubernetes/scale-in-kubernetes.md)
   ```
   helm upgrade tidb-cluster-test pingcap/tidb-cluster --namespace=tidbtest -f values.yaml 
   ``` 
   You will see this after the command.
   ![](img/helm-upgrade.png)
1. **Automatically Scale Your Pod and Node using Cluster Autoscaler**     

   You could also **configure Cluster Autoscaler(CA)** to combine the above scaling together. After the configuration, when new pod comes to pending status and finds no available node, CA will **automatically scale the node**. The max capacity depends on your auto scaling max setting in the last step. 

   Detailed CA configuration steps could be found in [Deploy CA in eksworkshop](https://eksworkshop.com/scaling/deploy_ca/). Note that for China users, you have to replace the image registry address to ```gcr.azk8s.cn/google-containers/cluster-autoscaler:v1.2.2``` to make it work. Or you will receive 'trying and failing to pull image' error.
   
   ![](img/autoscaler-yml.png)

   An example is listed below where you could see new pod scaling requests (by revising replicas number in yaml file) triggers new nodes and new pods launched on new nodes.
   
   ![](img/pod-pending.png)
   
   New node created.
   
   ![](img/ca-new-node.png)
   
## Step 4. How to access TiDB 

###	Cluster Startup
1. Watch tidb-cluster up and running
    ```
    watch kubectl get pods --namespace tidbtest -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=tidb-cluster-test -o wide
    ```
1. List services in the tidb-cluster
    ```
    kubectl get services --namespace tidbtest -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=tidb-cluster-test
    ```

###	Cluster access

1. Access tidb-cluster using the MySQL client
    ```  	
    kubectl port-forward -n tidbtest svc/tidb-cluster-test-tidb 4000:4000 &
    mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 4000 -u root -D test
    ```
1. Set a password for your user

    ```
    SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'%' = 'JEeRq8WbHu'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    ```    
1. View monitor dashboard for TiDB cluster

   ```
   kubectl port-forward -n tidbtest svc/tidb-cluster-test-grafana 3000:3000
   ```   

1. Open browser at http://localhost:3000. The default username and password is admin/admin.
If you are running this from a remote machine, you must specify the server's external IP address.

## Delete resources

- Use ```make delete-cluster``` to delete all resources

- If your pvReclaimPolicy is retained, after the scale down, you may need to delete the released pv manually by running ```kubectl delete pv```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Error: Trying and failing to pull image error**   
Check the image registry address. In China, as google is being blocked, any image coming from google.com is blocked. You have to replace the image source to a China native one. For example, you could use 
'gcr.azk8s.cn/google-containers' etc.

1. **Error: cannot find tiller**   
Move tiller to ```/usr/local/bin/``` path.

1. **Failing to launch desired number of pods or node: Check account limitation**   
Each account has an instance number limitation. You should check your limitation first to see if you have enough capacity. If you need more number than your current limit, click '**request limit increase**'.
   ![](img/instance-limit.png)

1. **Fail to Create PV: check storageclass defination**    
There are serveral storageclass defination for different components in the yaml file, like TiDB, TiKV, pd etc. 
   - If you are using **EBS-only instances** like c4 and c5 instance types, you must **replace all storageclass to one of the EBS types like gp2**. Or the PV creation would fail cause no instance storage is available. 
   - If you are using instances with instance storage like m3, i3 etc, you could choose either local storage or EBS according to your own need. If you don't how to choose, read [Storage type choice](https://pingcap.com/docs-cn/v3.0/tidb-in-kubernetes/deploy/prerequisites/) for more info.
   - Click [instance type introduction](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) if you would like to know more about different instance types.
