# OwnChat 🔐🌎
## For those who yearn for freedom 🏳️
A Self-Hosted Chat Application for Desktops (client->Server->client) using Java Swing and Sockets and Oracle Database.

## Features
 
- **Account creation & login** — usernames/passwords stored in `USER_DETAILS`, checked on login.
- **Contacts** — add contacts, fetch a contact list, and see whether a contact is currently online before starting a chat.
- **Real-time messaging** — each logged-in client registers a socket with the server; messages are relayed live to the recipient if they have a chat window open, and every message is logged to `CHAT_HISTORY`.
- **Chat history** — reopening a chat with a contact replays prior messages, colored by sender, with date/time headers.
- **Themes** — Metal, Dark, and Light look-and-feels, persisted per user in the `SETTINGS` table and re-applied automatically on login.
- **Online/offline status tracking** — updated in `LOG_STATUS` whenever a user opens/closes the contacts list or logs in/out (including on window close, via an auto-logout hook).
- **Configurable server IP** — the client can point at any server host through a simple settings screen.
- **About screen** — developer/branding info panel.

## Tech Stack
 
| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Client UI | Java Swing (`JFrame`/`JPanel`, `JTabbedPane`, `JTextPane` for styled chat text) |
| Networking | Java `Socket` / `ServerSocket` over a single TCP port (`4567`), line-based text protocol |
| Server | Multi-threaded (`Thread` per client connection), Swing UI to configure DB credentials and show run status |
| Database | Oracle DB via JDBC (`jdbc:oracle:thin:@//localhost:1521/FREEPDB1`) |
| Concurrency | `ConcurrentHashMap<username, PrintWriter>` to track connected clients for message relaying |

## Project Structure
 
### Client
 
| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `Welcome.java` | App entry point (`main`). Shows a splash/loading screen, then launches `App`. |
| `App.java` | Main window; hosts a `JTabbedPane` with Home, Settings, Set Server, and About tabs. |
| `Home.java` | Landing tab — Log In, Create Account, and Chat Now entry points. |
| `log.java` | Login form; sends credentials to the server and applies the user's saved theme on success. |
| `CrAc.java` | "Create Account" form. |
| `SetServerIP.java` | Lets the user set the server's IP address (stored statically for all socket calls). |
| `Settings.java` | Log out, change username, change theme, add contacts. |
| `Contacts_List.java` | Fetches and displays the logged-in user's contacts in a `JTable`; lets the user check if a contact is online and open a chat. |
| `Add_Contacts.java` | Form to add a new contact by name. |
| `ChatWindow.java` | The live chat UI — connects to the server, loads history, sends/receives messages, appends colored/styled text. |
| `About.java` | Static info/credits panel. |
| `clientSession.java` | Simple static holder for the current logged-in username and login state. |
 
### Server
 
| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `ServerL.java` | Server entry point. UI to enter DB credentials, then listens on port `4567` and spawns a `clientHandler` thread per connection. |
| `clientHandler` (in `ServerL.java`) | Parses the first line of each connection as an action (e.g. `Log In`, `Create Account`, `Contacts`, `Add Contacts`, `Fetch contacts`, `checkUser`, `Change online status`, `ChatHistory`, `Set Theme`, `Check Theme`, `Change username`, `SLogOut`, `chat_connect`) and executes the matching SQL/relay logic. |
 
### Database
 
| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `OwnChatDB.sql` | Schema: `USER_DETAILS`, `SETTINGS`, `LOG_STATUS`, `CONTACTS`, `CHAT_HISTORY`, plus triggers that auto-seed default settings and an initial "logged out" status when a new user is created. |
 
## How To Setup

### (1) Build Database:

- Download Oracle
- Run the OwnchatDB.sql File (excluding the statements of drop table; are only for dropping in case there is an issue or you want to alter)

### (2) Setup the Server

-  Download and then extract the file(OwnChatS-Portable.zip) from Releases section
- Run exe file
- The Window will open then input the database username and password to connect

### (3) Setting up the Client(OwnChat App)

- Download and then extract the file(OwnChat-Portable.zip) from Releases section
- Run the exe file
- Go to set Server then input the IP Address of your Sever
- Create account
- Log in
- Go to Chat Now and add contacts 
- Then again click chat now
- Contacts list will arrive 
- Select the contact then hit connect if the user is online the chat window will open
- Chat Freely

### Want to chat beyond your local network?

OwnChat stays self-hosted/on-premise — there is no central public server. If you need to reach users outside your LAN, you can host **your own** server + database on a cloud VM you control. See **[DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md)** for a full walkthrough (Azure example, Docker + Oracle setup, systemd service, troubleshooting).

## Important Points

- For the client running on the same machine as server you do not need set server IP Address or just set as localhost if needed

## Roadmap
 
A web-based version of OwnChat is planned, built up in stages: Servlets → JSP → J2EE → Spring Boot, with an HTML/CSS/Bootstrap frontend.
