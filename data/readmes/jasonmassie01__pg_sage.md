**Agentic Postgres DBA.** No extension required.

## What It Does

pg_sage runs as a single Go binary alongside your PostgreSQL instance. It connects
over the standard wire protocol, collects performance data from catalog views and
`pg_stat_statements`, projects issues into DBA **Cases**, and optionally uses an
LLM for deeper analysis. A trust-ramped executor proposes or applies typed
actions with guardrails, approval gates, rollback metadata, and a shadow-mode
report showing what autonomous policy would have handled. Works on Lakebase, Cloud SQL,
AlloyDB, Aurora, RDS, Neon, Supabase, and self-managed Postgres.
See [Neon and Supabase setup](docs/neon-supabase.md) for hosted connection requirements.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Binary (Linux amd64)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/jasonmassie01/pg_sage/releases/latest/download/pg_sage_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar xz
./pg_sage --pg-url "postgres://sage_agent:pw@localhost:5432/mydb"

# Docker
docker run --name pg_sage \
  -e SAGE_DATABASE_URL="postgres://sage_agent:pw@host:5432/mydb" \
  -p 8080:8080 -p 9187:9187 ghcr.io/jasonmassie01/pg_sage:latest
```

Dashboard at `http://localhost:8080` -- API and Prometheus metrics at `:8080/api/v1/` and `:9187/metrics`.

For bounded, read-only pgvector recall and latency experiments, run
`pg_sage vector-lab --manifest workload.json` with `SAGE_VECTORLAB_DATABASE_URL`.
See the [Vector Evidence Lab guide](research/2026-09-04-product/README.md) for
the manifest, explicit budgets, report format, and supported query shapes.

Automatic index builds require verified host CPU and data/log I/O utilization.
The catalog-only PostgreSQL adapter cannot supply those metrics, so it withholds
automatic index admission; reviewed manual index actions remain available.

After verification retains a replacement index, superseded indexes are preserved
for reviewed cleanup. The verification reason records `reviewed_cleanup_required`
while the verified index remains retained.

On first start, pg_sage creates `admin@pg-sage.local` and prints a one-time
initial admin password to stderr. The dashboard and JSON API use the
`sage_session` login cookie; unauthenticated API calls return `401`.

For Docker, retrieve the password with:

```bash
docker logs pg_sage 2>&1 | grep 'INITIAL ADMIN PASSWORD'
```

## Features

| Area | What You Get |
|------|-------------|
| **Cases Work Queue** | Findings, incidents, migration risks, and action history are projected into ranked DBA cases with why-now context and next actions |
| **Incident Playbooks** | Runaway queries, lock blockers, connection exhaustion, WAL/replication risk, and sequence exhaustion become typed diagnostics or reviewed action scripts |
| **Vacuum/Bloat/Freeze Autopilot** | Table bloat, dead tuples, XID runway, freeze blockers, and per-table autovacuum tuning produce guarded candidates with verification plans |
| **Query Tuning Beyond Hints** | Query rewrites, broken-hint retirement, `CREATE STATISTICS`, parameterization, and repeated role-level work_mem patterns become reviewable actions with verification steps |
| **Provider Capability Adapters** | Cloud SQL, AlloyDB, RDS, Aurora, and self-managed Postgres expose provider-specific extension paths, log access, limitations, and action readiness |
| **Agent DB Deployments** | Provision local agent schemas/databases, run gated cloud provisioning for RDS/Cloud SQL/Lakebase, track pings, cost, backups, cleanup, blueprints, Terraform, and agent-facing query recommendations |
| **DDL Safety + PR/CI Output** | Migration-risk cases include lock/rewrite/live-risk preflight, guarded migration SQL, rollback or forward-fix guidance, verification SQL, and PR-ready metadata |
| **Rules Engine** | 20+ deterministic checks: duplicate/unused/missing indexes, slow queries, regressions, seq scans, vacuum & bloat, dead tuples, sequence exhaustion, replication lag, security audit, config drift |
| **Index Optimizer** | LLM-powered recommendations validated through 8 checks + HypoPG cost estimation, confidence scored 0.0--1.0 |
| **Config Advisors** | 6 LLM advisors: vacuum tuning, WAL/checkpoint, connections, memory, query rewrite, bloat remediation |
| **Health Briefings** | Periodic LLM summaries. ReAct is C-extension-only via `sage.diagnose()`; it is not exposed by the Go sidecar. |
| **Trust-Ramped Executor** | Observation -> Advisory -> Autonomous. Typed actions carry risk tier, guardrails, expiration, rollback/mitigation, and verification state. HIGH-risk actions always require approval. |
| **Shadow Mode** | Shows avoided toil and proof rows for actions pg_sage would have handled under auto-safe policy before teams turn on autonomous execution |
| **Fleet Mode** | Monitor N databases from one binary with per-database trust levels, token budgets, and health scores |
| **Per-Query Tuner** | EXPLAIN plan analysis with `pg_hint_plan` directives for disk sorts, hash spills, bad joins, missed index scans |
| **Workload Forecaster** | Predicts disk growth, connection saturation, cache pressure, sequence exhaustion, query volume spikes, checkpoint pressure |
| **Alerting** | Slack, PagerDuty, and webhook channels with per-severity routing, cooldown, and quiet hours |
| **Dashboard & API** | React SPA + REST API embedded in the binary -- Overview, Cases, Actions, Fleet, Settings, authenticated by default |
| **Prometheus** | Standard `/metrics` endpoint with findings, collector, LLM, executor, and database size gauges |
