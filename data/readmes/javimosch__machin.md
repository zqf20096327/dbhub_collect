# machin ⎯ Machine-First Language (MFL)

A language **shaped for AI agents to write and edit cheaply**: zero type annotations, one canonical declaration per line, every design choice measured for token cost. Compiles through C to a single native binary — C/Rust-class speed, unboxed values, no runtime.

> ### 🧬 machin is **written in machin** — a self-hosting compiler
> The whole toolchain — lexer, parser, type checker, C code generator, *and* `encode` /
> `build` / `run` — is written *in machin* ([`selfhost/`](selfhost/), ~4k lines). It
> compiles its own source back into itself, and the rebuild reproduces itself
> **byte-for-byte** — a genuine compiler **fixpoint** — at ~0.9× the original's speed. A
> language mature enough to build itself from scratch, verified to the byte. Every stage
> was built against a byte-diff oracle, which flushed out three real compiler bugs along
> the way. **CI enforces it on every push** — the fixpoint, a 415-program codegen
> oracle diffed against the reference compiler, and the embedded runtime being in
> sync — so this is a checked claim, not a milestone someone once reached. See
> [`selfhost/`](selfhost/) and [`BOOTSTRAP.md`](selfhost/BOOTSTRAP.md).

## Same service, measured

The pitch in one table. The **same REST + SQLite API** (`POST` / `GET` / `DELETE
/notes`) written idiomatically in each language, then measured for what actually
costs an AI agent: **tokens to write, and tokens to edit**. All three build and
pass the same CRUD test ([`bench/rest-sqlite`](bench/rest-sqlite)).

| | author tokens | edit tokens | ships as |
|---|--:|--:|---|
| **machin** | **388** | **290** | **44 KB static binary · 0 deps** |
| Go | 527 · 1.36× | 329 · 1.13× | 14.8 MB binary + module deps |
| Python | 383 · 0.99× | 332 · 1.14× | source + CPython interpreter |

machin is **as terse as Python** to write, **~36 % cheaper than Go**, lowest on
edit cost — and the only one that ships as a **single 44 KB native binary with
SQLite, the HTTP server, and the router built in**. No interpreter, no `go mod`,
no container. *Write it like a script, ship it like C.* That combination — not a
raw token count — is the whole idea. (`o200k_base`; `cl100k_base` gives the same
ranking. Reproduce: `python3 bench/rest-sqlite/measure.py`.)

…and then it ships in a way an interpreter can't ([`bench/cold-start`](bench/cold-start)):

| same HTTP server | deployable image | cold start | idle RSS |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| **machin** (static, `FROM scratch`) | **92.9 kB** | **0.49 ms** | **108 kB** |
| Node (`.js` + `node:alpine`) | 178 MB · 1916× | 28.9 ms · 59× | 51 MB · 477× |
| Python (`.py` + `python:alpine`) | 47.6 MB · 512× | 49.1 ms · 100× | 17.9 MB · 166× |

A 92.9 kB image — the binary and nothing else — that's serving traffic in half a
millisecond on ~0.1 MB of RAM.

## Why

Every mainstream language was designed for **human** ergonomics — readable syntax, explicit types, multi-line formatting. For an AI agent, every output token costs, and that human-friendly ceremony taxes the writer without adding meaning. machin measured this: [`tools/tokcost.py`](tools/tokcost.py) showed base64 source costs ~2.5× the tokens to output; whitespace alone costs ~13%. The canonical one-line-per-declaration form, with every type inferred, is the end of that measurement — the smallest token surface that still produces C/Rust-class native code with zero runtime overhead.

### Measurement

The form should be *measured, not asserted*. [`tools/README.md`](tools/README.md) is the entry point to the instruments behind that: [`tools/tokcost.py`](tools/tokcost.py) (write/edit token cost of a source form), [`tools/tokmin.py`](tools/tokmin.py) (where MFL spends tokens and what a minimization would save), and [`tools/reliability/`](tools/reliability) — the other half of the metric, since real cost is *tokens × tries*: it measures whether a syntax change makes a model write the code wrong more often, not just whether it's shorter.

> **Agents: run `machin guide`** for the complete, version-exact feature surface — every keyword, every builtin with its signature, the core idioms, and the gotchas, as JSON (`--text` for prose). Emitted from the compiler's own catalog; can't drift from the implementation. Depth lives in [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) and [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## The form

`.mfl` is plain canonical text: one normalized declaration per line, whitespace tightened. Greppable, diffable, no type annotations. A minimal illustration (not a transcript of any specific file — see [`examples/demo.mfl`](examples/demo.mfl) for a fuller runnable program):

```
func fib(n){if n<2{return n}return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2)}

func main(){println(fib(10))}
```

A dense `machin pack` form exists for distribution; `machin run` reads either.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javimosch/machin/main/install.sh | sh
machin guide                             # learn the language (version-exact catalog, JSON)
```

Installs the latest release binary to `~/.local/bin` (override with `MACHIN_INSTALL`).
machin compiles MFL through C, so building programs needs a **C compiler** (`cc`
by default — set `CC` to override it, e.g. `CC=clang machin build app.mfl -o app`); the
`--target wasm` web target additionally needs [`zig`](https://ziglang.org). Building
web apps? See the [`machin-web` skill](skills/machin-web/SKILL.md).

Prefer to fetch the binary yourself? Every [release](https://github.com/javimosch/machin/releases)
ships static `linux`/`darwin` × `amd64`/`arm64` binaries plus a `SHA256SUMS.txt`:

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/javimosch/machin/releases/latest/download/machin-<tag>-<os>-<arch>
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/javimosch/machin/releases/latest/download/SHA256SUMS.txt
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt --ignore-missing        # verify before running
chmod +x machin-<tag>-<os>-<arch>
```

The C compiler requirement above still applies to a downloaded binary — it's needed
at `run`/`build` time regardless of how `machin` itself got installed.

## Use it from Claude Code

Install machin's agent skills as a [Claude Code plugin](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins),
so an AI agent reaches for machin at the right moment — in any project:

```
/plugin marketplace add javimosch/machin
/plugin install machin@machin
```

You get **machin-start** (when to reach for machin, and a zero→running→shipped
quickstart, with the measured benchmarks as decision criteria) plus the web / backend
/ gamedev / deploy how-tos — they auto-activate by intent. For any other agent runtime,
`machin skill install` writes the same skills to a vendor-neutral `~/.agents/skills`.

## Use

```bash
make build                               # …or build from source (needs Go 1.22 + a C compiler)
bin/machin run    examples/demo.mfl      # compile to native + execute
bin/machin build  app.mfl -o app         # standalone native binary
bin/machin build  app.mfl --emit-c       # print the generated C
bin/machin build  app.mfl --safe         # + bounds / div-zero / overflow checks
bin/machin build|run app.mfl --race-safe # refuse to build if a data race is inferred
bin/machin encode a.src b.src > app.mfl  # mint canonical .mfl from loose Go-like text
bin/machin pack   app.mfl                # dense base64 form (distribution)
bin/machin guide  --text                 # print the full feature catalog for agents
```

## Performance

machin compiles through C, so it runs in the **native tier**, not the scripting tier.
On four kernels with byte-identical output, timed interleaved against Rust `-O3` and
Zig `ReleaseFast` (min of 9 rounds, this machine):

| | fib(40) | mandelbrot 1000² | sieve 10⁷ | intsum 10⁹ |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| **machin** | **214.7 ms** | 724.2 ms | 202.0 ms | **3079.7 ms** |
| Rust `-O3` | 289.7 ms | 720.1 ms | 142.9 ms | 3223.8 ms |
| Zig fast | 292.9 ms | **702.8 ms** | **137.9 ms** | 3189.7 ms |

**Wins 1, ties 2, and the sieve now ties Rust too** (it still trails Zig by ~1.19×).
Unboxed values, no interpreter, no VM. The sieve gap was never slice indexing —
that loop always tied Rust; it was `append` copying into a fresh block on every
growth, fixed in [#578](https://github.com/javimosch/machin/issues/578) by proving
a slice unaliased and then growing it in place. The table above predates that fix.

Where machin beats **Rust**: **binary size** — 14 kB stripped vs 335 kB, both dynamic.
Read that as a fixed offset (Rust starts ~320 kB ahead), not a ratio: machin's hello
world and its fib are the same size to the byte, so both numbers measure each
toolchain's floor. It does **not** beat Zig here — Zig 0.15.2's *fully static* binary
is 16 kB, and machin's own `--static` build is 940 kB.

And **compile-time bug reports** — a guaranteed deadlock that `rustc` and `zig`
accept silently and then hang on, machin reports as `DL001` before you run it.

Where it loses: **build time** (Rust ~57 ms vs machin ~100 ms) and **default
runtime safety** (machin, like Zig `ReleaseFast`, omits bounds checks unless you
pass `--safe`; Rust traps by default).
