## In 30 seconds

These requests come from the evaluation corpus. The table describes the intended workflow, not a recorded agent execution or fabricated cloud output.

| Ask your agent | Skill | What it helps you do |
|---|---|---|
| “port 80 is open in the security list but the site still times out from outside” | [oci-networking](skills/oci-networking/SKILL.md) | Inspect scoped VCNs, subnets and NSG rules; trace the failing hop before proposing a rule change. |
| “tô tomando NotAuthorizedOrNotFound em tudo, mas o usuário é admin. como descubro com qual identidade o cli tá autenticando?” | [oci-cli-auth](skills/oci-cli-auth/SKILL.md) | Establish profile identity and region subscriptions; distinguish missing resources from missing access. |
| “launch an ARM VM.Standard.A1.Flex with 2 ocpus and 12gb in my dev compartment” | [oci-compute](skills/oci-compute/SKILL.md) | Read shape and image compatibility, then prepare a scoped launch and recovery plan for review. |

Reads retain explicit scope and bounded output. The Claude Bash guard reviews recognized writes; mutation recipes are marked **shape-verified only**. [Corpus and evaluation limits →](docs/evals.md)

## Get started

Prerequisites: Python 3.13+, `uv`, and OCI CLI 3.93.0 for the reproducible baseline. Configure your OCI profile outside the checkout when you need credentialed reads. Offline smoke tests require no cloud credentials.

Clone this repository, then run these two commands from its root:

```bash
uv sync --frozen --project runtime
claude --plugin-dir .
```

For a self-contained copy, project adapters and runtime configuration, follow the [installation guide](docs/install.md).

Before executing a proposed read, the optional [offline command-contract helper](docs/command-contract.md)
checks required flags, pagination and query syntax without accessing OCI. Its
separate two-tool MCP server is opt-in; the default 15-tool server is unchanged.

| Host | Entry point | Shell guard supplied by this pack |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | Native plugin; full, database or DevOps selection | Advisory Bash `PreToolUse` hook |
| Codex | Plugin manifest or copy installer `--host codex` | **UNGUARDED** |
| Gemini CLI | Copy installer `--host gemini` | **UNGUARDED** |
| Cursor | Copy installer `--host cursor` | **UNGUARDED** |
| OpenCode v2 | Copy installer `--host opencode` | **UNGUARDED** |
| Other MCP clients | Bundled stdio server | Fixed read-only tools; shell controls belong to the host |

The four unguarded copy adapters require `--i-accept-unguarded`. Host configuration and launcher checks do not establish interactive compatibility with every host version. IAM remains the cloud access boundary.

## What's inside

Each skill combines a scope check, symptom-based routing, command examples, focused references and failure modes. The [full catalog](docs/skills.md) shows verification labels, helper scripts, references and read examples for every skill.

Skill bodies and references load on demand. `scripts/catalog.py` searches command shapes without loading the entire census. The MCP exposes fixed operations, explicit compartment scopes and bounded pages; it provides no arbitrary CLI, SQL or SDK executor. [Architecture and contracts →](docs/foundation.md)

## Safety model

- **Measured OCI classification:** 9,145 CLI leaves, all 278 critical-labelled leaves denied, and zero allows outside the strict read-only set. The severity snapshot shares the catalog's generator; it is not an independent taxonomy. [Matrix and invariant](docs/evidence/guard-severity-matrix.json).
- **Review before change:** danger flags, including `--force`, never lower severity. Unknown OCI leaves and modified helper hashes ask for review. Unrecognized commands return no decision and retain host permissions.
- **Read-only runtime:** fixed MCP dispatch and scoped helper wrappers constrain the operations they expose. The Bash hook is advisory and does not intercept generic MCP executors or protect other host shells.
- **Untrusted results:** names, tags, logs and other returned values are data. Sanitized evidence and inert safety fixtures are checked; live resistance to prompt injection remains unmeasured.

The frozen Oracle denylist comparison permits 374 destructive-labelled leaves under current prefix replay; this measures a snapshot, not today's upstream server behavior. The [audit](docs/audit.md) preserves the matching rules, census false positives, source revisions and known gaps. Terraform, kubectl, SQL and APEX guard rules are outside the measured OCI matrix.

## Evidence you can inspect

[September 13 semantic validation](docs/semantic-validation-2026-09-13.md): 38 successful trial reads out of 39 requests; 34 query-result comparisons passed, including 16 with nonempty input. Offline regressions cover projections, joins, pagination and incomplete reads. These bounded checks do not certify every skill end to end.

| Check | Recorded result | Scope |
|---|---:|---|
| Regression suite | See latest full run | Test count, warnings and date in the [validation matrix](docs/validation-matrix.md) |
| Authored OCI fences | 286/286 valid | CLI shape lint, not workload execution |
| Negative routing prompts | 0/40 fired in each of two trials | Isolated semantic classifier; dated evidence |
| Semantic skill selection | 80/80 and 80/80 | Zero disagreements in the recorded trials; [ownership repair and evidence](docs/evals.md#current-ownership-repair) |
| OCI CLI census | 9,145 leaves / 174 groups | Includes aliases; not complete product coverage |
| Full release matrix | 24 pass / 4 open | Open gates retain owners and reasons |
| Preserved five-case repair regression | 4/5 native; 3/5 no-plugin | Historical development evidence; [further guidance changes](docs/offline-followup-2026-09-11.md) have no fresh model measurement |

[Validation matrix](docs/validation-matrix.md) · [Evaluation method](docs/evals.md) · [Semantic investigation and limits](docs/semantic-routing.md)

The [ownership contracts](docs/routing-contracts.md) explain the implemented
routing repair. The [historical reliability study](docs/routing-reliability.md)
covers the original errors, calibrated uncertainty and task evaluation still needed. It also identifies the official `oracle/skills`
repository as a prospective baseline; the archived comparison below is unchanged.

The archived four-arm comparison below dates from September 9, before the scope repairs. It uses the same frozen prompts and static matcher for every arm. These figures measure authored material and inert guard replay, not agents completing tasks:

| Arm | Routing proxy | Authored fence validity | Unconfirmed guard exposure |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| This pack | 37.5% | 100.0% / 277 | 0/20 |
| adibirzu skills | 13.8% | 14.0% / 114 | 20/20 |
| Oracle API + Cloud descriptors | 6.2% | Unmeasured | 5/20 |
| Bare descriptor baseline | 0.0% | Unmeasured | 20/20 |

The bare arm has no descriptions and abstains; it does not measure a bare model's knowledge. Oracle's arm measures tool discovery and denylist replay. See the [full comparison and reproduction command](docs/head-to-head.md) before comparing these unlike interfaces.

```bash
uv run --frozen --project runtime pytest -q tests skills/oci-incident-triage/tests skills/oci-security-posture/tests skills/oci-sdk-patterns/tests
uv run --frozen --project runtime oci-readonly-smoke
uv run --frozen --project runtime python scripts/doc-gen/catalogs.py --check
uv run --frozen --project runtime python scripts/ci/release_gate.py
```

The release gate writes evidence outside the checkout and prints diffs. It exits nonzero while any release gate is open. Default mode reuses dated cloud/link/host evidence and makes no model calls. `--probe-host` requires a separately approved model-provider allocation, not OCI credits. [Contributor checks →](CONTRIBUTING.md)

**Archived context cost (September 9):** 6,386 tokens by characters/4 for descriptions plus MCP schemas, excluding host framing. One Claude Code measurement found a 5,517-token skills-only delta; adding the schema estimate yields 8,972 estimated tokens, not a measured MCP-on total. [Method and raw counts](docs/evidence/context-measurement.json).

## Open work

1. **Scheduled drift:** real hosted issue publication and deduplication passed; the actual Tuesday scheduler trigger remains unobserved.
2. **Live workflows:** selected CLI/MCP and disposable database-lab probes passed, but Cloud Guard, Support and FinOps prerequisites retain failed or incomplete coverage. No full workload certification is claimed.
3. **Host evaluation:** [five skill repairs](docs/task-repair-validation-2026-09-11.md) recovered four of five native development failures. Full current-task behavior remains unmeasured; the earlier 35/40 score belongs to its immutable old revision. The native evaluator is early-access restricted.
4. **Behavioral comparison:** normalized model-backed synthetic comparisons are recorded; a native four-product deployment comparison and live injection resistance remain unmeasured.

The separately authorized [published-history cleanup](docs/history-migration-2026-09-11.md)
is complete; current and reachable historical patch-body scans pass.

The [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) separates implementation work, missing infrastructure and external access. Eleven niche CLI groups remain without dedicated skill ownership; the [coverage map](docs/audit.md#unowned-services) lists them explicitly.

## Built from research, checked against code

The build combined OCI documentation and CLI/SDK inventories, a research plan, implementation passes and adversarial audits. Community and official projects informed the design: adibirzu/oci-skills, araidon/oci-skills, oracle/mcp, oci-ai-architects, marcocanto, cvranjith, jasonwilbur and Oreo-Tech. Their contributions, pinned comparison snapshots and license notices are recorded in the [provenance matrix](docs/audit.md). The [build record](docs/build-log/README.md) preserves implementation history; research and build notes are excluded from installations.
