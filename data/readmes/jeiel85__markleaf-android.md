## 🍃 What is Markleaf?

**Markleaf** is an Android Markdown note app designed to strip away the clutter so you can focus on just two things: capturing and organizing. Your data is stored only on your device, and standard Markdown guarantees full ownership and portability. Even sync happens only through *a folder you choose* — Markleaf never syncs or uploads anything itself.

[**View the branding page**](https://jeiel85.github.io/markleaf-android/) · [Current version: v2.53.1](https://github.com/jeiel85/markleaf-android/releases/tag/v2.53.1) · [Privacy Policy](https://jeiel85.github.io/markleaf-android/privacy.html) · [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.markleaf.notes/) · [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.markleaf.notes)

## ✨ Key Features

### Writing & Preview
- **`/` Quick Insert** — search commands at the start of a line to insert headings, lists, tables, callouts, wikilinks, images, and more as standard Markdown
- **Live Markdown preview** — toggle instantly between editing and preview, or use the *Show Markdown syntax* option for live syntax coloring
- **GFM tables / checkboxes / blockquotes / callouts (`> [!NOTE]` …)** — all rendered in preview
- **Code block syntax highlighting** — token coloring for 10 languages: Kotlin, Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Bash, JSON, YAML, XML, SQL
- **Footnote (`[^N]`) ref ↔ def jump** — tap the superscript to scroll smoothly to the definition
- **Image attachments + alt-text editing** — kept as isolated copies in the app's internal storage (no media permission required)
- **Smart Markdown formatting toggle** — wrap the selection or the word around the cursor in Bold/Italic/Strikethrough/Inline Code, and tap again to cleanly unwrap text that's already wrapped
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Ctrl/Cmd+B, I, K, Shift+S for bold, italic, link and strikethrough on a hardware keyboard
- **Table of contents (TOC)** — in preview mode, jump to H1–H3 headings to navigate long notes
- **Serif / Sans font choice** — switch the writing surface to a serif face for a book-like feel; code blocks always stay monospaced
- **Focus mode / word, character & reading-time stats / find & replace within a note**

### Organizing & Navigating
- **Tag-based classification + autocomplete** — just write `#tags` in the body for automatic indexing, no folders; existing tags autocomplete as you type `#`
- **Wikilinks (`[[Title]]`) + backlinks panel** — autocomplete, and see at a glance what points to this note
- **Quick switcher (Ctrl+K)** — Obsidian-style title substring jump
- **SQLite FTS full-text search** — fast, down to the body text
- **Pin / archive / trash** — trash asks once more before permanent deletion

### Sync & Export (No-Cloud principle)
- **Folder mirror sync** — mirrors each note as a **title-named** `.md` / `.txt` file to a folder you pick via SAF (Drive/Dropbox/Syncthing/OneDrive/NAS, etc.); rename a note and its file follows. Markleaf never syncs anything itself; it is delegated to *whatever external app syncs that folder*
- **Open a `.md` / `.txt` file to read it** — *Open file…* in the ⋮ menu, or a tap in your file manager, opens the file rendered and read-only; nothing joins your notes until you tap *Save as note* (the file name becomes the title when there's no heading). Sharing a file into Markleaf from another app still imports it straight away. Tags in synced-in notes are recognized right away
- **Export individual / all notes as `.md`**
- **Send via the system share sheet**

### Design & Accessibility
- **Markleaf green theme + Material You toggle** — Android 12+ system wallpaper colors optional
- **Automatic dark mode** — follows the system setting
- **Tablet 3-pane layout** — tag sidebar · note list · editor; tap a tag in the sidebar to filter the note list in place (note list still collapsible)
- **UI in 11 languages** — Korean / English / Spanish / Japanese / French / German / Simplified Chinese / Croatian / Russian / Vietnamese / Slovak resources
- **Block screenshots / recent-apps preview option** — for sensitive notes

## 🔗 Works with the Markdown folder you already have

Markleaf has no vault format of its own. Point it at a folder — including one that Obsidian, Logseq, or your text editor already opens — and it works on the files that are there.

- **Plain files, already yours.** One note is one `.md` (or `.txt`) file. Drop existing files into the folder and Markleaf picks them up as notes the next time it comes to the foreground — no import step.
- **Your frontmatter survives.** Markleaf adds a small YAML header (`markleaf_id`, timestamps, pinned/archived) so it can match a file to a note across devices, and **everything it does not recognize is carried back out byte-for-byte** — the indented block lists Obsidian writes tags in, nested maps, comments and quoting all included. The header it adds is a strict subset of YAML that Obsidian, GitHub and VS Code all parse.
- **The same syntax you already write.** `[[Wikilinks]]` with a backlinks panel, inline `#tags`, GFM tables and checkboxes, `> [!NOTE]` callouts, and an Obsidian-style `Ctrl+K` quick switcher.
- **Reconciles by itself, carefully.** Changes made elsewhere are pulled in when Markleaf returns to the foreground (throttled to once a minute). An edit from another editor is seen even if that editor never touches Markleaf's frontmatter — the reconcile compares the body, not just the timestamp. A file only wins when it is genuinely newer; if both sides moved, the remote arrives as a *separate* note rather than overwriting your edits, and nothing is ever deleted automatically.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Two things to know before you point Markleaf at a real vault.**
> - **One folder, no subfolders.** Markleaf reads the files directly inside the folder you pick and does not descend into subdirectories. A vault organized into nested folders will only meet Markleaf at its top level — by design, Markleaf organizes by tags instead of folders.
> - **Editing a note renames its file.** Mirror filenames track the note title, so a file whose name differs from its heading gets renamed the first time you save it in Markleaf. Where `[[links]]` in your vault point at the old filename, they will break.
>
> If your vault is deeply foldered or link-heavy, point Markleaf at a *separate* folder and treat it as a mobile inbox you merge from, rather than as a second editor on the vault itself.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Markleaf follows current Android development standards with a modern, maintainable stack.

- **UI**: [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) + Material 3 + Material You dynamic color
- **Architecture**: simple layered separation (core / data / domain / feature / ui) + Repository pattern
- **Database**: [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) — SQLite-backed local persistence, FTS4 virtual tables for full-text search
- **Markdown parser**: [commonmark-java](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-java) (CommonMark 0.30 + GFM extensions: tables, strikethrough, task lists, footnotes, YAML frontmatter; preview renders a single newline as a line break rather than a space)
- **Asynchronous**: [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) & [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html)
- **Storage Access Framework (SAF)** — folder mirror sync + image attachments
- **Image loading**: [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) — F-Droid-friendly Apache 2.0
- **DataStore Preferences** — app settings
- **Profile Installer 1.4.0 + Macrobenchmark** — cold-start baseline profile measurement (326ms on a TB320FC)
- **Testing**: JUnit + Robolectric + [Roborazzi](https://github.com/takahirom/roborazzi) visual regression tests (Linux goldens, threshold 0.005)
- **CI**: GitHub Actions — build and instrumented tests are required checks, plus launch-smoke, record-roborazzi, and the signed release on a tag

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

> [!NOTE]
> **Google Play updates are currently on hold.** New versions won't be pushed to the Play Store until a Korean business-registration policy requirement for the solo developer is resolved. For the current release, use **GitHub Releases**. F-Droid remains the recommended update path when its build has caught up. (If you already installed it from the Play Store, it keeps working.)

- **F-Droid** *(recommended for automatic updates)*: [Markleaf on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.markleaf.notes/) — search in the F-Droid client or install via the link above. Its catalog may publish after GitHub; if it does not yet show the current version, use GitHub Releases below. It uses the same signing key (SHA-256 `0be97352…f91a`), so updates continue seamlessly even if you first sideload a GitHub APK.
- **Direct APK install**: the [GitHub v2.53.1 release](https://github.com/jeiel85/markleaf-android/releases/tag/v2.53.1) carries two APKs — `markleaf-v2.53.1.apk` matches the F-Droid/Play build (no auto-update, no extra permission), and `markleaf-v2.53.1-sideload.apk` adds an opt-in in-app update check (`INTERNET`, `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`). Pick the sideload one for in-app updates, download it, then run it on your Android device — both share the same signing key, so switching between them later is a normal update, not a reinstall.
- **Google Play**: [Markleaf on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.markleaf.notes) — **updates are paused** (see the note above). If you already have it, it keeps working; use GitHub Releases for the current version or F-Droid once it is available there.

### Building from source
If you'd like to build or contribute, follow these steps.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jeiel85/markleaf-android.git

# Enter the project folder
cd markleaf-android

# Build and install
./gradlew installDebug
```

Markleaf's bug fixes mostly begin as somebody else's report. The people who wrote them are listed in [THANKS.md](THANKS.md).

## 🔒 No-Cloud by design

Markleaf has no backend, and none of your notes ever leave the device on their own. Whether your data leaves the device is *entirely your choice*.

- ✅ **No** `android.permission.INTERNET` in the store builds (F-Droid, Google Play) — they make no network requests at all
- ✅ **No** Markleaf server / backend
- ✅ **No** analytics / ads / tracking / closed-source SDKs
- ✅ `android:allowBackup="false"` — Markleaf data is excluded from Android auto-backup / device transfer
- ✅ Data only ever moves through OS paths when *you* export, share, open an external link, or pick a SAF folder
- ✅ Fully open source, auditable by anyone under Apache 2.0

**One exception, and only one.** The APK on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jeiel85/markleaf-android/releases/latest) declares `INTERNET` (for an **opt-in, off-by-default** update check) and `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` (so it can install the update you choose to download, after verifying its SHA-256). The F-Droid and Google Play builds contain neither permission nor that code — not disabled, absent. **No notes, tags, attachments, metadata, identifiers or usage data are ever sent, in any build or by either request.** The boundary is written down in [`docs/AGENT_SPEC.md` §15.9](docs/AGENT_SPEC.md).

How "never leaves your device" works exactly is documented in the [Privacy Policy](docs/PRIVACY.md) and the [No-Cloud Certification](docs/NOCLOUD_CERTIFICATION.md).
