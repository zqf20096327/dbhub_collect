**Developer Intelligence Platform**

DevScore is an AI-powered platform that analyzes GitHub repositories to generate structured engineering tiers. It evaluates code quality, architectural decisions, contribution consistency, and technical depth to produce measurable developer insights.

## Overview

DevScore connects to a developer’s GitHub account, audits repositories using an AI-driven evaluation pipeline, and assigns standardized engineering levels. The system emphasizes objective metrics across architecture, discipline, and long-term contribution patterns.

The result is a quantified score breakdown and shareable “DevScore Dossier” badges for portfolios and public profiles.
