## Overview

Greed is a financial application written almost entirely in Golang, used to view/track data easily across financial institutions/accounts. It utilizes the third-party API [Plaid](https://plaid.com) to connect your account with your financial institutions, and obtain your account and transaction history. This data can then be viewed in a user friendly format, which can be used to track past expenditures and plan future ones.

Since this app utilizes paid Plaid functions, and is not intended for widespread use, users are restricted in a 'demo' mode, in the number of calls they can make to certain server endpoints, specifically those that talk to Plaid. Users are limited to 5 calls to update/sync their financial data.

Cloud server currently offline.

## System Requirements
- No dependencies for binary installation
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for Docker installation)
- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) 1.24+ (for source installation)

## Installation Options

1. Download Binary (Recommended)
    - Download from [Releases](https://github.com/jms-guy/greed/releases)
    - Make it executable and run:

        - **Linux:**
        ```bash
        # Download greed-cli-linux-amd64
        chmod +x greed-cli-linux-amd64
        ./greed-cli-linux-amd64 ping
        
        # Optional: Rename for easier use
        mv greed-cli-linux-amd64 greed
        ./greed register ExampleUser
        ```

        - **Windows:**
        ```powershell
        # Download greed-cli-windows-amd64.exe
        # No chmod needed, just run directly
        # Cd into download directory (ex. Downloads)
        cd .\Downloads\
        .\greed-cli-windows-amd64.exe ping

        # Rename in file explorer, or in command line
        ren greed-cli-windows-amd64.exe greed.exe
        .\greed.exe register ExampleUser
        ```

        **Windows Users:**
        It's recommended to use [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) for the best experience:
        - Download from Microsoft Store or GitHub releases
        - Full support for colors, tables, and interactive features
        - Use default PowerShell tab

        **If Windows Terminal isn't available:** Use Command Prompt (cmd.exe) as a fallback. Powershell will crash with paginated table views.

    ### Windows Security Warning
    Windows Defender may flag the executable as suspicious. This is a false positive common with Go applications. To resolve:

    1. **Windows Defender**: Click "More info" → "Run anyway"
    2. **Chrome**: Click "Keep" on the download warning
    3. **Add exception**: Add the download folder to Windows Defender exclusions

    The source code is available for inspection, and you can build from source if preferred.

2. Docker
    - Have Docker installed
    - Pull the image:
    ```bash
    docker pull jmsguy/greed-cli
    ```
    - Create directories:
        - **Linux:**
        ```bash
        mkdir -p ~/.config/greed
        ```
        - **Windows:**
        ```powershell
        mkdir "$env:USERPROFILE\.config\greed"
        ```
    
    - Add an alias for easy input:
        
        - **Linux/macOS:**
        ```bash
        alias greed='docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -e HOME=/home/user -v ~/.config/greed:/home/user/.config/greed jmsguy/greed-cli'
        ```
        
        - **Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```powershell
        function greed { docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v "$env:USERPROFILE\.config\greed:/root/.config/greed" jmsguy/greed-cli $args }
        ```

        - Docker flags breakdown:
            - '-it': Run the docker image in an interactive terminal session, for getting input after the original command
            - '-p 8080:8080': Maps the container's port 8080 to host, allowing the CLI to open a temp server to listen for Link callback
            - '--user': Runs docker container as your user instead of root, granting user correct read/write permissions for volume
            - '-v': Mounts a docker volume to the image, allowing for client-side database use and export functionality

        - To make the alias permanent, add it to your shell profile:
            - **Linux/macOS:**
            ```bash
            echo "alias greed='docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -e HOME=/home/user -v ~/.config/greed:/home/user/.config/greed jmsguy/greed-cli'" >> ~/.bashrc
            source ~/.bashrc
            ```

            - **Windows PowerShell:**
            ```powershell
            Add-Content $PROFILE "function greed { docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v `"`$env:USERPROFILE\.config\greed:/root/.config/greed`" jmsguy/greed-cli `$args }"
            . $PROFILE
            ```

    - Run commands!
    ```bash
    greed register ExampleUser
    greed login ExampleUser
    ```

    - **Note for Docker users:** Link opening is not supported in containers. The CLI will display the link for you to copy and paste into your browser.

    go install github.com/jms-guy/greed@latest
