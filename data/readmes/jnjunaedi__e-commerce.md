# 🛍️ E-Commerce System

I designed and developed an e-commerce system using a microservices architecture built with native Go and MySQL, incorporating Clean Architecture principles across all services to ensure testability, modular code readability, and flexibility for future technology transitions. To maximize inter service communication speed, I implemented the gRPC protocol in place of conventional REST APIs. The system features transaction protection via local row locking at the database level, designed to handle extreme traffic spikes and prevent negative stock anomalies during high-volume events such as flash sales. Furthermore, to maintain distributed data consistency even in the event of network failures or server downtime I constructed a robust data synchronization pipeline using the Transactional Outbox pattern, combined with an automated retry mechanism. Developed with a minimalist philosophy that eliminates reliance on external frameworks or heavy ORMs, this project demonstrates a deep mastery of Go’s built-in features to ensure optimal system execution speed.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This system is built using a modern, production-grade technology ecosystem:

*   **Primary Programming Language**: **Golang v1.26.2** (Clean, efficient, and prioritizes pure performance).
*   **API & HTTP Server**: **`net/http`** (Standard Library) & **`go-chi/chi/v5`** for lightweight, high-concurrency routing.
*   **RPC Framework**: **`gRPC`** (`google.golang.org/grpc`) for fast, low-latency cross-service communication.
*   **Message Broker (Event-Driven)**: **Kafka Client** via **`twmb/franz-go`** for feature-complete, high-performance asynchronous event streaming.
*   **Payment Gateway Integration**: **`midtrans/midtrans-go`** as the official API client for managing secure checkout transactions and billing settlement.
*   **Data Storage (Database)**: **MySQL 8.0** as an ACID-compliant transaction storage.
*   **Database Interface**: **`database/sql`** (Standard Library) for native connection pooling and raw SQL execution (utilizing `PrepareCtx`, `BeginTx`, `QueryRowContext`, `QueryContext`, `ExecContext`).
*   **Database Driver**: **`go-sql-driver/mysql`** for native interaction with the MySQL engine.
*   **Data Validation**: **`go-playground/validator/v10`** for secure structural payload and input validation tags.
*   **Image Processing Utility**: **`disintegration/imaging`** for image manipulation and upload management.
*   **Testing Library**: **`Stretchr/Testify`** (`assert` & `mock`) for building isolated unit test architectures [index].

## 🏗️ System Architecture

This project is built using a **Microservices Architecture**, where each independent service strictly implements **Clean Architecture** internally to ensure a decoupled, highly testable, and maintainable codebase. By separating concerns into distinct layers, the core domain logic of each service remains completely independent of external frameworks, databases, and network delivery mechanisms.

---

### 1. Distributed Microservices Ecosystem

The ecosystem is split into domain-specific microservices that communicate asynchronously and synchronously to preserve system resilience:
*   **Auth Service**: Handles user authentication, credential verification, token generation (JWT), and authorization security across the platform.
*   **User Service**: Manages customer profiles, account data structures, shipping addresses, and personal identification records.
*   **Product Service**: Manages the global product catalog, regular inventory updates, and executes high-concurrency Flash Sale stock lock management.
*   **Order Service**: Handles the complete checkout lifecycle, local order processing, idempotency tracking, and local outbox transaction logging.
*   **Payment Service**: Manages interaction with payment gateways, processes billing transactions, and handles dynamic transaction invoices.
*   **Notification Service**: Processes asynchronous customer communications (such as order confirmation emails via Kafka) driven by backend transaction workers.
*   **Inter-Service Communication**: Leverages low-latency **gRPC** for internal synchronous network calls and the **Transactional Outbox Pattern** combined with a message broker for reliable asynchronous events.

---

### 2. Internal Service Layers (Clean Architecture Inside-Out)

Every microservice within this project enforces the exact same layered architecture:

*   **Domain / Entity Layer (Core)**: 
    Contains the fundamental business objects (`Order`, `Product`, `FlashSale`) and strict domain rules. This layer is written in pure Golang, has **zero dependencies** on any other layers or external libraries, and heavily utilizes *value types* instead of pointers to maximize stack allocation.
*   **Use Case / Service Layer**: 
    Orchestrates the specific business logic of the service (`CreateCheckout`, `DeductFlashSaleStock`). It interacts directly with the Domain layer and defines abstract interfaces (ports) for data access or external clients, completely unaware of *how* data is stored or fetched.
*   **Repository / Adapter Layer**: 
    Implements the interfaces defined by the Use Case layer. This is where **`database/sql`** and **`go-sql-driver/mysql`** reside. It executes raw SQL queries, manages local ACID transactions via `db.BeginTx`, and maps relational database rows directly into domain value structures using `rows.Scan()`. Additionally, it heavily utilizes **`PrepareCtx`** to pre-compile SQL statements natively, maximizing execution speed and ensuring full protection against SQL injection during high-volume traffic.
*   **Delivery / Infrastructure Layer (HTTP / gRPC)**: 
    The outermost gate handled by **`net/http`** (for client-facing REST APIs) and **`google.golang.org/grpc`** (for internal inter-service RPC communication). It parses payloads, decodes gRPC requests, runs entry-level validation, triggers the appropriate Use Case, and returns structured network responses.

---

### 3. Data Flow & Distributed Dependency Rule

The fundamental rule of this architecture is that **dependencies only point inwards**. Inner layers know absolutely nothing about outer infrastructure, protocols, or network boundaries.

---

#### A. High-Level Request Flow (Simplified View)
This simplified diagram represents the high-level path a client request takes from the edge gateway down to the persistent database:

---

#### B. Internal Inter-Service Data Flow (Detailed View)
This detailed diagram shows the internal orchestration, local transaction isolation, and asynchronous data consistency across multiple microservices using the Transactional Outbox Pattern:

        GatewayHTTP
        OrderGrpcClient
    end

    subgraph Order Service
        OrderGrpcServer
        OrderUC
        OrderRepo
        OrderDB
    end

    subgraph Product Service
        ProductgRPC
        ProductUC
        ProductRepo
        ProductDB
    end

```
1.  **Ingress Request**: The client hits the API Gateway via HTTP, which parses the input into an immutable value struct and maps it to a gRPC client request.
2.  **Local Isolation**: The Order Use Case coordinates internal business rules and commits the order alongside an outbox payload safely inside a local MySQL transaction block.
3.  **Distributed Consistency**: The Outbox Worker polls the local transaction table asynchronously and synchronizes the state by invoking the downstream Product Service via gRPC to safely reduce physical catalog inventory.


#### C. Memory & Performance Design Principles

To achieve optimal performance and minimize Garbage Collector (GC) overhead, the architecture enforces these structural constraints:

*   **Pure Pass-by-Value**: Data structures are passed across layer boundaries as explicit copies (`Product` instead of `*Product`) whenever feasible. This keeps the data scoped to the function execution block, ensuring it stays allocated on the **Stack** and prevents *Escape Analysis* from moving it to the **Heap**.
*   **Boundary Decoupling via Interfaces**: Use Cases rely strictly on interfaces to communicate with Repositories. This decoupling allows **`Stretchr/Testify`** to inject lightweight mocks during unit testing, enabling full test coverage without needing network or database resources.
*   **Explicit Resource Management**: Database rows and HTTP request bodies are closed immediately after consumption using native Go defer statements (`rows.Close()`, `r.Body.Close()`), ensuring deterministic memory cleanup without relying on the GC to release system descriptors.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap & Architecture Evolution (Conclusion)

Although the current architecture successfully mitigates race conditions under high-concurrency scenarios through the use of Local Row-Level Locking and ensures data availability via the Transactional Outbox Pattern, this distributed system is designed to evolve. The following points are prioritized for long-term future development:

### 1. Distributed Transactions: Saga Pattern (Orchestration-Based)
*   **Context:** Currently, the system isolates failures locally using database transactional rollbacks. As the ecosystem grows, complex multi-service workflows (such as matching a successful `Order` with a third-party `Payment` gateway deduction and an inventory commit in the `Product Service`) will require cross-network atomicity.
*   **Evolution:** We plan to implement an **Orchestration-Based Saga Pattern**. A centralized coordinator inside the `Order Service` will manage successful steps via gRPC and fire explicit **Compensating Transactions** (such as releasing locked stock or triggering a refund) if a downstream payment execution fails mid-way.

### 2. Distributed Tracing & Observability
*   **Context:** Tracking down performance bottlenecks or hidden heap allocations across multiple network hops (Gateway -> gRPC Client -> gRPC Server -> MySQL) can become difficult using raw local terminal logs.
*   **Evolution:** Integrating **OpenTelemetry** linked with **Jaeger** or **Grafana Tempo**. By propagating a unique `trace_id` inside the gRPC Metadata Context, we can visually map the exact latency and execution profile of a user’s checkout request across all network microservice boundaries in real-time.

### 3. Distributed Cache Layer (Redis Cluster Deployment)
*   **Context:** The current `flash_sale_caches` table resides directly inside the relational `order_db` MySQL storage. While it protects the main transaction tables, a relational database disk I/O still has structural throughput limitations under millions of requests.
*   **Evolution:** Introducing a distributed in-memory **Redis Cluster** equipped with **Lua Scripting** to handle atomic `DECRBY` check-and-deduct operations for Flash Sales. MySQL will then purely receive finalized, asynchronous bulk inserts from the Outbox Worker, pushing the system's concurrency boundaries even further.

---
### 🏁 Conclusion
This E-Commerce Order Service demonstrates that **native engineering** without heavy third-party framework abstraction provides clean code transparency and effective memory optimization. By pushing data structures to the **Stack** and securing logical constraints via **Outbox Workers and database row locks**, this system stands as a reliable layout for predictable, low-latency, and production-ready distributed system architectures.
