# OBSYD — the European electricity desk

**One desk for the European power grid: day-ahead prices, load & residual load and generation mix across 38 bidding zones — hourly everywhere, 15-minute day-ahead where SDAC trades it (35 of 38 zones; CH and IE-SEM are hourly-only, and GB has no day-ahead auction feed at all — it carries Elexon's half-hourly MID index instead) — plus a live generation-outage board (where zones publish outages), country-level cross-border flows, reservoir levels for the 15 hydro zones, forecasts and the gas that fuels the marginal price — from the official record (ENTSO-E, Elexon, GIE) and Fraunhofer Energy-Charts.**

OBSYD turns the free, official European power record into one legible, auditable desk for Europe’s bidding zones. An all-zones overview leads to per-zone detail: day-ahead price (hourly and as-traded 15-minute, with negative-price flags), residual load & Dunkelflaute, generation mix, spark spread, generation outages (revision-aware), cross-border flows, and the day-ahead load/residual **forecast** with its measured error. A live anomaly radar flags forced outages, negative prices, Dunkelflaute and gas-balance moves the moment they deviate from each zone's own history — every number arriving with a plain-language "what this means" and a "vs normal" reference. Every rule and threshold runs in code you can read on GitHub. No black-box ML, no proprietary scoring, no "trust us".

OBSYD is **not** a Montel, EPEX or Bloomberg replacement — no intraday or settlement-grade pricing. And it is deliberately **power-only**: non-power commodities (oil flows, shipping/AIS, metals) live in a separate sibling project. It is a way to stop wiring up a dozen ENTSO-E queries by hand and read the European power situation from the official record, with the signal code open for audit.

## Cloud hosting or self-host

OBSYD is open source under AGPL-3.0 and **completely free** — there is no paid tier. Two ways to use it:

- **Self-host (free):** Clone the repo, plug in your own API keys, run on your own infra. Full feature set, no usage limits.
- **Cloud (free):** Use the hosted version at [obsyd.dev](https://obsyd.dev). The full power desk, Europe map, anomaly radar, and data explorer need no account. Personal features (your watchlist, custom alerts, daily brief) just need a free magic-link login — no card, no payment.

## Features

- **38 European bidding zones** — 27 EU bidding zones + 11 more (CH, NO1–5, SE1–4, and GB via Elexon/BMRS — the first non-ENTSO-E zone); the Baltic zones (EE/LV/LT) are not yet enabled (config-only via `ENABLED_ZONES`)
- **Hourly resolution, 5 years of history** — day-ahead price, actual load, generation by fuel, residual load and forecasts per zone; imbalance prices for 36 of 38 zones (history depth varies by zone — the deepest imbalance series start in 2021)
- **Imbalance prices** — 15-min settlement prices → hourly, per zone (DE-LU included: the combined reBAP is served under the country EIC)
- **Installed capacity** — generation capacity by fuel per zone (ENTSO-E A68), annual context
- **Near-real-time** — actual load/generation/flows refresh every 30 min; today fills in hour by hour (the honest ~1h ceiling of free ENTSO-E data)
- **Day-ahead forecasts** — load, wind/solar and residual-load forecast vs actual, incl. tomorrow's hourly residual curve
- **Cross-border flows** — physical net flows between zones (Fraunhofer Energy-Charts, CC BY 4.0)
- **Gas fuel side** — EU storage (AGSI), LNG send-out (ALSI), ENTSOG flows, power-burn, demand model and the residual balance signal
- **Spark spread** — CCGT margin per zone (power − gas × heat-rate)
- **Anomaly radar** — negative prices, Dunkelflaute and gas-balance moves flagged vs each zone's own history (descriptive, not a forecast)
- **Europe map** — bidding-zone choropleth by day-ahead price or grid state
- **Public data API + Python client** — `GET /api/v1/series` (JSON/CSV/**Parquet** export), catalog, zones, capacity, meta and an honest coverage/status endpoint — see [docs/API.md](docs/API.md); pip-installable client in [clients/python](clients/python)
- **Interactive series explorer** — query any series/zone/range, **compare two zones** on one chart, download as CSV
- **Chart-Builder** (`/builder`) — the series explorer as its own full-screen, shareable-URL page
- **Embeddable widgets + badges** — self-refreshing `/embed/<zone>/<metric>` iframes (price/genmix/load) and `/api/v1/badge` SVG status images for READMEs/dashboards
- **Activated balancing energy** — aFRR/mFRR activation prices per zone; volumes are not served by ENTSO-E's API (A83 fails structurally for every zone tried) — prices only
- **German balancing-capacity prices** — FCR/aFRR/mFRR procured-capacity tenders (DE-LU LFC block)
- **Transmission outages** — cross-border line/PST unavailability (ENTSO-E A78) alongside the generation-outage board (A77)
- **Live today-view** — near-real-time load, generation mix and day-ahead price for the current day, refreshing intraday

## Public data API

A free, versioned HTTP API over the canonical power record: `GET /api/v1/series?series=&zone=&start=&end=&resolution=&format=json|csv|parquet`, plus `/api/v1/{zones,catalog,capacity,meta,status}`. Interactive docs at `/api/docs`. Full reference: **[docs/API.md](docs/API.md)**.

## Roadmap / deferred

Shipped since the first cut: imbalance prices (A85, incl. Germany's reBAP via the country EIC),
installed capacity (A68), hydro reservoirs (A72), the generation-outage board (A77,
revision-aware), hourly cross-border flows, all-time records, Parquet export, the
pip-installable Python client, the non-EU neighbour zones (CH, NO, SE), and an
estimated hourly CO₂ intensity per zone (`co2.intensity.lifecycle`/`.direct` —
published emission factors over the generation mix; methodology and every factor's
source in `backend/power/co2.py`).

Investigated and deliberately deferred (with their blockers), not silently dropped:

- **Great Britain** — left ENTSO-E's day-ahead publication post-Brexit (A44 returns an Acknowledgement); not addable as a priced zone from the free feed.
- **Curtailment / redispatch / reserves** (ENTSO-E A63/A80/…) — fragmented, border-specific congestion-management data, not a clean pan-EU series.
- **Continuous intraday prices** — no clean, free, redistributable source.
- **`power_hourly` retention** — the canonical store grows unbounded by design (all-time records need all-time history). If disk ever becomes the constraint, the 15-min `.qh` series are the thinning candidates (raw quarter-hours matter most recently; the hourly series keeps the long history) — documented option, deliberately not built.

## Tech Stack

**Backend:** FastAPI · SQLAlchemy · SQLite (WAL mode) · APScheduler · Python 3.11+
**Frontend:** React 19 · Vite · Tailwind CSS 4 · deck.gl · Recharts · Lightweight Charts
**Deployment:** Ubuntu 24.04 · systemd · a reverse proxy for TLS. Self-host: the included `deploy/setup-vps.sh` provisions a standalone nginx + Let's Encrypt (certbot). Hosted obsyd.dev runs behind Caddy (shared with another app) via `deploy/install-caddy-integration.sh` — use whichever proxy you prefer.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jo20ow/obsyd.git
cd obsyd

# Backend
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env    # Fill in API keys (see table below)

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

# Run the backend — API + interactive docs at http://localhost:8000/api/docs
uvicorn backend.main:app
```

`uvicorn` serves the **API only** on :8000 (Swagger UI at `/api/docs`). For the UI, either run the Vite dev server — `cd frontend && npm run dev`, which serves the app at http://localhost:5173 and proxies `/api` to :8000 — or serve the built `frontend/dist` behind a reverse proxy (what the `deploy/` scripts set up).

## API Keys

All keys are free. **For the electricity+gas desk the two that matter are `ENTSOE_API_TOKEN`
(ENTSO-E day-ahead/load/generation/forecasts — request "Restful API" access at
transparency.entsoe.eu) and `GIE_API_KEY` (AGSI storage + ALSI LNG).** Cross-border flows
(Energy-Charts) need no key. `ENABLED_ZONES` (comma list, e.g. `DE_LU,FR,NL,BE,AT,ES,PT,PL,CZ`)
selects the zones. Also set `SECRET_KEY` and `JWT_SECRET`. The keys below are legacy/optional —
they power the dormant non-power modules being split into a sibling project.

## Architecture

FastAPI backend with APScheduler running the collection jobs (nightly deep ingest, 30-min intraday refresh for load/generation/flows, 6h outage refresh plus an hourly offline-capacity snapshot, 5-min anomaly evaluation). Everything lands in a canonical hourly store (`power_hourly`, SQLite WAL, single writer) plus per-domain tables; every raw API payload is disk-cached so recalibrations never re-hit the sources. The anomaly radar runs pure, descriptive detectors against persisted state every 5 minutes.

The React frontend renders the bidding-zone map with deck.gl (real zone geometry, © Electricity Maps contributors), time series with Recharts, and follows a monospace terminal aesthetic. Dormant non-power modules (AIS map, chokepoints, metals, sentiment) remain in the tree for extraction into a sibling project and are lazy-loaded out of the main bundle.

## Known Limitations

- **~1h publication lag** — actual load/generation ride ENTSO-E's free publication cycle; "near-real-time" honestly means the last hour or two fills in as published.
- **A75 coverage varies by zone** — some zones under-report generation (notably NL); renewable-share metrics are suppressed rather than shown when coverage is too low to trust.
- **Energy-Charts flows are country-level** — Nordic/Italian sub-zones have no per-sub-zone border series.
- **yfinance is unofficial** — the TTF leg of the spark spread may lag or temporarily fail.
- **SQLite single-writer** — sufficient for moderate traffic; not suitable for high-concurrency deployments.
- **IE_SEM actual load ends 2025-10-23 (source-side)** — ENTSO-E stopped publishing actual load for the SEM bidding zone *and* for the Northern Ireland control area at the same instant (2025-10-23 11:00 UTC); only the Republic-only EirGrid series continues, which is ~1 GW short of the island total. OBSYD serves the all-island history up to the cutoff (stitched from the two control-area series, spot-verified against the zone series — three consecutive half-hours plus seam checks) and shows the zone's load as honestly stale since — no Republic-only substitute, no guess.
- **Data revisions** — recent windows are deliberately re-fetched with overwrite (the nightly reverify), so recently served values can be restated when ENTSO-E revises its own publication. Series responses reflect the store at request time; there is no historical-snapshot pinning. If you need bit-identical reproducibility, archive what you pulled (and record the pull date), or self-host a frozen copy.
