**Vayu** is Sanskrit for *wind*: the force that moves everything and belongs to
no one. Point a domain at one server and run one command. You get a website, a
blog at `blog.`, your own mail at `mail.` and private chat at `talk.`, each
with a certificate issued and renewed for you. It all runs as one Go binary with
one SQLite database, sends no telemetry, and has no SaaS behind it. You own
the content, the mailbox, the data and the machine.

## Products

| | What it is | Read more |
|---|---|---|
| **Website** | A business site from eleven templates, edited with a live preview. You choose whether the site or the blog sits at the root. | [A website is a document](docs/adr/ADR-0161-a-website-is-a-document.md) |
| **Blog** | A block editor with lossless Markdown and HTML modes, focus mode, typewriter scrolling, footnotes, diagrams and version diffs.

## VayuOS Still Air

**Still Air** is the design VayuOS is built in, and the name it ships under: a
console that is calm, precise and quiet, where the work is the loudest thing on
the screen.

- **Content first.** Each app opens on what you came for. Help waits behind a
  small ⓘ instead of standing in front of the page.
- **One grammar.** Every page is built from the same few parts: hairline
  sections, rows with their control on the right, figures and disclosures.
- **Colour that means something.** The accent marks the one thing you act on.
  Green, amber and red appear only when a fact calls for them.
- **Two schemes, drawn separately.** Graphite (dark) and Paper (light), each
  with its own tokens.
- **The machine's state is always visible.** The system bar shows the
  operating mode and the world (Clearnet or Tor) on every page. `⌘K` finds any
  page and runs any command.
- **Nothing hidden behind a framework.** It is server-rendered Go and HTMX,
  with one stylesheet and one icon set, served from your origin under a strict
  CSP. It installs as an app, and its service worker caches nothing.
- **Held by tests, not taste.**
  - A design lint walks every console page in a browser and fails on any value
    off the token scale.
  - Twelve surfaces are compared with approved baselines in both schemes.
  - Every text colour is held to WCAG AA against its surface.
  - Lighthouse budgets hold four console pages.

[How the console is built](docs/ADMIN-UI.md)

## Quick start

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johalputt/vayupress/main/scripts/deploy-vayupress.sh | bash
```

The installer sets up the binary, the systemd service, Nginx and Let's Encrypt.
It creates an `admin@yourdomain` account with a random password, saved to a
root-only file, and asks for a new password at first sign-in.

Point the apex and `www` at the server for a website. Each subdomain below adds
one product and can be added later:

| Name | CDN proxy | Adds |
|---|---|---|
| `mail.` | **off** | VayuMail |
| `openpgpkey.` | **off** | Automatic PGP key discovery |
| `talk.` | **off** | VayuTalk |
| `mcp.` | **off** | VayuMCP |
| `api.` | **off** | VayuAPI, without challenges |

These must be *DNS only*: mail servers, GnuPG and MCP clients cannot answer a
CDN's bot challenge, and `openpgpkey.` fails silently behind one. A single
8 GB / 4 vCPU / 50 GB VPS runs everything.

September 2026, the home page and an article (`/vayupress-for-privacy`); the
article's 97 on desktop is small touch targets, a finding queued for a fix. Time to
first byte from Iowa was 156–161 ms in Cloudflare Synthetic Monitoring on
27–28 July 2026. There is no third-party script to block on.

## Security

- **Strict CSP:** no `unsafe-inline` or `unsafe-eval`, and a nonce on every
  request. Every asset is served from your origin.
- **Encrypted at rest:** PGP private keys and stored secrets use AES-256-GCM.
  Backups are one AES-256-GCM archive, keyed with Argon2id.
- **Plugins:** out-of-process plugins run under seccomp and namespaces, with
  capabilities denied by default.
- **Records:** releases are signed, and there is a write-once audit log.

A commit reaches `main` only through fifteen required CI jobs, including race
tests, a cross-compile matrix and a byte-for-byte reproducible build.

## Why this exists

I built VayuPress for myself first. Self-hosting hurt, and the pain was not one
dramatic thing but an accumulation: a mail server that needed a weekend and
then broke, six services that each wanted their own database, proxy block,
certificate and upgrade path. That pain is not a law of nature. Nobody had
bothered to make the sovereign option as easy as the rented one. So I made one
binary, one process and one command, and I do not want anyone else to feel what
I felt.

**VayuPress is free for everyone, forever: individuals and large companies
alike.**
- It will not be sold, relicensed, or made source-available.
- There is no paid tier, and no feature is held back.
- The funding goal exists only so the work can become full-time; it is not a
  condition on anything.
