Suchi combines SQLite, content-addressed storage, a Svelte interface, and an
integration-friendly HTTP API. It needs no database server, queue, cache, or
telemetry service.

The content-addressed store keeps immutable original and derived bytes under
their SHA-256 digest. Identical bytes can share one stored object, retries do not
create another copy, and database rows can retain stable content while filing
paths are rebuilt as views. It is not encryption or an access-control boundary;
SQLite metadata and the API still decide who can see each document.

Current source line: **v0.1.0**. Back up before upgrades, test restore for
critical archives, and follow the documented stable-v1 compatibility policy.

- Reproducible size and startup measurements live under
  [`hack/bench/latest-published/`](hack/bench/latest-published/).
- No built-in outbound connection is made until an operator enables or uses an
  integration. Operator scripts are outside Suchi's egress inventory.
- Static, `CGO_ENABLED=0` Go binary with multi-user ACLs and scoped tokens.
- AGPL-3.0.

## Capabilities

- PDF and image OCR, thumbnails, barcodes, encrypted PDFs, and ZUGFeRD invoices.
- EPUB, Office, OpenDocument, RTF, CSV, DjVu, HEIC/HEIF, EML, and Outlook MSG.
- Full-text search, Johnny.Decimal filing, custom fields, saved views, and
  rendered filesystem views.
- Import-introduced filing systems with permanent codes, direct membership plus
  document ACLs, and `SYS.AC.documentID` addresses using existing global IDs.
  Unprefixed archives keep their existing UI and paths until first prefixed Apply.
- Browser uploads, watched folders, IMAP intake, portable import/export, and
  versioned documents.
- Automations, human approval workflows, selective rescans, and optional
  OpenAI-compatible classification, grounded archive research, and source-backed
  date intelligence with Calendar. High-confidence suggestions apply by default;
  review-first mode sends inferred changes to Approvals instead.
- Groups, object ACLs, OIDC, share links, audit events, backups, and restore
  tooling.
- Svelte SPA, Android/iOS Suchi Companion, a documented scoped HTTP
  API, and MCP over stdio or HTTP.

The [feature comparison](docs/comparison.mdx) and
[architecture](docs/architecture.mdx) describe the detailed scope and
tradeoffs.

## Quick Start

The versioned standard image is a convenient local evaluation starting point:

```sh
docker volume create suchi-data
docker run -d --name suchi --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 \
  -e PUBLIC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 \
  -v suchi-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/johnnybravo-xyz/suchi:v0.1.0
docker logs suchi 2>&1 | grep token_minted
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, enter the one-time setup token, and create the
first admin account. The token expires after 24 hours; attempting to use an
expired token writes a replacement to the server log. A minimal
[`compose.yaml`](compose.yaml) is also provided
for operators who want editable mounts, networks, and image pins. See [Getting
started](docs/getting-started.mdx) for direct binary, reverse-proxy, NAS, and
production deployment paths.

After creating the administrator, choose a filing tree in **Settings > Archive
configuration > Filing tree**. This is the only required archive setup step;
the reminder remains until a preset, imported tree, or explicit Blank choice is
saved.

This quick start is bound to loopback and pins the v0.1.0 image. A production
server, including one reached by the mobile app, must use HTTPS and pin the
selected release by its published image digest.

## Images

- `v0.1.0` / `latest`: Alpine. Supports all listed formats and indexes scanned
  PDFs with Tesseract.
- `v0.1.0-full` / `latest-full`: Debian. Adds OCRmyPDF so downloaded scanned
  PDFs can retain a searchable text layer.

Both images include anydoc, DjVu, HEIC/HEIF, and Outlook MSG support. The full
image changes only the scanned-PDF archive behavior. See [Supported file
types](docs/formats.mdx) for the exact routing and bare-metal dependencies.

## Development

The workspace requires Go 1.27.0 or newer; `plugin-api` remains compatible
with Go 1.24.
SPA and documentation development require Bun.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/johnnybravo-xyz/suchi.git
cd suchi
make install-hooks
make check
make run
```

`make run` uses `/tmp/suchi-dev` and listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
Useful verification commands:

```sh
make test
make lint
make ui-check
make smoke
make smoke-ingest
./hack/smoke-anydoc-docx.sh
make smoke-mail
```

The `ci` workflow runs formatting, vet, tests, static analysis, and the SPA
build. The `smoke` workflow boots both images and verifies real PDF
OCR and Outlook MSG ingestion.

## Repository

```text
plugin-api/   shared extension interfaces and types
core/         API, database, ingest pipeline, jobs, auth, and embedded UI
plugins/      local auth, OIDC, and LLM classifier modules
distro/       importable app assembly and shipped suchi / suchi-mcp entry points
ui/           Svelte SPA source
deploy/       self-hosting templates and mail intake sidecar
docs/         published documentation source
hack/         fixtures, benchmarks, smoke tests, and developer tools
```

The root module contains the shipped application; `plugin-api` stays separate
for external plugins and the utilities under `hack/` keep isolated dependency
graphs. The empty `ui` module keeps Go tooling out of frontend dependencies.
`make build` uses Bun to install locked frontend dependencies, generates the
ignored SPA bundle, and produces `dist/suchi`; `suchi doctor` inventories
configured egress, pipeline tools, schema and taxonomy state, data-directory
writability, and selected job, backup, audit, upload-limit, and CAS indicators.
