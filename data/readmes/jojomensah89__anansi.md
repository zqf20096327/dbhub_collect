# 🕸️ Anansi

**Open-source, local-first web memory you control, for people and AI agents.**

Anansi captures X bookmarks, Reddit saves, GitHub stars, and web pages or Chrome bookmarks from the browser sessions you already use, stores them in a searchable library you control, and lets compatible AI agents search and retrieve those saved references through eight read-focused MCP tools.

## ✨ What Anansi does

Anansi does the following:

- 📥 **Captures supported saves** — X bookmarks, Reddit saves, GitHub stars, and Web pages
- 🔖 **Mirrors Chrome bookmarks** — optional Chrome bookmark capture is stored as Web items
- 🔍 **Searches the library** — saved text, authors, sources, tags, and recency
- 💾 **Keeps the library under your control** — run locally with SQLite or use the repository's own-account Cloudflare deployment path
- 🧠 **Exposes saved references to agents** — eight read-focused MCP tools search, retrieve, list, and summarize the library
- 🔁 **Recovers from interruptions** — queued capture, retry, and resumable imports survive restarts and rate limits
- 🔒 **Uses bounded access** — explicit capture, bearer-auth ingest, no `<all_urls>`, no `cookies` permission, and no GitHub OAuth or PAT

## 📥 Supported Sources

> GitHub capture is extension-only. It reads the signed-in GitHub stars pages in your browser, includes repositories visible to that account — including visible private repositories — and needs no GitHub OAuth or personal access token.

Live saves are delivered immediately. Anansi also performs one daily incremental catch-up for sources that support history import, covering changes made while Chrome or the extension was inactive. GitHub and Reddit import via background session requests without opening tabs. Anansi closes only tabs it created. If a provider session is missing, the popup asks you to sign in — use the explicit **Sign in** button, then retry. Network and rate-limit failures keep the resume cursor. TikTok capture is paused in the shipped extension and web UI while its authenticated path is repaired; old rows are retained for a deliberate future re-enable.

## 🚀 Quickstart

Two paths, same library: run it locally or host it in your own Cloudflare account.

### A. Local

Requirements: [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.3+, Chromium-based browser. SQLite DB is created automatically.

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set three independent server secrets:
#   LIBRARY_TOKEN, INGEST_TOKEN, MCP_TOKEN
# Then mirror INGEST_TOKEN into ANANSI_EXTENSION_INGEST_TOKEN.
# Keep ANANSI_EXTENSION_ORIGIN=http://127.0.0.1:3001
bun run dev:local
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3001`. This is the one public local origin: the library is at `/`, JSON endpoints are under `/api`, and MCP is at `/mcp`. The launcher creates `data/anansi.db` on first start and prints the local library sign-in token.

An internal Bun process listens on port `8788` because Vite's Node runtime cannot load Bun's SQLite implementation. Vite proxies `/api` and `/mcp` to it. Do not enter or configure port `8788` anywhere.

Build the private extension in a second terminal:

```bash
bun run --cwd apps/extension build
```

Open `chrome://extensions` → enable **Developer mode** → **Load unpacked** → choose `apps/extension/.output/chrome-mv3`. The extension connects immediately; there is no server or token field in the popup.

> The configured build contains your ingest credential. This is appropriate for your private, load-unpacked extension, but anyone with the artifact can extract it. Never upload this configured build to a public extension store or share it.

GitHub first import: sign in to GitHub in the same browser profile → popup → **Import** beside GitHub. It walks your stars pages in the worker (no tabs open), persists the pagination cursor, and resumes after interruptions. Unstarring hides from current-star view without deleting history; re-starring restores it.

### Developer-only local AI search and tagging

The hosted path uses the existing Cloudflare Workers AI and Vectorize bindings;
hosted users only enable Semantic search in Settings. A local model is not
required for installation, `bun run dev:local`, or deployment.

For the local web UI, install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) (0.11.10+
for EmbeddingGemma). A clone-to-working semantic setup is:

1. Confirm the tools are available:

   ```powershell
   bun --version       # 1.3+
   ollama --version    # 0.11.10+ for EmbeddingGemma
   ollama list
   ```

2. Install Anansi's dependencies and create the local environment if you have
   not already done so:

   ```powershell
   bun install
   Copy-Item .env.example .env
   ```

   Keep the existing local authentication values in `.env`; Ollama settings
   are server-side values and must not be renamed to `VITE_*` variables.

3. Pull the embedding model once:

   ```powershell
   ollama pull embeddinggemma
   ```

4. Make sure the Ollama daemon is running. The Ollama desktop app normally
   does this; if it is not running, start it with `ollama serve` in another
   terminal.

5. Start Anansi:

   ```powershell
   bun run dev:local
   ```

   Open `http://127.0.0.1:3001`, go to **Settings**, and enable **AI semantic
   search** or **Automatic tags**. Semantic search uses `embeddinggemma`; tags
   use the configured `OLLAMA_TAG_MODEL` (default
   `qwen3:4b-instruct-2507-q4_K_M`).

6. Build and load the extension so you can import real bookmarks:

   ```powershell
   bun run --cwd apps/extension build
   ```

   In `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**, choose **Load unpacked**,
   and select `apps/extension/.output/chrome-mv3`. Sign in to a supported source
   and import a few bookmarks. Then search using a concept rather than an exact
   keyword. Anansi calls Ollama on `http://127.0.0.1:11434` from the local server
   and stores vectors in the ignored SQLite sidecar at
   `data/semantic/ollama.sqlite`. New bookmarks are saved and keyword-searchable
   immediately; semantic indexing catches up in the background. If Ollama is
   stopped or the model is missing, the UI says so and continues with BM25
   keyword results. Tagging also runs in the background and never blocks a save.

   The extension is optional if the clone already contains library data or you
   only want to run the synthetic smoke test; it is required to capture new
   browser bookmarks.

Local keyword search remains available without Ollama. It uses SQLite FTS5 with
BM25 ranking: terms are quoted and implicitly ANDed, English stemming is
enabled, a trailing `*` performs prefix matching, quoted text is a phrase, and
misspellings are not fuzzy-matched. Semantic search adds an optional vector
candidate set and keeps the keyword page when the local index is warming or
unavailable.

Before using private bookmarks, validate the complete local path with synthetic
data:

```powershell
bun run semantic:ollama
bun run ai:tagging:ollama
bun run e2e:local
```

The check should report an observed dimension (768 for the default model) and
`"expectedSemanticOnlyMatch": true`. This proves the local provider, sidecar,
hybrid ranking, and filtering path; it does not prove a hosted Cloudflare
deployment or MCP/CLI semantic search. `bun run e2e:local` is the stronger
opt-in local acceptance: it uses a temporary SQLite database to exercise
authenticated ingest/idempotency, Ollama tagging and embeddings, FTS5, the
semantic API, extension configuration, and HTTP plus stdio MCP. These commands
never use private captures or Cloudflare credentials.

Change `OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_MODEL` in `.env` to try `nomic-embed-text` (smaller,
English-focused) or `nomic-embed-text-v2-moe` (larger, multilingual) instead;
run `ollama pull <model>` before restarting, and changing models creates a
fresh local index generation. The
existing `bun run semantic:local` Transformers.js smoke remains available for
offline contract testing only. The remote Workers AI/Vectorize check is
separate and documented in
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-07-alchemy-semantic-smoke-runbook.md`.

To force a rebuild, stop the local server and remove only the sidecar (the
canonical library database is separate), then start Anansi again:

```powershell
Remove-Item -LiteralPath .\data\semantic\ollama.sqlite
bun run dev:local
```

Common fixes:

- **“Ollama is unavailable”** — run `ollama list`, start `ollama serve`, and
  retry the search. BM25 remains available while Ollama is down.
- **Model not found** — run `ollama pull embeddinggemma`, or make
  `OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_MODEL` match a model shown by `ollama list`.
- **Automatic tags** — run `ollama pull qwen3:4b-instruct-2507-q4_K_M`, or make
  `OLLAMA_TAG_MODEL` match a text-generation model shown by `ollama list`.
- **Index warming** — leave the local server running; jobs are processed in the
  background. A model change or sidecar removal intentionally starts a fresh
  generation.
- **Remote Ollama URL** — this is an explicit developer override; Anansi prints
  a warning because bookmark text will leave the machine. The default is
  loopback.

### B. Cloudflare — one-click self-hosting

Use the **Deploy to Cloudflare** button at the top of this README. Cloudflare
copies this public GitHub repository into your account, provisions the Worker
resources declared in [`wrangler.jsonc`](./wrangler.jsonc), and builds and
deploys the app with Workers Builds. Future pushes to the connected repository
can trigger builds and deployments. Cloudflare requires the source repository
to be public for this button flow.

The root build targets the web Worker; the browser extension remains a separate
local build. Keep the project root at the repository root because the Worker
build uses shared Bun workspace packages. See Cloudflare's [Deploy to Cloudflare
button documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/deploy-buttons/)
for the button flow and its repository requirements. D1 migration files in
`packages/db/drizzle` are the canonical schema history. Never use `db:push`:
the FTS5 virtual table and triggers require the SQL migration path.

The hosted library uses new D1 and R2 resources in your Cloudflare account.
Deploying does not copy an existing local `data/anansi.db` or `data/media`
directory; the first hosted library starts empty. Keep the local copy as a
backup if you need those captures, because this deployment path does not
include a local-to-cloud import.

In Cloudflare's deploy form, set the Vectorize index to **384 dimensions** and
the **cosine** metric. Anansi's default hosted embedding model,
`@cf/baai/bge-small-en-v1.5`, returns 384-dimensional vectors. The Deploy form
does not infer these fixed index settings from Wrangler, so this is a required
resource-setup value; using a different dimension or metric will break semantic
search. The model and Vectorize index are only used after semantic search is
enabled in Settings.

During setup, enter three independent secrets when Cloudflare prompts for them:

- `LIBRARY_TOKEN` — sign in to the hosted library.
- `INGEST_TOKEN` — authenticate extension captures.
- `MCP_TOKEN` — authenticate MCP clients at `/mcp`.

Generate each with `openssl rand -hex 32`. The app remains closed to each
surface when its secret is absent. Both Cloudflare AI features start off; enable
Semantic search or Automatic tags from `/settings` only when you want to use
your account's AI quota.

#### Hosted semantic search

Hosted semantic search is off until you enable it in Settings. Before the first
backfill, Anansi shows the number of saved items and chunks and asks you to
confirm. Captures continue while indexing runs in the background. You can pause
indexing without removing the vectors already in use, or turn semantic search
off to remove hosted chunk text from D1 and queue its Vectorize vectors for
retryable deletion.

Long captures are split at paragraph and sentence boundaries into chunks of up
to 1,800 characters, with 180 characters of overlap. D1 stores the normalized
title/capture-text chunks, offsets, hashes, and model/chunker generation;
Vectorize stores the corresponding vectors under stable IDs. Search combines
keyword and vector candidates, applies the same library filters, collapses
chunk matches to one saved item, and shows the best-matching chunk excerpt.
MCP search remains keyword/BM25.

Hosted indexing and query embeddings share a per-library monthly cap of 10,000
app credits by default. One credit counts each started 1,000 characters sent in
an embedding input. Credits track workload; they are not a provider-bill estimate.
At the cap, Anansi sends no more embedding requests; captures still save, and
search requests that cannot be embedded fall back to keyword results. You can
change the cap in Settings. Local Ollama search does not use hosted credits.

After the first successful deploy, open the Worker project’s **Settings → Build
→ Build Variables and Secrets** and add `BUN_VERSION=1.3.1` for subsequent
builds. The first button build uses Cloudflare's default Bun version and must
pass the clean-account acceptance check before this button is announced as
ready.

After deployment returns `https://<worker>.workers.dev`:

1. Open the URL and sign in with `LIBRARY_TOKEN`.
2. Set `ANANSI_EXTENSION_ORIGIN` to the Worker URL and
   `ANANSI_EXTENSION_INGEST_TOKEN` to the same value as `INGEST_TOKEN` in your
   local `.env`.
3. Build the extension separately with `bun run --cwd apps/extension build`
   and load `apps/extension/.output/chrome-mv3` from `chrome://extensions`.
4. Sign into each provider in the same Chrome profile before its first import.
5. Add the Worker URL and `MCP_TOKEN` to any remote MCP client you want to use.

The Worker is the only public origin: the library is `/`, the API is `/api/*`,
and MCP is `/mcp`. New schema changes still start with `packages/db/src/schema.ts`
and `bun run db:generate`; review and commit the new SQL migration, then push
to the connected repository. Workers Builds applies only pending D1 migrations
before publishing the Worker.

#### Existing Alchemy installations

Wrangler becomes the deploy and migration owner after a one-time handoff. Edit
`wrangler.jsonc` to point at the existing Worker name, D1 database ID, R2
bucket, and Vectorize index. Keep the bindings `DB`, `MEDIA`, `AI`, and
`VECTORIZE` unchanged.

Back up D1 and inspect the existing migration ledger before changing it. Compare
the result of this query with the SQL filenames in `packages/db/drizzle`:

```powershell
bun run wrangler d1 export DB --remote --output anansi-before-wrangler.sql
bun run wrangler d1 execute DB --remote --command "SELECT name FROM __alchemy_migrations ORDER BY id"
```

If every applied name matches a repository migration filename, copy those
already-applied names into Wrangler's ledger. This baseline script does not
run schema SQL or alter application data:

```powershell
bun run wrangler d1 execute DB --remote --file scripts/alchemy-to-wrangler-baseline.sql
bun run wrangler d1 migrations list DB --remote
```

The migration list should show no already-applied migration pending. Then run
`bun run build` and `bun run deploy`; Wrangler applies only future migrations
and updates the existing Worker and bindings. If the names differ, stop and
reconcile the migration history before deploying. Keep the backup until the app
and saved data are verified. Do not run the old Alchemy `destroy` command
during this handoff.

#### Manual deploy and local development

The one-click button is the easiest first install. For a manual deployment,
configure the resources and secrets in your Cloudflare account, then run:

```powershell
bun run cf-typegen
bun run build
bun run deploy
```

`bun run deploy` applies remote D1 migrations and publishes the Worker output
created by `bun run build`.
Local development remains SQLite-backed through `bun run dev:local`; Wrangler's
Cloudflare Vite build uses a separate config and does not change that workflow.

## 🧠 Ask it from your agent (MCP)

Streamable HTTP MCP server at `http://127.0.0.1:3001/mcp` locally (or `https://<worker>.workers.dev/mcp` when hosted). Bearer auth with `MCP_TOKEN` when configured. The web `/mcp` setup page uses a literal `<YOUR_MCP_TOKEN>` placeholder and never prints the secret.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `search_saved` | Search saved items, ranked excerpts + source URLs |
| `get_saved` | One item with text, links, media, thread context |
| `get_saved_many` | A bounded shortlist of items in requested order |
| `list_saved` | Browse saved items with filters and a cursor |
| `list_recent_saves` | Newest saved items |
| `list_author_saves` | Items from one author |
| `list_tags` | Visible tag vocabulary and usage counts |
| `library_stats` | Visible library and media statistics |

The optional `source` filter accepts visible `x`, `reddit`, `github`, and `web`
items. TikTok rows remain hidden while that source is paused. MCP search is
keyword/BM25 today; it does not claim the web UI's optional semantic ranking.

Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http anansi http://127.0.0.1:3001/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_MCP_TOKEN>"
```

Codex / env-backed clients:

```toml
[mcp_servers.anansi]
url = "http://127.0.0.1:3001/mcp"
bearer_token_env_var = "MCP_TOKEN"
```

Keep `MCP_TOKEN` in the client environment, never in a committed file.

### Choose a transport

Anansi exposes the same MCP server through two transports. The tool definitions
and database functions are shared; only the connection method changes.

| Use case | Configuration | Transport and database | Authentication |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenCode or another local agent | `opencode.json` | Starts `bun run apps/cli/src/cli.ts serve --mcp` and reads the local SQLite library directly | The local process boundary; no HTTP token |
| Browser-based or remote-capable clients | MCP URL above | Streamable HTTP at `/mcp`; local Vite proxies `3001` to the internal Bun server on `8788` | `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_TOKEN>` |

The OpenCode entry is deliberately `type: "local"`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "anansi": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["bun", "run", "apps/cli/src/cli.ts", "serve", "--mcp"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

This is not a second MCP implementation. The CLI connects the shared server
to an stdio transport, while `/mcp` connects that same server to the
Web-standard Streamable HTTP transport. The CLI writes diagnostics to stderr;
stdout remains reserved for JSON-RPC.

### Verify the MCP paths

For a repeatable local acceptance check, run:

```bash
bun run scripts/e2e-local-smoke.ts
```

This requires a running Ollama daemon with the configured embedding and tag
models. It uses a temporary SQLite library and exercises authenticated local
ingest, `initialize`, `tools/list`, search, and both HTTP and stdio MCP. If the
AI jobs remain pending, the harness stops before its MCP assertions; treat
that as an Ollama/model-readiness failure rather than an MCP transport result.
For the OpenCode wiring itself, run:

```bash
opencode mcp list
```

The Anansi entry should report `connected`. This verifies that OpenCode can
launch the configured stdio process; it does not test the HTTP route.

With `bun run dev:local` running, the HTTP route can be checked at both layers:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8788/mcp   internal Bun handler
http://127.0.0.1:3001/mcp   public local origin and Vite proxy
```

The authenticated HTTP check should reject a wrong bearer with `401`, accept
`initialize` with `200`, list the same eight tools, complete a search and
`get_saved` call, and return a normal MCP error/result for hostile search text.
These local checks prove the local handler, proxy, auth, and transport wiring;
they do not prove a deployed Cloudflare Worker or an external client reaching
it over the internet.

The standalone scripts under `apps/cli/scripts/mcp-smoke.ts` and
`apps/web/scripts/mcp-http-smoke.ts` also exercise real transports. Their
search assertions depend on the hard-coded sample query being present in the
current library, so a zero-result failure can be a stale data fixture rather
than a transport failure. Use `scripts/e2e-local-smoke.ts` for an isolated,
fixture-controlled acceptance run.

Durable boundaries: extension captures and queues; server validates and parses; database owns identity, search, removal state, and provenance; MCP and HTTP call the same database functions.

```

## 🔒 Privacy by design

- No `<all_urls>` permission · No `cookies` permission · No GitHub OAuth / PAT for extension capture
- GitHub + Reddit use browser-managed session cookies; X uses signed-in page scripts. Cookie values are never read or uploaded.
- Raw payloads are bounded and validated before server-side parsing; extension traffic is bearer-authed
- Chrome bookmark access is optional, requested only when mirroring is enabled
- Local DB + media live under `data/` (local dev); D1 + R2 in your account (hosted). Never commit `.env`, database files, raw captures, or media.
