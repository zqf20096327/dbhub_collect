## PromQL in ClickHouse

ClickHouse is growing native Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) support so time series stored in a `TimeSeries` table can be queried with Prometheus' own dialect instead of (or alongside) SQL. Support is experimental and evolving — the specs and PRs below track where it is headed.

| Link | Description |
|---|---|
| [Support for PromQL (Issue #57545)](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/57545) | Open tracking issue (since Dec 2023) requesting a PromQL interpreter, Prometheus-optimized table structures, and native Prometheus HTTP / Remote-Read API integration. |
