# **Danny's Diner: Customer Behavior Analysis**  

**[View Dashboard](https://dannys-diner.vercel.app)**

## **Project Overview**  
This project analyzes customer transaction data from **Danny’s Diner** to uncover spending habits, visiting patterns, and menu preferences. Using **SQL**, I extracted insights to help Danny improve customer experience and optimize his loyalty program. This project and the data used was part of a case study which can be found [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/).

## **Project Objectives**  
- Analyze **customer spending** and favorite menu items.  
- Track **visiting patterns** (frequency, first/last orders).  
- Evaluate **loyalty program performance** through reward points.  
- Provide **actionable recommendations** for business growth.  

## **Data Used**  
Three key tables:  
1. **`sales`** (customer orders: `customer_id`, `order_date`, `product_id`)  
2. **`menu`** (menu items: `product_id`, `product_name`, `price`)  
3. **`members`** (loyalty program sign-ups: `customer_id`, `join_date`)

### **11. Rank all products for each member, with NULL values for non-members**  
*Danny also requires further information about the ranking of products. He purposely does not need the ranking of non member purchases so he expects NULL ranking values for customers who are not yet part of the loyalty program.*
Provide product rankings exclusively for loyalty program members while clearly identifying non-members with NULL values.  

#### Method:
```
with customers_data as (

	select 
		s.customer_id as customer, 
		s.order_date, 
		m.product_name, 
		m.price,
		case
			when s.order_date < mb.join_date then 'N'
			when s.order_date >= mb.join_date then 'Y'
			else 'N' 
			end as member
	from sales s
		left join members mb
			on s.customer_id = mb.customer_id
		inner join menu m
			on s.product_id = m.product_id

)

select 
	*, 
	case
		when member = 'N' then null
		else rank() over (partition by customer, member order by order_date) 
	end as ranking
from customers_data
order by customer, order_date
;
```

## **Insights & Recommendations**  

### **Key Findings**  
✅ **Customer B** visited most frequently (6 times).  
✅ **Ramen** is the top-selling item, followed by curry and sushi.  
✅ **Customer A** loves ramen, **Customer C** only orders ramen, while **Customer B** enjoys all three equally.  
✅ Last pre-membership orders: **sushi (Customer A)** and **curry (Customer B)**—potential loyalty triggers.  

### **Actionable Steps for Danny**  
1. **Boost Loyalty Program:**  
   - Offer **double points on sushi** and **first-week bonuses**.  
   - Personalize rewards (e.g., free ramen for frequent buyers).  
2. **Increase Engagement:**  
   - Target **Customer B** with exclusive deals (highest visits).  
   - Investigate why **Customer C** only orders ramen—expand menu appeal?  
3. **Menu Optimization:**  
   - Introduce **new ramen variants** (top seller).  
   - Create **bundles** (e.g., sushi + curry) to diversify orders.

## **Conclusion**  
This SQL-driven analysis revealed **customer preferences, spending trends, and loyalty program opportunities** for Danny's Diner. The additional product ranking analysis (Question 11) provides clear differentiation between member and non-member purchasing patterns, enabling more focused loyalty program strategies.
