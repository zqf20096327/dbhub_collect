# Kotlin Notion Client

A modern, type-safe Kotlin client for the Notion API with comprehensive DSL support and coroutine-based operations.

> **⚠️ AI-Assisted Development Notice**
> This library is developed primarily by AI agents (Claude Code) under human direction. While it includes comprehensive testing (1,200+ unit tests), validation against official Notion API samples, and live-API integration passes, please be aware of potential issues:
> - Documentation examples may not perfectly match implementation
> - Edge cases may exist that weren't covered in testing
> - Some API patterns may have inconsistencies
>
> We are deliberately open about this — including when it bites: several fixes in the upcoming 0.6.0 release correct bugs that earlier AI-assisted releases introduced (see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)).
>
> **Please report any issues you encounter!** Your feedback is invaluable for improving the library.
> See the [Development Context](#development-context) section for full transparency about the development process.

## Installation

### Maven Central

```kotlin
// Gradle (Kotlin DSL)
dependencies {
    implementation("it.saabel:kotlin-notion-client:0.7.0")
}
```

```xml
<!-- Maven -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>it.saabel</groupId>
    <artifactId>kotlin-notion-client</artifactId>
    <version>0.7.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Requirements

- Kotlin 2.3.21 or higher
- JVM target 21+

## Quick Start

```kotlin
import it.saabel.kotlinnotionclient.NotionClient

// Initialize the client (constructor - recommended)
val notion = NotionClient("your-notion-api-token")

// Alternative: factory method (also supported)
// val notion = NotionClient.create("your-notion-api-token")

// Retrieve a page
val page = notion.pages.retrieve("page-id")

// Create a page in a data source
val newPage = notion.pages.create {
    parent.dataSource("data-source-id")
    properties {
        title("Name") { text("My Project") }
        select("Status") { name("In Progress") }
    }
}

// Query a data source (table)
val results = notion.dataSources.query("data-source-id") {
    filter {
        property("Status") {
            select { equals("In Progress") }
        }
    }
}
```

### Client Initialization

You can create a `NotionClient` instance using either pattern:

```kotlin
// 1. Direct constructor (idiomatic Kotlin - recommended)
val client = NotionClient("your-api-token")

// 2. Factory method (also fully supported)
val client = NotionClient.create("your-api-token")

// With custom configuration
val client = NotionClient(
    NotionConfig(
        apiToken = "your-api-token",
        logLevel = LogLevel.INFO,
        enableRateLimit = true
    )
)
```

Both patterns are fully supported - use whichever feels more natural to you.

## Rate Limiting & Throttling

Every request the client sends flows through a single rate-limit pipeline that
does two things automatically:

1. **Proactive throttling** — a continuous-refill token bucket paces outbound
   requests so you stay under Notion's documented sustained ceiling (≈3 req/s)
   instead of firing a burst that earns a wave of `429`s.
2. **Reactive retry** — `429` responses (honouring `Retry-After`), transient
   `5xx` (`502` / `503` / `504`), and network errors are retried with
   exponential backoff and jitter. Other `4xx`, plain `500`, and successes are
   returned immediately.

Tune it through `NotionConfig.rateLimitConfig`:

```kotlin
val client = NotionClient(
    NotionConfig(
        apiToken = "your-api-token",
        rateLimitConfig = RateLimitConfig(
            sustainedRate = 3.0,            // tokens (requests) refilled per second
            burstCapacity = 20,            // requests allowed to fire immediately
            maxRetries = 3,                // retries AFTER the first attempt (see note)
            retryBaseDelay = 1.seconds,    // first retry waits ~this long
            retryMaxDelay = 30.seconds,    // cap on any single backoff delay
            jitterFactor = 0.1,            // ±10% randomness to avoid thundering herds
        ),
    ),
)
```

| Field | Default | What it controls |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| `sustainedRate` | `3.0` | Steady-state requests per second. Notion's sustained ceiling — lower for politeness; raising it risks `429`s. |
| `burstCapacity` | `20` | How many requests can go out back-to-back before pacing kicks in. |
| `maxRetries` | `3` | Retries after the initial attempt. |
| `retryBaseDelay` | `1s` | Base of the exponential backoff schedule. |
| `retryMaxDelay` | `30s` | Upper bound on a single backoff wait. |
| `jitterFactor` | `0.1` | Randomness added to each delay. |

> **Off-by-one note:** `maxRetries` counts *retries*, not total attempts.
> `maxRetries = 3` permits up to **4** HTTP calls (1 initial + 3 retries); `0`
> disables retrying entirely.

**Tuning for heavy concurrency.** If you fan out many requests at once (e.g.
bulk-creating pages or hydrating a large database), raise **`burstCapacity`**
rather than `sustainedRate`. A larger bucket lets the initial burst drain
immediately, after which everything is paced at `sustainedRate`; `sustainedRate`
itself should stay pinned to what Notion allows. The bucket is scoped per
`NotionClient`, so independent clients throttle independently.

To opt out entirely (e.g. when you front the client with your own limiter), set
`enableRateLimit = false`.

## Understanding Databases vs. Data Sources

**Important**: The 2025-09-03 API introduced a fundamental change to how databases work:

- **Database** = Container that holds one or more data sources
- **Data Source** = The actual table with properties and rows (pages)

Most operations you'd expect to do on a "database" (like querying, adding pages) actually work on **data sources**:

```kotlin
// ❌ In older APIs: notion.databases.query("database-id")
// ✅ In 2025-09-03+: notion.dataSources.query("data-source-id")
```

The `DatabasesApi` is for container-level operations (create database, update title/icon/cover). The `DataSourcesApi` is for data operations (query, create data source, update schema).

See [docs/databases.md](docs/databases.md) and [docs/data-sources.md](docs/data-sources.md) for details.

### Learning Resources

The **[Kotlin Notebooks](notebooks/)** are the best way to learn the library:
1. [Getting Started](notebooks/01-getting-started.ipynb) - Authentication and basic operations
2. [Reading Databases](notebooks/02-reading-databases.ipynb) - Querying with filters and sorting
3. [Creating Pages](notebooks/03-creating-pages.ipynb) - Pages, properties, icons, and covers
4. [Working with Blocks](notebooks/04-working-with-blocks.ipynb) - All block types and operations
5. [Rich Text DSL](notebooks/05-rich-text-dsl.ipynb) - Formatting, colors, links, dates, equations
6. [Advanced Queries](notebooks/06-advanced-queries.ipynb) - Complex filtering, AND/OR logic, pagination
7. [File Uploads](notebooks/07-file-uploads.ipynb) - Uploading files, external imports, media blocks
8. [What's New in v0.4.0](notebooks/08-whats-new-in-v0.4.ipynb) — Tour of all breaking changes and new features added in v0.4.0

The notebooks currently pin **v0.4.1** in their `@file:DependsOn` cells and have not yet been re-run against 0.6.0 — their output cells reflect the version they were authored against. They can be run in IntelliJ IDEA (with the Kotlin Notebook plugin) or Jupyter (with kotlin-jupyter-kernel); run each cell in order and set the required environment variables before starting. Bumping the pin to 0.6.0 will require code changes, since 0.6.0 is a breaking release (see [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)). Refreshing them is tracked in [#87](https://github.com/jsaabel/kotlin-notion-client/issues/87).

## Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jsaabel/kotlin-notion-client.git
cd kotlin-notion-client

# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Run all tests (unit tests run, integration tests skip without env vars)
./gradlew test

# Run integration tests (requires environment variables)
export NOTION_RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=true
export NOTION_API_TOKEN="secret_..."
export NOTION_TEST_PAGE_ID="page-id"
./gradlew test

# Run specific integration tests (recommended)
./gradlew test --tests "*SearchIntegrationTest"
```

**Notes**:
- Integration tests are controlled via environment variables. Without `NOTION_RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=true`, they are automatically skipped.
- **⚠️ Avoid running all integration tests at once** - they perform many real API operations on your workspace. Run specific test classes instead.

## Development Context

This project was developed using **Claude Code** (Anthropic's CLI for Claude) as an exploration of AI-assisted software development. The goal was to understand how human expertise and AI capabilities can collaborate on production-quality code.

**Key aspects:**
- Iterative, test-driven development with AI assistance
- Extensive use of official Notion API samples for validation
- Transparent development process documented in [journal/](journal/)

Since the 0.6.0 cycle, whole releases are carried out by orchestrated agent runs: features and fixes are specced as GitHub issues, implemented one agent per issue, merged via reviewed PRs onto a shared release branch, and finished with a dedicated live-API verification pass against a real workspace. The paper trail — issues, agent reports (`FOLLOWUPS.md`), and architecture decision records (`docs/adr/`) — is kept in the open, including the cases where a fix corrects a bug an earlier AI-assisted release shipped.

The development journals are intentionally kept in the repository for transparency and educational value for others exploring LLM-assisted development workflows.

## Project Status

This library covers virtually all aspects of the Notion API (2026-03-11 version). It has been validated against official API samples and includes both unit tests and integration tests. However, it has not yet been used extensively in production environments.

**Before using in production:**
- Review the test coverage for your specific use cases
- Test thoroughly with your Notion workspace
- Be aware that the API version support is fixed to 2026-03-11
- **Date/time properties with timezones**: The write side is offset-preserving, zone-explicit and validating since 0.6.0 (a response to a real-world bug where offset-less writes were silently stored as UTC), and the read accessors (`wallClockDateTime`, `utcInstant`, `storedOffset`, `localDateTimeIn(timeZone)`) name the question they answer — but timezone handling remains an area worth testing against your own workload
