## [Usage](/wiki/en/usage.md)
Refer to the [Usage](/wiki/en/usage.md) documentation.

## Managing application data
- Most of the application data is stored in the `main.db` file. To export or backup your data, store this file and later paste it into the new location.
- If you are migrating from a compatible version to the latest version, you can export both `main.db` file and `Galleries` folder.
- If you are migrating from an incompatible version to the latest version, you can only export the `Galleries` folder since `main.db` won't be compatible.

## How to resolve issues
- If the webpage does not load, try visiting the page in Incognito/Private mode.
- In a rare case, an error might occur when other applications are using the default localhost port. In this case, manually change the Url's port number in `appsettings.json` to a random number between (1024 - 65535).

      "Kestrel": {
        "Endpoints": {
          "Http": {
            "Url": "http://localhost:7076" <-- here
          }
        }
      },
      ...

## Notes
- Downloaded gallery images are stored in the `Galleries` folder.
