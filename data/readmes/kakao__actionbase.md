# Actionbase

**One database for user–user, user–item, and item–item interactions — precomputed at write time, served as simple lookups.**<br />
**1M+ req/min in production at Kakao. Built on HBase.**

## Why Actionbase

Follows, likes, recent views, related content — they are all **interaction data**. They look simple, but at scale, real-time counts, toggle consistency, and ordered relationship reads turn into bottlenecks, and teams end up rebuilding caches, indexes, and dual-write pipelines from scratch every time.

Actionbase consolidates these into **one database for interactions**. Every interaction is expressed in the same model — *source → action → target* — and the combination of source and target naturally yields three axes:

- **User–User (U2U)** — follow/unfollow, follower/following counts, timeline scans
- **User–Item (U2I)** — likes/bookmarks, view history, bidirectional counters
- **Item–Item (I2I)** — related products, similar-content graphs, and other precomputed item-to-item relations

All three axes have run in production at Kakao at over 1M req/min since 2024.

## Quick Start

**1. Run**

```bash
docker run -it ghcr.io/kakao/actionbase:standalone
```
Runs server (port 8080) in the background, CLI (`actionbase>`) in the foreground.

**2. Load sample data**

```
load preset likes
```
Loads metadata and 3 edges (a U2I example):
```
Alice --- likes ----> +--------+
                      | Phone  |
Bob ----- likes ----> +--------+
      |
      |               +--------+
      +-- likes ----> | Laptop |
                      +--------+
```

**3. Query** — Precomputed. Just read.

```
get --source Alice --target Phone                # Alice → Phone
scan --index recent --start Bob --direction OUT  # Bob → Laptop, Bob → Phone
scan --index recent --start Phone --direction IN # Alice → Phone, Bob → Phone
count --start Alice --direction OUT              # 1
count --start Phone --direction IN               # 2
```

## How It Works

- **At write time**: exact counts, consistent toggles, indexes, and aggregations are all precomputed.
- **At read time**: precomputed results are read as-is. Read-path cost stays flat under load. Multi-hop traversals are expressed by composing the supported operations.

Supported operations:

* Edge lookups (GET, multi-get)
* Edge counts (COUNT)
* Indexed edge scans (SCAN; multi-start variant is SEEK)
* Real-time aggregations (AGG)

Planned:

* Global TopK
* Per-entity TopK

## Architecture

- **HBase** — durable storage for interactions; strong durability, horizontal scalability.
- **Kafka** — WAL/CDC publication for recovery, replay, and downstream pipelines.
- **JDBC metastore** — to be consolidated into HBase.

Additional storage backends are planned for small to mid-size deployments.

## Codebase Overview

* **core** — data model, mutation, query, encoding logic (Java, Kotlin)
* **engine** — storage and messaging bindings (Kotlin)
* **server** — REST API server (Kotlin, Spring WebFlux)
* **pipeline** *(planned)* — bulk loading and CDC processing (Scala, Spark)

## When to Use It

- A single database or cache layer can no longer absorb your U2U/U2I/I2I traffic
- Multiple teams keep rebuilding the same real-time counters, sync queues, and relationship scans
- You need predictable read latency without read-time computation

If a single database can handle your workload, that's the better choice.

## Current Status

Early open-source phase. The first release focuses on introducing core concepts and hands-on guides. Production installation, operations guides, and additional components will be released over time.
