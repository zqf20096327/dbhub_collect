## What is this?

Every morning, hundreds of AI papers and community posts come out. Most of them aren't useful if you're a developer building products with AI — they're about model training, benchmarks without actionable takeaways, or domain-specific research you'll never apply.

AI Paper Digest cuts through the noise. It automatically collects from arXiv, HuggingFace, Hacker News, and Reddit every day, runs strict AI-powered screening, and delivers summaries designed for developers who use AI agents, prompting, and RAG — not ML researchers.

The bar is high: roughly **1 in 10 papers makes it through**.

## How it works

A GitHub Actions pipeline runs automatically every day at 07:00 KST:

| Step | Script | Source | Filter | Output |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1. Collect papers | `collect-papers.ts` | arXiv 100 + HuggingFace 40 | Claude Haiku screening (score ≥ 7) | Max 2/day |
| 2. Collect community | `collect-community.ts` | HN 100 + Reddit 150 | Claude Haiku screening (score ≥ 6) | Max 10/day |
| 3. Summarize community | `digest-community.ts` | Full post + comments | Claude Sonnet | Max 10/day |
| 4. Summarize papers | `summarize.ts` | Full PDF text | Claude Sonnet | Max 2/day |
| 5. Translate | `translate.ts` | Korean summaries | Claude Sonnet | Max 12/day |
| 6. Redeploy | `redeploy.yml` | — | Vercel production deploy | — |
| 7. Slack drip | `api/cron/slack-drip` | — | cron-job.org (every 5min) | Max 20/day |

**Screening criteria for papers** — passes only if:
- Immediately applicable without model training or infra setup
- A developer can change their prompting or tool usage based on this
- Non-obvious, not already common knowledge

**Screening criteria for community** — passes only if:
- Technical tutorial, deep dive, or real-world experience with AI tools
- Developer workflow or productivity content with substance

Each summary includes:
- TL;DR (one-liner)
- Core mechanics / key findings
- Evidence with specific numbers
- How to apply
- Terminology glossary
- Korean and English
