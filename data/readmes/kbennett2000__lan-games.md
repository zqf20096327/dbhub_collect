## Why This Exists

LAN parties want games everyone in the room can play together. Most multiplayer games today require internet, accounts, and matchmaking — LAN Games is the opposite. One Node.js server on your network hosts eight turn-based board games in the browser. No accounts beyond a username, no internet after install, no configuration required. The platform is game-agnostic: each game is a server module behind a [small interface](server/src/game-logic-interface.js), so adding a ninth game doesn't touch the framework. Hidden-information games like Battleship and Risk coexist with open-board games through a per-game state-filtering contract, and spectators can watch any game with full visibility.

## Quickstart

1. **Clone and install:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kbennett2000/lan-games.git
   cd lan-games/server
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   # Generate a random secret (once) and start:
   export JWT_SECRET=$(node -e "process.stdout.write(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))")
   npm start
   ```

3. **Play.** Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. Create a game, share the URL with friends on your network, and play.

No database setup, no external services, no configuration files. Docker is also supported — see the detailed [Quick Start](#quick-start) below.

> **Windows note:** The root `package.json` scripts use bash syntax (`. ./.env`). Run from Git Bash, WSL, or use the `cd server && npm start` path directly with `JWT_SECRET` set as an environment variable. A `.env.example` is included for reference.

Every game supports save/resume, in-game chat, and spectator mode. Games with hidden information (Battleship, Risk, Life) enforce privacy server-side — each player sees only what they're allowed to.

## Features

### Framework
- **Multi-game** — add any turn-based game by implementing one interface file; no framework changes required
- **Real-time multiplayer** — all clients sync instantly via Socket.io WebSockets
- **Player accounts** — register/login with username + password; JWT persisted in `localStorage`
- **Lobby** — create, browse, and join open games; game-type badge shown on every card
- **Save & Resume** — pause any in-progress game and continue it later from the lobby
- **Auto-reconnect** — disconnected players are marked AFK; their turn is auto-skipped after 30 s
- **In-game chat** — room-scoped, real-time, 300-character cap
- **Spectator mode** — anyone logged in can watch any game in progress (👁 Spectate button on every in-progress lobby card). Spectators see the full unfiltered state (including hidden information for games like Battleship, Risk, and Life), chat with players, and watch the action log; they cannot take actions. Players are notified when spectators join. See the "Spectator mode" section below.
- **Configurable** — every rule, price, and board value lives in JSON; hot-reload without a restart

### Monopoly
- Full rules: dice, doubles (3× → jail), property buying, auctions, rent, color-group monopoly detection, even-building rule, mortgage/unmortgage, jail (fine / doubles / card), Chance & Community Chest (full 16-card decks), trades (money + properties + jail cards), Income Tax (flat or 10% of net worth), bankruptcy with asset transfer
- Visual CSS Grid board with color bands, player tokens, house/hotel indicators, and ownership dots

### Connect Four
- Standard 7 × 6 board; drop pieces by clicking column buttons
- Win detection: horizontal, vertical, and both diagonals
- Draw detection when the board is full

### Risk
- Classic 42-territory world map across 6 continents; 2–6 players
- Three-phase turns: reinforce → attack → fortify
- Auto-distributed initial setup; armies and territories dealt evenly to all players
- Dice combat: attacker rolls up to 3, defender auto-rolls up to 2; ties go to defender
- Continent bonuses (NA 5, SA 2, EU 5, AF 3, AS 7, AU 2) applied at the start of every reinforce phase
- 44-card deck (42 territory + 2 wild); valid sets (3 of a kind, 3 different, or any 2 + wild) traded for escalating bonus armies (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, then +5 each)
- Player elimination transfers all cards to the conqueror; last player standing wins by world domination
- **First game with hidden information** — each player's hand is private, enforced server-side by the game's `getStateForPlayer` filter

### Tic-Tac-Toe
- Classic 3 × 3 board; 2 players take turns marking cells with `✕` and `◯`
- Win detection: rows, columns, both diagonals
- Draw detection when the board fills

### Yahtzee
- Standard 5-dice, 13-category, three-rolls-per-turn rules; 1–8 players (solo play supported)
- Up to 3 rolls per turn with arbitrary holds between rolls
- All 13 categories (six upper + three-/four-of-a-kind, full house, two straights, Yahtzee, chance)
- Upper-section bonus (+35 when subtotal ≥ 63); ties produce a shared-winner array
- Two-click commit on category selection prevents accidental score-locking
- **First non-board game** — UI is a shared score sheet (players as columns, categories as rows) plus a dice tray, all inside the renderer-owned board area

### Battleship
- Classic 2-player, 10×10 grid; five ships per side (Carrier 5, Battleship 4, Cruiser 3, Submarine 3, Destroyer 2)
- Drag-and-drop ship placement with **R-key rotation** during drag
- Two-grid firing layout — your fleet on the left, opponent's waters on the right; fixed positions across turns with active/inactive treatment that flips
- Both fleets revealed at game over (winner and loser see the layout that beat them)
- **First game with a simultaneous private setup phase** — both players place ships in parallel; the phase transitions to firing on a barrier (both Ready) rather than via a turn. Modelled as `status='playing'` + `turnState.phase='setup'` with `currentPlayerIndex=null`
- **First game with fully hidden state per player** — opponents' ship positions are stripped by `getStateForPlayer` on every emit, not masked

### Checkers
- Classic American Checkers on an 8×8 board; 12 pieces per side, 2 players
- Diagonal movement with mandatory captures and multi-jump chain captures
- King coronation on reaching the back row (kings move forward and backward, one square at a time — not "flying" kings)
- Stalemate-as-loss: player with no legal move loses
- Click-driven move selection consuming server-supplied action descriptors — the renderer highlights only legal pieces and destinations
- Animated piece movement, capture fading, chain-capture sequencing, and king coronation visual

### The Game of Life
- 64-square branching board with a start fork (Career vs College), main track, and two-path retirement choice (Countryside Acres vs Millionaire Estates)
- 1–10 spinner (no dice) — CSS-animated wheel that decelerates and settles on the result
- College path costs $40,000 in loans but unlocks degree-required careers; career path skips the loan but is locked out of degree careers
- Marriage adds a spouse peg and collects $5,000 from each other player as wedding gifts
- Children mechanic — single births (+$5k/player) and twins (+$10k/player); each child counts toward final scoring at $50k each
- Insurance — auto and life, optional out-of-band purchases that nullify the matching accident squares
- Stocks — pick a number 1–10; collect $10,000 whenever **any** player's spinner matches it (cross-turn payouts)
- House purchase — pick from 2–3 offered house cards (cost vs scoring value); contributes to final score
- Retirement is the strategic crux: Countryside Acres draws life tiles from a shrinking deck; Millionaire Estates is a cash gamble that resolves at game over
- **First game with a branching, non-grid board** — squares are graph nodes with explicit `next[]` adjacency; the renderer places squares at hand-tuned grid coordinates with arrows showing direction
- **First game with deferred-resolution game over** — ME retirees' win/loss is undetermined until the last player retires; documented in [docs/renderer-contract.md](docs/renderer-contract.md)
- **First game with a "retired-but-still-in-game" pattern** — retired players stay in `state.players` and turn rotation skips past them; the game ends when every player is retired
- Life tiles are hidden information per player (count visible to opponents, values masked until game over); revealed with a per-tile flip animation during the final score reveal

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** (LTS recommended) — *or* **Docker** (see below)
- **C++ build toolchain** — `better-sqlite3` and `bcrypt` are native modules compiled during `npm install`. If the build fails, install the toolchain for your OS:
  - **Windows:** `npm install -g windows-build-tools` *or* install the "Desktop development with C++" workload from [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
  - **macOS:** `xcode-select --install`
  - **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):** `sudo apt install build-essential python3`
  - **Docker sidesteps this entirely** — the `node:20` (Debian) build stage ships the toolchain
- No external database — SQLite is embedded via `better-sqlite3`

### Install & run

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start          # production
npm run dev        # development (nodemon auto-restart)
```

The server binds to `0.0.0.0:3000` by default — reachable on your entire LAN.

### Docker

**1. Create a `.env` file** at the repo root containing your JWT secret (the server refuses to start without one):

```bash
# Generates a random secret and writes it to .env in one step
node -e "console.log('JWT_SECRET=' + require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))" > .env
```

**2. Build and start:**

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The Dockerfile runs both the unit and integration test suites during the build — the image is only produced if all tests pass.

Open `http://localhost:3000`. The SQLite database is stored in a Docker named volume (`db-data`) and survives container restarts and image rebuilds.

**To reset the database inside the container:**

```bash
docker compose run --rm server node scripts/reset-db.js
```

### Connect

| Who | URL |
|-----|-----|
| Host machine | `http://localhost:3000` |
| LAN players | `http://<host-ip>:3000` |

Find `<host-ip>` with `ip addr` (Linux/macOS) or `ipconfig` (Windows).

### Play

1. Every player registers a username and password on their own browser.
2. One player creates a game, picks a game type, and optionally customises rules.
3. Other players join from the lobby.
4. The host clicks **Start Game**.

### Spectator mode

Anyone logged in can watch any in-progress game without playing.

- In the lobby, every game in `playing` status has a **👁 Spectate** button next to the Join/Rejoin button.
- A spectator sees the full unfiltered state — *including* hidden information like Battleship ship positions, Risk card hands, and Life tiles. (The point is to enjoy watching strategy unfold; spectators are watching, not playing.)
- Spectators can chat in the same room as players; their messages are prefixed with 👁 so players know which lines come from the gallery.
- Spectators see the action log, the player roster, and any in-progress modals.
- The action panel is hidden; the "You're spectating" banner persists at the top of the play area.
- Players are notified when a spectator joins (log entry). Leaves are silent.
- A spectator can leave any time via the **✕ Leave** button (replacing the host's Save/Quit). Leaving has no effect on the game.

Spectators cannot take actions. The server enforces this (any `game:action` from a spectator is rejected with a `game:error`); the client gates click handlers as a UX layer so spectator clicks don't appear to do anything.

A user who is already a player in a game cannot also spectate it — the Spectate button is suppressed in that case, and the server rejects an explicit attempt with "You are already a player in this game".

## Project Structure

The repository has three top-level directories: `server/` (Node.js backend with game-logic modules under `server/games/` and framework under `server/src/`), `client/` (single-page application with per-game renderers under `client/js/games/`), and `docs/` (design notes and reference documentation).

See [docs/project-structure.md](docs/project-structure.md) for the full annotated directory tree.

---

## Architecture

The platform is a single Node.js server (Express + Socket.io) backed by embedded SQLite. Game logic lives in pure-function modules behind a small interface; the framework handles persistence, real-time sync, authentication, and the lobby. Each client renders its game type through a registry-dispatched renderer.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the component diagram, data-flow walkthrough, database schema, and common GameState shape.

---

## Security Notes

LAN Games is designed for trusted local networks. Authentication uses JWT tokens (the server refuses to start without a `JWT_SECRET`) and bcrypt-hashed passwords. Every game action is validated server-side, and every state-bearing emission routes through `getStateForPlayer` to protect hidden information. A full [state-emission audit](docs/state-emission-audit.md) documents the boundary.

The platform is **offline by design** — once installed, the server and client need zero internet connectivity. All assets are served locally, there are no CDN dependencies, no telemetry, and no outbound HTTP calls.

See [docs/security.md](docs/security.md) for the complete security notes including JWT configuration, LAN binding warnings, and the offline-by-design inventory.

## Roadmap

- **More games** — Chess, Scrabble, Catan, Coup, Liar's Dice, …
- **Action descriptor contract** — implemented across five of the eight games (Battleship, Checkers, Risk, Yahtzee, and The Game of Life); the renderer-side rule mirrors are gone in all five. Connect Four and Tic-Tac-Toe deliberately skip the contract — their action surfaces (`dropPiece`, `markCell`) are trivial enough that `getValidActions` covers them. See [`docs/action-descriptors.md`](docs/action-descriptors.md) for the contract and the patterns the five migrations established.
- **Turn timer UI** — server emits absolute-deadline warnings via `game:turn_warning`; the client-side countdown bar is implemented in [`client/js/turn-warning.js`](client/js/turn-warning.js).
- ~~**Spectator mode**~~ — shipped; see the Spectator mode section above
- **AI players** — pluggable bot interface implementing the same `applyAction` contract
- **Custom board themes** — CSS variable overrides per game type
- **Mobile optimisation** — touch-friendly controls for handheld players
- **HTTPS / mDNS** — easier LAN discovery and secure transport without manual IP lookup
