## Why this guide exists

The DP-800 is Microsoft's first certification focused on building **AI-enabled database solutions** — vector search, embeddings, RAG, and intelligent search inside SQL Server, Azure SQL, and SQL databases in Microsoft Fabric. The official skills list is broad and changes quickly. Public study resources are scarce.

This repo is the notes that got me through it. Now it's yours.

## Who this is for

- **Database developers / DBAs** moving into AI-augmented workloads
- **Data engineers** who want to add vector search and RAG to relational platforms
- **AI / app developers** who need to talk fluently about Azure SQL, Fabric SQL, and T-SQL AI functions
- **Exam takers** preparing for DP-800 specifically — every topic file maps 1:1 to the official blueprint
- **Anyone curious** about how Microsoft is bringing GenAI into the database layer

You don't need to be taking the exam to get value — the guide doubles as a reference for SQL Server 2025 vector features, MCP server integration, Data API Builder, and embedding maintenance patterns.

## What's covered

- **11 topic sections** mapped 1:1 to the official skills measured list
- **7 cheat sheets** for fast review (security, vector/AI, JSON, performance, T-SQL, Azure SQL config)
- **60+ practice questions** with full explanations across all three domains
- **2 full-length mock exams** (50 questions each — 45 standalone + a 5-question case study mirroring the real exam format)
- **Per-mock debrief files** mapping every missed question to a topic file + cheat sheet
- **End-to-end RAG worked example** — the full pipeline in ~80 lines of T-SQL
- **Final review** designed to read in 20 minutes the morning of the exam
- **T-SQL code examples** covering vector search, RAG, full-text, and AI integration

## 2026 updates you should know

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft refreshed the DP-800 skills measured on **March 12, 2026**. Highlights:

- **SQL Server 2025 is GA.** The `VECTOR` data type and `VECTOR_DISTANCE` are **generally available** in SQL Server 2025 and Azure SQL Database. `VECTOR_SEARCH`, `VECTOR_NORMALIZE`, and `VECTORPROPERTY` are in **public preview** on the same platforms.
- **DiskANN vector indexes** are in **public preview** across SQL Server 2025, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and SQL database in Microsoft Fabric. On SQL Server 2025 also requires `PREVIEW_FEATURES = ON`.
- **Half-precision (16-bit) `float16` vectors** are in preview — halves storage for the same dimension count (the documented type cap is **1 998** dimensions).
- **MCP server endpoints** (SQL Server + Fabric lakehouse) are explicitly tested.
- **Microsoft Foundry** is named as a valid embedding-maintenance method alongside CDC, Change Tracking, and CES.
- **Change Event Streaming (CES)** in Fabric is now in the blueprint.
- **Passwordless DB access** and **Managed Identity for model endpoints** are explicit security requirements.
- **Schema drift detection** in SQL Database Projects is now an explicit skill.

The [main overview](./certification/dp-800-overview.md) opens with the full "What's New" callout.

## Getting started with Obsidian (recommended)

This guide is written in [Obsidian Flavored Markdown](https://help.obsidian.md/). It renders fine on GitHub, but in **Obsidian** you get callouts, foldable practice-question answers, Mermaid diagrams, backlinks, and a navigable Graph View of every cross-link — which makes studying meaningfully better.

### 5-minute onboarding

1. **Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download)** (free; macOS, Windows, Linux).
2. **Clone this repo** somewhere on your machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kengio/dp-800-study-guide.git
   cd dp-800-study-guide
   ```

3. **Open the vault**: launch Obsidian → *Open folder as vault* → pick the cloned `dp-800-study-guide/` directory.
4. **Trust the author** when Obsidian asks (the included `.obsidian/` config has pre-tuned settings — line numbers, tab width, no inline titles).
5. **Open `certification/dp-800-overview.md`** — that's your study path entry point. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + O` to fuzzy-find any topic.
6. **Toggle Graph View** (`Cmd/Ctrl + G`) to see how all 11 sections cross-link — surprisingly useful for spotting weak areas.

### Recommended plugins

Two are essential, the rest are quality-of-life. Install via **Settings → Community plugins → Browse**.

- **Obsidian Git** — back up your notes and progress checkboxes to your own fork.
- **Linter** — keeps your edits consistent with the project's markdown conventions.
- **Advanced Tables** — auto-aligns Markdown tables as you type.
- **Codeblock Customizer** (or *Better CodeBlock*) — line numbers, titles, copy buttons on code blocks.
- **Copilot** (by logancyang) — chat with Claude / GPT-4o / Ollama inside Obsidian; **Vault QA** mode indexes the guide so the AI can quiz you using your actual notes.

> 📖 **See [`OBSIDIAN-SETUP.md`](./OBSIDIAN-SETUP.md)** for the full setup walkthrough — plugin configuration details, Copilot Vault QA setup, recommended study prompts, and tips for using AI to generate active-recall questions from your notes.

### Don't want Obsidian?

No problem. The guide also renders perfectly in:

- **GitHub** — browse the files online; callouts and Mermaid diagrams render natively
- **VS Code** with the [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) extension
- **Any Markdown reader** that supports GFM — you'll lose callouts and Graph View, but the content is fully readable

## How to use this guide

1. **Start at the [main overview](./certification/dp-800-overview.md)** — it has the full study path and a progress tracker.
2. **Work through the 11 topic sections in order** — each topic file is 300–600 lines with examples, comparison tables, common-mistake callouts, and exam tips.
3. **Hit the [cheat sheets](./certification/resources/cheat-sheets/cheat-sheets.md)** after each domain to consolidate.
4. **Take the [practice questions](./certification/resources/practice-questions/practice-questions.md)** — aim for 70 %+ per domain before moving on. Or drill them adaptively in the **[live practice quiz](https://kengio.github.io/dp-800-study-guide/)** which surfaces what you've recently missed.
5. **Sit the two [mock exams](./certification/resources/mock-exam/mock-exam-1.md) under timed conditions** when you think you're close — both are available as bank options in the [live quiz](https://kengio.github.io/dp-800-study-guide/) with a 70-minute timer.
6. **Read [`final-review.md`](./certification/resources/final-review.md) the morning of the exam** — it's the 20-minute scan.

## Study roadmap

Pick the plan that matches the time you have. All three end with the same outcome — sitting the exam with confidence. The hours are realistic averages for an experienced T-SQL developer; double them if you're newer to relational databases or to the Microsoft stack.

### 🏃 4-week sprint (~30–35 hours total — ~1 hour/day)

Best for: experienced SQL developers brushing up on AI features. Tight but doable.

| Week | Focus | Files | Hours |

| **2** | Domain 2 — Secure, optimize, deploy | `05-data-security-compliance`, `06-performance-optimization`, `07-cicd-database-projects`, `08-azure-services-integration` | 9 |
| **3** | Domain 3 — AI capabilities | `09-models-embeddings`, `10-intelligent-search`, `11-rag` + cheat sheets | 9 |
| **4** | Practice & polish | Practice questions (all 3 domains) → Mock Exam 1 → review → Mock Exam 2 → final-review.md | 6 |

### 🚶 8-week balanced (~55–65 hours total — ~1 hour/day, 7 days/week)

Best for: working professionals fitting study around a job. The recommended default.

| Week | Focus | Hours |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **1** | `01-database-objects` (all 5 sub-topics) + read the [overview](./certification/dp-800-overview.md) | 7 |
| **2** | `02-programmability-objects` + `03-advanced-tsql` part 1 (CTEs, window, JSON) | 8 |
| **3** | `03-advanced-tsql` part 2 (regex, graph, error handling) + `04-ai-assisted-tools` | 7 |
| **4** | **Checkpoint:** Domain 1 cheat sheets + Domain 1 practice questions (target 70 %+) | 5 |
| **5** | `05-data-security-compliance` + `06-performance-optimization` | 8 |
| **6** | `07-cicd-database-projects` + `08-azure-services-integration` | 7 |
| **7** | Domain 2 practice questions + `09-models-embeddings` + `10-intelligent-search` | 8 |
| **8** | `11-rag` + Domain 3 practice → **Mock Exam 1 (timed)** → review weak areas → **Mock Exam 2** → final-review.md | 8 |

### 🧘 12-week comprehensive (~80–100 hours total — ~1 hour/day, with weekends off)

Best for: newcomers to AI features, career changers, or anyone wanting deeper retention.

| Week | Focus | Hours |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **1** | `01-database-objects/01–02` (tables, specialized tables) | 6 |
| **2** | `01-database-objects/03–05` (JSON columns, constraints, partitioning) | 6 |
| **3** | `02-programmability-objects` (views, functions, procs, triggers) + first hands-on lab | 7 |
| **4** | `03-advanced-tsql/01–03` (CTEs, JSON, regex) | 7 |
| **5** | `03-advanced-tsql/04–05` + `04-ai-assisted-tools` + Domain 1 practice questions | 7 |
| **6** | **Checkpoint:** Domain 1 cheat sheets + retake weak Domain 1 questions | 5 |
| **7** | `05-data-security-compliance` (all 5 sub-topics) | 8 |
| **8** | `06-performance-optimization` + isolation/concurrency hands-on | 7 |

| **12** | Domain 3 practice → **Mock Exam 1** → gap-fill → **Mock Exam 2** → final-review.md → exam | 8 |

### Suggested daily cadence

```text
Weekday    (45–60 min):  Read 1 topic sub-file + work the examples in your own DB
Weekend    (90–120 min): Cheat sheet review + practice questions + flashcards
Pre-exam   (last 3 days): Stop new material. Re-read cheat sheets and final-review.md only.
Exam day:                Read final-review.md once over coffee. Eat. Go pass it.
```

### Time-budget per resource (single sitting, end-to-end)

| Resource | Realistic time |
| :--- | :--- |
| Each numbered topic file | 30–45 min reading + 15 min experimentation |
| Each section index | 5 min |
| One cheat sheet | 15–20 min |
| One domain's practice questions (15–20 Qs) | 30–45 min |
| Mock Exam (45 Qs, timed) | 90 min + 30 min review |
| `final-review.md` | 20 min |

## Translations

The English content under `certification/` is canonical. Community translations live in `i18n/<locale>/` as parallel trees and don't alter the English source.

- **Available locales** — see [`i18n/README.md`](./i18n/README.md) (none yet — be the first!)
- **How to translate** — read [`TRANSLATING.md`](./TRANSLATING.md) for BCP-47 locale codes, layout, priority order, and the currency policy
- **Coordinate first** — open an issue titled `i18n: <locale name>` so two people don't start the same locale in parallel

## Contributing

Found an error, a stale link, or a topic that needs deeper coverage? PRs are welcome.

- **Small fixes** (typos, link rot, factual corrections) — open a PR directly
- **New practice questions or topic expansions** — open an issue first to discuss scope
- **Blueprint changes** — Microsoft updates DP-800 periodically; PRs that bring sections in line with the latest skills-measured list are especially appreciated

Please keep the existing structure: each topic file follows the conventions in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md), and code examples live in `certification/resources/code-examples/tsql/`.
