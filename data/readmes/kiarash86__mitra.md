# Mitra

A **project-centric** work management and communication system: the deployment is single-tenant (no organizations/tenants), projects have members and tasks, and tasks are assigned to users.

Backend: Go (Gin) · sqlc · PostgreSQL — Frontend: React + TypeScript (Vite)

> **Single-tenant model:** there is no self-serve sign-up or multi-tenant concept — the app was built for one deployment only. The first owner account is created by a seed step (see [Local Setup](#local-setup)); from there the owner adds users through the API/UI. There is currently no `/auth/register` endpoint.

This is a Phase 1 / MVP snapshot — see [Known Limitations](#known-limitations-phase-1) for what's intentionally not built yet, and [`MITRA.md`](./MITRA.md) for the full architecture proposal and roadmap (in Persian).

## Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose — for the all-in-one setup, or just to run PostgreSQL locally
- Go 1.27+ — only needed for the manual (non-Docker) backend setup; migrations and seeding are both subcommands of the same `mitra` binary now, so there's nothing extra to install for them
- Node.js 20+ — needed for frontend dev (`npm run dev`), and at least once for any local (non-Docker) `go run . serve`/`go build`, since it embeds `web/dist` (see [Frontend is embedded](#frontend-is-embedded))

---

## Environment Variables

All variables live in `.env` (copy from `.env.example`). Every `mitra` subcommand (`serve`, `migrate`, `seed`) reads this file via `internal/config`.

| Variable                | Used by      | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `APP_ENV`                | serve        | `development`, `production`, or `test` — controls Gin's mode                  |
| `APP_PORT`               | serve        | Port the API listens on (default `8080`)                                      |
| `DATABASE_URL`           | serve, migrate, seed | Full Postgres connection string; takes priority when set              |
| `DB_HOST` / `DB_PORT` / `DB_USER` / `DB_PASSWORD` / `DB_NAME` / `DB_SSLMODE` | serve, migrate, seed, docker-compose | Used to build the connection string / to configure the `postgres` container |
| `AUTO_MIGRATE`           | serve        | Default `true` — `mitra serve` applies pending migrations itself on startup before accepting requests. Set to `false` to manage migrations only via `mitra migrate` |
| `JWT_SECRET`             | serve        | **Required** — the API refuses to start if this is empty                      |
| `JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL`   | serve        | Access token lifetime (e.g. `15m`)                                            |
| `JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL`  | serve        | Refresh token lifetime (e.g. `720h`) — issued today, but there's no `/auth/refresh` route yet to redeem it |
| `OWNER_EMAIL`            | seed         | Login email for the seeded owner account                                      |
| `OWNER_NAME`             | seed         | Full name for the seeded owner account                                        |
| `OWNER_PASSWORD`         | seed         | Initial password for the seeded owner account — change it after first login   |

> `mitra seed` fails fast if `OWNER_EMAIL`, `OWNER_NAME`, or `OWNER_PASSWORD` are empty. It's a no-op (prints a message and exits 0) if a user already exists, so it's safe to re-run.

---

## Local Setup

### Option A — Docker (all services)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# JWT_SECRET is required — the api will fail to start if it's empty.
# The placeholder value in .env.example works for localhost only;
# replace it with a real random secret for anything beyond that.
# OWNER_EMAIL / OWNER_NAME / OWNER_PASSWORD are used by the seed step below.

docker compose up --build
```

This starts everything: `postgres` → `api` runs pending migrations itself on startup (see `AUTO_MIGRATE`), builds the frontend, and serves both the API and the UI from `http://localhost:8080`.

> The frontend is embedded into the `mitra` binary at build time (see `web/embed.go`) and served by the same process that serves the API — there's no separate frontend container or port anymore. `web/Dockerfile` and `web/nginx.conf` still exist for the rare case you'd want to host the frontend standalone (e.g. behind a CDN), but the default Docker flow above doesn't use them.

**Seed the owner account** (one-time, required before you can log in). Since `seed` is just a subcommand of the same binary as `api`, run it against the running container — no separate `go` install needed:

```bash
docker compose run --rm api ./mitra seed
```

This reads `OWNER_EMAIL`, `OWNER_NAME`, and `OWNER_PASSWORD` from `.env` and creates the owner account. Every value can also be passed as a flag instead (`--owner-email`, `--owner-name`, `--owner-password`), which takes priority over the env var when given — handy for scripting/CI without touching `.env`. Prefer the env var for the password where you can, since flag values are visible in shell history and `ps`.

### Option B — Manual (Backend)

```bash
# 1. Start the database only
docker compose up -d postgres

# 2. Configure env
cp .env.example .env
# Make sure to replace JWT_SECRET with a secure, random value

# 3. Run migrations
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://mitra:mitra@localhost:5432/mitra?sslmode=disable"
go run . migrate up

# 4. Seed the owner account (one-time, required before you can log in)
go run . seed

# 5. Build the frontend — required at least once, since `go run . serve`
# embeds whatever is currently in web/dist (see "Frontend is embedded" below)
cd web && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

# 6. Run the server
go run . serve
# UI: http://localhost:8080  ·  health check: curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

> `go run . migrate up` is optional here — by default `mitra serve` (step 6) applies pending migrations itself on startup. Run it explicitly if you'd rather control migrations separately (set `AUTO_MIGRATE=false` in that case). Other migration subcommands: `go run . migrate down`, `migrate steps <n>`, `migrate force <version>`, `migrate version`.

#### Frontend is embedded

`web/embed.go` embeds `web/dist` into the `mitra` binary via `go:embed`, and `mitra serve` serves it directly — that's how `docker compose up` gives you both API and UI on one port. This has one consequence for local (non-Docker) development: **`web/dist` has to contain a real build before `go build`/`go run` in this module serves real UI files.** `web/dist` is git-ignored (only a `.gitkeep` placeholder is tracked), so on a fresh clone the package still compiles fine, it just has nothing real to serve until you run step 5 above. Re-run `npm run build` any time you change the frontend and want `go run . serve` to reflect it — there's no live-reload here, that's what `npm run dev` below is for.

### Manual (Frontend)

For active frontend development, run Vite's dev server instead of rebuilding on every change:

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

This proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:8080` (see `vite.config.ts`) and gives you hot reload — it doesn't touch `web/dist` or the embedded build.

## API (Currently Implemented)

Base path: `/api/v1` (except `/health`, which is unversioned)

### Health
| Method | Path      | Description            |
| ------ | --------- | ----------------------- |
| GET    | `/health` | Liveness/health check   |

### Auth
| Method | Path                     | Description                                            |
| ------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/auth/login`            | Login                                                    |
| POST   | `/auth/change-password`  | Change own password *(requires Authorization: Bearer)*  |

> There is no `/auth/register`. Accounts are created either by the seed step (the first owner) or by an owner/admin adding a user — see [Users](#users-requires-authorization-bearer). Login responses include `must_change_password`; the frontend routes users with that flag set to a forced password-change screen before letting them in.

### Users *(requires Authorization: Bearer)*
| Method | Path         | Description                                                   |
| ------ | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/users/me`  | Get your own profile                                            |
| PATCH  | `/users/me`  | Update your own profile (`full_name`)                           |
| GET    | `/users`     | List all users                                                  |
| POST   | `/users`     | Create a user (owner/admin only; only an owner can create another owner) — returns a `temp_password` |
| DELETE | `/users/:id` | Remove (soft-delete) a user (owner/admin only; can't remove yourself; only an owner can remove another owner) |

> There's no separate "organization" resource — the deployment is single-tenant, so this list is simply every user account. Global role (`owner`/`admin`/`member`/`viewer`) lives directly on `users.role`.

### Projects
| Method | Path                              | Description             |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| POST   | `/projects`                       | Create project (owner/admin only) |
| GET    | `/projects`                       | List all projects        |
| GET    | `/projects/:id`                   | Project details          |
| PUT    | `/projects/:id`                   | Edit project              |
| DELETE | `/projects/:id`                   | Delete (soft) project     |
| GET    | `/projects/:id/members`           | List project members     |
| POST   | `/projects/:id/members`           | Add member                |
| DELETE | `/projects/:id/members/:user_id`  | Remove member             |
| POST   | `/projects/:id/tasks`             | Create task in project    |
| GET    | `/projects/:id/tasks`             | List project's tasks      |

### Tasks
| Method | Path                      | Description           |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| GET    | `/tasks/assigned-to-me`   | Tasks assigned to me   |
| GET    | `/tasks/:id`              | Task details            |
| PUT    | `/tasks/:id`              | Edit task                |
| PATCH  | `/tasks/:id/status`       | Change status            |
| POST   | `/tasks/:id/assign/user`  | Assign to a user         |
| POST   | `/tasks/:id/unassign`     | Unassign                  |
| DELETE | `/tasks/:id`              | Delete (soft)            |
| GET    | `/tasks/:id/comments`     | List task comments       |
| POST   | `/tasks/:id/comments`     | Add comment               |

### Comments
| Method | Path            | Description    |
| ------ | --------------- | -------------- |
| PUT    | `/comments/:id` | Edit comment   |
| DELETE | `/comments/:id` | Delete comment |

### Requested by the frontend but not yet implemented on the backend
The web client already has API/store/hook code for these — they currently 404 against this backend:

| Method | Path                          | Used by (frontend)                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/v1/notifications`           | `api/notifications.ts`, notifications store    |
| PATCH  | `/v1/notifications/:id/read`  | `api/notifications.ts`                         |
| PATCH  | `/v1/notifications/read-all`  | `api/notifications.ts`                         |
| WS     | (a websocket endpoint)        | `hooks/use-websocket.ts`, chat page            |

None of these have a corresponding Go handler yet — see [Known Limitations](#known-limitations-phase-1).

---

## Frontend Overview

React 19 + TypeScript app in `web/`, built with Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS 4. In production it's embedded into the `mitra` Go binary and served by the same process as the API (see [Frontend is embedded](#frontend-is-embedded)) — there's no separate frontend server/container to run.

- **Routing** (`src/router.tsx`): auth pages (`login`, forced password change), dashboard, project list/detail with a task board, task detail, team (user directory/management, at `/team`), profile, chat, and notifications. `components/guards/RouteGuards.tsx` gates routes on auth state.
- **State** (`src/stores/`): one Zustand store per domain — `auth`, `users`, `project`, `task`, `notification`, `toast`, `ui`.
- **API layer** (`src/api/`): a thin axios client (`client.ts`) plus one module per resource (`auth`, `projects`, `tasks`, `comments`, `notifications`, `users`). The `notifications` module calls endpoints the backend doesn't expose yet (see the table above).
- **Realtime**: `hooks/use-websocket.ts` is a generic reconnecting-WebSocket hook, used by the chat page — there's no WebSocket server on the backend yet (Phase 2, see [`MITRA.md`](./MITRA.md)).
- **i18n**: `src/i18n/` provides Persian (`fa.ts`) and English (`en.ts`) dictionaries behind a React context, with RTL-aware components (`DirectionalIcon`, `LanguageSwitcher`) and a Vazirmatn variable font for Persian.
- **UI kit**: a small local component library in `src/components/ui/` (Button, Card, Modal, Toaster, DonutChart, StatCard, etc.) rather than a third-party design system.
- **Permissions**: `src/lib/permissions.ts` mirrors the backend's global-role/project owner-or-admin checks (`canManageUsers`, `canRemoveUser`, `canManageProject`) so the UI can hide actions the API would reject.

---

## Roles & Permissions

Roles are free-form `VARCHAR` values (no DB-level enum), but the app treats these as the valid set at both scopes:

| Role     | Global scope (`users.role`)                 | Project scope                          |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `owner`  | Full control; set once by the seed step       | Full control over that project            |
| `admin`  | Manage users/projects, same as owner for most checks | Manage members/tasks, same as project owner for most checks |
| `member` | Default role for anyone added by an owner/admin | Default role for anyone added to a project |
| `viewer` | Read-only (per the hierarchy diagram)         | Read-only (per the hierarchy diagram)     |

`internal/rbac/policy.go` implements the checks actually enforced today: `GetUserRole`/`IsOwnerOrAdmin` (global role, read straight off `users.role` — no separate membership table anymore), `IsProjectMember`, `IsProjectOwnerOrAdmin` — i.e. most write actions currently just require "member" or "owner/admin", not a fully granular per-permission model yet (that's Phase 3 in `MITRA.md`).

---

## Known Limitations (Phase 1)

- **No `/auth/refresh` endpoint yet** — the frontend's axios client already has retry logic wired up to call it on a 401, but the backend doesn't implement this route yet, so an expired access token currently just logs the user out and requires a fresh login.
- **No self-serve registration** — by design for now, single-tenant deployment; see the note under [Users](#users-requires-authorization-bearer).
- **Seeding requires a manual step** — `mitra seed` has to be run once explicitly (via `docker compose run --rm api ./mitra seed` or `go run . seed`); it's not triggered automatically since it depends on the `OWNER_*` env vars you set per-deployment.
- **Frontend/backend gap** — the web app already has UI, stores, and API calls for a user profile endpoint, notifications, and a WebSocket connection (chat), none of which exist on the backend yet. See the table in [API](#api-currently-implemented).
- **Presence/Realtime/Push notifications** are not yet implemented (Phase 2).
- **No Redis/NATS** — removed for cost control in Phase 1; rationale and temporary in-process workaround documented in `MITRA.md`.
- **No automated tests** in this snapshot (`internal/`, `web/`) — sqlc queries and handlers are not yet covered by integration tests.

---

## Roadmap

Summarized from [`MITRA.md`](./MITRA.md) (full detail and rationale there, in Persian):

1. **Phase 1 — Core MVP** *(current)*: auth, user/project/task CRUD, task comments, basic dashboard, scope-aware RBAC. ✅ mostly done, gaps listed above.
2. **Phase 2 — Communication & Realtime**: in-app chat over WebSocket (in-process hub, no NATS yet), push notifications (direct FCM calls, no queue yet), live task-status updates.
3. **Phase 3 — Advanced access & reporting**: full RBAC with project-level overrides, activity-log-based reporting, advanced filtering/search.
4. **Phase 4 — Desktop & optimization**: Tauri desktop packaging around the same React codebase, full offline mode for the (planned) Flutter mobile app, revisit bringing Redis/NATS back if horizontal scaling is actually needed.
