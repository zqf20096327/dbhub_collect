Nibomo (formerly Flashcards Open Source App) is an open-source AI-powered flashcards app built for serious daily study on iOS, Android, and the web. Use it to prepare for exams, learn vocabulary, memorize technical terms and facts, improve your material with AI, and review with spaced repetition. The project also includes an external agent API for terminal and AI-agent workflows.

## Card scheduling

Card scheduling uses FSRS-based spaced repetition. Detailed scheduling rules live in [docs/fsrs-scheduling-logic.md](docs/fsrs-scheduling-logic.md).

## MCP connector

The hosted MCP server is available at `https://mcp.nibomo.com/mcp` and publishes to MCP registries under `com.nibomo/flashcards`. It exposes eight tools, most of them workspace-scoped: `list_workspaces`, `sql_query`, `sql_execute`, `get_guide`, `next_review_card`, `reveal_answer`, `submit_review`, and the account-scoped `get_usage_limits`.

The dedicated review tools support one-question-at-a-time conversations and idempotent FSRS scheduling. See [conversational reviews](docs/conversational-reviews.md) for the contract shared by MCP, the in-app chat, and the Agent API, and for voice-session examples. ChatGPT Voice currently does not invoke apps/MCP; these tools do not remove that external limitation.

Interactive clients authenticate with OAuth 2.1 authorization code + PKCE and Dynamic Client Registration. Headless clients can use an `fca_` Bearer token.

The former address `https://mcp.flashcards-open-source-app.com/mcp` still serves the same server, so existing client configurations keep working. A client moved to `https://mcp.nibomo.com/mcp` authorizes once more; [backend and web deployment](docs/backend-web-deployment.md) owns why.

### Cline CLI

Create an agent API key using the [MCP connector authentication instructions](https://nibomo.com/docs/mcp-connector/#authentication). Add the following `nibomo` entry to `mcpServers` in Cline's MCP settings, preserving any existing servers and replacing `<YOUR_AGENT_KEY>` with your key:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nibomo": {
      "type": "streamableHttp",
      "url": "https://mcp.nibomo.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_AGENT_KEY>"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

Cline CLI 3.0.68 reads `~/.cline/data/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json` by default. If `CLINE_DATA_DIR` is set, use `$CLINE_DATA_DIR/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`. For an isolated profile, set `CLINE_MCP_SETTINGS_PATH` to the full path of your MCP settings file when launching Cline; this overrides the default path.

After saving, restart Cline CLI before using the tools so the new session loads the server registration. Ask: "Use Nibomo's `list_workspaces` tool to list my workspaces without changing any data." Approve that read-only call when prompted.
