## Getting Started

```bash
cp .env.example .env
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Paste the generated value into `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env`, then set `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

```bash
npm run db:up
npm install
npm run db:migrate
npm run bootstrap:admin
npm run dev
```

The bundled Docker Postgres instance listens on `127.0.0.1:${POSTGRES_PORT:-54329}`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Docker Compose

You can run the full stack in Docker:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Paste the generated value into `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env`, then set `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

If `54329` or `3000` is already in use on your machine, set `POSTGRES_PORT` and/or `APP_PORT` in `.env` before starting the stack.

The container now refuses to start if `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` or `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` still use the example placeholder values.

That starts:

- `postgres` on `127.0.0.1:${POSTGRES_PORT:-54329}` by default
- `app` on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default

If you also want the bundled MCP sidecar in Docker, use `docker compose --profile mcp up --build` and pass `BIG_BOSS_API_TOKEN` in `.env`.

The app container automatically:

- waits for Postgres to become healthy
- applies Prisma migrations
- bootstraps the first admin when `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` are set

Useful scripts:

- `npm run docker:up` starts the full stack in the background
- `npm run docker:down` stops the full stack
- `npm run docker:logs` tails the app and database logs
- `npm run db:up` still starts only Postgres for local non-Docker app development

## GHCR Image

GitHub publishes the app image to `ghcr.io/kitakitsune0x/bigbossbot`.

- `main` updates the `latest` and `main` tags
- each published build also gets a `YYYY.MM.DD` tag based on the build date
- tagged releases publish matching version tags
- if you want anonymous `docker pull` from a public VM, make the GHCR package public after the first publish
- Docker Compose uses `BIG_BOSS_IMAGE` and defaults to the GHCR image name above

## Build Versions

- `npm run build` stamps each build with a date version in `YYYY.MM.DD` format
- the build version is persisted in `.build-version` so the MCP server can report the same version after the build finishes
- set `APP_VERSION` before `npm run build` or `docker compose build` if you need to override the auto-generated date for a deterministic rebuild

## Self-Hosting

For a public repository, treat the top-level [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file as local development and single-machine testing.

For an internet-exposed VM, use [docs/vps-deploy.md](./docs/vps-deploy.md) together with [docker-compose.vps.yml](./docker-compose.vps.yml). That path is designed for a public repo, Docker-based self-hosting, GHCR image updates, Caddy-managed HTTPS, and private runtime secrets that stay only on the server.

1. Clone the repo on your server and move into the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kitakitsune0x/bigbossbot.git
cd bigbossbot
```

2. Copy the production env template and edit it on the server only.

```bash
cp .env.production.example .env.production
```

3. Replace every placeholder value in `.env.production`. At minimum, set:

- `APP_DOMAIN` to the DNS hostname pointing at your VM
- `BIG_BOSS_IMAGE=ghcr.io/kitakitsune0x/bigbossbot:YYYY.MM.DD` to pin an exact build, or leave `:latest` if you want the moving default
- `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to a long random secret
- `AUTH_REQUIRE_2FA=false` if you want authenticator setup to stay optional on signup, or `true` if you want to enforce it globally
- `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to the first admin account you want created
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `DATABASE_URL` for the bundled Postgres service

4. Pull the published containers and start the production stack.

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.production -f docker-compose.vps.yml up -d
```

5. Point your DNS `A` or `AAAA` record at the VM, open ports `80` and `443`, and let Caddy obtain the certificate automatically.

6. Follow the full VM deployment guide in [docs/vps-deploy.md](./docs/vps-deploy.md) for automatic updates, rollbacks, and Caddy setup details.

Recommended production setup:

- keep the bundled Postgres volume mounted so data survives container restarts
- update by changing `BIG_BOSS_IMAGE` to a newer `YYYY.MM.DD` tag, then run `docker compose --env-file .env.production -f docker-compose.vps.yml up -d`
- enable Watchtower later with `docker compose --profile watchtower --env-file .env.production -f docker-compose.vps.yml up -d watchtower` once your Docker tooling is up to date
- if you rebuild locally and want a pinned date tag inside the image metadata, export `APP_VERSION=YYYY.MM.DD` before `docker compose build`

## Auth Setup Notes

- `npm run db:up` starts the Docker Postgres service defined in [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml)
- `npm run db:migrate` applies the checked-in Prisma migration to the running database
- `npm run bootstrap:admin` creates the first admin using `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `AUTH_REQUIRE_2FA=true` forces every account through authenticator setup before `/dashboard`; the shipped default is optional 2FA
- `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` should be a long random secret anywhere outside disposable local development

## MCP Access

BIG BOSS BOT includes a local stdio MCP server for agents that need live read-only intel.

- Create a read-only token in `Account -> Settings -> Agent access tokens`
- Start the web app with `npm run dev`
- Start the MCP sidecar with `npm run mcp`
- Configure your client with `BIG_BOSS_BASE_URL` and `BIG_BOSS_API_TOKEN`
- Docker users can run the same sidecar with `docker compose --profile mcp run --rm mcp`

Full setup instructions, client config snippets, and the bundled Codex skill are in [docs/mcp.md](./docs/mcp.md).
