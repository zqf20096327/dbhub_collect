MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool server for AI coding agents.

## Why?

Built-in tools in AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc.) have known limitations:

- **Tab indentation breaks**: LLMs output spaces, but your project uses tabs. The built-in Edit tool writes spaces as-is, corrupting your indentation style.
- **Encoding corruption**: Editing EUC-KR, Shift-JIS, or GB18030 files silently converts them to UTF-8, breaking legacy projects.
- **Too many separate tools**: Making the agent find, install, and configure Redis CLI, MySQL client, SSH client, etc. is tedious and error-prone. agent-tool bundles 55 tools into one binary and exposes them on demand through compact profiles.
- **No reverse engineering support**: Built-in tools can't disassemble binaries, inspect PE/ELF headers, find function boundaries, or search cross-references. agent-tool includes static binary analysis (disassembly, xref, function detection), a DAP debugger, and CheatEngine-style memory tools -- giving your agent full reverse engineering capabilities.
- **Network censorship**: In some countries, government-level web filtering breaks plain `curl`/`wget` requests. agent-tool uses ECH (Encrypted Client Hello) and DoH (DNS over HTTPS) by default to work around these restrictions.

**agent-tool** solves these with agent-oriented tools that preserve project conventions while keeping model context bounded.

## Supported Agents

Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Gemini CLI, and any MCP-compatible agent.

## LLM-efficient by default

The default `core` profile exposes only 11 schemas (including `toolbox`) instead of
all 55. In a protocol-level measurement this reduced the serialized tool list from
about 84 KB (`full`) to 15 KB. For the smallest steady-state context, start with
`--profile core-lite`; its five schemas are about 6.4 KB and expose only `read`,
`write`, `edit`, `grep`, and `toolbox`. Use
`toolbox(operation="describe", tool="ssh", compact=true, tool_operation="execute")`
to load only one operation's fields and required list, then invoke it through
`toolbox(operation="call", tool="ssh", arguments={...})`. The gateway does not
depend on dynamic tool-list refresh, so it works with fixed-binding clients such as
Codex. Describe returns a tool/version-bound `schema_handle`; sending it on a later
describe returns a short unchanged acknowledgement when the schema is still current.
Common compact operations include SSH execution, MySQL queries, file copy, Windows
screenshots/clipboard images, and static-analysis operations. You can also start
with `--profile core-lite|coding|remote|analysis|full`.

Potentially large text responses default to 32K characters with a 128K hard ceiling.
Truncation is always visible and pageable tools return `next_offset` or `next_cursor`.
Local relative paths resolve against an explicit workspace, then the MCP client root.

## Features

| Tool | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Edit** | String replacement with smart indentation and encoding preservation (supports dry_run) | ✅ |
| **Read** | Encoding-aware, line-numbered reading. Defaults to 400 lines/32K chars, reports truncation and exact `next_offset`, safely handles very long lines, optional SHA-256. Flexible offset and MCP ImageContent support | ✅ |

## Key Improvements

### Smart Indentation
LLMs typically output spaces, but many projects use tabs. AgentTool auto-converts indentation to match the file's existing style.

- Reads `.editorconfig` for `indent_style` and `indent_size`
- Falls back to content-based detection (first 100 lines)
- Protects legacy files: won't convert if actual content contradicts `.editorconfig`

### Encoding Preservation
Edits preserve the original file encoding instead of forcing UTF-8.

- **Detection priority**: BOM → `.editorconfig` charset → BOM-less UTF-16 → valid UTF-8 → chardet auto-detection → fallback encoding
- **Supported**: UTF-8, UTF-8 BOM, EUC-KR, Shift-JIS, ISO-8859-1, UTF-16 (LE/BE, with or without BOM), and more
- **No false warnings on ASCII**: valid UTF-8 is verified directly, so plain ASCII files never raise a low-confidence warning
- **Line endings**: Detects LF, CRLF, CR, and mixed files. `edit` matches a multi-line `old_string` whether the file uses CRLF or LF, including files that mix both, and text inserted by `edit`/`regexreplace` follows the newline style of the region it lands in, so the rest of the file is left byte-identical

### Token-safe directory listings
`listdir` defaults to 500 entries per page and returns `next_cursor` when more
entries are available. Narrow results with `directories_only`, `files_only`,
`name_pattern` (for example `A*`), or multiple OR patterns in `include`.
Use `counts_only=true` when only matching file/directory counts are needed.

### Idle memory release
After 30 minutes with no tool call, the server returns its heap to the OS. A
stdio MCP server cannot tell an abandoned client from a quiet one -- the process
that spawned it may be alive, finished with it, and still holding the pipe open,
so no EOF ever arrives -- and exiting on that guess would break a session that
merely paused. Releasing the memory is the safe half of that trade: an instance
that once read a 50MB file settles back to its ~20MB baseline instead of holding
200MB for the rest of the machine's uptime. Open shell and ssh sessions survive,
and nothing the client can observe changes.

## Quick Start

1. Download the binary for your OS from [Releases](https://github.com/knewstimek/agent-tool/releases/latest)
2. Run `agent-tool install` (or `agent-tool install claude` for a specific agent)
3. Restart your IDE / agent
4. Done — the compact core tools are available immediately; `toolbox` describes and calls every other tool on demand

Or just ask your AI agent to do it for you:
> "Download agent-tool from https://github.com/knewstimek/agent-tool/releases/latest and run `agent-tool install`"

Any capable AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) can handle the full download → install → restart flow automatically.

### Recommended: Tell your agent to prefer agent-tool

After installing, agents will have access to agent-tool but may still default to built-in tools (Read, Edit, etc.). To ensure agents **prefer** agent-tool's encoding-aware, indentation-smart tools, add one of the instructions below.

**Code navigation tip**: For large projects, add this to your CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md to enable AST-based code navigation:

```
At the start of a session, run codegraph(op="index", path="<project_root>") to build a code index.
For several repositories sharing one graph, use codegraph(op="index", path="<db_root>", roots=["<source_root_1>", "<source_root_2>"]). Source-root provenance prevents unrelated projects with the same symbol names from contaminating candidates while explicit/transitive includes can still cross roots.
Then use codegraph for structural queries (find, callers, callees, methods, inherits) instead of grep.
```

Pick **Strict** or **Soft**:

| Mode | When to use | Instruction |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Strict** | Projects with non-UTF-8 files or mixed indentation | `ALWAYS use agent-tool MCP tools (mcp__agent-tool__*) instead of built-in file tools. agent-tool preserves file encoding and respects .editorconfig indentation settings.` |
| **Soft** | General projects | `Prefer agent-tool MCP tools (mcp__agent-tool__*) over built-in file tools when available.` |

**Where to put it:**

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code</b> — CLAUDE.md (per-project) or global instructions</summary>

**Per-project** — add to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:
```
ALWAYS use agent-tool MCP tools (mcp__agent-tool__*) instead of built-in file tools.
```

**Global** (all projects) — add to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:
```
ALWAYS use agent-tool MCP tools (mcp__agent-tool__*) instead of built-in file tools.
```

**Hard enforcement** — deny built-in file tools at the permission level via `~/.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": ["Read", "Edit", "MultiEdit", "Write", "Glob", "Grep"]
  }
}
```
This makes Claude Code's built-in file tools unavailable, so the agent is forced to use agent-tool. Recommended when you want strict enforcement without relying on prompt instructions.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Codex CLI</b> — model_instructions.md (global)</summary>

1. Add to `~/.codex/config.toml` (top-level, **not** inside `[mcp_servers.*]`):
```toml
model_instructions_file = "~/.codex/model_instructions.md"
```

2. Create `~/.codex/model_instructions.md`:
```
ALWAYS use agent-tool MCP tools (mcp__agent-tool__*) instead of built-in file tools.
```

3. Restart Codex.

**Per-project** — add to your project's `AGENTS.md` instead.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cursor / Windsurf / Cline</b> — .cursorrules or AGENTS.md</summary>

Add to your project's `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, or `AGENTS.md`:
```
ALWAYS use agent-tool MCP tools (mcp__agent-tool__*) instead of built-in file tools.
```
</details>

## Installation

### Auto-install (recommended)

```bash
# Register with all detected agents (full auto-approve — all tools)
agent-tool install

# Safe mode — only auto-approve local file tools (no SSH, HTTP, DB, shell)
agent-tool install --safe-approve

# No auto-approve — manual approval required for every tool call
agent-tool install --no-auto-approve

# Register with a specific agent
agent-tool install claude
agent-tool install claude --safe-approve

# Uninstall (removes agent-tool entry only, preserves other settings)
agent-tool uninstall          # from all agents
agent-tool uninstall claude   # from specific agent
```

**Install permission levels:**

| Level | Flag | Auto-approved tools |
|-------|------|---------------------|
| Full (default) | _(none)_ | All tools (`mcp__agent-tool__*` wildcard) |
| Safe | `--safe-approve` | 29 local-only tools (read, edit, write, grep, glob, etc.) — no SSH, HTTP, DB, bash, process control |
| None | `--no-auto-approve` | No tools — every call requires manual approval |

Approval level is independent of schema profile: installation may approve the full
namespace while the server still starts with the token-efficient `core` profile.
`toolbox` is intentionally not auto-approved by `--safe-approve`, because its
`operation=call` gateway can invoke network, shell, database, and process-control
tools. Safe-mode users should review each toolbox approval and avoid granting it a
permanent allow rule unless they intend to trust the full AgentTool namespace.

### Manual setup

**Claude Code / Cursor / Cline** (`settings.json` or `mcp.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-tool": {
      "command": "/path/to/agent-tool"
    }
  }
}
```

**Codex CLI** (`~/.codex/config.toml`):
```toml
[mcp_servers.agent-tool]
command = "/path/to/agent-tool"
```

### Options

```bash
# Select the initial schema profile (default: core)
agent-tool --profile core-lite

# Set fallback encoding for projects with non-UTF-8 files
agent-tool --fallback-encoding EUC-KR
```

Profiles are presets: `core-lite` (read/write/edit/grep/toolbox), `core` (11
schemas), `coding` (core plus broader file/build/shell tools), `remote`, `analysis`,
and `full`. At runtime, prefer the
client-independent `toolbox` gateway: `operation=describe` returns one tool's schema
(`compact=true` plus `tool_operation` limits it to one operation), and
`operation=call` invokes it through the stable toolbox binding. Re-send a returned
`schema_handle` to avoid receiving an unchanged schema again. When command
diagnostics are compacted, `operation=output` retrieves the bounded raw output by
its reported ID for 30 minutes and reports `next_offset` when paging is needed. `enable`,
`disable`, and `profile` remain available for clients that honor
`tools/list_changed`; fixed-binding clients can always keep using the gateway.

### Environment Variable

Set `AGENT_TOOL_FALLBACK_ENCODING` and/or `AGENT_TOOL_PROFILE` to avoid repeating CLI flags:

```bash
# Windows (no admin required)
setx AGENT_TOOL_FALLBACK_ENCODING EUC-KR
setx AGENT_TOOL_PROFILE coding

# Linux / macOS (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export AGENT_TOOL_FALLBACK_ENCODING=EUC-KR
export AGENT_TOOL_PROFILE=coding
```

Priority: CLI flag > environment variable > default (UTF-8).

### Local SSH/SFTP connection profiles

SSH and SFTP accept either `connection_profile` or a session-local `connection_id`,
so host, user, key, and jump-host fields do not need to be repeated. Profiles are
read from the OS user config directory at `agent-tool/connections.json`; override the
location with `AGENT_TOOL_CONNECTION_PROFILE_FILE`. Keep this file local and explicitly
ignored if it is placed inside a workspace.

```json
{
  "connections": {
    "dev": {
      "host": "192.0.2.10",
      "user": "builder",
      "key_file": "/local/path/to/id_ed25519",
      "host_key_check": "strict",
      "trusted": true
    }
  }
}
```

An initial call returns an opaque `connection_id` that remains reusable by both tools
for 30 minutes. Local profiles default to `trusted:true`; set `trusted:false` to show the
private-address warning on every call instead of once per pooled connection. This affects
only display; SSRF blocking and cloud metadata protection are unchanged. SSH also supports `quiet`, `echo_command`, and
`result_only`; the last returns compact JSON centered on `stdout`, `stderr`, and
`exit_code`. SFTP supports `quiet`, `result_only`, and `upload_many` (up to 100 files).

### Local SSH private-key conversion

`ssh_key` converts a private-key file without sending its contents over the network or
returning key material in the response. Input is auto-detected as PPK, PEM, PKCS#8, or
OpenSSH. The output format is one of `ppk`, `pem`, `pkcs8`, or `openssh`.

```json
{
  "operation": "convert",
  "input_path": "server.pem",
  "output_path": "server.ppk",
  "output_format": "ppk",
  "input_passphrase": "",
  "output_passphrase": "",
  "overwrite": false
}
```

PPK output uses version 3. Passphrase-protected PPK output uses Argon2id,
AES-256-CBC, and HMAC-SHA-256; protected OpenSSH output uses OpenSSH's modern
encrypted format. Traditional PEM and PKCS#8 output are deliberately unencrypted;
use `openssh` or `ppk` when output encryption is required. New files are mode 0600,
and existing files are not replaced unless `overwrite=true`.

### Runtime Configuration

Agents can change settings at runtime via `set_config` without restarting:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `fallback_encoding` | Fallback encoding when auto-detection fails | `UTF-8` |
| `encoding_warnings` | Show encoding detection warnings | `true` |
| `max_file_size_mb` | Max file size for read/edit/grep (MB) | `100` |
| `allow_symlinks` | Allow symlink extraction from tar archives | `false` |
| `workspace` | Explicit local workspace root. Otherwise the first MCP client root is used, then cwd | _(MCP root/cwd)_ |
| `allow_http_private` | Allow webfetch/download/httpreq to access private IPs | `false` |
| `allow_mysql_private` | Allow mysql tool to access private IPs | `true` |
| `allow_redis_private` | Allow redis tool to access private IPs | `true` |
| `allow_ssh_private` | Allow ssh/sftp tools to access private IPs | `true` |
| `enable_doh` | Enable DNS over HTTPS globally (webfetch/download/httpreq/dnslookup) | `true` |
| `enable_ech` | Enable Encrypted Client Hello globally (webfetch/download/httpreq) | `true` |

## Build

```bash
go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w" -o agent-tool .
```

Cross-compile:
```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w" -o agent-tool .
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w" -o agent-tool .
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w" -o agent-tool.exe .
```

## Release

The guarded GitHub workflow runs tests, builds all declared assets, creates the MCPB and checksums,
and verifies uploaded bytes. From a clean, pushed `master` branch, dispatch a build-only dry run:

```powershell
.\scripts\release.ps1
```

After the dry run succeeds, publish the version declared in `main.go`:

```powershell
.\scripts\release.ps1 -Publish
```

The workflow requires tracked notes at `docs/releases/vVERSION.md`. Publication creates an
annotated tag and GitHub Release, then updates `server.json` with the released MCPB hash.
When RepoPlane uses this repository as its workspace, the same dry-run, publish, and status
operations are discoverable through the repository-local `catalog/` manifests.

## Troubleshooting

### Garbled text (encoding issues)

If Korean, Japanese, or other non-ASCII text appears as garbage characters:

**Option 1**: Add `charset` to your `.editorconfig`:
```ini
[*]
charset = euc-kr
```

**Option 2**: Set environment variable (persistent):
```bash
setx AGENT_TOOL_FALLBACK_ENCODING EUC-KR   # Windows
export AGENT_TOOL_FALLBACK_ENCODING=EUC-KR  # Linux
```

**Option 3**: CLI flag (per-session):
```bash
agent-tool --fallback-encoding EUC-KR
```

### Built-in help for agents

agent-tool includes a `agent_tool_help` tool that agents can call for usage guidance. When an agent encounters encoding warnings or garbled text, it can call:

```json
{ "tool": "agent_tool_help", "arguments": { "topic": "encoding" } }
```

Available topics: `overview`, `encoding`, `indentation`, `tools`, `troubleshooting`

## Security

agent-tool provides powerful system access (SSH, MySQL, Redis, file operations, HTTP requests).
When used with AI coding agents, be aware of prompt injection risks:

- **SSRF Protection**: Cloud metadata IPs (169.254.x.x, fe80::/10) are always blocked regardless of settings. Private IP access is configurable per protocol via `set_config` (`allow_http_private`, `allow_mysql_private`, `allow_redis_private`, `allow_ssh_private`)
- **DLP (Data Loss Prevention)**: All outbound HTTP request bodies are scanned for sensitive data patterns (PEM private keys, AWS access keys, GitHub/GitLab tokens, Slack tokens, .env file dumps) and **blocked before transmission**
- **Prompt Injection Warnings**: Allowed private IP connections show a compact warning; trusted local SSH/SFTP profiles show it once per pooled connection
- **Zip Slip protection**: Archive entries with `../` path traversal are blocked (both zip and tar)
- **Zip Bomb protection**: Single file limit (1GB), total extraction limit (5GB)
- **Symlinks**: Skipped by default. Enable via `set_config allow_symlinks=true` (tar only; zip symlinks always skipped). Even when enabled, symlinks targeting outside the output directory are blocked
- **File size limit**: Configurable max file size (default 100MB) prevents OOM on large files. Adjustable via `set_config max_file_size_mb=N`
- **Encoding safety**: chardet uses 64KB sample (not full file) for memory efficiency

For maximum security, review the AI agent's tool calls before approving, especially for SSH commands, HTTP requests to external URLs, and database queries.
