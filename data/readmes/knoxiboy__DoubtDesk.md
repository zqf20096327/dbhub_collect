## Problem Statement

Students in colleges and universities face a recurring set of challenges that existing tools fail to address:

- **Doubts go unanswered.** Asking questions in large lectures is intimidating, and instructors are not available around the clock.
- **No structured Q&A channel.** WhatsApp and Telegram groups are chaotic — doubts get buried, and solutions are never archived or searchable.
- **Teachers lack visibility.** Instructors have no data on which topics students struggle with until exam results arrive, which is too late to intervene.
- **Existing platforms miss the mark.** Stack Overflow targets professional developers, not structured academics. ChatGPT lacks classroom context, anonymity, and teacher oversight.

DoubtDesk bridges this gap by combining AI-powered instant solving with real classroom structure, giving students answers in seconds and teachers insights in real time.

---

## Solution

DoubtDesk provides a virtual classroom environment where:

1. **Students ask doubts** via text or image (photo of a handwritten problem).
2. **AI instantly solves** the doubt with step-by-step, simplified, and exam-ready explanations.
3. **Community and teachers** can also answer, creating a layered support system.
4. **Analytics dashboard** surfaces weak topics, peak doubt hours, and resolution rates so teachers can act proactively.
5. **Moderation engine** keeps the platform academic and safe using AI content filtering with an escalating strike system.

---

## Features

### AI Doubt Solver
- Type a question or upload a photo — AI solves it instantly using Groq-accelerated LLMs.
- Structured output: Step-by-step breakdown, simplified explanation, and final answer.
- Interactive follow-ups: click any step to ask for further clarification.
- Full LaTeX rendering for math and science equations via KaTeX.
- Persistent chat history for continuing previous AI sessions.

### Virtual Classrooms
- Teachers create classrooms with unique invite codes.
- Students join using invite codes; recommended classrooms auto-surface by university and year.
- Three doubt channels per class: **AI Solve**, **Community Board**, **Teacher Lane**.
- Role-based views (Student vs Teacher) with distinct capabilities.
- Anonymous posting — students are assigned randomized identifiers (e.g., `Student_A7X`) to encourage participation without fear.

### Classroom Analytics
- **Topic Difficulty Heatmap** — highlights which subjects have the most doubts.
- **Resolution Pulse** — solved vs. pending ratio with circular progress visualization.
- **Peak Activity Timeline** — 24-hour bar chart showing when students are most active.
- **Personal AI Mentor** — per-student weak-topic detection after sufficient engagement.

### Moderation and Safety
- AI-powered content moderation flags abusive, off-topic, or spam content before it is posted.
- 3-strike system with escalating temporary account blocks (3 days for first block, increasing for subsequent violations).
- Full audit trail via moderation logs table for admin review.

### Privacy Model
- Doubts and replies are attributed to other users only by an anonymized, non-reversible handle (e.g. `Student_7F3Q2`) — never by the author's email or any other personal identifier.
- The real author is stored server-side for ownership, moderation, karma, and notifications, but is never serialized into any API response or client payload.
- Ownership is conveyed to clients via a server-computed `isOwnPost` flag rather than by exposing identifiers. See [docs/PRIVACY.md](docs/PRIVACY.md) for the full model and enforcement details.

### Public Doubt Board
- Open community board (no classroom required) with subject filters.
- Like, reply, and mark doubts as solved.
- Accessible to all authenticated users.

### User Profiles
- Personal dashboard showing doubts asked, replies given, and classrooms joined.
- Activity statistics including helpful votes received.

## Demo Access

A live instance of DoubtDesk is deployed at **[doubt-desk-seven.vercel.app](https://doubt-desk-seven.vercel.app/)**.

To explore the full classroom experience without setting up your own environment, use the sample classroom below after signing in:

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Classroom Invite Code** | `DNOIRL` |

**Steps to access:**
1. Visit the [live demo](https://doubt-desk-seven.vercel.app/).
2. Sign up or sign in using Clerk authentication.
3. Complete the onboarding flow (select your university, year, and role).
4. Navigate to **Classrooms** and click **Join Classroom**.
5. Enter the invite code `DNOIRL` to join the sample classroom.
6. Explore all features: post a doubt, use the AI solver, view the community board, and check analytics.

> **Note for contributors:** Using the demo classroom is strongly recommended before working on any issue. It provides context for how the platform works end-to-end.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18 or higher
- **npm** (bundled with Node.js)
- **Git**
- API keys for the following services:
  - [Clerk](https://clerk.com) — Authentication
  - [Neon](https://neon.tech) — PostgreSQL database
  - [Groq](https://console.groq.com) — AI inference

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository (click Fork on GitHub)

# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/DoubtDesk.git
cd DoubtDesk

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your API keys (see Environment Variables below)

# 5. Start the development server
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Docker

Run DoubtDesk in a container using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose v2. External services (Neon, Clerk, Groq) are **not** containerized — configure them in `.env` as usual.

**Prerequisites:** Docker Desktop or Docker Engine with Compose v2.

```bash
# 1. Configure environment (required before first run)
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in Neon, Clerk, Groq, and other required keys

# 2. Apply database migrations against your Neon instance (one-time / as needed)
npx drizzle-kit migrate

# 3. Build and run the production image
docker compose build
docker compose up
# Open http://localhost:3000

# Stop containers
docker compose down
```

**Development with hot reload:**

```bash
docker compose --profile dev up app-dev
```

| Topic | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Required env vars** | Same as [`.env.example`](.env.example) and [`docs/SETUP.md`](docs/SETUP.md) |
| **Not containerized** | Neon PostgreSQL, Clerk, Groq, Inngest, Upstash, Resend |
| **Clerk redirects** | Use `http://localhost:3000` in Clerk dashboard and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` |
| **Build-time vars** | `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are baked at image build; rebuild after changing them |
| **Migrations** | Run `npx drizzle-kit migrate` locally before first Docker run |
| **Inngest webhooks** | `/api/inngest` needs a public tunnel (e.g. ngrok) to test background jobs locally |
| **Video generation** | Remotion/ffmpeg may need extra system libraries; test natively if Docker video fails |

### Environment Variables

DoubtDesk relies on several external services (Clerk, Neon, Groq, Inngest, etc.). 

For a complete breakdown of which services are strictly required versus optional, along with a setup verification checklist, please read the **[Local Environment Setup Guide](docs/SETUP.md)**.

> **Security:** Never commit your `.env` file. It is already included in `.gitignore`.

2. **Comment on the issue** to indicate you are working on it.
3. **Fork and clone** the repository.
4. **Join the demo classroom** using invite code `DNOIRL` to understand the product before writing code.
5. **Create a branch** following the naming convention:
   - `feature/add-dark-mode-toggle`
   - `fix/classroom-invite-validation`
   - `docs/update-readme-screenshots`
6. **Make focused changes** with clear, conventional commit messages.
7. **Test locally** using `npm run dev`.
8. **Submit a PR** against the `main` branch.

### Commit Message Format

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard:

```
feat: add loading skeleton to AI solver
fix: handle empty classroom state gracefully
docs: add screenshots to README
style: improve mobile responsiveness of classroom cards
refactor: extract doubt card into reusable component
```

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript with proper interfaces — avoid `any` types.
- Follow the existing component structure in `/components` and `/app`.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling, matching the existing dark theme (slate-950 backgrounds, blue-500/600 accents, glassmorphism patterns).
- Keep components focused: one file, one responsibility.
