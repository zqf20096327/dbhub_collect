## $MEERKAT is live on Robinhood Chain

**Official CA:** `0x7730e0066e26a8e033a7ebbd51f6af0b94394d96`

[Trade on PONS](https://www.ponsfamily.com/launchpad/0x7730e0066e26a8e033a7ebbd51f6af0b94394d96) · [View contract](https://robinhoodchain.blockscout.com/token/0x7730e0066e26a8e033a7ebbd51f6af0b94394d96) · [Open MEERKAT](https://meerkat.my/)

> **Project status:** the public evidence terminal is live at [meerkat.my](https://meerkat.my/terminal). Transparent token scoring, installation-scoped wallet scoring, lifecycle reconstruction, fee flow and relationship views run against Robinhood Chain today. The MEERKAT token is live on Robinhood Chain.

## What it looks like

**Radar V2 is the default terminal view.** It continuously indexes verified Pons launches, ranks signals from cached evidence, and keeps Fresh, Exits, Launches, and Wallets one click away. Global search accepts a token name, symbol, token contract, or wallet address.

![MEERKAT Radar V2 with ranked token signals and global search](docs/assets/radar-v2.png)

| Connected token dossier | Connected wallet dossier |
| --- | --- |
| Radar Strength, Launch Quality, qualified buyers, fee flow, relationships, holders, and the paginated event timeline stay attached to the token. | Wallet Reputation, attributed positions, realized/open PnL, recent fills, shared-wallet context, Pons profile, and transaction evidence stay attached to the wallet. |
| ![MEERKAT Token Dossier V2](docs/assets/token-dossier-v2.png) | ![MEERKAT Wallet Dossier V2](docs/assets/wallet-dossier-v2.png) |

**Leaderboard ranks wallets by evidence-backed performance.** Eligible rows require at least three completed attributed positions and no material transfer gap. Provisional wallets remain visible but cannot outrank eligible wallets.

![MEERKAT wallet PnL leaderboard](docs/assets/leaderboard-v2.png)

**Score first, then inspect the reasons.** The Overview keeps the token score, confidence, index coverage, market activity and source links in one workspace. This capture uses the real HOP OUT token on Robinhood Chain.

**Follow creator revenue to its current recipient.** Fee Flow separates curve payouts from pool payouts, reconstructs routing changes and links the recipient to its wallet dossier, Pons profile and Blockscout evidence.

![MEERKAT Fee Flow showing the HOP OUT payout route and exact indexed revenue](docs/assets/fee-flow.png)

**See who interacted with the token and in which direction.** Relationship Map separates BUY and SELL flows, current holders and direct wallet routes. Every wallet node opens the observed activity behind it.

| Reconstructed current holders | Paginated lifecycle evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Balances and supply shares come from indexed ERC-20 transfers and remain marked partial until the captured head is complete. | Timeline loads 50 events at a time, colors BUY and SELL separately and links every row to its transaction. |

## What MEERKAT does

Use global search in `/terminal` to find a Pons V2 token or open a public wallet explicitly. MEERKAT keeps four destinations—**Radar**, **Leaderboard**, **Watchlist**, and **Activity**—and opens token and wallet dossiers as linked detail routes:

- launch identity, deployer, pair, curve, tax and current phase;
- curve buys and sells with attributed initiating addresses;
- factory phase transitions, pool swaps and ERC-20 transfers;
- exact block, transaction, log index, quantities and venue for every event;
- participant summaries such as early entry and fast exit, with the rule shown;
- token score components for deployer exposure, creator tax, participant breadth, two-sided market activity and reconstructed current-holder breadth;
- wallet score components for local scope, early discovery, two-sided activity and evidence depth;
- exact creator-fee flow from curve and pool sweep events, including the current recipient and recipient-change history;
- three relationship views: directional trade flow, reconstructed current holders and direct wallet-to-wallet transfer routes;
- a wallet inspector on every graph node with observed roles, buys, sells, token amounts, current reconstructed balance and supply share;
- a wallet dossier across every token history stored on the same installation.

Token evidence is split into five persistent views: **Overview & Score**, **Fee Flow**, **Relationships**, **Wallets & Holders**, and **Timeline**. The Timeline loads only when opened, fetches 50 newest events at a time, and can filter BUY, SELL, TRANSFER, and FEES evidence without placing the complete history in the browser.

BUY evidence is green, SELL evidence is red, transfers are amber and unattributed activity is gray throughout the terminal. Trade Flow can isolate BUY or SELL wallets and places them around the token; Current Holders and Wallet Routes show each displayed wallet's indexed buy/sell counts. Missing evidence lowers the score's confidence and remains visible. Holder balances are reconstructed from indexed ERC-20 Transfer events; while an index is incomplete, the holder view is explicitly marked partial. A score is a summary of observed evidence, not a safety rating, price prediction, beneficial-ownership claim, realized profit, bot identity, or investment-skill verdict.

## Run it

Requires **Node.js 24** and a Robinhood Chain RPC endpoint.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kocer6/MEERKAT.git
cd MEERKAT
npm ci
npm start
```

Use the [public terminal](https://meerkat.my/terminal), or open [http://127.0.0.1:4664/](http://127.0.0.1:4664/) after a local install. Select **Open terminal** and paste a token or wallet address. The default RPC and database path work without adding secrets. See the [local setup guide](docs/LOCAL-SETUP.md) for configuration and troubleshooting.

## Connected investigations

| Mode | Input | Result | Current boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Token** | Pons V2 token address | Five focused views for score, fee flow, relationships, holders and lifecycle evidence | Timeline pages load 50 events at a time; the full indexed history stays in SQLite |
| **Wallet** | Public EVM address selected explicitly | Reputation, positions, completed outcomes, recent actions, Pons profile and exact transaction links | Transfer gaps withhold open/total PnL and leaderboard eligibility |

Radar is the live market-wide list. Global search replaces the former Analyze destination: it opens a registered token directly and asks before treating an unclassified contract-shaped address as a wallet. Watchlist is stored in the current browser; Activity contains material score-band and market changes from the persistent index.

PnL uses attributed curve fills and weighted-average cost in pair-token units. Native-pair launches display ETH. Open and total PnL appear only after an executable sell quote is captured; missing quotes and material transfer gaps remain `UNKNOWN`. MEERKAT does not invent USD values.

The landing page, terminal, APIs, indexer, state, and database all run inside one local Node.js process. The browser never receives a signing route because the server has none.

## Verified evidence

The current checkpoint was exercised against Robinhood Chain using COPY (`0xac79255f6f404eba14f316e8669d76573a2d7b1e`):

- factory launch resolved at block `59,283,454`;
- an interrupted job resumed from its saved profile and 64-block overlap;
- the captured head `60,319,607` completed with `41,302` persisted events;
- `25` curve participants were attributed and the bounded relationship API returned `48` nodes and `96` routes.

This is evidence for one real token and captured head, not a claim that every token is fully indexed. Reproduction details and known limits are in the [full backfill note](docs/evidence/copy-backfill-relationship-2026-09-11.md).

The dense ZZZ token (`0x7dbf38976f6d3b9c529e7d9484a71898b409ee6a`) was also opened through the packaged terminal. At the completed captured head, MEERKAT loaded `741,643` persisted events, `29` attributed curve participants, a transparent `93/100` token score, and `16` displayed reconstructed holders. Wallet Routes rendered transfer evidence only. The live head continues to advance, so a refresh can temporarily return the score to `CALIBRATING` while the new tail is indexed.

HOP OUT (`0x78f13072b0f6ebc7fd0b5359c9b4e09c6160cff8`) verified the creator-fee path at captured head `60,571,478`: `26` token-specific sweep events paid `1.177461500182357592 ETH` in total, split between `0.472838185133738444 ETH` from the curve and `0.704623315048619148 ETH` from the pool. The configured recipient differs from the deployer, so the terminal labels the route `ROUTED AT LAUNCH`. The recipient escrow balance is displayed separately because it aggregates assets across launches and is not this token's revenue.

## How an address becomes evidence

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Token or wallet address] --> B[Collect local evidence]
  B --> C[Score plus confidence]
  C --> D[Show component reasons]
  D --> E[Lifecycle and relationships]
  E --> F[Blocks and transaction links]
```

Every label is derived from an explicit rule. For example, an **early entry** is a curve buy within 30 blocks of launch, and a **fast exit** is a sell within 300 blocks of that wallet's first indexed buy. Read the complete [analysis contract](docs/ANALYSIS.md).
