[![Release: 1.5.0 Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-1.5.0%20Stable-16803c.svg)](RELEASE_NOTES.md)
[![Runtime: SWI-Prolog](https://img.shields.io/badge/runtime-SWI--Prolog-E61B23.svg)](https://www.swi-prolog.org/)

AsaDB is a local-first SQL database runtime powered by SWI-Prolog. It ships
with AsAPanel, a login-first web workspace for creating databases, running SQL,
importing/exporting data, and inspecting tables without a cloud dependency.

Current release: **v1.5.0 Stable**. The publication artifact
`AsaDB-1.5.0-linux-x86_64.tar.Z` is a complete open-source distribution
validated for Linux x86_64. It does not bundle SWI-Prolog; see
[RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) and [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md).

## Release order

| Version | Status | Main focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1.5.0** | **Current Stable** | Local TVCC reader snapshots, view-aware interchange, bounded ordering, and release-integrity checks. |
| 1.4.0 | Superseded Stable | Backend-owned, integrity-checked `.asb` backup and restore. |
| 1.3.1 | Superseded Release Candidate | SQL completion/coloring and Windows source-launcher delivery. |
| 1.3.0 | Historical Stable | Reservoir, paged results, and indexed equality joins. |

The table is newest-first. Detailed release scope, validation, and limits are
kept in [RELEASE_NOTES.md](RELEASE_NOTES.md); only 1.5.0 describes the current
supported release contract.

## SWI-Prolog pack

AsaDB has a first-class `asadb` pack manifest and an embeddable
`library(asadb)` API. **One Pack, Two Modes** contains the complete CLI, panel
backend, frontend assets, engine, Flask Server source, offline Python
wheelhouse, launchers, examples, documentation, and tests. After publication
to the SWI-Prolog pack server, the normal cross-platform commands are:

```sh
swipl pack install asadb
swipl pack install --upgrade asadb
swipl pack info asadb
swipl pack remove asadb
```

Before publication, an extracted release or checkout includes the portable
repository helper: `swipl -q -s tools/asadb_pack.pl -- install`. It follows
the official repository and retains the canonical `asadb` pack name on both
Linux and Windows. `swipl install asadb` is not a stock SWI-Prolog command;
use the documented `swipl pack ...` form instead. See
[docs/swi-prolog-pack.md](docs/swi-prolog-pack.md) for repository, stable,
upgrade, remove, API, and publishing commands.
The command semantics are based on SWI-Prolog's official
[`library(prolog_pack)` guide](https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=prologpack)
and its [pack application mechanism](https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=swipl-app).

After installation, start AsaDB on Linux or Windows with exactly one command:

```sh
swipl asadb
```

The first run builds the bundled offline Python gateway in a per-user location,
asks for the first administrator once, registers `data.asa`, then opens
`http://127.0.0.1:2026/login`. Login always comes before selecting Local
Workspace (loopback only) or Server Workspace. Flask only hosts and protects
the web/API boundary: the SWI-Prolog backend remains the sole SQL parser,
executor, transaction manager, and `.asa` storage engine. No `pip install` or
manual virtual environment is required.

Use `swipl asadb --help` for the explicit local CLI, maintenance, or remote
commands. `swipl asadb` requires SWI-Prolog 9.1.18 or newer; this is the
version where pack applications became available. See
[the pack guide](docs/swi-prolog-pack.md) for offline/repository installation
and upgrade/removal commands.

## Server Mode: login-first web delivery

Server Mode turns one local AsaDB installation into an authenticated web
workspace without adding a second SQL engine. The bundled Python component
handles HTTP, login sessions, role checks, registered physical database files,
and operational endpoints; it starts and proxies the official Prolog web
backend. Prolog remains the authority for SQL parsing, query execution,
transactions, TVCC, Reservoir jobs, backup/restore, import/export, and `.asa`
storage.

Start the normal local portal:

```sh
swipl asadb
```

On first use it asks for an administrator and opens
`http://127.0.0.1:2026/login`. Sign in, choose **Local Workspace** or
**Server Workspace**, then use **Admin** for users, database registration,
jobs, health, and safe mutable settings. Useful operational commands are:

```sh
swipl asadb doctor --json
swipl asadb start --host 127.0.0.1 --port 2026
swipl asadb server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 2026
```

`start` performs first-run setup when necessary; `server` is for an already
initialized service. Keep the service bound to loopback and place TLS/public
exposure behind a reverse proxy. Never expose the raw panel or its private
Prolog backend directly to an untrusted network.

Current server mode is one control-plane process around local Prolog-backed `.asa` files, with one writer
per physical file and asynchronous snapshot-based replication where enabled.
See SiriDB's [database administration overview](https://docs.siridb.com/database/)
and [server/pool/replica model](https://docs.siridb.com/overview/server_pool_replica/)
for the architectural references; see AsaDB's
[server feature matrix](flaskserver/FEATURE_MATRIX.md) and
[boundaries](flaskserver/docs/LIMITATIONS.md) for the implemented scope.

AsaDB is developed in the open under **GNU GPL v3.0 only**. Bug reports, test
cases, documentation, storage-engine review, and code contributions are
welcome. Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the
[project governance guide](GOVERNANCE.md).

## What Makes It Different

- Prolog-backed SQL parser, executor, catalog, and storage.
- Local `.asa` database files with journal-style persistence.
- A durable Reservoir bridge spools writes before the backend pulls bounded
  batches, preventing duplicate submissions and unbounded browser pressure.
- Windows source launchers run the same backend through an installed
  SWI-Prolog; the separately embedded portable executable is rebuilt on Windows.
- AsAPanel runs on `127.0.0.1` and auto-selects a free port.
- Browser UI stays usable for big SQL files by sending imports to the Prolog backend.
- Asa Process Guardian is an opt-in source-mirror and process-supervision tool;
  it is isolated from SQL execution and the database storage path.

## 1.5.0 Stable highlights

v1.5.0 keeps the 1.4.0 backend-owned backup design and adds local snapshot
reads, view-aware interchange, and faster bounded ordering:

- The SQL editor offers lightweight schema-aware completion for AsaDB keywords,
  supported types and functions, local database/table/view names, declared
  aliases, and table columns. It uses the local catalog and no editor framework.
- SQL coloring recognizes the supported lexer surface consistently in the
  modern and Firefox-38-compatible bundles; ID, JP, and EN now share the same
  Noto Sans JP family for a consistent interface.
- `ORDER BY *` keeps its established no-op meaning without materializing and
  sorting every matching row, so a bounded result query can stop at its result
  window. Semicolon diagnostics are invalidated immediately while a query is
  being edited, preventing stale "missing ;" feedback.
- Asa Process Guardian provides an opt-in, SQL-isolated SHA-256 source mirror
  and bounded process supervision for operators who want launcher health and
  recovery records.
- Local TVCC gives eligible read-only panel `SELECT` requests an immutable
  catalog plus storage generation. It retains one writer and keeps active SQL
  transactions on their established read-your-writes path.
- Selected views appear in the export picker. MySQL/PostgreSQL preserve their
  definitions, while CSV/XLSX materialize view rows through the backend.
- The bounded projected `ORDER BY` path caches each matching row's sort key and
  merges sorted buffers; equal keys retain scan order. An unindexed order still
  scans qualifying rows, while `ORDER BY *` stays the historical no-op.
- The release set includes a checksummed Windows source-launcher ZIP with the
  same source revision and batch launchers for an installed SWI-Prolog.
- **Production export is now a real backend backup.** AsAPanel creates an
  `.asb` artifact by scanning the database record store on the server; it does
  not reconstruct a database from browser cache or the visible result window.
  The artifact contains schema, rows, indexes, and catalog objects, and binds
  its manifest and SQL payload with SHA-256 integrity checks.
- **Restore is verified before commit.** AsaDB rejects malformed or altered
  production backups, restores into a transaction, re-scans table and row
  totals before commit, and refuses backup creation or restore while another
  database transaction is active.
- **Portable exchange stays backend-owned.** MySQL SQL, PostgreSQL SQL, CSV,
  and XLSX export scan stored rows in Prolog instead of browser cache. Uploaded
  interchange enters Reservoir and the normal transactional importer; CSV and
  XLSX use bounded sampling and row streaming.

## Production backups

Use **Export → AsaDB Backup** while the local backend is online. The browser
downloads a complete `.asb` file directly from the backend; it is suitable for
moving or retaining a database backup, unlike a partial browser-side export.
Importing an `.asb` verifies its format, payload and integrity manifest before
the restore transaction can commit. Keep the resulting file with the same care
as the database because it contains the database's logical contents.

For a consistent snapshot, the backend serializes the database while it scans
the record store. On a busy production panel, schedule large backups so normal
write traffic can wait for the snapshot, and leave sufficient local temporary
disk space for the generated artifact.

For selected-table exchange, choose MySQL, PostgreSQL, CSV, or XLSX in the
same Export page. These are portable interchange artifacts rather than
authenticated backups. See [docs/interchange.md](docs/interchange.md) for
format behavior, input limits, and regression commands.

## Why 1.5.0 Stable improves on 1.4.0 Stable

- Read-only panel queries can use a bounded immutable local snapshot, so a
  reader sees catalog and page files from the same committed generation.
- Production backup remains a backend-produced, checksummed `.asb` snapshot;
  it is regression-tested with TVCC rather than reverting to browser state.
- Portable interchange now includes selected views without silently dropping
  them: SQL dialects retain definitions and CSV/XLSX export backend results.
- Filtered, projected ordering no longer reevaluates sort expressions for every
  comparison in the bounded result window.

## 1.5.0 Stable Package Contents

Every 1.5.0 source package includes the SQL engine, page storage, B+Tree and
metadata layers, Reservoir bridge, AsAPanel modern and compatibility bundles,
ID/JP/EN assets, tests, build scripts, SWI-Prolog `app/asadb.pl`, Linux/POSIX
launchers, Windows batch launchers, operational guardian, and GPL notices. The
Linux and main-source archives are gzip-compressed tar streams under `.tar.Z`;
the Windows source-launcher is a ZIP with its own SHA-256 file.

The Windows ZIP is a source/runtime-launcher package, not a relabelled native
executable: install SWI-Prolog first. The portable executable remains a
separate Windows-native build target.

## 1.4.0 Stable checkpoint

1.4.0 established the backend-produced `.asb` backup and verified restore
path. The current 1.5.0 line preserves that production-backup contract while
adding local reader snapshots, view-aware interchange, and bounded ordering.
See the ordered comparison in [RELEASE_NOTES.md](RELEASE_NOTES.md).

## 1.3.0 Stable historical highlights

v1.3.0 fixes the aliased JOIN path and makes the source release practical on
Linux systems with minimal shells:

- Qualified aliases such as `field m` and `zone z` now resolve `m.No` and
  `z.No` correctly, including case-insensitive table and column identifiers.
- Qualified equality joins use an AVL-backed lookup index instead of comparing
  every left row with every right row. Two 15,000-row inputs no longer imply
  225 million candidate comparisons.
- `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN` share the fast path for simple
  `alias.column = alias.column` conditions; complex predicates retain the
  compatible nested-loop fallback.
- Planner metadata exposes `indexed_joins` and `nested_loop_joins` counters.
- A 15,000 + 15,000 row regression reproduces the `field m` / `zone z` case,
  verifies the alias result, validates all 15,000 matches, and enforces a
  bounded join execution time.
- Linux launchers are POSIX `/bin/sh` scripts and have been syntax-checked with
  `dash`; the same syntax is suitable for BusyBox `sh` used by minimalist
  distributions such as 4MLinux.
- Runtime diagnostics, 4MLinux-specific install notes, source-release tooling,
  `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, and Linux GitHub Actions CI are included.
- The Linux package has a clean explicit manifest and a separately published
  `.sha256` file; runtime databases, logs, spools, and Windows binaries are not
  included.
- AsAPanel now switches its complete interface and Asa feedback between
  Indonesian (ID), Japanese (JP), and English (EN), with the selector alongside
  the Save and Delete database buttons and the preference kept in local browser
  storage.
- Long SQL paste keeps its caret and scroll viewport instead of snapping to the
  first line; large scripts retain virtualized line numbers.
- AsAPanel no longer holds every refresh behind a fixed 3.5-second warmup
  screen or sends a second browser-side warmup request. It shows a compact
  650 ms visual cue that never captures clicks or keyboard focus.
- The browser entry point loads a checked-in Firefox-38-compatible UI bundle
  with small API polyfills (including `NodeList.forEach` and `Element.append`),
  so an older DOM cannot leave a static panel with dead buttons.
- DROP TABLE is verified against the backend before the browser catalog is
  changed, while the core regression confirms catalog persistence plus physical
  heap and B+Tree cleanup after restart.
- Static UI localization, SQL syntax, persistence, storage, Reservoir, and the
  15,000-row JOIN path have dedicated regression coverage.

The source distribution requires a feature-complete SWI-Prolog on `PATH`.
4MLinux does not ship a general package manager, so its SWI-Prolog runtime must
be provided separately; this support is conditional until the included runtime
and regression checks pass on the target machine. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Reservoir System

The v1.3.0 source tree includes `src/bridge/reservoir.pl`, a bounded and durable
adapter between AsAPanel and the SQL executor. It is not another database and
does not replace the page manager, buffer pool, transaction manager, or WAL.
It controls pressure at the JavaScript-to-Prolog boundary:

- write commands and large SQL payloads are spooled to disk in 256 KB chunks;
- admission limits both active jobs and reserved spool bytes;
- one worker serializes mutations through the existing execution mutex;
- idempotency keys plus SHA-256 fingerprints suppress safe retries;
- progress, cancellation, result paging, and queue statistics have dedicated
  localhost API endpoints;
- queued jobs survive restart, while interrupted in-flight writes are not
  replayed automatically because that could duplicate a partially committed
  command;
- job state is append-only and result publication uses temporary-file rename.

Small read-only queries still use the direct low-latency path. See
[docs/reservoir.md](docs/reservoir.md) for the state machine, failure model,
configuration, and API contract.

Historical changes and benchmark context are retained in
[RELEASE_NOTES.md](RELEASE_NOTES.md) and
[BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md](BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md). The v1.3.0 root causes, exact
fixes, validation, and remaining optimizer limits are summarized in
[BUGFIX_REPORT.txt](BUGFIX_REPORT.txt).

## Supported SQL Surface

Stable core:

- `CREATE DATABASE`, `DROP DATABASE`, `USE`
- `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE TABLE`
- `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- `SHOW DATABASES`, `SHOW TABLES`, `SHOW INDEX`, `DESCRIBE`
- `ALTER TABLE` for add/drop/modify/change/rename column flows
- `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, `LIMIT offset,count`, `LIMIT count OFFSET offset`
- `WHERE` expressions, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `IS NULL`
- `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`
- `GROUP BY` with `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`
- Basic subqueries: scalar, `IN (SELECT ...)`, `EXISTS`
- `UNION`, `CASE WHEN`, `CONCAT`
- `CREATE VIEW` and selecting from views
- Transaction commands: `BEGIN`, `START TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`
- Basic user/grant catalog: `CREATE USER`, `GRANT`, `REVOKE`, `SHOW GRANTS`, `LOGIN`
- Metadata routines: `CREATE/DROP TRIGGER`, `CREATE/DROP PROCEDURE`, `CREATE/DROP FUNCTION`

User rows now live in persistent 4 KB slotted heap pages. Indexed equality,
range, and simple ordered scans use persistent B+Tree files with linked leaf
pages. The bounded buffer pool uses a Clock-style policy with pin/unpin and dirty
tracking. Recovery uses append undo records, page mutation backups, transaction
snapshots, atomic catalog replacement, and bounded local TVCC snapshots for
concurrent `SELECT` requests. TVCC retains at most three complete committed
generations and keeps one writer; it is not a distributed lock manager,
cross-process concurrency layer, full SQL-standard MVCC, or ARIES.
See [the local TVCC design](docs/tvcc.md) for its visibility, retention, and
performance boundaries.

Runtime limits are configured in `asadb.conf`. Keep each `.asa` catalog together
with its matching `.asa.store` directory when moving a database.

## Running The Linux x86_64 Release

Verify and extract the publication files:

```sh
sha256sum -c AsaDB-1.5.0-linux-x86_64.tar.Z.sha256
tar -xzf AsaDB-1.5.0-linux-x86_64.tar.Z
cd AsaDB-1.5.0-linux-x86_64
./scripts/check_linux_runtime.sh
swipl pack install .
swipl asadb
```

On first run the command asks for administrator credentials, then opens the
login page at `http://127.0.0.1:2026/login`. After login, Server Workspace
uses the supervised Prolog backend by default; Local Workspace remains an
explicit authenticated switch. The `.tar.Z` file is
gzip-compressed. `swipl` is a separate runtime dependency.

## Running The Portable Windows Release

Extract the release zip and run:

```powershell
AsaDB.exe
```

Optional:

```powershell
AsaDB.exe panel data\mydb.asa 8088
AsaDB.exe cli data\mydb.asa web\samples\feature-tour.sql
