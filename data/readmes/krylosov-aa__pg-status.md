# pg-status

An extremely lightweight and fast sidecar service that reports the status of
your PostgreSQL hosts: whether they are alive, which host is the master, which
hosts are replicas, and how far each replica is lagging behind the master.

pg-status is designed to run alongside your main application. It is
resource-efficient and fast enough to query on every request without
noticeable overhead. However, it can also be deployed as a standalone service,
allowing multiple instances of your main application to share a single
pg-status instance.

It polls database hosts in the background at a configurable interval and
exposes an HTTP API for retrieving hosts that meet specific conditions.

All responses are served directly from memory.

To learn why this project exists and what problem it solves, read
[Three PostgreSQL Master/Replica Discovery Problems](docs/why.md).

## Usage

Run pg-status alongside your main service or on any host that can reach the
PostgreSQL servers. The HTTP server starts immediately, without waiting for
PostgreSQL checks. `/live` and `/version` are available immediately. `/ready`
and all host-information endpoints return HTTP 503 until the initial status
check of every configured host has completed, successfully or with an error
or timeout. After that, they serve the current monitoring state.

### API

The service provides several HTTP endpoints for retrieving host information.

While the monitor is not ready, `/ready` and all host-information endpoints
return HTTP 503 Service Unavailable with
`{"error_text": "pg_monitor is not ready"}`, regardless of the `Accept` header.
Readiness is checked before endpoint query-parameter validation.

Host-selection endpoints support two response formats: plain text and JSON.
These endpoints are `/master`, `/replica`, `/sync_by_*`, and
`/most_sync_by_bytes`.

Include the `Accept: application/json` header to receive JSON, for example:
`{"host": "localhost", ...}`.

Without this header, the response is plain text: `localhost`.

The `/hosts` and `/status` endpoints always return JSON, while `/version`
always returns plain text.

If a host-selection endpoint cannot find a matching host, it returns HTTP 404.
The response body is empty in plain-text mode and `{"host": null, ...}` in JSON
mode.

#### Lag query parameters

The `/replica` and `/sync_by_*` endpoints accept optional `lag_ms` and
`lag_bytes` query parameters that override the lag thresholds for a single
request. `/most_sync_by_bytes` accepts the same parameters but considers only
`lag_bytes`; `lag_ms` has no effect. Values must be non-negative integers;
otherwise, the endpoint responds with HTTP 400 and a body such as
`{"error_text": "Invalid lag_ms"}`.

The meaning of an omitted parameter depends on the route:

- `/replica` — a missing parameter means **no constraint on that
  dimension**. The global `pg_status__sync_max_lag_*` defaults are not
  applied here.
- `/sync_by_*` — a missing parameter falls back to the corresponding global
  `pg_status__sync_max_lag_ms` or `pg_status__sync_max_lag_bytes` value.
- `/most_sync_by_bytes` — a missing `lag_bytes` falls back to
  `pg_status__sync_max_lag_bytes`; `lag_ms` is always ignored.

A `/sync_by_time` request considers only the time threshold, while
`/sync_by_bytes` and `/most_sync_by_bytes` requests consider only the byte
threshold. Passing the other parameter to these endpoints has no effect.

#### LSN query parameter (read-your-writes)

The `/replica`, `/sync_by_*`, and `/most_sync_by_bytes` endpoints also accept
an optional `min_lsn` query parameter: a strict freshness filter that
guarantees the chosen replica has replayed through a given WAL position. This
is the basis for read-your-writes consistency. Instead of
relying on `lag_ms` and `lag_bytes` heuristics, the caller supplies an exact
LSN, and pg-status returns only a replica that has caught up to it.

The value must be a PostgreSQL LSN in canonical `HEX/HEX` form (for
example, `0/3000060`). An invalid format produces HTTP 400 with
`{"error_text": "Invalid min_lsn"}`. An omitted parameter means there is no
LSN constraint. When provided, it is combined with the lag parameters
described above.

If no replica has replayed to `min_lsn`, the master is returned as a
fallback.

**Read-your-writes pattern.** After writing to the master, capture
`pg_current_wal_lsn()` and pass it to the next read request:

```text
INSERT INTO ...;
SELECT pg_current_wal_lsn();   -- returns e.g. "0/3000060"

# The following read is guaranteed to see the write:
GET /replica?min_lsn=0/3000060
```

Either a replica whose replay LSN is at or beyond `0/3000060` is returned, or
the master is returned.

#### Locality-aware replica selection

When complete locality metadata is available, `/replica` and the `/sync_by_*`
endpoints prefer eligible replicas in the following order:

1. Replicas whose `dc` matches the current `dc`.
2. If there is no matching-DC replica, replicas whose `geo` matches the
   current `geo`.
3. If neither locality rule can be applied, all eligible replicas participate
   in the existing round-robin selection.

DC and geo are independent. Locality is a preference after the endpoint's
health, lag, and `min_lsn` eligibility filters; it does not make an otherwise
unsuitable replica eligible.

`/most_sync_by_bytes` deliberately ignores locality. It always prioritizes the
smallest byte lag, with ties resolved by host order.

#### `GET /master`

Returns the current master's host name. If no master is available, the endpoint
returns HTTP 404 as described above.

#### `GET /replica`

Returns the host name of a replica, selected using DC preference, then geo
preference, then round-robin as described above.
Optional `lag_ms`, `lag_bytes`, and `min_lsn` query parameters constrain
the result:

- No parameters — any live replica.
- `?lag_ms=X` — live replicas with `lag_ms ≤ X`.
- `?lag_bytes=Y` — live replicas with `lag_bytes ≤ Y`.
- `?lag_ms=X&lag_bytes=Y` — live replicas with both `lag_ms ≤ X` and
  `lag_bytes ≤ Y`.
- `?min_lsn=X/Y` — live replicas whose replay LSN is at or beyond the given
  value (see "LSN query parameter" above). This constraint can be combined
  with the lag filters.

If no replica matches, the master's host name is returned instead.

#### `GET /sync_by_time`

Returns the host name of a replica, selected using locality preference and
round-robin, whose time lag is less than or equal to the threshold. The
threshold is taken from the `lag_ms` query parameter when provided; otherwise,
`pg_status__sync_max_lag_ms` is used. If no replica meets this condition, the
master's host name is returned.

#### `GET /sync_by_bytes`

Returns the host name of a replica, selected using locality preference and
round-robin, whose WAL lag in bytes is less than or equal to the threshold. The
threshold is taken from the `lag_bytes` query parameter when provided;
otherwise,
`pg_status__sync_max_lag_bytes` is used. If no replica meets this condition,
the master's host name is returned.

#### `GET /sync_by_time_or_bytes`

Returns the host name of a replica, selected using locality preference and
round-robin, that is synchronous either by time or by bytes. The `lag_ms` and
`lag_bytes` query parameters override the corresponding global thresholds for
the current request. If no such replica exists, the master's host name is
returned.

#### `GET /sync_by_time_and_bytes`

Returns the host name of a replica, selected using locality preference and
round-robin, that is synchronous by both time and bytes. The `lag_ms` and
`lag_bytes` query parameters override the corresponding global thresholds for
the current request. If no such replica exists, the master's host name is
returned.

#### `GET /most_sync_by_bytes`

Returns the host name of the replica with the smallest `lag_bytes` among those
that satisfy the byte threshold and the optional `min_lsn` constraint. Unlike
the `/sync_by_*` endpoints, this endpoint does not use locality preference or
round-robin: selection is deterministic, and ties are resolved by host order.

The `lag_bytes` query parameter overrides `pg_status__sync_max_lag_bytes` for
the current request. Neither `lag_ms` nor `pg_status__sync_max_lag_ms` is
considered.

If no replica satisfies the byte and LSN constraints, the master's host name
is returned.

#### `GET /hosts`

Returns a JSON list containing status information for every configured host.
The `dc` and `geo` fields contain the host's configured locality metadata and
are `null` when the corresponding metadata is not configured.
The `sync_by_time` and `sync_by_bytes` flags indicate whether the current lag
is within the global `pg_status__sync_max_lag_*` thresholds. For a dead host
(`alive: false`), the lag fields and `lsn` are `null`, and the sync flags are
`false`.

The `lsn` field is the host's latest known WAL position as of the last
successful poll: `pg_current_wal_lsn()` on the master,
`pg_last_wal_replay_lsn()` on a replica. It is `null` for dead hosts.

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "host": "host-1",
    "dc": "frankfurt",
    "geo": "europe",
    "master": true,
    "alive": true,
    "lag_ms": 0,
    "sync_by_time": true,
    "lag_bytes": 0,
    "sync_by_bytes": true,
    "lsn": "0/3000060"
  },
  {
    "host": "host-2",
    "dc": "amsterdam",
    "geo": "europe",
    "master": false,
    "alive": true,
    "lag_ms": 6193,
    "sync_by_time": false,
    "lag_bytes": 456,
    "sync_by_bytes": true,
    "lsn": "0/2FFFE98"
  },
  {
    "host": "host-3",
    "dc": null,
    "geo": null,
    "master": false,
    "alive": false,
    "lag_ms": null,
    "sync_by_time": false,
    "lag_bytes": null,
    "sync_by_bytes": false,
    "lsn": null
  }
]
```

#### `GET /status`

Returns the status of the host specified by the `host` query parameter.
If the `host` parameter is missing, the endpoint responds with HTTP 400 and
`{"error_text": "Get parameter 'host' wasn't passed"}`. If the host is not in
the monitored list, the endpoint returns HTTP 404.

You can also use this endpoint to check whether a configured host is currently
alive.

Example: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/status?host=host-1`

```json
{
  "dc": "amsterdam",
  "geo": "europe",
  "master": false,
  "alive": true,
  "lag_ms": 0,
  "sync_by_time": true,
  "lag_bytes": 0,
  "sync_by_bytes": true,
  "lsn": "0/3000060"
}
```

#### `GET /version`

Returns the pg-status semantic version as plain text, including during startup.

#### `GET /live`

Returns HTTP 200 with the plain-text body `OK` as soon as the HTTP server is
running. This endpoint reports that pg-status has started and does not depend
on monitor readiness or PostgreSQL availability.

#### `GET /ready`

Returns HTTP 503 while the monitor is warming up, and HTTP 200 with the
plain-text body `OK` once every configured host has completed its first check.
The rest of the monitoring API becomes available at the same time.

Readiness does not require a live master or any live PostgreSQL host. Failed
checks and timeouts count as completed checks; subsequent PostgreSQL outages
are reported through the regular host status and selection endpoints without
making pg-status unready.

### Parameters

Configure pg-status using the following environment variables:

- `pg_status__hosts` — Comma-separated list of PostgreSQL hosts. Required.
- `pg_status__pg_user` — PostgreSQL user. Default: `postgres`.
- `pg_status__pg_password` — PostgreSQL password. Default: `postgres`.
- `pg_status__pg_database` — PostgreSQL database name. Default: `postgres`.
- `pg_status__pg_port` — PostgreSQL port. To use a different port for each
  host, provide a comma-separated list in the same order as
  `pg_status__hosts`. A single value applies to every host. Default: `5432`.
- `pg_status__hosts_dc` — Optional comma-separated DC for each host, in the
  same positional order as `pg_status__hosts`.
- `pg_status__current_dc` — Optional DC of the pg-status instance. When set,
  it takes precedence over `pg_status__current_dc_env`.
- `pg_status__current_dc_env` — Optional name of another environment variable
  whose value is the current DC.
- `pg_status__hosts_geo` — Optional comma-separated geo for each host, in the
  same positional order as `pg_status__hosts`.
- `pg_status__current_geo` — Optional geo of the pg-status instance. When set,
  it takes precedence over `pg_status__current_geo_env`.
- `pg_status__current_geo_env` — Optional name of another environment variable
  whose value is the current geo.
- `pg_status__max_fails` — Number of consecutive failed checks before a host
  is considered dead. Default: `3`.
- `pg_status__sleep_ms` — Target period, in milliseconds, between the starts
  of consecutive checks of each host. Default: `1000`. Checks never overlap;
  if a check takes longer than the period, the next starts immediately after
  it finishes. Must be greater than `0`.
- `pg_status__query_timeout_ms` — Hard deadline, in milliseconds, for one poll
  iteration (connect, send, and read). When an iteration times out, its
  connection is closed and the host's failure counter is incremented.
  Default: `1000`. Must be greater than `0`; may exceed `sleep_ms`.
- `pg_status__conn_max_age_ms` — Maximum age, in milliseconds, of a reused
  PostgreSQL connection. Older connections are closed after the current
  iteration and reopened for the next one. Default: `300000` (5 minutes).
- `pg_status__sync_max_lag_ms` — Maximum time lag, in milliseconds, for a
  replica to be considered time-synchronous. Default: `1000`.
- `pg_status__sync_max_lag_bytes` — Maximum WAL lag, in bytes, for a replica
  to be considered byte-synchronous. Default: `1000000` (1 MB).
- `pg_status__http_listen_address` — IP address on which the HTTP server
  listens. Accepts an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or `*` for best-effort
  IPv4/IPv6 wildcard listeners. Default: `0.0.0.0`.
- `pg_status__http_port` — HTTP server port. Default: `8000`.
- `pg_status__log_level` — Minimum logging level. Accepts `debug`, `info`,
  `warning` (or `warn`), `error`, or `fatal`. Default: `info`.
- `pg_status__log_format` — Log format: `text` (default) or `json`.

All locality variables are optional. A dimension is used for replica selection
only when both its current value and one non-empty positional value for every
entry in `pg_status__hosts` are available. If only part of a DC or geo
configuration is supplied, pg-status logs a startup warning and disables that
dimension. It continues to use the other complete dimension, or round-robin
when neither dimension is complete.

Direct current-locality values take precedence over indirect values. For
example, if both `pg_status__current_dc` and `pg_status__current_dc_env` are
set, `pg_status__current_dc` is used. Otherwise the value of the environment
variable named by `pg_status__current_dc_env` is used. Geo follows the same
rule. Indirect variable names must match `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`; lookup is
performed once and is not recursive. In a container deployment, the referenced
environment variable must also be passed into the container. The bundled
Compose example forwards `PLATFORM_DC` and `PLATFORM_GEO`; add an equivalent
entry when using another variable name.

Example using a direct DC and an indirectly supplied geo:

```sh
pg_status__hosts="db-frankfurt.example,db-amsterdam.example"
pg_status__hosts_dc="frankfurt,amsterdam"
pg_status__hosts_geo="europe,europe"
pg_status__current_dc="frankfurt"
pg_status__current_geo_env="PLATFORM_GEO"
PLATFORM_GEO="europe"
```

### PostgreSQL TLS

TLS is configured by libpq's standard environment variables. pg-status does
not add its own certificate store or TLS configuration format:

- `PGSSLMODE` — libpq TLS mode, such as `disable`, `require`, or
  `verify-full`.
- `PGSSLROOTCERT` — path to the trusted CA certificate bundle.
- `PGSSLCRL` — path to a certificate revocation list.
- `PGSSLCERT` — path to the client certificate when the server requires mTLS.
- `PGSSLKEY` — path to the corresponding client private key. Its filesystem
  permissions must satisfy libpq's requirements.

## Quick demo

The demo requires Docker with Docker Compose.

To build pg-status and start a ready-to-use PostgreSQL topology, run:

```sh
make build_up_test
```

This starts pg-status, one PostgreSQL primary, two physical streaming
replicas, and proxy services used to simulate role changes. After the
containers become healthy and the initial host checks complete, query the API
at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/master
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/replica
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/hosts
```

Switch the simulated master and query pg-status again after the next polling
cycle:

```sh
make 2-master
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/master
```

Restore the original topology or stop the demo with:

```sh
make 1-master
make down_test
```

See [test/README.md](test/README.md) for details about the topology and project
testing.

## Performance

Measured on an Ubuntu 24.04 VM with 4 Ice Lake vCPUs and 4 GB RAM. pg-status
was pinned to **one vCPU**;  requests used localhost HTTP with keep-alive.

| Workload                           | Confirmed RPS | Worst p99 |
|------------------------------------|--------------:|----------:|
| `/master`                          |    **52,500** |   4.17 ms |
| `/master` + `/most_sync_by_bytes`  |    **55,000** |   4.51 ms |
| `/master` + `/replica`, fresh RYOW |    **52,500** |   4.50 ms |

At these rates, pg-status used approximately **90–94% of one vCPU** and
**10 MiB RSS**. With a **0.1-vCPU quota**, a mixed workload confirmed
**3,000 RPS** at p99 ≤5 ms.

See the [full results](docs/performance.md) for all ten scenarios,
CPU/RAM measurements, rare latency spikes and limitations, and the
[benchmark guide](test/rps/README.md) to reproduce the measurements.

## Implementation details

### Concurrent polling

A single writer thread polls **all hosts concurrently** using libpq's
non-blocking API and one `poll()` system call across their sockets. Each host
has an independent polling cycle: each check is scheduled
`pg_status__sleep_ms` after the previous check **started**. Time spent checking
the host counts toward this period, on both success and failure. If a check
overruns the period, the next starts immediately after it finishes; missed
periods do not accumulate, and checks of the same host never overlap.

For example, with a 1000 ms period and a 200 ms check, the remaining wait is
800 ms. This scheduling rule replaces the previous delay-after-completion
behavior for all configurations; there is no mode switch.

Every iteration has a deadline of
`pg_status__query_timeout_ms`; when that deadline expires, the connection is
closed and the host's failure counter is incremented.

Waiting for a slow or unresponsive host's socket does not block updates for
the other hosts. DNS resolution during connection setup can still block
inside libpq and delay the monitoring loop, including deadline handling.

### Byte lag

`lag_bytes` estimates how many WAL bytes a replica has yet to replay.
It uses the maximum of three known positions: the last observed master LSN
(`pg_current_wal_lsn()`), WAL received by the replica
(`pg_last_wal_receive_lsn()`), and the upstream WAL end reported to its receiver
(`pg_stat_wal_receiver.latest_end_lsn`).

```text
lag_bytes = max(0, max(master_lsn, received_lsn, latest_end_lsn) - replay_lsn)
```

`replay_lsn` is `pg_last_wal_replay_lsn()`: WAL already applied by the replica.
These observations can be stale, so zero byte lag does not guarantee freshness.

For more complete measurements, the monitoring user needs `pg_read_all_stats`
(or `pg_monitor`) and access to `pg_stat_wal_receiver`.

If receiver statistics are unavailable, polling continues using other WAL
positions. Permission errors produce a warning; access is retried after
reconnection.

### Connection reuse

PostgreSQL connections are kept alive between polling iterations. Opening a
new `PGconn` for every iteration would require a full TCP and authentication
handshake every `pg_status__sleep_ms`, adding unnecessary load to the server.
Instead, each host keeps its connection open and reuses it.

To prevent stale connections from persisting indefinitely, for example after
intermediate NAT state expires or server-side cleanup occurs, each connection
is recycled when its age exceeds `pg_status__conn_max_age_ms`. Connections are
also closed and reopened after any query error or socket-level failure.

### Consistency

Cross-host consistency is intentionally not provided.

There is one writer (the polling thread) and many readers (HTTP handlers). The
writer never blocks the readers, and the readers never block the writer.

Each host's data is published as a consistent snapshot through a seqlock, so
readers always see fields from the same poll iteration for that host.

Cross-host inconsistency is permitted by design: at any moment, some hosts may
contain newer snapshots than others. There is no global polling barrier; the
freshness of each snapshot depends on that host's independent polling schedule
and query deadline. Fast responses and up-to-date per-host data are more
important for this project than a consistent view across all hosts.

### Reaction speed to host unavailability

If a host does not respond to a status check, the cause may be either a
temporary issue or an actual outage. To avoid marking a host as dead
prematurely, pg-status waits for `pg_status__max_fails` consecutive failed
checks. With responsive event-loop scheduling, an unanswered check times out
after `pg_status__query_timeout_ms`. Counting from the outage, the worst-case
detection time is approximately:

```text
sleep_ms + query_timeout_ms
  + (max_fails − 1) × max(sleep_ms, query_timeout_ms)
```

The initial `sleep_ms` allows for an outage just after a successful check.
With the defaults (1000 ms period, 1000 ms timeout, 3 failures), detection
takes up to roughly 4 seconds. Immediate connection errors can be detected
sooner; DNS stalls or delays in the monitoring thread can extend this time.

After the first failed check, but before the failure count reaches
`pg_status__max_fails`, the host is marked as possibly dead. This state affects
host selection:

- Master selection prefers fully responsive masters, then possibly dead
  masters. If neither exists, no master is selected. Dead hosts and replicas
  are excluded.
- When selecting a replica, pg-status prefers fully responsive hosts. If no
  such replica meets the search criteria, it returns a possibly dead replica.
  Round-robin applies within the best available health and locality group.

Failed checks preserve the last successfully measured `lag_ms`, `lag_bytes`,
and `lsn`. While the host is possibly dead, lag and LSN filters use these
last known values. A failed check does not make a lagging replica appear
synchronous. Once the host is marked dead, it is excluded from selection,
and the HTTP API returns `null` for its lag and LSN fields. A successful check
updates the measurements and clears the failure counter and possibly dead state.

### Split-brain

With client-side master detection, pg-status cannot determine which host
*should* be the master during a split-brain scenario. Within the best available
health group, the first master in `pg_status__hosts` wins.

## Logging

The service writes thread-safe, single-line logs to stderr.
The default `text` format contains an RFC 3339 UTC timestamp, severity, component,
and message:

```text
2026-08-21T12:34:56.123Z INFO http: server started address=0.0.0.0 port=8000
2026-08-21T12:35:01.245Z WARNING monitor: host state changed host=pg-2 state=possible_dead
```

Set `pg_status__log_format=json` for one JSON object per line, with the same
RFC 3339 UTC timestamps and Deploy-compatible fields:

```json
{"@timestamp":"2026-08-21T12:35:01.245Z","levelStr":"WARNING","component":"monitor","message":"host state changed host=pg-2 state=possible_dead"}
```

`pg_status__log_level` applies independently of the format. System errors add
a numeric `errno`. Fatal records use `levelStr=ERROR`.
Long values are shortened with `...[truncated]`
while preserving valid JSON. Host names, states, and lag values remain in
`message`.

The default `info` level reports startup, shutdown, role changes, availability
changes, and transitions across the global `pg_status__sync_max_lag_*`
thresholds. PostgreSQL operation failures are logged at `error`. Detailed polling
progress and replica-to-master fallback decisions are available at `debug`.

pg-status never logs PostgreSQL passwords or complete connection strings. Log
collection, storage, and rotation are delegated to the process supervisor,
Docker, or the operating system.
