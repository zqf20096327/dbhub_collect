## What is Kurrent

Event Store – the company and the product – are rebranding as Kurrent.

- The flagship product will be referred to as “the Kurrent event-native data platform” or “the Kurrent platform” or simply “Kurrent"
- EventStoreDB will be referred to as KurrentDB
- Event Store Cloud will now be called Kurrent Cloud

Read more about the rebrand in the [rebrand FAQ](https://www.kurrent.io/blog/kurrent-re-brand-faq).

## What is KurrentDB

KurrentDB is a database that's engineered for modern software applications and event-driven architectures. Its event-native design simplifies data modeling and preserves data integrity while the integrated streaming engine solves distributed messaging challenges and ensures data consistency.

## What is Kurrent Cloud?

 Kurrent Cloud is a fully managed cloud offering that's designed to make it easy for developers to build and run highly available and secure applications that incorporate KurrentDB without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. You can provision KurrentDB clusters in AWS, Azure, and GCP, and connect these services securely to your own cloud resources.

## Building KurrentDB

KurrentDB is written in a mixture of C# and JavaScript. It can run on Windows, Linux and macOS (using Docker) using the .NET Core runtime.

**Prerequisites**

- [.NET SDK 10.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)

Once you've installed the prerequisites for your system, you can launch a `Release` build of KurrentDB as follows:

```
dotnet build -c Release
```

To start a single node, you can then run:

```
dotnet run --project ./src/KurrentDB/KurrentDB.csproj -c Release -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development -- --dev --db ./tmp/data --index ./tmp/index --log ./tmp/log
```

Alternatively, you can run the `KurrentDB - Dev DB` profile pre-configured in `launchSettings.json`:

```
dotnet run --project ./src/KurrentDB/KurrentDB.csproj -c Release -lp "KurrentDB - Dev DB"
```

### Running the tests

You can launch the tests as follows:

```
dotnet test --solution KurrentDB.slnx
```

### Build KurrentDB Docker image

You can also build a Docker image by running the command:

```
docker build --tag mykurrentdb . \
--build-arg CONTAINER_RUNTIME={container-runtime}
--build-arg RUNTIME={runtime}
```

For instance:

```
docker build --tag mykurrentdb . \
--build-arg CONTAINER_RUNTIME=noble \
--build-arg RUNTIME=linux-x64
```

**_Note:_** Because of the [Docker issue](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/1900), if you're building a Docker image on Windows, you may need to set the `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0` environment variable. For instance, running in PowerShell:

```
$env:DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0; docker build --tag mykurrentdb . `
--build-arg CONTAINER_RUNTIME=noble `
--build-arg RUNTIME=linux-x64
```

Currently, we support the following configurations:

1. Noble:

- `CONTAINER_RUNTIME=noble`
- `RUNTIME=linux-x64`

You can verify the built image by running:

```
docker run --rm mykurrentdb --insecure --what-if
```
