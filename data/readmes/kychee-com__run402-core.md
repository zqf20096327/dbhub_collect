# Run402 Core

Run402 Core is the open-source, self-hostable server and runtime core for
[Run402](https://run402.com) — backend infrastructure for AI agents. Run402 gives an
agent a Postgres database, user auth, file storage, serverless functions and site
hosting that it provisions and operates itself; this repository is the part of that
backend you can run on your own machine, under Apache-2.0. The agent-facing SDK, CLI
and MCP server live in [kychee-com/run402](https://github.com/kychee-com/run402) (MIT).

The current Core runtime-kernel slice is an Apache-2.0 self-hosting runtime. It can create a local project, plan and commit a supported ReleaseSpec, run inline PostgreSQL migrations, serve PostgREST/RLS behavior, serve active-release static content, handle local storage objects and route manifests, execute trusted local functions including durable function runs and single-node schedule triggers, run a narrow Astro SSR target, and import verified portable project archives.

Run402's wider product model treats people and agents as first-class participants: each acts through its own principal and authenticator, while explicit authority determines what it may do. Core supports the sovereignty side of that model by making a concrete application-runtime slice inspectable and portable. It does **not** currently reproduce the managed Cloud control plane, its human/agent principal graph, or its complete attribution history.

## Operating interface

Use the [Run402 CLI](https://docs.run402.com/cli/reference/) by default to operate supported Core targets. Use the [typed SDK](https://docs.run402.com/sdk/scripting/) for programmatic TypeScript/JavaScript workflows; MCP is a thin adapter for tool-native hosts. The API remains the supported integration foundation. A shared client does not imply every Cloud capability exists in Core: inspect the target's capability document first.

The setup, conformance and native package examples below intentionally use Docker, npm, HTTP probes and runtime code where those are the operation being taught. They are not competing Cloud first-deploy recipes.

## What Is Here Today

- `packages/functions` - `@run402/functions`, the helper library for deployed Run402 functions.
- `packages/release` - `@run402/release`, the release manifest semantics package.
- `packages/runtime-kernel` - public Core runtime contracts and application services.
- `apps/core-gateway` - public Core gateway composition root.
- `docker-compose.yml` - local Core, Postgres, and PostgREST stack.
- `fixtures/runtime-kernel-static-rest` - canonical static + Postgres/RLS conformance fixture.
- `fixtures/storage-routing-core` - canonical storage + static routing conformance fixture.
- CI for clean install, lint, build, tests, tarball verification, boundary checks, Compose boot, and Core conformance.

## What Is Not Here Yet

This repo is not a complete production self-hosted Run402 distribution. It does not include Cloud's principal and organization authority graph, human control-plane login, grants and grant keys, Buzz control-plane lifecycle, complete action-time attribution history, fleet scheduling, Aurora operations, global routing, Cloud billing operations, managed abuse controls, managed backups, monitoring, compliance automation, TLS automation, HA, custom domains, arbitrary dependency installation, hostile multi-tenant code isolation, or Cloud import back into managed Run402.

The promise of this slice is smaller and concrete: the supported Core runtime path is public, buildable, testable, and suitable for Run402 Cloud to consume or verify directly.

## Extraction Status

Run402 Core is an open-source ratchet. Public-safe, production-used runtime code moves here, and Run402 Cloud consumes the public package or verifies against the public implementation.

| Extracted surface | Current status |
| --- | --- |
| `@run402/functions` | Public package consumed by Cloud |
| `@run402/release` | Public release/apply semantics package |
| `@run402/runtime-kernel` | Public Core runtime contracts and services |
| Core gateway + Compose | self-hosted local runtime |
| Storage/routing | Supported Core subset |
| Functions runtime | Trusted local execution |
| Astro SSR runtime | Supported narrow output contract |
| Portable archives | Cloud export to Core import for the supported runtime slice |

Run402 Cloud remains the managed service and the authority for its participant, organization, grant, deploy, lease, billing, and runtime records. Core reduces vendor-lock-in risk for the supported application-runtime slice; it does not open-source the full control plane or fleet operations.

## Packages

### `@run402/functions`

In-function helper library for Run402 serverless functions. It provides typed access to caller-context database queries, admin database queries, auth helpers, email, AI, storage assets, cache helpers, routed HTTP utilities, and webhook verification.

```bash
npm install @run402/functions
```

Most users do not install it manually for deployed functions because Run402 Cloud auto-bundles the package at deploy time. Installing it locally is useful for TypeScript autocomplete and tests.

### `@run402/release`

Release manifest semantics package. It is the public source for ReleaseSpec schemas, canonicalization rules, digest identities, portable state shape, and compatibility policy.

```bash
npm install @run402/release
```

Current package scope:

| Capability | Included |
| --- | ---: |
| Parse and validate ReleaseSpec | Yes |
| Canonicalize and digest | Yes |
| Materialize desired release state | Yes |
| Compute release diff | Yes |
| Derive event and content requirements | Yes |
| Deploy resources | No |
| Execute migrations | No |
| Store secrets/content | No |
| Provide auth or HTTP gateway | No |
| Run a local control plane | No |
| Export/import a Cloud project | No |

### `@run402/runtime-kernel`

Public Core runtime contracts, capability document, project services, and apply plan/commit services.

Current runtime-kernel scope:

| Capability | Included |
| --- | ---: |
| Local project create/inspect | Yes |
| Supported ReleaseSpec plan/commit | Yes |
| Inline PostgreSQL migrations | Yes |
| PostgREST/RLS fixture | Yes |

## Cloud Vs Core

Run402 Cloud is the managed service. Run402 Core is the public runtime and release-semantics code that can move toward self-hosting and portability over time.

Run402 Cloud should be the easiest place to start, not the only place the supported application can run. This is a bounded portability promise, not a claim that Core already reproduces every Cloud identity, authority, billing, or operations capability.
