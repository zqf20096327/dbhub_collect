QueryForge is a local-first, domain-first AI data analytics platform built around
one principle:
**generated SQL should be governed like application code, not trusted like prose**.

Users create or select a data domain first—such as retail, finance, product, or
the bundled Anime Streaming sample—then onboard that domain's data, review its
semantic contract, and ask questions inside the same governance boundary.
QueryForge combines that workflow with natural-language-to-SQL, AST-level
security, read-only execution, bounded recovery, and complete run artifacts.

> QueryForge currently targets SQLite and controlled environments. It is a
> portfolio-grade reference architecture, not a multi-tenant analytics service.

### Measured behaviour

The governance layer is deterministic, so it is tested exhaustively offline; the
model layer is not, so its numbers are reported separately and with their sample
size. Both are reproducible from this repository.

| What | Result | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Offline test suite | 928 passing, 25 skipped | `./init.sh` |
| Offline acceptance gate | 13/13 checks | `make check` |
| Deterministic agent benchmark | 23/23 tasks (`dev` + `regression` splits; the 9-task `holdout` split is requested explicitly) | `python scripts/benchmark_agent.py --tier 1 --gate` |
| Real-model NL2SQL accuracy | **0.875** semantic correctness, 1.0 execution success | 40 cases, single run, `deepseek-v4-flash` |

Two honest qualifications on that last row, because they matter more than the
number:

- It is **one run of 40 cases**. Differences of ±0.03 have been observed across
  *identical* code, so this figure cannot resolve small changes.
- It covers the anime sample domain only. It is evidence that the pipeline works
  end to end on a real model, not a general accuracy claim.

Tier-1's 23/23 measures the *engineering* chain (governance, execution, evidence,
budgeting, failure classification), not model capability: a fixture supplies the
SQL. See [NL2SQL evaluation](docs/nl2sql_evaluation.md) for the method and the
frozen baselines.

## Why QueryForge?

Most NL2SQL demos stop after a model emits a query. QueryForge covers the full
delivery loop:

| Need | QueryForge approach |
| --- | --- |
| Trust the generated SQL | Parse with SQLGlot and enforce a named policy before execution |
| Keep business meaning consistent | Define metrics, dimensions, grain, and join paths in YAML |
| Prevent context from leaking | Scope sources, semantic contracts, policies, and run history to a selected data domain |
| Recover from imperfect output | Reflect, repair, and retry within explicit budgets |
| Handle harder questions | Use bounded schema discovery, a tool loop, and serviceable failure classification |
| Trace what happened | Persist run state, policy decisions, quality evidence, and artifacts |
| Integrate with other tools | Expose CLI, REST/SSE, MCP, gateway, JSON, charts, and HTML reports |
| Start from raw data | Build governed SQLite assets from CSV, Parquet, and paginated JSON APIs |

## Highlights

- **Defense in depth** — candidates are checked before execution and revalidated
  at the database boundary.
- **Semantic contracts** — YAML models describe business metrics, entities,
  relationships, cardinality, ownership, SLA, sensitivity, and quality rules.
- **Adaptive workflow** — simple questions stay fast; complex questions can
  activate a bounded tool loop.
- **Read-only by default** — normal analysis opens SQLite databases in read-only
  mode and rejects write or administrative SQL.
- **Multiple delivery surfaces** — use the same application service through the
  CLI, REST/SSE, MCP, or a webhook gateway.
- **Reproducible evaluation** — the repository ships a 32-task deterministic agent
  benchmark over three independent schemas and a 120-case, three-domain NL2SQL
  gold set, with the frozen real-model baselines recorded in the docs.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

Requirements: **Python 3.11 or 3.12** and SQLite.

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Configure a model

Set one provider in `.env`. OpenAI-compatible, Claude, Gemini, Qwen, DeepSeek,
and GLM configurations are included.

```dotenv
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
```

Provider defaults and environment-variable mappings live in [`models.yml`](models.yml).

### 3. Run the bundled example

```bash
queryforge --prepare-sample-data

queryforge \
  --database sample_data/anime_streaming/anime_streaming.sqlite \
  --question "Which anime generated the most watch hours?"
```

Try a multi-hop semantic query:

```bash
queryforge \
  --database sample_data/anime_streaming/anime_streaming.sqlite \
  --semantic-model sample_data/anime_streaming/semantic_model.yml \
  --sql-policy sample_data/anime_streaming/sql_policy.yml \
  --question "Compare watch completion and merchandise GMV by anime genre"
```

### Explore QueryForge Studio

The repository includes a complete visual workspace for creating and switching
data domains, onboarding domain-owned data, reviewing the required semantic
layer, asking governed questions, inspecting SQL and Trust Trace evidence, and
auditing domain-scoped run history.

```bash
# Terminal 1: QueryForge API
python -m pip install -e ".[api]"
queryforge --serve-api

# Terminal 2: QueryForge Studio
make web-install
make web-dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. Start in **Data Domains**, select the bundled Anime
Streaming example or create a clean domain, then add data inside that domain. If
the Python API is offline, the sample-domain analysis remains explorable with a
deterministic demo response. See the [Studio guide](docs/studio.md).

## How It Works

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/queryforge-flow.svg" width="100%" alt="Animated QueryForge runtime architecture">
</div>

The public lifecycle stays intentionally small:

```text
analysis → candidate → execution → completion → delivery
```

Role-specific agents operate inside those stages. A deterministic router chooses
the path; the model does not control the security boundary.

## SQL Governance

Every generated query passes through an auditable pipeline:

```text
SQL candidate
  → SQLite AST parse
  → single read-only statement
  → table and column scope
  → dangerous-function checks
  → recursive CTE and cross-join checks
  → table, join, and LIMIT budgets
  → governed preview
  → execution-boundary revalidation
```

A policy can be as small as:

```yaml
version: 1
name: anime_streaming
allowed_tables:
  - fact_watch_session
  - dim_anime
require_limit: true
max_limit: 500
max_tables: 2
max_joins: 1
allow_cross_join: false
```

Policy denials return a structured `SQL_SECURITY_ERROR` before SQLite execution.

## Semantic Layer

QueryForge's YAML semantic models give generated SQL business context that raw
schemas cannot provide:

```yaml
metrics:
  - name: watch_hours
    description: Total valid viewing time in hours.
    entity: watch_session
    aggregation: sum
    expression: SUM(fact_watch_session.watch_seconds) / 3600.0
    default_filters:
      - fact_watch_session.is_valid = 1
    owner: audience-analytics
    sensitivity: internal
```

Models can declare entities, dimensions, metrics, grain, relationships, join
paths, fan-out constraints, operational metadata, and physical quality rules.
QueryForge requires a validated model by default; it auto-discovers a model beside
the database and rejects schema-only analysis unless the caller explicitly selects
the diagnostic escape hatch.

In Studio, semantic construction is domain-first and gated:

```text
Create/select domain
  → upload domain-owned sources
  → profile physical schema
  → confirm entity identity and grain
  → define dimensions, measures, metrics, and time
  → review relationships, cardinality, and Join Paths
  → classify sensitivity, ownership, policy, and quality
  → validate 100% of blocking checks
  → publish data + semantics atomically
```

Technical names are treated as evidence, not business truth. A new domain starts
empty and never inherits the Anime sample's entities or metrics.

Build or incrementally refresh one:

```bash
python scripts/build_semantic_model.py \
  --database warehouse.sqlite \
  --output warehouse.semantic.yml \
  --owner data-platform
```

The generated report separates high-confidence physical evidence from definitions
that need business review. See [Semantic layer authoring](docs/semantic_authoring.md)
and [Semantic contracts](docs/semantic_contracts.md).

The repository also includes a Monday-morning
[semantic drift workflow](.github/workflows/semantic-weekly.yml) that checks schema,
metrics, relationships, Join Paths, and data-quality contracts against a reviewed
baseline.

### Bundled sample domain: Anime Streaming

Anime Streaming is one ready-to-run example data domain, not a product-wide
schema. The dataset is purpose-built for QueryForge and fully synthetic: **370,762
rows**, **15 tables**, **30 declared relationships**, **7 governed Join Paths**, and
**11 business metrics** across content, engagement, subscriptions, advertising,
community, and merchandise.

## Common Workflows

### Preview a plan without executing SQL

```bash
queryforge \
  --plan-mode \
  --question "Compare monthly watch hours by subscription tier"
```

### Enable the complex execution profile

```bash
queryforge \
  --complexity-mode complex \
  --parallel-candidates 3 \
  --question "Explain completion-rate changes by genre, device, and membership tier"
```

### Stream progress or create a report

```bash
queryforge --stream --question "List the top ten anime by watch hours"
queryforge --report --question "Build a report for monthly engagement by genre"
```

### Build a governed data asset

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[assets]"

python scripts/scaffold_data_asset.py \
  --source events.csv \
  --output events.assets.yml \
  --owner engagement-analytics

# Review the semantic draft and set semantic_model.reviewed: true.
python scripts/build_data_assets.py \
  --config sample_data/data_assets/assets.yml \
  --publish-database .queryforge/demo/analytics.sqlite
```

Every uploaded asset must carry entity semantics. Data and semantics publish
atomically, so a failed metric, relationship, grain, or quality contract rolls the
whole upload back.

### Start the REST API

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[api]"
queryforge --serve-api --api-host 127.0.0.1 --api-port 8000
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "question": "List the ten anime with the highest completion rate",
    "database": "sample_data/anime_streaming/anime_streaming.sqlite"
  }'
```

### Start the MCP server

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[mcp]"
python -m queryforge.interfaces.mcp.server --transport stdio
```

Dependencies flow inward from interfaces and application code toward domain,
infrastructure, and core contracts.

## Quality and Evaluation

Run the complete offline quality gate:

```bash
./init.sh                # environment + 928-test suite + repository state
make check               # repository hygiene + 13 offline acceptance checks
```

Live model evaluation reports execution success, semantic equivalence, policy
precision/recall, latency, measured token usage, and projection tolerance:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_sql.py \
  --cases evaluation/gold/nl2sql_multidomain.jsonl \
  --model-provider openai \
  --output .queryforge/evaluations/openai.json
```

CI runs the offline acceptance gate (including the deterministic agent benchmark)
on Python 3.11 and 3.12, plus an integration job that requires the optional
transport dependencies. Real-model evaluation is a manual workflow
(`.github/workflows/model-eval.yml`) because it spends money.

## What is verified (and what is not)

Every claim in this section is reproducible from the repository. The point of the
table is the third column: what has *not* been shown is stated as plainly as what has.

| Capability | How you can check it | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full offline test suite | `./init.sh` — **928 tests, 25 skipped, 0 failures** | verified |
| Repository + integration gate | `make check` (`scripts/run_acceptance.py --full`, 13/13 checks) | verified |
| End-to-end demos (upload → publish → query; semantic catch; multi-step analysis; transports/refusal/recovery) | `make demo` — five narrated, asserting scripts under `docs/demo/`, offline and key-free | verified |
| Deterministic agent benchmark (32 gold tasks over 3 independent schemas, ablation, effect gate) | `python scripts/benchmark_agent.py --tier 1 --gate` | verified (23/23 — the `dev` + `regression` splits; the 9-task `holdout` split must be requested with `--split holdout`) |
| Optional-dependency integration tier | `python scripts/benchmark_agent.py --tier 2 --gate` — a missing dependency **fails** the tier | verified with `.[api,mcp]` installed |
| Real-model NL2SQL evaluation | `python scripts/evaluate_sql.py --cases evaluation/gold/nl2sql_multidomain.jsonl --model-provider <p> --model <m>` | **0.875 semantic correctness on 40 anime cases, one run, `deepseek-v4-flash`** — see the caveats above |
| Automatic skill selection is worth its cost | `--skill-mode auto` vs `--skill-mode off` | **not established** — it costs +139% p50 latency and +44% output tokens with no measured accuracy benefit |
| PostgreSQL backend | `pip install '.[postgres]'`, then `PostgresConnector` | **implemented, not verified** against a live server, and not exported from the package API |

The demos and tier-1 are offline and deterministic: no model call, no network, no
API key. The agent benchmark's tier 1 supplies the SQL as a fixture, so its 23/23
measures the engineering chain — **not model accuracy**. Real-model numbers must
come from a tier-3 run with credentials and are reported separately.

Deployment level: **controlled environment, single tenant, read-only data access**.
SQLite is the default backend; DuckDB and PostgreSQL adapters exist behind optional
extras (see [Database adapters](docs/database_adapters.md)). The system is not
hardened for arbitrary untrusted multi-tenant input; the honest blank spots are
general-domain model accuracy and the PostgreSQL backend.

## Contributing and Security

- [Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Security policy](SECURITY.md)
- [Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

The source tree is ready for GitHub review and CI. The repository owner still needs
to select and add a `LICENSE` before public release; no license has been assumed on
their behalf.

## Scope and Security

QueryForge's guarantees apply to its configured SQLite execution boundary. The
project does **not** currently include:

- production authentication, authorization, tenant isolation, or rate limiting;
- durable distributed workflow recovery or token-level cancellation;
- MySQL, warehouse, lakehouse, or streaming-system adapters (a PostgreSQL
  connector exists but is neither exported from the package API nor verified
  against a live server);
- provider-normalized billing or a trained-model lifecycle.

Keep REST and MCP transports inside a controlled environment. Do not commit
provider secrets, generated run state, or local databases containing sensitive data.

Network transports can be hardened without code changes:

- `QUERYFORGE_API_KEY` — when set, REST/Gateway endpoints (except `/health`)
  require `Authorization: Bearer <key>` or `X-API-Key: <key>`.
- `DATABASE_ALLOWLIST` / `REPORT_ROOT_ALLOWLIST` — comma-separated directories
  that confine caller-supplied `database`/`semantic_model_path`/`sql_policy_path`
  and report output paths. Without them, network transports fall back to the
  project root plus the default database directory.

`POST /ask/stream` delivers progress events followed by one terminal
`final_result` event carrying the serialized answer (or an `error`); clients
that disconnect cancel the run cooperatively at the next node boundary.

## Roadmap

- Database adapters beyond SQLite
- First-class authentication and tenant policy boundaries
- Durable workflow execution and cancellation
- Warehouse-catalog integrations
- Provider-independent usage and cost accounting

Contributions and design discussions are welcome after the repository license is selected.
