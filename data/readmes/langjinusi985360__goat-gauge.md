It reads the same account and billing endpoints used by the Command Code CLI:

- `GET /alpha/whoami`
- `GET /alpha/billing/credits`
- `GET /alpha/billing/subscriptions`
- `GET /alpha/usage/summary`

The dashboard shows the rolling 5-hour, weekly, and monthly quota, reset
countdowns, credit balances, billing-period statistics, and a locally recorded
usage trend. It runs on `127.0.0.1`, stores history in SQLite, and stores a
saved API key with Windows DPAPI encryption.

It mirrors the GoGauge layout: quota rings, a time-range switch
(today / 7 days / 30 days / all), overview KPIs, a model-usage donut, a daily
trend chart, a paged usage-record table with per-request cost, plus cache hit
rate, cache read/write volume, and per-model hit rate.

## Run

Double-click `start_chrome.bat`, or run:

```powershell
python entry.py --chrome
```

The first run opens a dedicated Chrome profile at the Command Code sign-in
page. Sign in once in that window. GOAT Gauge then captures the authenticated
browser session through Chrome DevTools, saves it encrypted on disk, and starts
refreshing the dashboard automatically. The dashboard opens in the same Chrome
profile.

If you prefer not to use browser sign-in, the onboarding screen also accepts a
Command Code API key.

To run only the local server:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python entry.py --serve --port 18927
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:18927`.

Use `--demo` to preview the UI without an API key:

```powershell
python entry.py --chrome --demo
```

## Desktop shortcut

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\make-shortcut.ps1
# 可选: 同时注册「登录后静默启动本地服务」
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\make-shortcut.ps1 -Startup
```

This creates a **GOAT Gauge (Chrome)** shortcut on the desktop together with
`assets/goat-gauge.ico`.

The shortcut targets a hidden `powershell.exe` running `launch.ps1` rather than
`cmd.exe`, which is what makes it behave well on the taskbar: no black console
flash on launch, and the shortcut keeps its own icon when pinned.

`launch.ps1` starts or reuses the local server, waits for it to become ready,
and then opens the installed PWA through its Chrome app identity. If the PWA is
not installed yet, it falls back to a regular Chrome app window. This ordering
prevents the taskbar shortcut from opening the dashboard before the local
server is available.

In `-ServerOnly` mode, the same launcher starts only the local server and never
opens a browser window. This is the mode used by the optional login startup
entry.

The normal launcher is also self-healing. It opens the PWA first so the
dedicated Chrome profile exposes its authenticated session through DevTools,
then waits briefly for the dashboard session to recover. If the running server
is still stuck unauthenticated, the launcher exits that server cleanly, starts
a fresh one, and retries once.

To pin it: right-click the desktop shortcut, then **Pin to taskbar**
(on Windows 11 choose *Show more options* first).

### Why the Chrome window pins as "Google Chrome"

Chrome's `--app=` windows inherit Chrome's own taskbar identity, so pinning a
running window produces a **Google Chrome** entry. GOAT Gauge therefore ships a
web app manifest and service worker, which lets Chrome install it as a real
standalone app with its own name and icon.

In the dashboard, open **设置 → 安装为桌面应用**. Once installed, GOAT Gauge
appears in the Start menu and can be pinned to the taskbar with the purple icon
and its own window identity.

Because the installed app talks to `http://127.0.0.1:18927`, register the server
to start at login (`-Startup` above) if you want the pinned app to work right
after a reboot. The pinned app itself needs the local server running.

## Credential lookup

GOAT Gauge uses either a signed-in Chrome session or an API key. For a browser
session, the key is never handled manually. For API-key mode, it checks:

1. `COMMAND_CODE_API_KEY`
2. `COMMANDCODE_API_KEY`
3. The encrypted key saved by GOAT Gauge
4. Known values in `%USERPROFILE%\.commandcode\auth.json` or
   `%USERPROFILE%\.commandcode\config.json`
5. The Command Code provider stored by
   [CC Switch](https://github.com/farion1231/cc-switch) in
   `%USERPROFILE%\.cc-switch\cc-switch.db`

Step 5 only reads providers that actually point at Command Code, so keys that
belong to other vendors in the same database are never used.

If no key or browser session is available, the interface asks for an API key.
It is validated before being saved. The key is never returned to the browser.

### Staying signed in

Auto-login used to depend on Chrome handing over a live cookie on every launch,
so an expired or renamed cookie silently logged the dashboard out. GOAT Gauge
now:

- reuses a Command Code API key from CC Switch when one exists, which never
  expires the way a browser session does;
- stores the captured browser session in `browser-session.bin`, encrypted with
  Windows DPAPI, and restores it at startup without needing Chrome;
- captures every `commandcode.ai` cookie instead of a fixed list of cookie
  names, so a renamed sign-in cookie no longer breaks detection;
- keeps session cookies across Chrome restarts by enabling `Continue where you
  left off` in the dedicated profile;
- clears a rejected session and reopens the Command Code sign-in page when the
  upstream API answers `401`/`403`.

Run the settings drawer's **自动检测** button to re-scan for a key.

### API key plus browser session

Command Code only exposes per-request usage records to a signed-in browser, so
the two credentials cover different things:

- The **API key** drives quota, credits, plan, and summary numbers. It does not
  expire the way a browser session does, so the dashboard always has live data.
- The **browser session** powers per-request records, per-model breakdown,
  cache hit rate, and the wider local ranges.

When a key is available it stays the primary credential and the captured
browser session is attached alongside it for the detail endpoints. If the
browser session is missing, the dashboard still shows live quota and adds a
note with a **登录 Chrome** button.

## Data

Runtime data defaults to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GOATGauge`.

Set `GOATGAUGE_DATA` to use a portable data directory.

### Currency

The settings drawer can show costs in `USD` (default) or `CNY`. Costs are
always fetched and stored in USD, so switching currency only changes how they
are displayed. In CNY mode an editable rate field controls the conversion
(default `1 USD = 7.2 CNY`), which keeps the app working offline instead of
depending on a live exchange-rate API.

Currency conversion applies to real cost fields only (`cost_total`,
`cost_input`, `cost_output`, `cost_cache`, and average cost). Quota and credit
figures such as `monthly_remaining` or window usage are Command Code credits,
not dollars, and are never converted.

### Proxy support

Upstream requests follow the `*_proxy` environment variables and the Windows
system proxy. The opener is rebuilt on every request, so a proxy client such as
Clash or mihomo may start, stop, or change ports while GOAT Gauge keeps
running; the dashboard picks the change up without a restart. When a proxy is
configured but unreachable, the request is retried once over a direct
connection, and loopback traffic to the DevTools port always bypasses the
proxy.

This matters on machines where DNS resolves upstream hosts to a proxy-only
fake IP range such as `198.18.0.0/15`: direct connections there time out, and a
dashboard that cached the "no proxy" decision at start-up would freeze until it
was restarted.

### Upstream limits

Command Code's usage endpoint only exposes the newest bounded window
(currently 1 day / 100 entries) and ignores range query parameters. GOAT Gauge
therefore keeps every record it has seen in local SQLite, and the
7-day / 30-day / all views are assembled from that local history. Those wider
ranges fill in as the app runs.

The same endpoint returns no session identifier, so per-session cost is not
available and is intentionally omitted rather than guessed.

Per-request records and cache buckets come from the `/internal/*` endpoints,
which only answer for a signed-in browser session. When that session is missing
the overview falls back to the billing-period aggregate that the API key can
still read (`/alpha/usage/summary`) and labels those cards "本计费周期上游汇总"
so period totals are never mistaken for the selected range.

### Cache metrics

Cache tokens come from `/internal/usage/charts`, which accepts an explicit
`from`/`to` window (roughly one day) and reports `cacheReadInputTokens` /
`cacheCreationInputTokens` per model and time bucket. GOAT Gauge stores those
buckets locally and computes:

- hit rate = cache read tokens / input tokens
- miss tokens = input tokens - cache read tokens

Aggregate KPIs prefer these upstream buckets because they cover the full
upstream window; the record table is a narrower sample (the newest ~100
entries), and the dashboard labels the difference.

GOAT Gauge uses Chrome DevTools port `9333` by default, so it can run
alongside other local tools that use port `9222`. Override it with
`GOATGAUGE_CHROME_CDP_PORT` if needed.
