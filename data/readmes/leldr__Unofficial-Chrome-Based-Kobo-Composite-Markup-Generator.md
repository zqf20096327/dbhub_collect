## Overview

The *Unofficial Chrome-based Kobo Composite Markup Generator* is a user-friendly, in-browser tool designed to efficiently process Kobo e-reader data. It enables users to overlay SVG images onto JPG files and generate composite PNG images using data extracted from a KoboReader.sqlite database. This combination of HTML and JavaScript offers a custom approach to processing your markup files and creating composite images that display annotations directly on your original book pages.

## Background

Kobo, the company behind popular e-readers like the Kobo Libra Color, has not provided a native solution for exporting markups outside of their proprietary ecosystem. This limitation has been a point of frustration for many Kobo users, including myself. To address this gap, I developed the **Unofficial Chrome-based Kobo Composite Markup Generator**.

The initial iteration of this project was a Python script that required intricate environment setups, making it inaccessible to most users. Recognizing the need for a more accessible solution, I completely rewrote the tool using JavaScript and HTML. This transition ensures that users can effortlessly run the tool directly from their Chrome browser without worrying about environment configurations.

The tool has been thoroughly tested in December 2024 on both **Linux** and **Windows** operating systems using the **Google Chrome** browser, specifically with the Kobo Libra Color device with out-of-the-box software version 4.41.23. This tool has also been tested using files and directories sitting directly on my Kobo Libra Color device, with no ill effects.

## Features

- **Organizes Markups by Book Title**: Queries the `KoboReader.sqlite` database to determine what boot title your markups belong to.
- **Preserves Order of Markups based on Book "Page" Occurance**: Because markup files are randomly named, order is not preserved. This tool also uses `KoboReader.sqlite` queries to properly order your markups by book page.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive web-based interface for easy navigation and usage.
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar and logging to monitor processing status.
- **No Modification of Original Files**: Ensures that original `KoboReader.sqlite`, `.jpg`, and `.svg` files in the `.kobo/markups` folder remain unaltered.

   - **Create a New Output Directory**: 
     - **Crucial Step**: It is **crucial** to create a **new** directory that will serve as the output directory. Not doing so can negatively impact the performance of the tool.
     - **How to Create**:
       - Choose a location on your system where you want the output files to be saved.
       - Create a new folder (e.g., "CompositeOutputs") to ensure that existing files are not overwritten and to maintain optimal performance.
   - **Select Output Directory**: Click the "Select Output Directory" button and navigate to the newly created directory. Select it to set it as the destination for the processed files.
   - **Run Composite**: Once all the above steps are completed and the "Run Composite" button is enabled, click it to start the processing of your files. Monitor the progress and logs to ensure everything runs smoothly.
