**[Live demo](https://awah-demo.99ia.com.br)** — `admin@awah.demo` / `admin`, no
sign-up. A running instance with a month of traffic in it: the real queue, the
real risk engine, the real webhooks, and a simulator where the phone would be.
[What is real and what is not](docs/demo.md).

**[awah.99ia.com.br](https://awah.99ia.com.br)** — the same thing on one page, for anyone who has not decided to read a README yet.

Most gateways answer *"how do I send a message"*. AWAH exists for the second
question: **"how do I send ten thousand without losing any of them, and without
losing the number"**.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leoberchielli/awah/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

Then open `http://localhost:2900`. There is no configuration file to write and
no curl to run: the dashboard walks you through the first organization, the
first number and the first integration.

session's risk panel — ending with the whole interface switching language](docs/img/dashboard.gif)

*Recorded against a live instance. The last few seconds are the panel changing
language: it ships in ten, and the reasons a session dropped are translated too,
not left in English inside a translated screen.*

## What happens to a message

The part that separates this from a send button. Nothing is discarded — what
does not pass now, waits, and says why.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["POST /messages"] --> B[("outbox<br/>Postgres")]
    B -->|"202 accepted"| A

    B --> C{"budget<br/>has a slot?"}
    C -->|"no"| H["held<br/><i>with the reason<br/>and an ETA</i>"]
    H -.->|"when the window opens"| C

    C -->|"yes, reserved"| D{"score<br/>0–100"}
    D --> E["human jitter<br/><i>typing, then a pause</i>"]
    E --> F["engine"]

    F -->|"refused"| G["retry with backoff"]
    G --> B
    G -->|"attempts exhausted"| I["dead letter<br/><i>queryable, replayable</i>"]

    F -->|"sent"| J["ACK reconciliation<br/>sent → delivered → read"]
    J --> K["signed webhook"]
```

The queue is the product. The API answers `202` the moment the row is durable,
before any network I/O — so a process that dies loses nothing, which is
[measured by killing one](docs/VERIFICATION.md).

## Why the risk engine exists

Unofficial engines get numbers banned. Every other guarantee here is worth
nothing if the number stops existing on a Tuesday.

The engine paces sending the way a person would, and the pace is not a constant
— it opens as the number ages:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph W["Warm-up: the ceiling grows with the number's age"]
        direction LR
        D0["day 0<br/><b>5%</b><br/>1/min"] --> D3["day 3<br/><b>20%</b><br/>2/min"]
        D3 --> D7["day 7<br/><b>40%</b>"]
        D7 --> D14["day 14<br/><b>70%</b>"]
        D14 --> D30["day 30<br/><b>100%</b><br/>12/min"]
    end
```

A freshly paired number that sends a thousand messages on day one is the most
obvious throwaway-account pattern there is. Those rates are
[observed, not claimed](docs/BENCHMARK.md#the-warm-up-curve): three sessions
identical except for their pairing date, given the same backlog.

## How it is put together

    end

    subgraph ENGINES["Engines, one contract"]
        BAI["Baileys<br/><i>unofficial, free</i>"]

A session belongs to one replica at a time, through a lease in Redis. When that
replica dies, another notices and takes it over — which is also
[checked by killing one](docs/VERIFICATION.md#killing-things).

## Status

**Waves 0 through 12 are done.** The session connects and pairs, sending goes
through a durable queue with ordering guaranteed per conversation, the risk
engine paces sending to protect the number, events go out over signed webhooks,
the gateway runs across several replicas with automatic failover, the operation
is measurable from a dashboard served by the API itself, and Meta's official
engine runs behind the same contract as Baileys. Wave 8 closed the set with the
SDK, the documentation and configuration hardening. **What is missing for v1.0
is not code: it is use at scale.**

| Wave | Delivered | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Schema, migrations, authentication, RBAC, CI, Docker | ✅ |
| 1 | Baileys adapter, session lifecycle, auth state in Postgres | ✅ |
| 2 | Outbox, scheduler, webhooks, retry, DLQ | ✅ |
| 3 | Risk engine: budgets, warm-up, adaptive throttle | ✅ |
| 4 | Cluster: leases, command routing, failover | ✅ |
| 5 | Telemetry, hourly aggregates, `/metrics`, tracing | ✅ |
| 6 | React dashboard: operations, business and sessions | ✅ |
| 7 | Cloud API adapter behind the same contract | ✅ |
| 8 | Documentation, TypeScript SDK, hardening | ✅ |
| 9 | Native Chatwoot and Typebot connectors | ✅ |
| 10 | Adoption without curl: dashboard setup and connection wizards | ✅ |
| 11 | HTTP connector: plug in any platform without a new connector | ✅ |
| 12 | Published image, multi-architecture, with provenance | ✅ |

> **This has now run against real numbers.** Four of them, roughly 3,700
> messages through the Baileys engine, with signed webhooks running throughout
> and the risk engine pacing the sending. No number was blocked.
>
> Everything upstream of the last hop is measured separately, against a
> `simulator` engine that sits behind the same contract as Baileys — the queue,
> the per-conversation ordering, the retry path and the risk engine under
> concurrency. See **[the benchmark](docs/BENCHMARK.md)**, which is generated by
> a script in this repository and which you can re-run yourself.
>
> **What is still missing is scale and time.** Four numbers and a few thousand
> messages say the path works; they do not say it holds at ten times the volume,
> and nothing here can yet tell you how WhatsApp treats a number over months.
> The mechanics are covered by 419 tests, and a test is still a test.

## Measured, not asserted

Four of the claims on this page are cheap to write and expensive to verify, so
there is a script that verifies them and writes down what it found:

```bash
node scripts/benchmark.mjs --url http://localhost:2900 --key "$AWAH_KEY"
```

It produces **[docs/BENCHMARK.md](docs/BENCHMARK.md)**. From the last run:

| | |
|---|---|
| Out-of-order sends within a conversation, first attempt | **0** of 192 pairs |
| Refused sends recovered by the retry path | **all of them**, none reached the DLQ |
| Ingest through `POST /v1/sessions/:id/messages` | **~450 sends/s** |
| Warm-up: day 0 · day 3 · day 30 | **1.2 · 2.4 · 14.4** sends/min, against ceilings of 1 · 2 · 12 |

The last row is the one worth reading twice. Three sessions identical except
for their pairing date, given the same backlog: the curve holds each of them to
its own ceiling. That is the difference between a risk engine and a rate limit
in a README.

Every number comes from the `simulator` engine, which stands in for the last
hop only. They describe the gateway; they do not describe WhatsApp. The report
says so at the top and explains what is still unmeasured.

### And the ones that are not about speed

A second script asks whether the guarantees hold at all, and records what it
saw rather than only whether it was happy:

```bash
node scripts/verify.mjs --url http://localhost:2900 --key "$AWAH_KEY" \
  --email you@example.com --password ...
node scripts/verify-cluster.mjs --key "$AWAH_KEY"   # needs the cluster profile
```

**[docs/VERIFICATION.md](docs/VERIFICATION.md)** — 45 checks over ten groups,
each with its evidence: a viewer key refused a session, a scoped key answered
404 rather than 403 for a session outside its scope, a webhook signature
recomputed from the body and the secret, a delivery refused twice and landed on
the third attempt, another that never landed and ended in the dead queue where
a replay brought it back, sixty messages surviving `docker kill` mid-drain with none
stuck and none lost, and a session taken over by the surviving replica after
its owner was killed.

The second script drives Docker, because durability and failover cannot be
checked without stopping a process — and a graceful stop is the easy case, so
it uses SIGKILL.

## Bringing it up

Before installing anything, the demo answers most of what a README cannot:
**[awah-demo.99ia.com.br](https://awah-demo.99ia.com.br)**, signing in with
`admin@awah.demo` / `admin`. It also runs locally, and it is a real instance —
only the engine is simulated:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leoberchielli/awah/main/docker-compose.demo.yml
docker compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up -d
```

For a gateway of your own, without cloning anything:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leoberchielli/awah/main/docker-compose.yml
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The image comes ready from the registry — multi-architecture, amd64 and arm64,
so it runs the same on a cheap VPS, on an Apple Silicon Mac or on a Raspberry
Pi.

That brings up Postgres and Redis, applies the migrations and starts the API on
`http://localhost:2900`. Open it in the browser: the first time it shows the
setup screen, where you create the organization and your user. It closes itself
after that, and new users come in by invitation from then on.

From there it is three steps, all in the dashboard: pair the number in the
**Sessions** tab, connect the tool in the **Integrations** tab, and follow it in
**Operations**. The full walkthrough is in
[docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md); the interactive API
documentation, at `/docs`.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
```

Bring up only the dependencies and run the API on the host, with hot reload:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis
```

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Generate the two secrets and put them in `.env`:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

```bash
openssl rand -base64 48
```

Apply the migrations and start:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate && pnpm dev
```

### Running from source

`docker-compose.yml` pulls the published image, which is the path for anyone who
just wants to try it out. To build your own, add the override:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

Or put `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.dev.yml` in your `.env`
and go back to plain `docker compose up -d`.

### Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | API with hot reload |
| `pnpm dev:web` | Dashboard on `:2891`, proxying to the API |
| `pnpm test` | Unit tests |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Type checking |
| `pnpm lint` | Lint and formatting (Biome) |
| `pnpm db:generate` | Generates a migration from the schema |
| `pnpm db:migrate` | Applies pending migrations |
| `pnpm db:studio` | Opens Drizzle Studio |
| `pnpm build` | Builds API, dashboard and SDK |

## Connecting a number

The dashboard does it without curl: create the session, start it, and the
pairing panel opens with the code and the four steps to follow on the phone.

![Pairing a number: the QR code beside the four steps, and the session showing
as Pairing until the phone accepts](docs/img/pairing.gif)

The code refreshes on its own and the panel closes itself the moment the phone
accepts. The QR above is long dead — that session was deleted right after the
recording.

If you would rather do it from a terminal, the QR rotates every few seconds, so
fetch it after the START:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:2900/v1/sessions -H "Authorization: Bearer $AWAH_KEY" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"name":"support"}'
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:2900/v1/sessions/$ID/start -H "Authorization: Bearer $AWAH_KEY"
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:2900/v1/sessions/$ID/qr -H "Authorization: Bearer $AWAH_KEY"
```

The response carries the QR as raw text and as a PNG in a `data:` URI, ready for
an `<img>` tag. If you would rather have a code than a QR, use
`POST /v1/sessions/$ID/pairing-code` with the number in digits.

| Route | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /v1/sessions` | Creates the session record |
| `POST /v1/sessions/:id/start` | Opens the connection |
| `POST /v1/sessions/:id/stop` | Disconnects, preserving credentials |
| `POST /v1/sessions/:id/logout` | Removes the device from the handset and wipes credentials |
| `GET /v1/sessions/:id/qr` | QR for the pairing in progress |
| `POST /v1/sessions/:id/pairing-code` | 8-digit code, an alternative to the QR |
| `GET /v1/sessions/:id/events` | Connection and drop timeline, with a plain-language cause |
| `GET /v1/engines` | Capability matrix per engine |

### When a session drops

`GET /v1/sessions/:id/events` returns the raw protocol code next to the cause in
plain language. The difference matters: `428` is a socket drop that recovers on
its own, `440` means the credential was opened somewhere else and insisting
makes it worse, and `401` means the handset unlinked the device and only a new
pairing fixes it. The gateway reconnects on its own only in the cases where
reconnecting helps — with exponential backoff and jitter, so that ten sessions
dropping together do not all come back in the same millisecond.

A session that will not pair: set `ENGINE_LOG_LEVEL=debug` and restart.

## Sending a message

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:2900/v1/sessions/$ID/messages -H "Authorization: Bearer $AWAH_KEY" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"chatId":"5511987654321","text":"olá","clientMessageId":"pedido-4821"}'
```

It answers **202, not 200** — and the difference is the project's thesis. The
message was persisted, not delivered. Promising delivery in a synchronous
response would be a lie: WhatsApp may be down, the session may have dropped, and
since wave 3 the risk engine may hold the send on purpose. The real state lives
in `GET /v1/outbox/:id` and in the webhooks.

**`clientMessageId` is your idempotency key.** Sending the same value again
returns the original send with `duplicate: true` and produces no second message
— a retry on your side, after a network timeout, is safe by construction. If you
omit it, AWAH generates one.

`chatId` accepts the number with country code, or the full JID.

### What the queue guarantees

- **Ordering per conversation.** Within a chat, messages leave in the order they
  came in, and there are never two simultaneous sends to the same recipient.
  Different chats run in parallel. The one exception is a send the engine
  refuses: it goes back to the queue with a backoff and the next message in that
  conversation takes the head, rather than stalling the whole conversation for
  the hour its attempts take to run out. The
  [benchmark](docs/BENCHMARK.md#ordering-within-a-conversation) measures both
  the guarantee and that exception.
- **Nothing is lost.** The row exists in the database before any network I/O. If
  the process dies midway, the message goes out later.
- **Unavailability is not failure.** A session that dropped, or is still
  pairing, returns the send to the queue without consuming an attempt. Only a
  real delivery error counts.
- **Nothing is discarded.** Once the attempts run out, the message goes to the
  DLQ and stays queryable at `GET /v1/outbox?status=dead`, with replay via
  `POST /v1/outbox/:id/retry`.

## Risk engine

It is the reason the project exists. Every send passes through it, between the
reservation in the queue and the engine call.

**It never discards a message.** When the budget is spent, the send goes back to
the queue carrying the time the window opens — and that time is real, computed
from the oldest send still inside the window. When the behavior starts to look
like a mass blast, the pace drops. Refusing is not one of the options.

### Budget

Sliding windows per session — minute, hour, day — plus a separate cap on **new
contacts per day**, which is the strongest spam signal WhatsApp reads. A sliding
window and not a fixed-hour bucket: a bucket would let you send the whole cap at
13:59 and the whole cap again at 14:00.

### Number warm-up

A freshly paired number starts at **5% of the cap** and reaches 100% over thirty
days, on an interpolated ramp. The limits you configure are the target, not
today's value:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:2900/v1/sessions/$ID/risk/limits -H "Authorization: Bearer $AWAH_KEY" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"perMinute":30,"perDay":5000}'
```

Setting 5000 per day on a session paired today gives you 250 in practice. That
is deliberate.

### Score 0–100

Four signals, each with its own weight and its own reason:

| Signal | Weight | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One-sided conversation | 35 | People talk in both directions; a bot only talks |
| New contacts | 25 | Talking to a lot of strangers is what gets you reported |
| Delivery failure | 25 | Points to a bought or stale list |
| Speed | 15 | Reacts before the cap is hit |

Above 40 the pace starts to drop; above 90 it goes to 10% of throughput. It
never reaches zero — stopping on its own would be indistinguishable from a bug.

```bash
curl http://localhost:2900/v1/sessions/$ID/risk -H "Authorization: Bearer $AWAH_KEY"
```

The response carries the score with each factor's contribution, the consumption
of the windows and the limits in force. `GET /v1/risk/events` keeps every
decision with a snapshot of the budget at that instant — it answers why one
specific send was late, months later.

### Human behavior

A log-normal interval between sends (most of them near the median, with the
occasional long pause) and a typing presence proportional to the text before
each message. A uniform interval produces a regular pattern, which is exactly
what is being avoided.

### Override

```bash
curl -X POST .../messages -H 'x-awah-bypass-risk: true' ...
```

Cuts the line, on the caller's own responsibility. It is recorded in
`risk_events` like any other decision.

`RISK_ENGINE_ENABLED=false` turns everything off. Only use it with a disposable
number.

## SDK

```bash
npm install @awah/sdk
```

```ts
import { Awah } from '@awah/sdk'

const awah = new Awah({ baseUrl: 'https://awah.yourcompany.com', apiKey: process.env.AWAH_KEY! })

await awah.messages.sendText(sessionId, {
  chatId: '5511987654321',
  text: 'olá',
  clientMessageId: 'pedido-4821',
})
```

No dependencies, built on `fetch` and WebCrypto — it runs on Node, Deno, Bun,
Cloudflare Workers and in the browser. It retries `408`, `429`, `5xx` and
network failures on its own, and does not retry the other `4xx`, because sending
again produces the same rejection.

**It generates the `clientMessageId` when you do not pass one**, and that is
what makes the automatic retry safe: without an idempotency key, repeating a
POST after a network timeout would send the same message twice to the end
customer.

It also carries webhook signature verification, which is the piece that most
often goes wrong when implemented by hand. Details in
[packages/sdk](packages/sdk/README.md).

## Webhooks

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:2900/v1/webhooks -H "Authorization: Bearer $AWAH_KEY" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"url":"https://seu-sistema/hook","events":["*"]}'
```

Events: `message.received`, `message.sent`, `message.status`, `message.failed`,
`session.status`. The secret appears **exactly once**, in the creation response.

Every delivery carries `x-awah-signature` (`sha256=…`) and `x-awah-timestamp`.
The signature covers `timestamp.body`, not just the body — so a captured
delivery cannot be replayed later: changing the timestamp to escape the window
invalidates the signature.

```js
const expected = 'sha256=' + createHmac('sha256', secret).update(`${timestamp}.${body}`).digest('hex')
```

Deliveries have exponential backoff and a dead-letter queue of their own,
queryable at `GET /v1/webhooks/deliveries?status=dead` and reprocessable at
`POST /v1/webhooks/deliveries/replay`. A 4xx response that is not 408 or 429
goes straight to the dead-letter queue — retrying does not fix a rejected
payload.

## Dashboard

The dashboard is served by the API itself, on the same origin. This is not a
packaging detail: it is what lets the dashboard credential be an `httpOnly`
cookie instead of a token kept in `localStorage`. On separate origins the
browser would require `SameSite=None`, and the cookie would start traveling on
third-party requests — exactly what it is supposed to prevent.

Sign in at `http://localhost:2900` with the user created at `register`. An API
key does not get you in here, and that is deliberate: a key pasted into the
browser is within reach of every installed extension.

| Tab | What it answers |
| --- | --- |
| **Operations** | Is everything up? Are messages going out? Is risk holding anything back? |
| **Business** | How much conversation there is, how much gets answered, and how fast |
| **Sessions** | Pair, start, stop, and see the risk and drop history of each number |
| **Integrations** | Connect Chatwoot, Typebot or any HTTP endpoint, and test it before trusting it |
| **Keys** | Issue an API key, scope it to specific sessions, revoke it |
| **Users** | Add people, change roles, remove access |

The time window and the session filter live in the **URL**. An operator who sees
something odd sends the link to a colleague and the colleague opens exactly the
same screen, instead of "click 7 days, then filter by...".

The dashboard highlights one specific divergence: a session with
`desired_state=running` that is not running. That is the state that costs money
in silence — the queue keeps accepting messages and nothing goes out.

### On visual legibility

State is shape **and** color: every pill carries a dot on top of its hue,
because color blindness is common and a dashboard that speaks only in color
shuts out part of the people operating it. Every number is in a monospaced font
with tabular digits — a column that does not dance when the value changes. Light
theme, dark theme, and "the system one", which is the default.

### Seeing the dashboard with data

A fresh instance shows an empty dashboard, which is correct and not very
informative. To check the charts before you have real traffic:

```bash
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U awah -d awah -f /dev/stdin < apps/api/scripts/seed-demo-metrics.sql
```

This is **synthetic data**, written only into `metrics_hourly`. The same file
carries the `DELETE` that removes it.

### Serving it from somewhere else

The API looks for the build in `public`, `apps/api/public`, `../web/dist` and
`apps/web/dist`, in that order, and starts without a dashboard if it finds none
— the API is useful on its own. `DASHBOARD_DIR` points at an explicit directory
and beats all of them.

## Meta's official engine

The point of the `cloud_api` adapter is not the Cloud API itself — it is that it
fits into the same `EngineAdapter` as Baileys. With both behind the same
contract, whoever integrates writes the code once and moves from the unofficial
to the official one by changing a single line: start cheap and exposed to bans,
end up expensive and shielded, without rewriting anything.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:2900/v1/sessions -H "Authorization: Bearer $AWAH_KEY" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"name":"oficial","engine":"cloud_api"}'
```

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:2900/v1/sessions/$ID/credentials -H "Authorization: Bearer $AWAH_KEY" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"phoneNumberId":"1098...","accessToken":"EAAG...","verifyToken":"a-secret-of-your-own","appSecret":"the-meta-app-secret"}'
```

The response returns the URL to register in the Meta app. The credentials are
encrypted in the same table as the Baileys auth state, and not in
`sessions.config`: the token allows sending messages on the company's behalf and
reading its conversations — it is a credential, not configuration. No API read
ever returns the token.

**There is no pairing and no socket.** "Connecting" means confirming that the
token reaches the number, and failing right there is the point: without that
check, a wrong credential would only surface on the first message, already
inside the queue and counting as a delivery failure. Messages arrive by webhook,
at the `/webhooks/meta/:id` endpoint.

### What changes when you switch engines

`GET /v1/engines` publishes the matrix. The summary:

| | `baileys` | `cloud_api` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| QR pairing | yes | no — it is a token |
| Groups | yes | no |
| Typing presence | yes | does not exist in the API |
| Free-form conversation | always | only inside the 24 h window |
| Ban risk | real | none |
| Cost | zero | per conversation, billed by Meta |

Outside the 24 h window the Cloud API only accepts an approved template. Meta's
`131047` error is translated into that sentence instead of leaking the code —
without the translation, whoever integrates sees a number and concludes the
credential broke.

### Webhook security

Meta's callback is the system's **only public endpoint**: the caller is their
infrastructure, with no API key. The whole defense is in the signature, which is
why `appSecret` is mandatory — without it there would be an anonymous path for
injecting fake messages into any customer's account. The check is an HMAC over
the **raw bytes** of the body, not over re-serialized JSON: re-serializing
produces similar bytes, not identical ones, and the HMAC would fail
intermittently and inexplicably.

## Integrations

AWAH has no inbox and no flow builder, and that is a decision, not a gap.
Chatwoot already solves human support; Typebot already solves flows; any other
platform comes in through the HTTP connector. What all of them lack is precisely
what the gateway has:

| | Wired straight to Meta | With AWAH underneath |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ordering per conversation | no guarantee | FIFO per chat, chats in parallel |
| Lost message | fire and forget | durable queue, retry, DLQ with replay |
| Send pace | whatever the tool decides | budget, warm-up and adaptive brake |
| Duplicate redelivery | sends it again | idempotency by key |
| Delivery state | "I sent it" | sent → delivered → read funnel |

Connecting takes two fields: the Chatwoot address and an access token. The
gateway discovers the rest — the account, the inboxes that exist — and **creates
the API inbox with the webhook already pointed at itself**. Digging the
`accountId` out of the URL, digging the `inboxId` out of the URL and going back
there to paste the webhook were the three steps that made most people give up;
none of them exist anymore.

The connection is tested before it is saved: a wrong credential stored in
silence would only surface on a real customer's first message.

Typebot asks only for the flow's **share link** — the address and the id come
out of it.

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:2900/v1/sessions/$ID/integrations/typebot -H "Authorization: Bearer $AWAH_KEY" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"shareUrl":"https://typebot.io/meu-fluxo"}'
```

### Any other platform

The two connectors above exist because they are the most common cases. For the
rest there is the **HTTP connector**: the gateway posts every received message
to your URL and sends back whatever the response carries.

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:2900/v1/sessions/$ID/integrations/http -H "Authorization: Bearer $AWAH_KEY" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"url":"https://n8n.example.com/webhook/support","secret":"a-good-and-long-secret"}'
```

Answer `{"reply":"texto"}` and the message goes out. Answer empty and nothing
goes out — valid for anyone who only wants to log. With that, n8n, Make, a
serverless function or the in-house system become the bot, without anyone
writing a new connector in here.

**This is not the same as a webhook.** A webhook notifies and forgets: its
response is ignored. The connector asks and gets an answer, and what comes back
enters through the same queue as any other send — with ordering per
conversation, risk engine and redelivery. An n8n flow wired straight to Meta has
none of that.

The dashboard has a **Test** button that sends a sample event and shows the
status, the timing, the raw body and — when the response does not turn into a
message — the reason. Recipes for each platform in
[docs/any-platform.md](docs/any-platform.md).

The two coexist in the same session, which is the most useful arrangement:
Typebot answers first, and when the customer types **atendente** the flow goes
quiet and the agent takes over a conversation that already has the whole
history.

Details, including what is not redelivered and why, in
[docs/integrations.md](docs/integrations.md).

## Metrics

Four families, one route each. All of them read from the hourly aggregates,
never from the raw tables — that is what keeps the dashboard fast as the
database grows.

| Route | Answers |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /v1/kpi/sessions` | Uptime, drops with a plain-language cause, MTBF per session |
| `GET /v1/kpi/delivery` | sent→delivered→read funnel, p50/p95/p99 latency, queue, DLQ |
| `GET /v1/kpi/risk` | Engine decisions, new contacts, score series |
| `GET /v1/kpi/business` | Volume per hour, active conversations, time to first response, top contacts |

They accept `?hours=` (default 24, up to 720) and `?sessionId=`.

**Latency by percentile, not by average.** The distribution has a long tail:
most messages arrive in seconds and some take minutes because the recipient had
no network. The average makes that behavior disappear; the p95 shows it.

### Prometheus

```bash
curl http://localhost:2900/metrics -H "Authorization: Bearer $METRICS_TOKEN"
```

Business series (`awah_messages_sent_total`, `awah_outbox_depth`,
`awah_risk_decisions_total`, `awah_send_duration_seconds`) and process series
(heap, GC, event loop lag). Every series carries the `node` label, to tell
replicas apart within the same scrape.

Set `METRICS_TOKEN`: without it, the URL hands message volume, session count and
the health of the operation to anyone who can reach the port.

### Tracing

The code is instrumented with **the OpenTelemetry API only** — a few kilobytes,
and with no SDK registered every call becomes a no-op. Bundling the full SDK
would charge everyone tens of megabytes, including people who will never look at
a trace. Anyone who wants it plugs it in at boot:

```bash
node --require ./otel.js apps/api/dist/index.js
```

## The image

`ghcr.io/leoberchielli/awah` — multi-architecture (amd64 and arm64), published
by CI on every push.

| Tag | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `latest` | The latest tagged release. This is the one you want. |
| `edge` | Tip of the main branch. It can break. |
| `1.2.3`, `1.2`, `1` | The exact version and its ranges |
| `sha-abc1234` | A specific commit, to pin without ambiguity |

Every publish carries a signed **provenance attestation**, verifiable with `gh`:

```bash
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/leoberchielli/awah:latest --owner leoberchielli
```

This is not ceremony: whoever runs a WhatsApp gateway has their own customers'
credentials inside it, and checking where the binary came from before bringing
it up is the bare minimum.

`GET /health` returns the image's version and commit — the first question in any
support conversation, answered without opening the container.

## Cluster

Bring up as many replicas as you want, all pointing at the same Postgres and
Redis. There is no primary node, no coordinator and no election — they all run
the same code.

```bash
docker compose --profile cluster up -d
```

**Ownership by lease.** Each session belongs to one node at a time, through a
Redis key with a 15 s TTL renewed every 5 s. This is not an optimization: two
replicas with the same auth state open two sockets to the same number, and
WhatsApp drops both of them alternately with 440 — the most confusing symptom in
the protocol.

**Automatic failover.** If the owning node dies, nobody renews, the lease
expires and another replica takes over. Measured in a test with `SIGKILL`:
**~20 seconds** until the session is back up, with no intervention.

What makes this possible is the wave 1 decision — the Baileys auth state lives
in Postgres, encrypted. While the credentials sit on one node's disk, no other
replica can take over anything.

**Intent separated from state.** `desired_state` holds where the operator wants
the session; `status` holds where it actually is. Failover only revives what is
`running` — a session you stopped stays stopped.

**Routed commands.** Stopping, logging out and asking for a pairing code all
require a live socket. Arriving at the wrong replica, the command travels to the
owner over pub/sub and comes back with the result. Without this, those
operations would work or not depending on which node the load balancer picked.

**Shared QR.** Published to Redis by the owner, read by any replica.

| Variable | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NODE_ID` | hostname | The replica's identity in the cluster |
| `LEASE_TTL_MS` | 15000 | How long ownership survives without renewal |
| `LEASE_RENEW_MS` | 5000 | Renewal interval |
| `FAILOVER_SCAN_MS` | 10000 | Sweep for orphaned sessions |
| `COMMAND_TIMEOUT_MS` | 10000 | Wait for a response from another node |

### Session credentials

The Baileys auth state lives in Postgres, encrypted with AES-256-GCM, not in a
file. That is what makes failover possible: while the credentials sit on one
node's disk, no other replica can take the session over. The signal keys go in a
table of their own, one row per key — keeping them in a single blob would make
every received message rewrite megabytes.

Postgres and Redis are mandatory — there is no SQLite mode. This is deliberate:
one path only, no parity between modes to maintain, and a cluster that works
from day one.

### Authentication

Two credentials, with deliberately different powers:

- **User session** — a signed httpOnly cookie, for the dashboard. Password in
  argon2id, session revocable in the database.
- **API key** — `Authorization: Bearer awah_<prefix>_<secret>`, for
  integration. The secret is stored only as a hash.

API keys **never** administer identity: they do not create other keys, do not
promote members, do not change the organization. A key leaks into logs, into
shell history and into third-party systems — when that happens, the damage
should be "someone sent messages in my name", not account takeover.

### Roles

| Role | Reach |
| --- | --- |
| `viewer` | Reading sessions, messages and metrics |
| `operator` | What viewer does, plus sending messages and operating sessions |
| `admin` | What operator does, plus managing sessions, keys, webhooks and members |
| `owner` | Everything, including promoting another owner and deleting the organization |

The organization always keeps at least one owner — the API refuses to demote or
remove the last one.

### Retention

`retentionDays` on the organization controls how long message bodies are kept.
Default 30 days; `0` never persists content, `-1` keeps it forever. Once the
deadline passes, the row degrades to metadata and the volume and latency KPIs
keep working.
