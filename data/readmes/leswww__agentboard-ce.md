# AgentBoard CE

**Local-first workspace for open-source maintainers and coding agents.**

AgentBoard CE helps developers and open-source maintainers manage local projects, command templates, coding agent prompts, issue triage, pull request review, release notes, and documentation workflows from one dashboard.

## Why AgentBoard CE?

Open-source maintainers juggle multiple tools daily — terminal, issue trackers, code review, release notes, documentation. AgentBoard CE brings these workflows together in a single local-first application:

- **Local-First**: All data stored in SQLite on your machine. No cloud services, no external API keys required, no telemetry.
- **Developer-Focused**: Clean UI with dark mode, keyboard-friendly navigation, and responsive design.
- **Agent-Ready**: Pre-configured profiles for popular coding agents like Codex, Claude, and Cursor.
- **Workflow Automation**: Streamline issue triage, PR reviews, and release note generation.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agentboard-ce.git
cd agentboard-ce

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up the database
npx prisma migrate dev

# Seed with sample data
npm run seed

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Other Commands

```bash
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npx prisma studio    # Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
```

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: SQLite with Prisma ORM
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Custom components with shadcn/ui patterns
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Git Integration**: simple-git
- **Notifications**: Sonner
- **i18n**: next-intl

## Internationalization

AgentBoard CE supports multiple languages:

| Language | Code | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| English | `en` | Default |
| Simplified Chinese | `zh-CN` | Supported |
| Russian | `ru` | Supported |

### How It Works

- The default language is **English** on first launch, regardless of browser locale.
- Language preference is persisted in `localStorage` and a cookie.
- Switch language from the **globe icon** in the header or from **Settings > Language**.
- All UI strings, form labels, placeholders, toast messages, and documentation are fully translated.

### Adding a New Language

1. Create `messages/<locale>.json` following the structure of `messages/en.json`.
2. Add the locale to `src/i18n/config.ts` (`locales` array and `localeNames` map).
3. Add a toast message to `src/components/language-selector.tsx`.
4. Submit a PR!

## Local-First and Privacy

AgentBoard CE is designed with privacy in mind:

- **No telemetry**: Zero data collection or tracking.
- **No cloud sync**: All data stays on your machine.
- **No API keys required**: Core features work entirely offline. AI features are optional.
- **Local SQLite database**: Your data is stored in a local file (`prisma/dev.db`).
- **No user accounts**: No authentication, no sessions, no accounts.
- **Open source**: Inspect every line of code.

## Codex/OpenAI Workflows

AgentBoard CE includes optional Codex/OpenAI-assisted maintainer workflows:

- **Issue Triage**: Generate structured triage drafts with type, priority, severity, and suggested actions
- **PR Review**: Generate code review drafts with risk assessment and suggested comments
- **Release Notes**: Generate release notes following Keep a Changelog format
- **Documentation Suggestions**: Generate documentation update suggestions from project changes

All AI workflows require:
1. An OpenAI or OpenAI-compatible API key configured in Settings
2. AI features to be enabled
3. Human review of all AI-generated content

See [docs/codex-workflows.md](docs/codex-workflows.md) for details.
