# webpprof — a Telescope-like request profiler and debug toolbar for Go

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/levskiy0/webpprof.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/levskiy0/webpprof)
[![CI](https://github.com/levskiy0/webpprof/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/levskiy0/webpprof/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

`webpprof` is a Telescope-like request profiler and debug toolbar for Go
(Golang) web applications. It shows everything one HTTP request did — SQL
queries, cache operations, background jobs, logs, mail, outgoing HTTP calls,
middleware, and panics — in one searchable local UI.

> **Early-stage:** webpprof is pre-v1. Public APIs and persisted capture formats
> may change between minor releases, so pin a version and review the changelog
> before upgrading.

Use it to find why an endpoint is slow, inspect the SQL it executed, follow
related operations through `context.Context`, and replay a captured HTTP request
as cURL. webpprof runs inside the application and needs no external collector,
Docker stack, or database.

> webpprof is a development and diagnostic tool, not a long-term production
> APM. Captures are bounded and kept in memory by default, with optional local
> persistence for short investigations.

## Why webpprof?

Go already has excellent runtime profiling and observability tools. webpprof
adds a request-centric view for application debugging:

- Why is this HTTP endpoint slow?
- Which SQL queries, cache operations, and outgoing calls did it execute?
- Which logs, jobs, mail, and exceptions belong to it?
- What happened before a panic or failed response?
- Can an AI coding agent inspect the same captured timeline?

It complements `pprof`, tracing, and production APMs with a quick local Go
request profiler, SQL query profiler, debug toolbar, and observability dashboard.

## Features

- Inspect method, route, status, duration, headers, bounded bodies, raw HTTP,
  and ready-to-run cURL for captured requests.
- Correlate middleware, SQL, cache, jobs, logs, mail, outgoing HTTP,
  exceptions, and custom events through `context.Context`; inspect Schedule,
  Callable, and measured Task work as standalone execution roots.
- Find possible N+1 queries, SQL-heavy requests, sequential HTTP calls, cache
  miss/query bursts, slow middleware, and direct operation failures.
- Explore a request-wide waterfall with nesting, critical path, bottleneck, and
  operation-time breakdown.
- Search and filter live events by entity, duration, status, time, and tags.
- Profile `net/http`, Gin, Chi, Echo, Fiber, gRPC, pgx, GORM, Bun,
  `database/sql`, Redis, queues, messaging, logging, mail, and OpenTelemetry.
- Let Codex, Claude, Cursor, and other MCP clients inspect the profiler through
  the separate read-only `webpprof-mcp` binary.

## Measured capture overhead

The repository includes an end-to-end benchmark that marshals and redacts a
custom event, records it into a full 10,000-entry store, and performs one FIFO
eviction per operation. Results on Go 1.25.13, darwin/arm64, Apple M3 Pro:

| Configuration | Time/op | Bytes/op | Allocs/op |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Event kind disabled | 52 ns | 224 B | 1 |
| In-memory, steady-state eviction | 3.89 µs | 4,162 B | 51 |
| JSONL journal, steady-state eviction | 8.82 µs | 5,204 B | 60 |
| SQLite, steady-state eviction | 73.4 µs | 5,790 B | 88 |

Run both benchmark suites on deployment-like hardware:

```sh
go test . -run '^$' -bench BenchmarkProfilerOverhead -benchmem -count=6
go test ./storage/sqlite -run '^$' -bench BenchmarkProfilerSQLiteSteadyStateEviction -benchmem -count=6
```

The SQLite row includes synchronous eviction and write I/O. Run the relevant
suite before enabling additional capture kinds in a hot path. These numbers are
a reproducible reference, not a latency guarantee.

## Getting started

Install the core module:

```sh
go get github.com/levskiy0/webpprof@latest
```

Start a private profiler server and wrap the application handler:

```go
profiler, err := webpprof.Start(
    "127.0.0.1:6061",
    webpprof.WithToken(os.Getenv("WEBPPROF_TOKEN")),
    webpprof.WithExcludedRequests("GET /health", "GET *.js", "GET *.webp"),
)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
defer profiler.Shutdown(context.Background())

handler := webpprofhttp.MiddlewareWith(profiler, applicationHandler)
```

Pass the handler's context to database, cache, logger, queue, mail, and HTTP
client operations. Their profilers use that context to attach events to the
request:

```go
if err := repository.Find(r.Context(), playerID); err != nil {
    return err
}
logger.InfoContext(r.Context(), "player loaded", "player_id", playerID)
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:6061/debug/webpprof/` and enter the token. Use
`webpprof.New(router, options...)` instead when the application owns the HTTP
server that serves the profiler UI.

Third-party integrations are independent nested Go modules, so installing Gin,
pgx, or GORM support does not add unrelated SDKs to the application's module
graph:

```sh
go get github.com/levskiy0/webpprof/profiler/gin@latest
go get github.com/levskiy0/webpprof/profiler/pgx@latest
go get github.com/levskiy0/webpprof/profiler/gorm@latest
```

See [all integrations and setup examples](docs/integrations.md).

## Debug with AI agents over MCP

`webpprof-mcp` is a separate process. It reads a running profiler through its
private HTTP API and exposes bounded, read-only MCP tools over stdio:

```text
Codex / Claude / Cursor <-- MCP over stdio --> webpprof-mcp <-- HTTP --> Go application
```

Installing the Go library does not install the MCP executable. Install its
independent module from any directory:

```sh
go install github.com/levskiy0/webpprof/cmd/webpprof-mcp@latest
webpprof-mcp --version
```

For a reproducible install, replace `@latest` with `@v0.5.0`.
The executable is written to `GOBIN`, or `GOPATH/bin` when `GOBIN` is unset.

The MCP command is versioned independently. Its versions are published as
`cmd/webpprof-mcp/vX.Y.Z` Go module tags through `proxy.golang.org`, without a
separate GitHub Release. Use `@latest` or pin an exact command version.

Register it in Codex:

```sh
codex mcp add webpprof \
  --env WEBPPROF_TOKEN="$WEBPPROF_TOKEN" \
  -- webpprof-mcp --url http://127.0.0.1:6061/debug/webpprof/
```

The server provides tools to check status, list and wait for requests, inspect
automatic findings, and search related events. Payloads, values, arguments, and
stacks are omitted unless explicitly requested; tools never replay requests,
clear events, or mutate the application.

See [MCP installation, client configuration, tools, and security](docs/mcp.md).

## Try it locally

Run the bundled application from the repository root:

```sh
go run ./example
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:3030/](http://127.0.0.1:3030/), generate a successful,
failed, or panic request, then inspect it at
[http://127.0.0.1:3030/debug/webpprof/](http://127.0.0.1:3030/debug/webpprof/).
The example is a real `net/http` application using `database/sql`, pure-Go
SQLite, structured `log/slog`, SQL EXPLAIN, and SQLite-backed profiler storage.
Its composition root shows the complete integration in one place: wrap the
HTTP handler, SQL driver, and slog handler once. Its ordinary handlers also use
the optional `Measure` helper to create service-level spans while SQL and logs
remain automatic. The clearly marked `/api/manual/*` routes contain the custom
integration and synthetic diagnostics. See [example/README.md](example/README.md)
for the annotated wiring, automatic behavior, routes, and configuration.

## What is recorded

| Entity | Automatic profilers | Examples of recorded data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP request | `http`, Gin, Chi, Echo, Fiber, gRPC | Route, status, headers, bounded bodies, duration, error |
| Middleware | `http`, Gin | Name, state, total span, measured middleware work, error |
| SQL query | Bun, GORM, pgx, `database/sql`, OTel | SQL, connection, rows, duration, callsite, optional EXPLAIN |
| Cache | go-cache, go-redis | Store, operation, key, hit, TTL, duration, error |
| Job | go-queue, Asynq | Queue, state, attempts, bounded arguments, duration, error |
| Log | `slog`, Zap, zerolog | Level, message, structured fields, stack |
| Mail | email, go-mail | Transport, recipients, subject, state, duration, error |
| Outgoing call | HTTP, gRPC | Method, target, status, bounded payloads, duration, error |
| Messaging | NATS, kafka-go | Subject/topic, producer/consumer state, size, duration, error |
| Schedule | schedule | Name, planned time, state, duration, error or panic |
| Callable | callable | Custom command name, state, duration, payload/result, error or panic |
| Task | core `StartTask` / `MeasureTask` | Application operation name, state, fields, duration, error or panic |
| Exception/event | HTTP recovery or manual API | Type, message, stack, custom fields and tags |

All entity types also have context-aware manual logging APIs. See the complete
[event and entity reference](docs/event-reference.md).

Use Task for a long-running application operation that is neither an incoming
request, a scheduled callback, nor a callable command. It becomes an independent
execution root; pass the callback context to dependencies so its queries, logs,
cache operations, and outgoing calls appear in the same scope:

```go
measurement := profiler.MeasureTask(ctx, webpprof.Task{
    Name:   "reports.players.generate",
    Fields: map[string]any{"format": "pdf"},
}, func(taskCtx context.Context) error {
    return reports.Generate(taskCtx)
})

return measurement.Err
```

Use `StartTask` and `FinishResult` when the lifecycle crosses function
boundaries or result fields are only known at completion.

For application services and unsupported dependencies, measure a block without
writing stopwatch/error boilerplate:

```go
measurement := profiler.Measure(ctx, webpprof.Event{
    Kind: "service",
    Name: "players.refresh",
}, func(ctx context.Context) error {
    return players.Refresh(ctx) // nested profilers inherit this Event as parent
})

metrics.Record(measurement.Failed(), measurement.Duration)
return measurement.Err
```

`MeasureValueWith` covers `(T, error)` functions. `StartEvent` plus
`FinishResult` provides a manual lifecycle for async wrappers or result-derived
status and fields. All helpers use only the standard library, honor
`WithoutRecording`, preserve panics after recording them, and are documented in
[writing a custom profiler](docs/custom-profilers.md).

## Supported integrations

Core and standard-library profilers ship in the root module:

| Package | Integration point |
| --- | --- |
| `profiler/http` | Incoming `http.Handler`, named middleware, and `http.RoundTripper` |
| `profiler/sql` | `driver.Connector` or `driver.Driver` before `sql.OpenDB` |
| `profiler/slog` | Standard `slog.Handler` |
| `profiler/email` | Dependency-neutral mail `Sender` |
| `profiler/schedule` | Scheduled `func(context.Context)` callbacks |
| `profiler/callable` | Custom `func(context.Context) error` commands |

Optional integrations are isolated modules:

| Area | Modules |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP and RPC | Gin, Chi, Echo, Fiber, gRPC |
| SQL and ORM | pgx, GORM, Bun |
| Cache | go-cache, go-redis |
| Jobs | go-queue, Asynq |
| Messaging | NATS, kafka-go |
| Logging | Zap, zerolog |
| Mail and tracing | go-mail, OpenTelemetry |

The application retains ownership of wrapped dependencies and closes them as
usual. Use one profiler per operation path: stacking Bun, GORM, pgx,
`database/sql`, or OTel instrumentation around the same query records
duplicates.

See [installation and recipes for every profiler](docs/integrations.md) and
[SQL callsites, EXPLAIN, and replay](docs/sql-profiling.md).

## Execution correlation and findings

The request middleware stores a capture in `context.Context`. Context-aware
profilers and `Log*Context` functions inherit the request ID, tags, and current
parent operation:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Incoming request"] --> B["webpprof middleware"]
    B --> C["context.Context"]
    C --> D["SQL / cache / logs"]
    C --> E["jobs / mail / HTTP calls"]
    D --> F["Request timeline and findings"]
    E --> F
```

Automatic findings currently cover repeated query fingerprints, SQL wall-clock
coverage, sequential safe HTTP calls, cache miss/query bursts, slow middleware,
slow operations, and failed execution roots, jobs, mail, or HTTP calls. Schedule
and Callable wrappers plus the Task lifecycle create independent roots and
parent their nested work. Bottleneck analysis follows those parent links and
prefers a nested operation when it explains most of an inclusive wrapper span.
It also requires operation-specific absolute latency thresholds, so an
otherwise fast operation is not labeled merely for being the longest.

See [request correlation, tags, middleware timing, and finding rules](docs/correlation.md).

## Configuration and security

Captures default to at most 10,000 events or 64 MiB for 30 minutes, with a
64 KiB limit per HTTP body. Configure retention, byte limits, sampling,
selective capture, redaction, disabled event kinds, and optional local storage
at startup:

```go
sqliteStorage, err := webpprofsqlite.Open(context.Background(), "./var/webpprof/events.db")
if err != nil {
    return err
}

profiler := webpprof.New(
    mux,
    webpprof.WithToken(os.Getenv("WEBPPROF_TOKEN")),
    webpprof.WithRetention(2*time.Hour),
    webpprof.WithMaxEvents(25_000),
    webpprof.WithMaxBytes(128<<20),
    webpprof.WithRequestSampleRate(0.25),
    webpprof.WithStorage(sqliteStorage),
)
```

SQLite is an independent optional module:
`go get github.com/levskiy0/webpprof/storage/sqlite@latest`. Without a token,
captured data and live updates stay unavailable. Local-only unauthenticated
access requires the explicit `webpprof.WithUnsafeUnauthenticatedAccess()`
option. Existing SQLite users should follow the
[migration example](docs/configuration.md#migrating-sqlite-configuration).

Keep the profiler on loopback or a private administrative network and always
set a strong token outside source control. Captures can contain personal data,
SQL, request bodies, mail, and stack traces even after automatic redaction.

## Development

The repository uses `go.work` for local development; consumers do not need it.
Each optional integration and the MCP command has its own `go.mod`.

```sh
make check
```

The check runs dependency isolation, module verification, `go vet`, all Go
tests, JavaScript syntax validation, and whitespace checks.
