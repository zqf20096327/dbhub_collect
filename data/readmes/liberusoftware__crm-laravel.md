Liberu CRM is an open-source, multi-tenant customer relationship management application for managing contacts, companies, leads, opportunities, deals, tasks, communications, campaigns, and support work in one place.

It is built for teams that need control over their data and integrations. The application can be self-hosted, extended with Laravel, and operated with the included Docker and Kubernetes configuration.

## What it includes

- Contact, company, lead, opportunity, deal, task, note, document, and activity management.
- Sales pipelines, stages, forecasting, lead scoring, reporting, dashboards, and exports.
- Email templates and tracking, marketing campaigns, social publishing, forms, landing pages, and workflow automation.
- Unified help desk features for tickets, messages, live chat, knowledge-base articles, and chatbot interactions.
- Team membership, per-team roles and permissions, tenancy, audit logs, SSO/SAML, and OAuth connections.
- Advertising account management for Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram.
- Communication integrations including Twilio, WhatsApp Business, Mailchimp, Gmail, Outlook, IMAP, POP3, calendars, Stripe, and YouTube.
- A versioned Sanctum-protected REST API, a Filament administration panel, and Livewire-driven application screens.

## Technology

- PHP 8.5+
- Laravel 13
- Filament 5
- Livewire 4
- Laravel Jetstream and Socialstream
- Laravel Sanctum, Octane, Horizon, and Reverb
- MySQL 8+, PostgreSQL, or SQLite
- Redis 7 for queues, cache, and real-time workloads

## Installation

### Requirements

Install PHP 8.5 or newer with Composer, Node.js and npm, and one of the supported databases. Redis is required for queue, cache, or real-time features that use it.

### Automated setup

The interactive installer configures a local application, installs dependencies, builds assets, migrates and seeds the database, and runs the test suite:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/liberusoftware/crm-laravel.git
cd crm-laravel
./setup.sh
```

### Manual setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/liberusoftware/crm-laravel.git
cd crm-laravel
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Configure the database and application services in `.env`, then run:

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
npm install
npm run build
php artisan serve
```

The application is available at `http://localhost:8000`. Use `php artisan storage:link` when serving uploaded files locally.

### Docker Compose

The repository includes a PHP 8.5 application image and services for MySQL and Redis:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose exec app php artisan migrate --seed
```

Optional Compose profiles provide Horizon, Reverb, a queue worker, and Mailpit:

```bash
docker compose --profile horizon --profile reverb --profile worker --profile mail up -d
```

Kubernetes manifests and validation scripts are available under [`k8s/`](k8s/). Review secrets and storage settings before deploying to a shared or production cluster.

## Configuration

Start with [`.env.example`](.env.example). Keep application keys, OAuth secrets, webhook secrets, and service credentials outside the repository. Configure only the integrations required by your deployment.

The application supports team-aware settings and encrypted credentials for integrations. Queue workers, scheduled tasks, Horizon, Reverb, and tenancy should be configured according to the deployment environment rather than enabled blindly in development.

## API

The REST API is versioned under `/api/v1` and uses Laravel Sanctum authentication. The endpoint reference and authentication examples are in [`docs/api-documentation.md`](docs/api-documentation.md).

## Documentation

- [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md) — application capabilities and implementation status.
- [`docs/MODULAR_ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/MODULAR_ARCHITECTURE.md) — module boundaries and extension points.
- [`docs/UNIFIED_HELPDESK.md`](docs/UNIFIED_HELPDESK.md) — help desk and communication workflows.
- [`docs/contact-management-ui-ux.md`](docs/contact-management-ui-ux.md) — contact management interface.
- [`docs/email-tracking.md`](docs/email-tracking.md) — email tracking configuration and behavior.
- [`docs/oauth-authentication.md`](docs/oauth-authentication.md) — OAuth connection setup.
- [`docs/workflow-automation.md`](docs/workflow-automation.md) — automation triggers and actions.

## Development

The default development branch is `main`. Run the relevant checks before opening a pull request:

```bash
php artisan test
./vendor/bin/pint
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
npm run build
```

Use focused tests while iterating:

```bash
php artisan test --filter=ContactTest
```

### Coverage

The `tests` workflow runs the complete PHPUnit suite with Xdebug, writes `coverage.xml`, and uploads the report to [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/liberusoftware/crm-laravel). Generate the same report locally with:

```bash
php artisan test --coverage-clover=coverage.xml
```

Keep business logic in actions and services, enforce access through policies, and preserve tenant and team boundaries when adding models, routes, jobs, or Filament resources.

## Contributing

1. Create a branch from `main`.
2. Make a focused change with accompanying tests and documentation where behavior changes.
3. Run the applicable PHP and frontend checks.
4. Open a pull request against `main` with the user impact, verification commands, and any migration or configuration requirements.

Please report security vulnerabilities privately through the repository maintainers rather than opening a public issue.
