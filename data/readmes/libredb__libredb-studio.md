## Quick Start

Run a full Database Editor in one command, no clone, no build:

```bash
# Docker (recommended)
docker run -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/libredb/libredb-studio:latest

# or with Node.js 24+ (no Docker)
npx @libredb/studio
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000**. On first run, the admin password is printed to the log (zero-config).

> If the browser reaches Studio at anything other than localhost or HTTPS (`http://192.168.x.x:3000` on a LAN, for example), also set `AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=false`. Without it the health check passes while login fails silently and sends you back to the login page.

> Need Helm, Homebrew, Snap, winget, or deb/rpm? See [all install options](#getting-started).

---

## Live Test

> **Try LibreDB Studio instantly without installation!**

| Test | URL | Credentials |
|------|-----|-------------|
| **Public Test With OIDC** | [app.libredb.org](https://app.libredb.org) | SSO |
| **Public Test With JWT** | [trial.libredb.org](https://trial.libredb.org) | admin@libredb.org / Admin!2026  user@libredb.org / User!2026 |

The test instance comes with a pre-configured PostgreSQL database via [Seed Connections](#seed-connections-pre-configured-databases). No setup required!

## Overview

You create a Postgres on a managed platform. It is ready in forty seconds. Then you want to look inside it — so you open a port to the internet, dig an SSH tunnel, or install a desktop client on every machine that needs one.

LibreDB Studio goes the other way. It deploys next to the data: a container, a Helm chart, an operator, a one-click template on your PaaS, or `npm i @libredb/studio` inside your own product. Nothing has to face outward.

Seventeen engines share one interface — PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite, libSQL, DuckDB, MongoDB, Redis, Couchbase, ClickHouse, Druid, Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Apache Trino, Apache Cassandra and Prometheus — with the same explorer everywhere, and ER diagrams, schema diff and monitoring wherever the engine has something to report. Three of the seventeen are read-only because their own SQL is: Druid, Elasticsearch and OpenSearch have no `UPDATE` and no `CREATE TABLE` in the grammar at all, so those controls are reported as unsupported instead of failing when used. Cassandra is the one that reports the least on purpose: it publishes no row count and no size that is true, so the object browser shows neither rather than showing a number that is wrong — the estimate it does publish counts partitions from flushed files, and it read 143 for a 500-row table. Trino is the other odd one: it is a query engine rather than a database, so it declares no keys and no indexes and reports the bytes as belonging to the systems behind its connectors.
Prometheus is the newest, and like MongoDB and Redis it is not SQL at all: it speaks PromQL over the Prometheus HTTP API, browses metrics, rules and scrape targets, and is read-only because Studio calls none of the server's write or admin endpoints.

And nothing is held back. Single sign-on, ER diagrams, the AI features and the NoSQL engines all ship in the MIT build. MIT is not generosity here, it is a requirement of the architecture: you cannot place a per-seat licensed, feature-gated tool into every environment you own.

### Why LibreDB Studio?
- **Deploys next to the data**: container, Helm chart, Rancher, OpenShift operator, one-click PaaS template, or embedded via npm.
- **Seventeen engines, one interface**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite, libSQL, DuckDB, MongoDB, Redis, Couchbase, ClickHouse, Druid, Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Trino, Cassandra, Prometheus.
- **Runs where you are**: browser, phone, Windows, MacOS, Linux desktop.
- **A read-only agent, with your own model**: state a question, and the run drafts SQL, reads the results, and writes a report whose claims cite them. Gemini, OpenAI, or a local Ollama with open-source models.
- **Nothing behind a wall**: RBAC, OIDC single sign-on, query audit trail, and ER diagrams all ship under MIT.

## Key Features

### Professional SQL IDE
- **Monaco Engine**: Powered by the same core as VS Code.
- **Smart Autocomplete**: Schema-aware suggestions for tables, columns, and SQL keywords.
- **Command Palette**: Quick access to tables, connections, saved queries, and actions with `Cmd/Ctrl+K`.
- **Multi-Tab Workspace**: Handle parallel tasks with independent execution states.
- **Saved Query Backups**: Export the complete saved-query library as JSON. Import validates the file, preserves query metadata and merges new entries, reporting duplicate IDs while keeping existing queries intact.
- **Duplicate Connections**: Open an independent `(copy)` of an editable saved connection in the connection editor, adjust its settings and save. Cancelling leaves the saved connections unchanged; administrator-managed connections cannot be duplicated.
- **Visual EXPLAIN**: Graphical execution plans to identify performance bottlenecks.
- **Interactive ER Diagrams**: Visual schema graph with real foreign key edges, cardinality labels, MiniMap navigation, table search/filter, compact mode, and PNG/SVG export. Automatic hierarchical layout powered by ELK.js.
- **Schema Diff & Migration**: Compare schema snapshots or cross-connection schemas side-by-side. Color-coded diff view (added/removed/modified) with automatic migration SQL generation for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, and SQL Server, plus ClickHouse column modifications.
- **Snapshot Timeline**: Visual horizontal timeline of schema snapshots. Click any two points to instantly compare and track schema evolution over time.

### The Database Agent

Studio's main AI surface is an **agent rail** beside the editor; the model-backed helpers listed
below it are the others. You state an objective: *"which department has the most employees?"*, *"why
is this query slow?"*; and press Start. The run drafts SQL against the connected database, reads
what comes back, and finishes by composing a report whose every claim cites the result it came from.

- **Read-only, enforced by the database rather than by a parser.** Every statement the agent runs
  goes through the agent's own audited pipeline — a policy decision, an audit event and budget
  accounting before the driver is touched (`executeAuditedOperation`, `src/lib/db/operations/execution.ts:129`)
  — under a read-only execution profile: a read-only transaction on PostgreSQL, `PRAGMA query_only`
  re-asserted per statement on SQLite, a `READ_ONLY` engine handle on DuckDB paired with an
  SQL-level guard, because that flag alone still lets `COPY … TO`, `EXPORT DATABASE` and the
  local-file table functions through, and, on SQL Server, which has no read-only transaction of any
  kind, a session principal verified at open to be unable to write, an optimizer admission that
  compiles each statement without running it, a server-side row bound, and a transaction that is
  always rolled back. Writes and DDL are refused before the database is reached,
  and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` is default-denied because it would run the statement. This pipeline is the
  agent's alone: statements you run yourself in the editor call the provider directly
  (`src/app/api/db/query/route.ts:44`) and are neither policy-checked nor audited this way.
- **Agent mode reads PostgreSQL, SQLite, DuckDB and SQL Server only.** The read-only profile is
  database-native, so it exists only where a provider implements it — `queryReadOnly` on
  `postgres.ts`, `sqlite.ts`, `duckdb/index.ts` and `mssql.ts`, and nowhere else. On any other engine
  an Agent-mode run whose workflow sends statements is refused when it is started, before a run is
  opened, and any that reaches the provider factory ends `engine-unsupported`. **Plan** mode opens on
  every connection — the model there is toolless, runs no statement of yours, writes nothing, and
  drafts a statement for you to run yourself. Its GROUNDING reaches every engine: on PostgreSQL and
  SQLite the server composes catalog statements itself, and on every other connection it asks that
  connection's own provider to describe its
  schema — the reading the sidebar already performs — which needs no read-only statement path. So the
  two limits are separate: agent mode is those four engines, grounding is all of them, and a run whose
  reading fails says so plainly rather than inventing tables.
- **Three workflows**: **Investigate** (answer a question), **Optimize** (compare estimated plans,
  propose an index or a rewrite), **Assess** (profile tables — counts only, never values).
- **Nothing runs itself.** The agent never starts a run for you, never writes to the editor, and
  never executes what it recommends. Applying a statement is your click.
- **Evidence or nothing.** A claim with no citation cannot be composed, and the run states its own
  verdict — *"Run answered"* or *"Run did not answer"* — beside how it ended.
- **Bounded, and the meter is on screen**: 18 to 45 statements and a 360 s to 900 s run deadline
  depending on workflow, 200 rows per read. See [docs/AGENT.md](docs/AGENT.md) for the exact figures
  per workflow.
- **Your own model.** Gemini (the default), OpenAI, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
  **Agent** mode needs a model that can call tools — on Ollama, a live probe, not the vendor's page,
  is what establishes that, and the guide says how to run one. **Plan** mode needs no tools and is
  never probed (`src/lib/agent/capability-gate.ts:74`), so a model refused for Agent mode can still
  be used in Plan mode, which is what the rail offers you.
- **No model configured, no AI.** With no `LLM_*` settings at all, the rail does not render, and
  nothing leaves your network. Note that a key is not the switch: Ollama and a custom endpoint count
  as a configured model without one, and then the AI is on. What the agent sends is
  [`docs/AGENT_DATA_FLOW.md`](docs/AGENT_DATA_FLOW.md).

Standalone application only: the embedded `@libredb/studio` package carries no agent surface.

### Model-backed helpers
- **Universal LLM Support**: Defaults to Gemini and serves OpenAI, Ollama, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (LM Studio, LiteLLM, vLLM).
- **Query Safety Analysis**: AI-powered pre-execution risk assessment for destructive queries (DELETE, DROP, TRUNCATE). With no provider configured, the confirmation remains available with a plain query warning. Setting `LLM_PROVIDER` without its credentials is an unfinished setup, so that error stays visible, as do other configuration and service errors.
- **AI Query Explainer**: EXPLAIN plans translated into plain language with optimization suggestions.
- **Schema Awareness**: the connected database's schema is sent as context, so an explanation names your own tables and columns.
- **Data Profiler summary**: the profiler's per-column statistics written up in prose. That context carries each column's `min` and `max`, which are real values from your data; see [Agent Data Flow](docs/AGENT_DATA_FLOW.md).

### Pro Data Management
- **Universal Data Grid**: Virtualized rendering (TanStack) for millions of rows.
- **Inline Editing**: Double-click to update values directly in the grid, on engines whose SQL has a single-table row update (the control is hidden elsewhere).
- **Column Filtering**: Per-column text filters on query results for instant data exploration.
- **Interactive Pivot Table**: Client-side pivoting with 5 aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX) and SQL generation.
- **Expert Exporter**: Instant CSV and JSON exports for reporting. CSV import and result export offer comma (default), semicolon and tab separators. Every format the Export menu writes to a file it also copies straight to the clipboard.

### Advanced Data Visualization
- **8 Chart Types**: Bar, Line, Pie, Area, Scatter, Histogram, Stacked Bar, and Stacked Area charts powered by Recharts.
- **Data Aggregation**: Group-by with SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX aggregation functions. Date grouping by hour, day, week, month, or year.
- **Chart Persistence**: Save chart configurations and reload them instantly. Manage a library of saved charts.
- **Chart Dashboard**: Grid view of all saved charts for at-a-glance data overview directly in the bottom panel.

### Display Masking (Preview)
- **Client-Side Display Layer**: Masks sensitive values in the browser UI — useful for screen sharing, demos, and reducing accidental on-screen exposure. **Not server-enforced**; query API responses still contain full values for authenticated users.
- **Column-Name Pattern Matching**: 10 built-in patterns (email, phone, credit card, SSN, password, IP, date, financial, and more) match **result column headers** by regex. Works when the output name matches (e.g., `SELECT salary`). Aliases (`salary AS x`) and aggregates (`SUM(salary)`) are not masked today.
- **Configurable Rules**: Admin panel to add, edit, enable/disable masking patterns. Email, phone, credit card and SSN presets prefill the Add Pattern form so column patterns can be adapted before saving. Custom patterns support regex. Settings stored per-browser in localStorage.
- **RBAC UI Controls**: User role cannot toggle or reveal masked cells in the UI. Admin role can toggle masking and temporarily reveal individual cells (10s auto-hide).
- **Export & Clipboard**: CSV, JSON, and SQL INSERT exports, whether saved as a file or copied to the clipboard, use masked display values when masking is active in the UI. This does not prevent access to raw data via the API, browser DevTools, or admin reveal.
- **UI Coverage**: Grid, mobile card/table views, row detail sheet, and clipboard copy respect the active display mask.

### Analyst & Developer Tools
- **AI Data Profiler**: One-click table profiling with column statistics (null %, cardinality, min/max, sample values) and AI-powered narrative summaries.
- **ORM Code Generator**: Generate TypeScript interfaces, Zod schemas, Prisma models, Go structs, Python dataclasses, and Java POJOs from live table schemas.
- **Test Data Generator**: Schema-aware fake data generation with 30+ semantic column inferences (email, phone, name, address, etc.). Produces INSERT statements or MongoDB insertMany JSON.
- **Database Documentation**: Auto-generated searchable data dictionary from live schema with AI-powered documentation and Markdown export.

### Authentication & SSO
- **Dual Auth Modes**: Local email/password login or OpenID Connect (OIDC) Single Sign-On; switchable via environment variable.
- **Vendor-Agnostic OIDC**: Works with any OIDC-compliant provider — Auth0, Keycloak, Okta, Azure AD, Zitadel, Google, and more.
- **One-Command SSO Demo**: `docker compose -f docker-compose.oidc-demo.yml up` starts Studio with a preconfigured Keycloak so you can try SSO and role mapping locally ([walkthrough](docs/OIDC.md#try-it-locally-with-keycloak)).
- **PKCE Security**: Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (S256) for secure authentication.
- **Auto Role Mapping**: Configurable claim-based role mapping with dot-notation for nested claims (e.g., `realm_access.roles`).
- **Provider Logout**: Logout clears both the local JWT session and identity provider session.

### DBA Maintenance Toolkit (Admin Only)
- **Live Monitoring Dashboard**: 7-tab monitoring with Overview, Performance, Queries, Sessions, Tables, Storage, and Connection Pool views.
- **Time-Series Trend Charts**: Real-time metric trends (connections, cache hit ratio, buffer pool, deadlocks) with auto-refreshing ring buffer history.
- **Configurable Auto-Refresh**: Polling intervals from 5s to 60s with play/pause control.
- **Threshold Alerting**: Color-coded health indicators (healthy/warning/critical) for cache hit ratio, connection usage, deadlocks, and buffer pool utilization.
- **Connection Pool Stats**: Live total/active/idle/waiting pool metrics with utilization progress bars.
- **One-Click Maintenance**: Trigger `VACUUM`, `ANALYZE`, `REINDEX`, `UPDATE STATISTICS`, `DBCC CHECKDB`, and `ALTER INDEX REBUILD` per database engine.
- **Audit Trail**: Full history of every query executed across the organization. The admin Audit tab exports loaded operations and query history as CSV or JSON, respecting the current filters.

## Supported Databases

| Database | Driver | Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PostgreSQL** | `pg` | Full SQL IDE, EXPLAIN plans, transactions, query cancellation (`pg_cancel_backend`) |
| **MySQL** | `mysql2` | Full SQL IDE, EXPLAIN plans, transactions, query cancellation (`KILL QUERY`) |
| **Oracle** | `oracledb` (Thin mode) | Full SQL IDE, `FETCH FIRST N ROWS` pagination, `V$` monitoring views, `ANALYZE TABLE`, `ALTER INDEX REBUILD`, transactions |
| **SQL Server** | `mssql` (tedious) | Full SQL IDE, `TOP N` / `OFFSET FETCH` pagination, `sys.dm_*` DMVs, `UPDATE STATISTICS`, `DBCC CHECKDB`, transactions, Azure SQL auto-detect |
| **SQLite** | `bun:sqlite` / `node:sqlite` (runtime-selected) | Full SQL IDE, file-based or in-memory databases (server-local file) |
| **libSQL** | none — HTTP (the Hrana protocol, `POST /v2/pipeline`, port 8080) | Full SQL IDE against a libSQL server or Turso Cloud — the same SQLite dialect as the row above, reached across a network instead of on disk. `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`, `sqlite_master` and `pragma_*` introspection, and real per-table bytes from `dbstat`, which the file-based driver above cannot read. The credential is an auth token rather than a password. Two maintenance operations only, `REINDEX` and `PRAGMA integrity_check`: the server refuses `VACUUM`, `ANALYZE`, `PRAGMA optimize` and `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint` outright, so no control is offered for them |
| **DuckDB** | `@duckdb/node-api` (a native N-API addon, ~68 MB of platform bindings) | Full SQL IDE against a local DuckDB file or `:memory:`, on the server the app runs on. `EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON)` physical plan trees, `duckdb_*` catalog introspection, real per-table bytes from `pragma_storage_info` block allocation, and query cancellation through the driver's own `interrupt()`. Three maintenance operations, `VACUUM`, `ANALYZE` and `CHECKPOINT`: `REINDEX` is a parser error here and neither `PRAGMA integrity_check` nor `PRAGMA optimize` exists, so no control is offered for them. No slow-query log and no session list — DuckDB publishes neither, so those panels say so rather than showing a zero. The file admits exactly ONE operating-system process, refused in read-only mode too, so a second Studio instance cannot open a database this one holds |
| **MongoDB** | `mongodb` | JSON query editor, collection operations (find, aggregate, insert, update, delete) |
| **Couchbase** | none — HTTP (Query + management REST) | Full SQL++ IDE, EXPLAIN plans, bucket/scope/collection explorer, `INFER` column inference, read-your-writes consistency, `UPDATE STATISTICS` / `BUILD INDEX` / request kill |
| **ClickHouse** | none — HTTP (SQL interface, port 8123) | Full SQL IDE, JSON EXPLAIN plan trees, system-table schema introspection, `OPTIMIZE TABLE` / table statistics / query kill maintenance |
| **Apache Druid** | none — HTTP (`POST /druid/v2/sql`, Router port 8888 or Broker 8082) | Read-only SQL IDE, native-query EXPLAIN plan trees, `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` datasource introspection, `sys.*` monitoring (segments, servers, ingestion tasks). Druid SQL has no `UPDATE`, no `DELETE` and no `CREATE TABLE`, and nothing it can do counts as a maintenance operation — a datasource changes through ingestion, not from the editor |
| **Elasticsearch** | none — HTTP (`POST /_sql?format=json`, port 9200) | Read-only SQL IDE, mapping-driven index/field explorer, cluster health plus per-index document counts and store sizes. No EXPLAIN, no maintenance operation, no slow-query or session panel: those live in log files and stats APIs the SQL surface does not reach. Elasticsearch SQL also has no `OFFSET`, so a second page of results cannot be requested — narrow the statement or raise the limit instead |
| **OpenSearch** | none — HTTP (`POST /_plugins/_sql`, port 9200) | The same read-only SQL IDE and explorer, from the same provider module. `LIMIT n OFFSET m` does work here, so paging does |
| **Apache Trino** | none — HTTP (the client protocol, `POST /v1/statement`, port 8080) | Full SQL IDE across every configured catalog, `EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON)` plan trees, `information_schema` schema tree for the catalog the connection pins, `system.runtime` + `jmx` monitoring, real `SHOW STATS` row counts, query cancellation and `kill_query` maintenance. Trino is a query engine and stores nothing, so it declares no primary keys, no foreign keys and no indexes anywhere — the ER diagram draws boxes and no edges, inline row editing is switched off, and the size panels name the catalogs rather than inventing a footprint. A failed statement arrives as HTTP 200, and a password is refused over plain HTTP even on a cluster with authentication disabled |
| **Apache Cassandra** | `cassandra-driver` (pure JS, no native module) | CQL IDE over the native protocol (port 9042), keyspace browser marking partition and clustering keys, `system_views` overview, uptime and running statements. No EXPLAIN (the keyword is not in CQL), no cancellation (the protocol has none), no maintenance (every operation is a `nodetool` action), and **no row counts or sizes**: the only figures Cassandra publishes are partition estimates from flushed files and whole mebibytes, so neither is shown rather than shown wrong |
| **Prometheus** | none, HTTP (the Prometheus HTTP API, port 9090) | PromQL editor whose text reaches the server unchanged, results in the grid and the chart tab (a stepped subquery such as `rate(x[5m])[1h:1m]` charts as lines over its timestamps: the tab opens on the first series, more are added from the Y-Axis menu, one line each, and at most eight are drawn at once, past which it says "Showing first 8 of N series"; but the chart draws a missing sample, and a `NaN` or `Inf` among numbers, at 0, so a raw range over targets scraped at their own offsets charts false zeros), a metric browser with label names as columns and metadata as the source, rule groups with recording and alerting rules (a firing alert is marked in the tree), scrape pools and targets (a down target is marked), and health, version, uptime and TSDB statistics. Read-only by design: no admin API, no remote write, no EXPLAIN (the parse endpoint is experimental) and no maintenance. A credential over plain HTTP is sent rather than refused, so enable TLS across a network you do not control |
| **Redis** | `ioredis` | Command editor, key browser, INFO-based monitoring |

> **Twenty-seven more engines have no driver of their own.** The seventeen above are the drivers this build ships. Twenty-seven further engines speak one of those wire protocols and connect through an existing driver unchanged, so seventeen drivers reach forty-four named engines in all. They are MariaDB, Percona Server for MySQL, TiDB, Vitess, StarRocks, Apache Doris, OceanBase, SingleStore, Databend, Citus, Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL, ParadeDB, OrioleDB, TimescaleDB, YugabyteDB, AlloyDB Omni, Apache Cloudberry (incubating), CockroachDB, Materialize and RisingWave (as PostgreSQL or MySQL), Valkey, DragonflyDB, KeyDB and Garnet (as Redis), FerretDB (as MongoDB), ScyllaDB (as Cassandra), and VictoriaMetrics (as Prometheus). Each was measured against a live instance, and how much of the product works differs per engine. MariaDB, both Percona distributions, TiDB, Vitess, AlloyDB Omni, Citus, TimescaleDB, YugabyteDB, ParadeDB, OrioleDB, Valkey, DragonflyDB, KeyDB and FerretDB behave as their driver's own engine, though three of them report statistics you should not trust: a Citus distributed table and a TimescaleDB hypertable report row counts and sizes that are wrong rather than missing, and YugabyteDB reports 0 until you run `ANALYZE`. Vitess is not one of those three, its row counts and sizes being exact to the byte, but a running query cannot be cancelled there: vtgate refuses `KILL QUERY` and the statement runs to completion. AlloyDB Omni is not one of them either, reporting 2000 rows for 2000 and 270336 bytes for 270336, but two things there surprise: `version()` names AlloyDB nowhere, so the version panel cannot be told apart from a stock PostgreSQL 17, and eight of AlloyDB's own `google_ml` tables list in the object browser, which any role that can connect at all may also read. StarRocks reports itself as MySQL 5.1 and loses its overview, health and session panels, its monitoring dashboard rendering six panels with the session one carrying the engine's own refusal; Apache Doris - the engine StarRocks is a fork of - loses only the overview and health panels, to one statement form its grammar rejects, and is the more trustworthy of the two where it counts: it reports 2000 rows and 10187 bytes for a table holding exactly that, where StarRocks reads zero at first too - its own background statistics collector is slower, measured 4.5 minutes against 3.3.22 where Doris's is about a minute - and, until a 2026-09-16 fix, read zero forever afterward for sizes specifically, because StarRocks' `INDEX_LENGTH` is NULL rather than Doris's real 0 and poisoned the sum the provider computed in SQL; no index is ever reported, and a foreign key is accepted, listed by `SHOW CONSTRAINTS`, invisible to the ER diagram and unenforced; Cloudberry loses the monitoring dashboard and its table and index statistics, all three to one MPP planner restriction, and reads a foreign key back as though it were enforced when it is not, though its row counts are correct; CockroachDB loses the object browser and the size panels; OceanBase answers fourteen of the fifteen surfaces but only twelve of them usefully, health failing outright because its tenant has no `performance_schema` database at all and every size reading 0 B, though its row counts are correct once `ANALYZE TABLE` has run; SingleStore lost five surfaces to a cause that was ours rather than its own - the provider sent every statement through the prepared-statement protocol, which SingleStore refuses for the `SHOW` and `EXPLAIN` statements four panels need - and four of those five are now recovered, its Explain panel being the one that is not, because there the grammar wants `EXPLAIN JSON` and the statement fails on either protocol; its numbers are still missing rather than wrong, a 2000-row table reading 0 rows and 0 B with no `ANALYZE` able to change it; ScyllaDB loses five surfaces and Test Connection with them, all six to one absent keyspace - the overview, health, performance-metrics, active-session and monitoring panels read Cassandra's `system_views` virtual tables and ScyllaDB has no `system_views` keyspace at all - those five now degrade to empty rather than throwing, so Test Connection passes and the dialog saves the connection, which it could not do at all until that change - while the editor and the object browser work in full, every one of 18 CQL types reading back byte-identically to the Cassandra 5.0.9 probed in the same pass; ParadeDB and OrioleDB are both full and their costs are opposites: ParadeDB's nine extensions put 41 objects in the object browser for 2 user tables and break agent plan mode on a stock install, while OrioleDB's browser is clean and its own storage is invisible to PostgreSQL's size functions, so every index reads 0 bytes and the cache hit ratio reads N/A. Materialize and RisingWave are partial: the object browser shows their tables, views and materialized views with their columns, while row counts, sizes and the monitoring statistics stay blank. Databend is query-editor-only, and its catalogs answer perfectly well when asked directly - the object browser is empty because our parameterised reads use a prepared protocol it does not implement. Garnet behaves as Redis and is one of three relatives here (with Valkey and DragonflyDB) whose own version `INFO` carries beside the Redis compat level and the overview now labels ahead of it - `Garnet 2.1.5 (Redis 7.4.3)` - and two of its readings are absences wearing a value, every size showing 0 B because it publishes no `used_memory` and the cache hit ratio showing 100% because it publishes no keyspace counters.
> VictoriaMetrics runs PromQL through the Prometheus driver and lists its metrics with their label columns, its targets, and its ten metrics with the most series, but its rule folders are empty, because a single-node server evaluates no rules; the overview, the storage statistics and the scrape pool folder fail, because it does not serve three of the Prometheus endpoints they read; a metric's source shows no unit and a target's no scrape interval or timeout, because it sends none, and a target it has not scraped yet reads as down; and a string expression returns no rows, a subquery's points are counted back from its evaluation time, and no PromQL info or warning appears beside any result.
> The per-engine detail, with the exact version probed, is in [`docs/providers/README.md`](docs/providers/README.md#wire-compatible-engines): we publish a name only after connecting to it, so a name absent there is untested rather than unsupported.

> **Transport security is cross-cutting, not per engine.** The SSH tunnel is opened before the provider connects and the connection is rewritten to the local endpoint, so it is provider-independent: it applies to any connection configured with a host and a port. A connection entered as a connection string instead (an option for MongoDB, Couchbase, ClickHouse and libSQL) carries neither, so it is not tunnelled; SQLite and DuckDB have neither either. The SSL/TLS panel is honoured by every engine that shows it — which is every engine except the three file-based ones, SQLite, DuckDB and the embedded LibreDB, where no transport exists to secure and no panel is offered. On Trino it is load-bearing rather than optional, because the coordinator refuses a password over plain HTTP. Oracle is the one engine whose mapping carries a caveat worth stating up front: its Thin driver always verifies the certificate chain, so `require` needs the server's CA supplied when that certificate is self-signed, and a connect string pasted whole keeps whatever protocol it names.

> All SQL databases share: schema explorer, ER diagrams, schema diff & migration, display masking (preview), monitoring dashboard, and connection string import. Druid, Elasticsearch, OpenSearch and Trino are each the exception twice over: their HTTP SQL APIs have no URI convention this build can parse, so they are configured by host and port only, and a generated migration names the limitation instead of emitting column-modification DDL against an engine whose SQL contains none — as it also does for Couchbase's schemaless collections. An ER diagram over a search cluster draws boxes and no edges: an index declares no foreign keys and the engine's model has none to declare, which the provider states as `declaresForeignKeys: false` rather than leaving to be guessed from an empty list.

> **Provider reference docs:** each database has an in-depth reference (design, connection, query format, monitoring, limitations) under [`docs/providers/`](docs/providers/README.md). For the provider architecture see [`docs/DATABASE_PROVIDERS.md`](docs/DATABASE_PROVIDERS.md), and to add a new database see [`docs/ADDING_A_PROVIDER.md`](docs/ADDING_A_PROVIDER.md).

  > Homebrew, deb/rpm, Snap, the Windows portable zip, winget/Chocolatey, the desktop AppImage and Debian package, and the npx launcher consume standalone artifacts attached to each GitHub release. Full per-channel guide — commands, configuration, systemd usage, and the Docker image tag model — in [`docs/DISTRIBUTION.md`](docs/DISTRIBUTION.md). Channel coverage scorecard (live / pending, by platform and category) — [`docs/CHANNELS.md`](docs/CHANNELS.md).

  ### Quick Start (Docker)

  Run LibreDB Studio with a single command — no clone, no install, no build:

```bash
docker run \
  --name libredb-studio \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@libredb.org \
  ghcr.io/libredb/libredb-studio:latest
```

  > **Registry**: `ghcr.io/libredb/libredb-studio` is the primary image (no pull rate limits — preferred for Kubernetes/CI). The same image is also mirrored to Docker Hub as [`libredb/libredb-studio`](https://hub.docker.com/r/libredb/libredb-studio?tag=latest) for convenience.

  > **Variants**: every tag also ships on Alpine. `:latest-alpine` is the same product on a musl base with a much smaller OS attack surface, and `:latest-alpine-slim` is smaller still in exchange for the DuckDB driver. The default tag stays Debian and is the only one where Oracle Thick mode can be layered on — [`docs/DISTRIBUTION.md`](docs/DISTRIBUTION.md#image-tag-model) has the table.

  > **IPv6**: the container picks its own bind address at startup and prefers `::`, which serves IPv4 and IPv6 through one socket — so an IPv6-only host needs no flags. It falls back to `0.0.0.0` where the namespace has no usable IPv6, and logs which it chose. Add `-e HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` to pin it to IPv4 — details, and the Kubernetes equivalent, in [`docs/DISTRIBUTION.md`](docs/DISTRIBUTION.md#network-exposure-bind-address).

  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The command above sets no password, so the first start generates one and prints it to the container log with `docker logs libredb-studio` — sign in as `admin@libredb.org` with the password it printed, or set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` yourself.

  > **Auth env vars (local provider):** `ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `JWT_SECRET` are only required when `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP=off`; otherwise both are generated on first start (see [Zero-config first run](#zero-config-first-run) below). `USER_EMAIL` / `USER_PASSWORD` are optional; omit them to run admin-only (no default user password is ever assumed). `ADMIN_EMAIL` defaults to `admin@libredb.org`. Using OIDC (`NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_PROVIDER=oidc`)? None of these are needed.

  > **Tip**: Add `-e LLM_PROVIDER=gemini -e LLM_API_KEY=your_key -e LLM_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash` to enable AI features.

  ### Zero-config first run

  Starting the server without `JWT_SECRET` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` works out of the box:
  the missing values are generated on first start, stored in `<data dir>/auth-bootstrap.json`
  (file mode 0600), and the admin password is printed once to the server log. Explicitly
  set environment variables always take precedence. Set `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP=off` to require
  explicit configuration instead (recommended for production deployments).

  A `JWT_SECRET` you set yourself must be at least 32 characters. A shorter one is a
  hard error at startup: the server prints what is wrong and exits with code 1, instead
  of booting into a state where the health check reports healthy but every login returns
  503. Unset the variable to let the first run generate a strong secret for you.

  ### Linux packages (.deb / .rpm)

  Native packages for Debian/Ubuntu and RHEL/Fedora (amd64 and arm64) are attached to every
  [GitHub release](https://github.com/libredb/libredb-studio/releases). They bundle the standalone
  server together with a private Node.js runtime (nothing else to install) and register a systemd service:

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo dpkg -i libredb-studio_<version>_amd64.deb

# RHEL / Fedora / Rocky
sudo rpm -i libredb-studio-<version>.x86_64.rpm

# Start the service (first run prints the generated admin password to the journal)
sudo systemctl enable --now libredb-studio
journalctl -u libredb-studio
```

  Configuration lives in `/etc/libredb-studio/env` (loaded by the unit; see the commented template
  installed there), state (SQLite storage and generated credentials) in `/var/lib/libredb-studio`.
  The `libredb-studio` command can also be run directly without systemd. Full details for this and
  every other channel: [`docs/DISTRIBUTION.md`](docs/DISTRIBUTION.md).

  ### Prerequisites
  - [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (Recommended) or Node.js 24+
  - A target database to query (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite, libSQL, DuckDB, MongoDB, Couchbase, ClickHouse, Apache Druid, Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Apache Trino, Apache Cassandra, Redis, or Prometheus)

  ### Quick Start (Local)
  1. **Clone & Install**
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/libredb/libredb-studio.git
     cd libredb-studio
     bun install
     ```

    2. **Configure Environment**
       Create a `.env.local` file:
       ```env
       # Authentication (email/password)
       ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@libredb.org
       USER_EMAIL=user@libredb.org
       JWT_SECRET=your_32_character_random_string

       # Optional: OIDC Single Sign-On (Auth0, Keycloak, Okta, Azure AD, etc.)
       # NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_PROVIDER=oidc
       # OIDC_ISSUER=https://your-provider.com
       # OIDC_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
       # OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

       # LLM Configuration
       LLM_PROVIDER=gemini # options: gemini, openai, ollama, custom
       LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key
       LLM_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
       LLM_API_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1 # optional for local LLMs (Ollama)
       ```

3. **Launch**
   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

  ### Embedding in your own app (`@libredb/studio`)

  Studio is published as an npm package as well as a server, so the editor can live inside your own
  product:

  ```bash
  npm i @libredb/studio
  ```

  **Adopt Studio's security headers from your own Next.js config.** The `@libredb/studio/security`
  subpath publishes the header policy as pure data — `securityHeaders()` returns a plain
  `Record<string, string>`, and the module it comes from imports nothing, so it is safe to load from
  a `next.config.ts` where no path alias and no Studio runtime exist yet:

  ```ts
  // next.config.ts
  import { securityHeaders } from "@libredb/studio/security";

  export default {
    async headers() {
      return [
        {
          source: "/:path*",
          headers: Object.entries(securityHeaders()).map(([key, value]) => ({ key, value })),
        },
      ];
    },
  };
  ```

  Options: `reportOnly` emits `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` instead of the enforcing header;
  `hsts: false` disables HSTS (or an object customises it); `allowEval` adds `'unsafe-eval'`, which
  React's *development* build needs; `monacoVsPath` adds the origin serving Monaco's bundle when it
  is not same-origin; and `extra` merges your own sources per directive. `studioCspDirectives()` and
  `HSTS_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` are exported too, for a config that needs to compose the policy rather than
  send it.

  Read the policy before you inherit it: the CSP permits inline scripts, because every document
  route is statically prerendered with nonce-less hydration scripts, so what it contains is where an
  injected script could *send* data, not whether one can run. That trade-off, and the two delivery
  paths a Next.js app has for these headers, are argued in
  [`docs/SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md).

## Development Databases

Need databases to test with? We provide ready-to-use containers for all supported engines:

```bash
# Start every default-profile database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQL Server, Oracle, ...)
docker compose -f database-compose.yml up -d

# Or start a specific database
docker compose -f database-compose.yml up -d postgres
docker compose -f database-compose.yml up -d mssql
docker compose -f database-compose.yml up -d oracle

# Apache Druid: profile-gated, so a bare `up -d` does NOT start it. Druid is a distributed
# system with no single-container mode - five Druid processes plus ZooKeeper plus its own
# metadata database is the minimum that can answer a SQL query, so all seven services carry
# `profiles: [druid]` rather than doubling the default stack. Connect to the Router on 8888
# (or the Broker on 8082 - the same endpoint, no different configuration).
docker compose -f database-compose.yml --profile druid up -d

# Start PostgreSQL with sample e-commerce data
docker compose -f docker/postgres.yml up -d

# Stop (keeps data)
docker compose -f database-compose.yml down

# Stop and remove all data
docker compose -f database-compose.yml down -v

# The Druid containers need the profile flag here too - without it `down` leaves them running
docker compose -f database-compose.yml --profile druid down -v
```

### Connection Details

| Database | Host | Port | User | Password | Database/Service |
|----------|------|------|------|----------|-----------------|
| **PostgreSQL** | localhost | 5432 | postgres | postgres | postgres |
| **MySQL** | localhost | 3306 | root | root | mysql |
| **SQL Server** | localhost | 1433 | sa | Password123! | master |
| **Oracle** | localhost | 1521 | system | Password123! | freepdb1 |
| **MongoDB** | localhost | 27017 | admin | admin | — |
| **Apache Druid** | localhost | 8888 (Router) or 8082 (Broker) | — | — | — (one catalog, always `druid`) |
| **Apache Trino** | localhost | 8080 | — | — | `tpch` (a *catalog*; `tpcds`, `memory`, `system` and `jmx` are configured too) |
| **Prometheus** | localhost | 9090 | none | none | none (one server is one TSDB) |
| **Prometheus** with basic auth (profile `prometheus-auth`) | localhost | 9091 | studio | studio-probe | none |

### PostgreSQL Sample Data

The `docker/postgres.yml` setup includes a pre-loaded e-commerce schema:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **PostgreSQL 18** | Official image with `pg_stat_statements` |
| **pg_stat_statements** | Pre-enabled for query monitoring |
| **Sample Schema** | E-commerce database (app schema) |
| **Sample Data** | 25 customers, 30 products, 100 orders |
| **Views** | Order summary, product sales, customer LTV |

Sample tables: `app.customers`, `app.products`, `app.orders`, `app.order_items`, `app.product_reviews`, `app.categories`, `app.coupons`, `app.audit_log`

> This setup is ideal for testing the **Monitoring Dashboard** features with real `pg_stat_statements` data.

---

## Testing

LibreDB Studio has a comprehensive test suite: 549 test files and 17,692 tests across seven layers, plus 79 browser tests, with **100% line coverage** enforced by CI (`bun run coverage:check`).

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Every test file, each in its own bun process
bun run test

# Run by layer
bun run test:unit          # Pure function tests (328 files)
bun run test:api           # API route handler tests (35 files)
bun run test:integration   # Database provider tests (24 files)
bun run test:hooks         # React hook tests (21 files)
bun run test:security      # Security posture tests (21 files)
bun run test:evals         # LLM prompt evaluation tests (13 files)
bun run test:components    # Component tests (107 files: tests/components and tests/isolated)

# Any subset, and what the runner would run
bun tests/run-tests.ts tests/integration/db/duckdb-provider.test.ts
bun tests/run-tests.ts --list
bun tests/run-tests.ts --jobs=4          # bound the concurrency

# E2E tests (requires build)
bun run test:e2e           # Playwright browser tests (79 cases across chromium and webkit)

# Coverage report (lcov)
bun run test:coverage
```

### Test Architecture

| Layer | Directory | Files | Tests | What it covers |
|-------|-----------|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Unit** | `tests/unit/` | 328 | 9,645 | Pure functions: SQL parser, connection strings, data masking, query limiter, schema diff, error classes, DB icons, showcase queries, and the packaging and chart manifests |
| **API** | `tests/api/` | 35 | 602 | Route handlers: auth, query, transaction, maintenance, AI endpoints, middleware |
| **Integration** | `tests/integration/` | 24 | 2,768 | Database providers: PG, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Couchbase, Redis, Oracle, MSSQL, ClickHouse, Druid, Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Trino |
| **Hooks** | `tests/hooks/` | 21 | 566 | React hooks: auth, connections, tabs, query execution, transactions, inline editing, monitoring |
| **Security** | `tests/security/` | 21 | 322 | The posture `docs/SECURITY.md` claims: route exposure, headers, audit channels, credential handling |
| **Evals** | `tests/evals/` | 13 | 198 | LLM prompt behaviour against recorded models |
| **Components** | `tests/components/`, `tests/isolated/` | 107 | 3,376 | UI components with `happy-dom`: Studio, Sidebar, QueryEditor, ResultsGrid, Admin Dashboard, Charts, ERD |
| **E2E** | `e2e/` | 18 | 79 | Full browser flows: login, connections, query execution, tabs, export, admin |

The Files column was counted on 2026-09-15 with `bun tests/run-tests.ts --list` for the first seven rows and `playwright test --list` for the last.
The Tests column comes from an earlier full run the same day, over the 542 files the tree held then, so the per-layer numbers are a little below the 17,692 above: they do not yet count the seven test files this branch and the merge from main add under `tests/unit/`, nor the cases this branch adds to the runner's own test files.
The nineteenth spec in `e2e/`, `base-path.spec.ts`, is not in that 18: it needs its own server configuration and runs as `bun run test:e2e:base-path`.

### Key Details

- **Test runner**: [`tests/run-tests.ts`](tests/run-tests.ts) over `bun:test`. It discovers every `*.test.ts` and `*.test.tsx` file under `tests/` except `tests/live/`, so a new test file runs the moment it is added, and it runs each file in its own bun process, several at a time (one per CPU by default, `--jobs=N` to change it).
- **Why a process per file**: bun's `mock.module()` is process-wide with no undo, and whole-module mocks are the standard pattern in `tests/api/`, so files that share a process contaminate each other. On Linux with 20 cores and bun 1.4.2, the suite took 211 seconds one file at a time, 61 seconds 4 at a time and 36 seconds 20 at a time, measured on 2026-09-15 over the 538 files the tree held then; `docs/BACKLOG.md` D86 carries the same three timings and the same basis.
- **One command everywhere**: the runner is TypeScript rather than shell so that the command a contributor is told to run works on Linux, macOS and Windows from the platform's own shell. The bash scripts it replaced did not: one used `mapfile`, a bash 4 builtin that macOS's bash 3.2 does not have.
- **E2E**: Playwright runs the full suite on Chromium and the `security-headers` spec on WebKit (`webkit-security`), against a production build (`bun run build && bun start`)
- **CI**: GitHub Actions runs lint + typecheck + build, the required `Unit & Integration Tests` job (`bun run test:coverage` then `bun run coverage:check`) on ubuntu, a non-required `Cross-platform Tests` job running `bun run test` on windows-latest and macos-latest, E2E tests, and SonarCloud analysis
- **Coverage**: `bun run test:coverage` is the same runner with `--coverage`, which writes one lcov per test file; `scripts/merge-lcov.mjs` merges them into `coverage/lcov.info` for the gate and for SonarCloud

> **Important**: Always use `bun run test`, never bare `bun test` over a directory. `bun test tests/api` puts every file in one process, where one file's module mock becomes every file's. To run a single file, name it to the runner: `bun tests/run-tests.ts tests/api/proxy.test.ts`.

> **DigitalOcean:** the [Marketplace listing](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/libredb-studio) creates a preconfigured Droplet. Unique admin credentials are generated on first boot; the welcome message (MOTD) tells you where to find them.
>
> **CapRover:** open your CapRover dashboard → **Apps → One-Click Apps/Databases**, search for **LibreDB Studio**, and deploy.
>
> **Koyeb:** set a strong `JWT_SECRET` (at least 32 characters — `openssl rand -base64 32`) and credentials before deploying (Koyeb cannot auto-generate secrets). The prefilled values are deliberately unusable: the secret is shorter than the 32-character minimum, so the app stops at boot and says so rather than running on a secret printed in this file. The button uses `STORAGE_PROVIDER=local` — connection metadata lives in the browser, which suits Koyeb's ephemeral filesystem. For persistence across redeploys, switch to `STORAGE_PROVIDER=postgres` and point `STORAGE_POSTGRES_URL` at a Koyeb managed Postgres or Neon database. The button also fills in `LLM_PROVIDER`/`LLM_MODEL`/`LLM_API_KEY`, but Agent mode needs a server-held connection, so its Start button stays disabled until `STORAGE_PROVIDER` is `sqlite` or `postgres` (see [docs/AGENT.md](docs/AGENT.md#turning-it-on)). See [`deploy/koyeb/`](deploy/koyeb/).
>
> **Fly.io:** the repo ships a ready [`fly.toml`](fly.toml) — full steps (app name, volume, secrets) in [`docs/FLY.md`](docs/FLY.md).
>
> **Cosmos:** install in one click from the [Cosmos](https://cosmos-cloud.io) Marketplace — search for **LibreDB Studio**. Cosmos auto-generates secrets, provisions a persistent SQLite volume, and serves the app behind its SmartShield reverse proxy. See [`deploy/cosmos/`](deploy/cosmos/).
>
> **Dokploy:** install in one click from the [Dokploy template catalog](https://templates.dokploy.com) — in your Dokploy dashboard, **Create Service → Template**, search for **LibreDB Studio**, and deploy. Dokploy auto-generates `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `USER_PASSWORD`, and `JWT_SECRET`, and persists connections on a SQLite volume behind Traefik. See [`deploy/dokploy/`](deploy/dokploy/).


### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | ❌ | Admin email (default: `admin@libredb.org`) |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | ✅(autogenerated) | Admin password; auto-generated on first run unless `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP=off` |
| `USER_EMAIL` | ❌ | Optional user account email (default: `user@libredb.org`) |
| `USER_PASSWORD` | ❌ | Optional; the lower-privilege user account exists only when set |
| `JWT_SECRET` | ✅(autogenerated) | JWT secret (min 32 chars); auto-generated on first run unless `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP=off`. A shorter value is fatal: the server refuses to start rather than serve a deployment where every login fails |
| `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP` | ❌ | `off` disables zero-config generation (strict mode; recommended for production) |
| `AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE` | ❌ | `false` drops the `Secure` flag from auth cookies — needed only when the browser reaches the app over plain HTTP (LAN/home server); not for TLS terminated at an ingress |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_PROVIDER` | ❌ | `local` (default) or `oidc` for SSO |
| `OIDC_ISSUER` | ❌ | OIDC issuer URL (required when `oidc`) |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | ❌ | OIDC client ID (required when `oidc`) |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | ❌ | OIDC client secret (required when `oidc`) |
| `OIDC_ADMIN_ROLES` | ❌ | Comma-separated admin role values (default: `admin`) |
| `OIDC_ROLE_CLAIM` | ❌ | Claim path for role (e.g. `realm_access.roles`) |
| `OIDC_SCOPE` | ❌ | OIDC scope (default: `openid profile email`) |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | ❌ | AI: `gemini`, `openai`, `ollama`, `custom` (self-hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoint) |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | ❌ | API key for AI features |
| `LLM_MODEL` | ❌ | Model name (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash`) |
| `LLM_API_URL` | ❌ | API URL for `ollama` and `custom`; required for `custom`, defaults to `http://localhost:11434/v1` for `ollama` |
| `STORAGE_PROVIDER` | ❌ | Storage provider: `local` (default), `sqlite`, or `postgres` |
| `STORAGE_SQLITE_PATH` | ❌ | SQLite file path (e.g. `/app/data/libredb-storage.db`) |
| `STORAGE_POSTGRES_URL` | ❌ | PostgreSQL connection URL (required when `STORAGE_PROVIDER=postgres`) |
| `SEED_CONFIG_PATH` | ❌ | Path to seed connections YAML config (see [Seed Connections](#seed-connections-pre-configured-databases)) |
| `SEED_CACHE_TTL_MS` | ❌ | Seed config cache TTL in ms (default: `60000`) |

> **Tip**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` for local development.

## Deployment (DevOps)

For a reverse-proxy path such as `/tools/libredb`, build with `BASE_PATH` and follow the
[subpath deployment guide](docs/SUBPATH.md). Prebuilt images use the root path.

> Maintainers: every distribution channel is inventoried in
> [`distribution/channels.yaml`](distribution/channels.yaml); `bun run distribution:check`
> reports version drift across all of them (see
> [docs/DISTRIBUTION.md](docs/DISTRIBUTION.md#channel-inventory-and-drift-check)).

### Koyeb

1. Use the **Deploy to Koyeb** button under [One-Click Deploy](#one-click-deploy) to run the prebuilt `ghcr.io/libredb/libredb-studio:latest` image.
2. Set a strong `JWT_SECRET` (32+ characters) in the deploy form before launching. Koyeb cannot auto-generate secrets, and the prefilled one is shorter than the 32-character minimum on purpose, so a deployment left as it stands stops at boot and says why. No password is prefilled: leave `ADMIN_PASSWORD` unset and the app generates one on first run and prints it to the Koyeb runtime log, or set your own. `USER_PASSWORD` is not generated — without it the lower-privilege account does not exist at all, which is the safer default for a public URL.
3. For connections to survive redeploys, set `STORAGE_PROVIDER=postgres` and `STORAGE_POSTGRES_URL` to a Koyeb managed Postgres or Neon connection string. The button defaults to `STORAGE_PROVIDER=local`, which keeps connection metadata in the browser.

See [`deploy/koyeb/`](deploy/koyeb/) for the complete setup and storage options.

### Railway

LibreDB Studio is available as a one-click [Railway](https://railway.com) template.
See [`deploy/railway/`](deploy/railway/) for the template definition, install
instructions, and the publish checklist. The template runs the prebuilt
`ghcr.io/libredb/libredb-studio` image with SQLite persistence on a Railway
volume. Note: Docker-image templates require a manual version bump on each
release (same as CapRover).

### CapRover

LibreDB Studio is published in the official [CapRover One-Click Apps](https://github.com/caprover/one-click-apps/blob/master/public/v4/apps/libredb-studio.yml) catalog:

1. **Open your CapRover dashboard** → **Apps → One-Click Apps/Databases**
2. **Search** for **LibreDB Studio**
3. **Fill in the variables** (admin/user credentials, `JWT_SECRET`, optional AI/storage settings)
4. **Deploy!**

The app runs the prebuilt `ghcr.io/libredb/libredb-studio` image. As with Railway, Docker-image templates require a manual version bump on each release.

### Kubero

LibreDB Studio is listed in the official
[Kubero template catalog](https://www.kubero.dev/templates) (a self-hosted
"Heroku alternative for Kubernetes"). From your Kubero dashboard, browse
**Templates**, search **LibreDB Studio**, fill in the credentials / `JWT_SECRET`,
and deploy. The template runs the prebuilt `ghcr.io/libredb/libredb-studio` image
with SQLite persistence on a 5Gi volume at `/app/data`. See
[`deploy/kubero/`](deploy/kubero/) for install and post-install details. As with
Railway and CapRover, Docker-image templates require a manual version bump on
each release.

### Cosmos

LibreDB Studio is listed in the official
[Cosmos servapp marketplace](https://github.com/azukaar/cosmos-servapps-official)
([Cosmos](https://cosmos-cloud.io) is a self-hosted server manager and secure
reverse proxy). From your Cosmos dashboard, open **Marketplace**, search
**LibreDB Studio**, and install. Cosmos auto-generates the credentials and
`JWT_SECRET`, provisions a persistent SQLite volume at `/app/data`, and serves
the app behind a SmartShield-protected route. See
[`deploy/cosmos/`](deploy/cosmos/) for install and post-install details. As with
Railway, CapRover, and Kubero, Docker-image templates require a manual version
bump on each release.

### Render (Recommended for cloud deployment)

LibreDB Studio includes a `render.yaml` Blueprint for one-click deployment:

1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Connect to Render**: [dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com) → New → Blueprint
3. **Select your forked repo** and Render will auto-detect `render.yaml`
4. **Set Environment Variables** in Render Dashboard:
5. **Deploy!**

### Docker Compose (Self-Hosted)

Use the ready-to-use [`docker-compose.example.yml`](docker-compose.example.yml) — it pulls the published image (`ghcr.io/libredb/libredb-studio:latest`), so no source build is needed. It documents every supported environment variable (auth, OIDC, storage, LLM, seed connections), with the less-common ones commented out.

```bash
# 1. Copy the ready-to-use compose file
cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml

# 2. Create your .env (set at least JWT_SECRET / ADMIN_PASSWORD / USER_PASSWORD)
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Start
docker compose up -d   # → http://localhost:3000
```

This file is platform-neutral and works with PaaS tools that consume a plain `docker-compose.yml` (Dokploy, Coolify, Portainer, etc.) — point them at the file and set the secrets as environment variables.

> The repository's default `docker-compose.yml` builds the image from source (`build: .`) and is intended for local development.

### Kubernetes (Helm Chart)

```bash
helm repo add libredb https://libredb.org/libredb-studio/
helm install libredb libredb/libredb-studio

# Retrieve the generated admin credentials from the pod log
kubectl logs deployment/libredb-libredb-studio | grep -A 4 "generated admin credentials"
```

Or via OCI registry:
```bash
helm install libredb oci://ghcr.io/libredb/charts/libredb-studio
```

For production, provide your own secrets instead of relying on generated ones:
```bash
helm install libredb libredb/libredb-studio \
  --set secrets.jwtSecret=$(openssl rand -base64 32) \
  --set secrets.adminPassword=MyAdmin123
```

Features: PostgreSQL subchart, Ingress/TLS, HPA, PDB, NetworkPolicy, ExternalSecrets support. See [charts/libredb-studio/README.md](charts/libredb-studio/README.md) for full documentation.

### Seed Connections (Pre-Configured Databases)

Pre-configure database connections via a YAML config file so users see them immediately after login. Ideal for Platform/SaaS deployments where admins provision databases for teams.

**Features:**
- Role-based access control (`admin`, `user`, `*` wildcard)
- Hybrid model: `managed: true` (read-only, admin-controlled) or `managed: false` (editable copy for user)
- Credentials injected via `${ENV_VAR}` syntax — never stored in config file
- Hot-reload: config changes apply within 60s without restart
- Works with Docker, docker-compose, and Kubernetes (Helm)

**1. Create a config file** (`seed-connections.yaml`):

```yaml
version: "1"

defaults:
  managed: true
  environment: production

connections:
  - id: "prod-analytics"
    name: "Production Analytics"
    type: postgres
    host: analytics-db.internal
    port: 5432
    database: analytics
    user: "readonly_user"
    password: "${ANALYTICS_DB_PASSWORD}"
    roles: ["admin"]
    color: "#10B981"

  - id: "dev-sandbox"
    name: "Dev Sandbox"
    type: mysql
    host: dev-mysql.internal
    port: 3306
    database: sandbox
    user: "dev_user"
    password: "${DEV_DB_PASSWORD}"
    roles: ["*"]
    managed: false
```

**2. Mount and configure:**

<details>
<summary><strong>Docker</strong></summary>

```bash
docker run -v ./seed-connections.yaml:/app/config/seed-connections.yaml:ro \
  -e SEED_CONFIG_PATH=/app/config/seed-connections.yaml \
  -e ANALYTICS_DB_PASSWORD=secret \
  -e DEV_DB_PASSWORD=devsecret \
  ghcr.io/libredb/libredb-studio:latest
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Docker Compose</strong></summary>

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/libredb/libredb-studio:latest
    volumes:
      - ./seed-connections.yaml:/app/config/seed-connections.yaml:ro
    environment:
      SEED_CONFIG_PATH: /app/config/seed-connections.yaml
      ANALYTICS_DB_PASSWORD: ${ANALYTICS_DB_PASSWORD}
      DEV_DB_PASSWORD: ${DEV_DB_PASSWORD}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Kubernetes (Helm)</strong></summary>

```yaml
# values.yaml
seedConnections:
  enabled: true
  config:
    version: "1"
    connections:
      - id: "prod-analytics"
        name: "Production Analytics"
        type: postgres
        host: analytics-db.internal
        password: "${ANALYTICS_DB_PASSWORD}"
        roles: ["admin"]

# Credentials via K8s Secret:
extraEnvFrom:
  - secretRef:
      name: seed-db-credentials
```
</details>

**Config Reference:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `version` | Yes | Must be `"1"` |
| `defaults` | No | Default values merged into all connections |
| `connections[].id` | Yes | Unique slug (`[a-z0-9-]+`, max 64 chars) |
| `connections[].name` | Yes | Display name in UI |
| `connections[].type` | Yes | `postgres`, `mysql`, `sqlite`, `mongodb`, `redis`, `oracle`, `mssql`, `libredb`, `couchbase`, `clickhouse`, `druid`, `elasticsearch`, `opensearch`, `trino` |
| `connections[].roles` | Yes | `["*"]` (everyone), `["admin"]`, `["user"]`, or `["admin", "user"]` |
| `connections[].managed` | No | `true` = read-only (default), `false` = editable copy for user |
| `connections[].password` | No | Use `${ENV_VAR}` syntax for secrets |
| `connections[].environment` | No | `production`, `staging`, `development`, `local`, `other` |
| `connections[].group` | No | Group label in sidebar |
| `connections[].color` | No | Hex color for badge (e.g., `#10B981`) |

**Environment Variables:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SEED_CONFIG_PATH` | `/app/config/seed-connections.yaml` | Path to config file |
| `SEED_CACHE_TTL_MS` | `60000` | Cache TTL in ms (hot-reload interval) |

### One-Command Vault Demo

[`docker-compose.vault-demo.yml`](docker-compose.vault-demo.yml) starts Studio, PostgreSQL and a dev-mode HashiCorp Vault, plus a one-shot init container that writes the database password into Vault and the seed file into the volume Studio mounts. It pulls the published image, so there's nothing to build, and the connection it defines takes its password from Vault through the reference `${vault:secret/data/prod/postgres#password}` instead of from an environment variable.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.vault-demo.yml up
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** and log in with the admin credentials the first run prints to the Studio log, same as the [Quick Start](#quick-start). The sidebar has a **Postgres (password from Vault)** connection — open it and run any statement, and it connects with the password Vault holds. To watch a rotation, change the password in Vault and in PostgreSQL, wait out the 10-second cache the file sets, and open the connection again: it authenticates with the new value, with no container restarted.

> The Vault in that file is dev mode — in-memory, root token, no TLS, no policies — so it's for demonstration only. The reference scheme, the `VAULT_*` variables, the rotation window and both rotation commands are in [`docs/SEED_CONNECTIONS.md`](docs/SEED_CONNECTIONS.md#vault-references); a real deployment starts from HashiCorp's [production hardening guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/operations/production-hardening).

- [x] **Phase 20**: Analytics Databases — ClickHouse ([#264](https://github.com/libredb/libredb-studio/issues/264)) and Apache Druid ([#265](https://github.com/libredb/libredb-studio/issues/265)), both driver-free over HTTP. Druid is read-only by nature — no `UPDATE`, no `DELETE`, no `CREATE TABLE` — so it also demonstrates a provider that reports absent capabilities honestly instead of offering controls that can only fail.
- [x] **Phase 21**: Federated Query — Apache Trino ([#424](https://github.com/libredb/libredb-studio/issues/424), Phase 2), driver-free over Trino's own client protocol. The product question that held it up is answered: a connection pins **one catalog**, exactly as a PostgreSQL connection pins one database, and the tree stays two levels — fanning `information_schema` across every catalog is unbounded, since `jmx.current` alone publishes one table per MBean. Cross-catalog queries still work in the editor by qualifying names in full. PrestoDB is a separate future type-id; the transport already builds its headers from a dialect prefix so that is a descriptor, not a rewrite.

### Cross-browser testing

The product is a browser application, so a browser bug is a product bug. CI runs the full Playwright
suite on desktop Chromium and the `security-headers` spec on WebKit (`webkit-security`). Beyond that
one WebKit spec, Safari and older WebKit regressions, mobile layout, and the WebKitGTK engine behind
the Linux desktop build need real devices. This project is tested with BrowserStack.

## Supporters

Distinct from the sponsors above: these are open-source programmes that cover a
running cost of the project. A place here cannot be bought, and nothing here is
an endorsement of libredb-studio by the company named. The full list, what each
one covers and what attribution is owed in return are at
[libredb.org/supporters](https://libredb.org/supporters/).

- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/community/open-source/)** — the
  Docker-Sponsored Open Source programme behind the `libredb` namespace on
  Docker Hub, which removes pull rate limits for everyone pulling the public
  image. The canonical image is still GHCR; this is what keeps the Hub mirror
  usable without an account. Since 2026-09-01.

- **[BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/opensource)** — the BrowserStack
  Open Source programme behind the cross-browser testing that runs the full Playwright
  suite on desktop Chromium and the `security-headers` spec on WebKit (`webkit-security`).
  Beyond that one WebKit spec, Safari and older WebKit regressions, mobile layout, and the
  WebKitGTK engine behind the Linux desktop build need real devices. Since 2026-08-31.

- **[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/opensource)** — the Community on GitHub
  plan behind the private network maintainers use to reach the database probe
  hosts, so testing against real engines does not mean exposing database ports
  to the internet. Since 2026-08-30.
