**Your AI research desk for technical news. Find what matters, understand why,
and remember it.**

News Dashboard helps developers keep up with fast-moving technical news without
reading everything. Centralize the sources you trust, stay current with a
ranked Today Feed, and receive a personalized briefing. Open an article for key
takeaways, context, and perspectives; ask cited follow-up questions; then save,
organize, or turn useful material into learning artifacts.

Screenshots are generated from demo-mode seed data by `npm run capture:screenshots`
(see [scripts/capture-screenshots.spec.ts](scripts/capture-screenshots.spec.ts)); no
real account data is shown.

## How it works

1. **Centralize and filter.** Bring together technical feeds, release notes,
   trending projects, and other sources, then use freshness and personalized
   recommendations to focus the Today Feed.
2. **Understand.** Start with a generated briefing, inspect article takeaways
   and wider context, and ask AI for cited answers grounded in your corpus.
3. **Retain.** Save and organize worthwhile articles, build learning artifacts,
   and revisit what you read through history, search, and the knowledge graph.

News Dashboard can run on your own infrastructure for privacy and control over
your sources, reading data, and AI-provider configuration.

## Features

- Curated Python, AI/LLM, agents, cloud, engineering, trending, and repository feeds.
- RSS/Atom ingestion, GitHub release feeds, Hacker News/GitHub trending feeds, and custom scraped sources.
- Article states: new, read, saved, skipped, archived, starred, and snoozed.
- Source health, ingest run history, dashboard stats, and search.
- Local password auth with first-admin bootstrap.
- Optional Keycloak login.
- OpenAI-compatible embeddings, cited Ask AI answers, article intelligence, and generated briefings when an AI provider is configured.
- Google Reader-compatible sync API for third-party RSS clients (NetNewsWire, Reeder, Unread, ...).
- Docker, Helm, and GitHub Actions deployment support.

## Stack

- Backend: Python 3.14, FastAPI, Typer, psycopg, APScheduler, LangChain, LangGraph.
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Query.
- Database: PostgreSQL.
- Tooling: Ruff, mypy, pytest, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, Playwright.

## Requirements

- Python 3.14+
- Node.js and npm compatible with `package-lock.json`
- PostgreSQL 16+ with the [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension (the `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` image, or install `vector` on an external Postgres)
- Docker and Docker Compose for the container flow
- API key for AI features (`FREE_LLM_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`)

## Configuration

Copy [`.env.example`](.env.example) to `.env` and supply real values. Runtime
storage is PostgreSQL only: set `DATABASE_URL` or the split `POSTGRES_*`
variables.

See the [environment variable reference](https://docs.lihor.ro/docs/self-hosting/environment-variables)
for the full catalogue, AI orchestration and tracing, and production security
settings. Existing deployments should read its pgvector upgrade note before
changing the database image.

## Try the demo

Want to try News Dashboard before self-hosting it? One command runs a
throwaway instance seeded with sample articles and a read-only guest account
— no AI keys, no configuration:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and log in with:

| Field    | Value   |
| -------- | ------- |
| Username | `guest` |
| Password | `demo`  |

The guest account is **read-only** — write actions (saving, marking read,
adding sources, etc.) are rejected. This compose file uses fixed demo secrets
and is not meant for real deployments; see [Quick Start](#quick-start) below
to self-host for real.

## Quick Start

You can run News Dashboard in two ways:

### Option 1: Build from source (recommended for development)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This stack now brings up PostgreSQL, Neo4j, and the app together, so the
knowledge graph is enabled locally by default.

### Option 2: Run the published image (recommended for production)

First, start PostgreSQL:

```bash
docker run --rm -d \
  --name news-dashboard-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=news_dashboard \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=news_dashboard \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=news-dashboard-local-password \
  -v news-dashboard-postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  pgvector/pgvector:pg16
```

Then run the application:

```bash
IMAGE_DIGEST="${IMAGE_DIGEST:?set IMAGE_DIGEST to the published sha256 digest}"
docker run -d \
  --name news-dashboard \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  --link news-dashboard-postgres:postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_HOST=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PORT=5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=news_dashboard \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=news_dashboard \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=news-dashboard-local-password \
  -e SESSION_SECRET="$(python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))')" \
  -e BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin \
  -e BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me \
  -e DATA_DIR=/data \
  -v news-dashboard-data:/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  "ghcr.io/lihor-hub/news-dashboard@${IMAGE_DIGEST}"
```

Resolve the digest from the published image or CI build output; a tag or commit
SHA can move or resolve to a different manifest. The
`news-dashboard-data:/data` volume keeps generated audio and other app data
across container recreates; without it, optional TTS and podcast MP3 caches are
lost during upgrades. See [Configuration](#configuration) for all required
environment variables.

If you also want the knowledge graph enabled in a manual `docker run`
deployment, run a Neo4j container and pass `NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USER`,
`NEO4J_PASSWORD`, and optionally `NEO4J_DATABASE=neo4j` to the app container.

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Log in with the default local-development credentials:

| Field    | Default value |
| -------- | ------------- |
| Username | `admin`       |
| Password | `change-me`   |

> **These are local-development defaults only.** Before deploying anywhere
> outside your own machine, set `SESSION_SECRET`, `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME`,
> and `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to strong, unique values via environment
> variables or a `.env` file — never use these defaults in production.

Run ingestion in the app container:

```bash
docker exec news-dashboard news-dashboard ingest
```

## Local Development

Install backend and frontend dependencies:

> **Zero-setup alternative:** Click [Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/lihor-hub/news-dashboard) or use the [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) in VS Code to skip all local installation. The devcontainer pre-installs Python, Node.js, and PostgreSQL automatically.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'
npm install
pre-commit install
```

Start PostgreSQL:

```bash
docker run --rm -d \
  --name news-dashboard-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=news_dashboard \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=news_dashboard \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=news-dashboard-local-password \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  pgvector/pgvector:pg16
```

Set backend env (or copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust values):

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://news_dashboard:news-dashboard-local-password@localhost:5432/news_dashboard
export SESSION_SECRET="$(python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))')"
# Optional: use a separate secret for digest mark-read links.
export TOKEN_SECRET="$(python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))')"
export BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
export BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me
```

Initialize schema and sources:

```bash
news-dashboard init
news-dashboard ingest
```

Run backend and frontend:

```bash
uvicorn news_dashboard.main:app --reload --app-dir backend
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Quality Checks

```bash
make lint        # ruff, eslint, prettier checks
make format      # auto-format backend and frontend
make typecheck   # mypy and TypeScript
make test        # backend and frontend tests (everyday development loop)
make build       # production frontend build
make check       # full CI suite
```

### Test lanes

| Command              | What it runs                                                     | When to use                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `make test-smoke`    | Backend `smoke`-marked tests + frontend smoke files              | Quick sanity check, ~seconds                  |
| `make test-backend`  | Full `pytest` suite                                              | Before pushing backend changes                |
| `make test-frontend` | Full Vitest suite                                                | Before pushing frontend changes               |
| `make test-a11y`     | Accessibility smoke tests (axe-core serious/critical violations) | Before pushing UI changes; enforced in CI     |
| `make test-e2e`      | Playwright end-to-end tests                                      | Before pushing UI/routing changes             |
| `make test-full`     | Everything with coverage                                         | Same as nightly CI; use before major releases |

**Local development loop:** run `make test-smoke` during active development, `make test-backend` or `make test-frontend` depending on what you changed, then `make check` before opening a PR.

**Pre-push / pre-release:** run `make test-full` for comprehensive coverage including slow and DB-heavy tests.

Pytest markers:

- `smoke` — fast tests with no external services
- `db` — auto-applied to any test using `pg_url` / `pg_clean`; requires PostgreSQL
- `slow` — expensive tests reserved for the nightly schedule

Run a specific lane with `pytest -m smoke`, `pytest -m "not db"`, or `pytest -m db`.

## Getting Started

To begin using News Dashboard as a reader, see the
[Getting Started guide](website/docs/getting-started/index.md) which covers:

- [Install the Android APK](website/docs/getting-started/install-android-apk.md)
  — native Android app wrapping the PWA
- [Create a web account](website/docs/getting-started/create-web-account.md)
  — sign in from any browser
- [Self-host your own instance](#quick-start)
  — run News Dashboard on your own infrastructure

## Documentation

The full documentation site is published at **[docs.lihor.ro](https://docs.lihor.ro)**.

For end-user documentation, see the [User Guide](https://docs.lihor.ro/docs/user-guide) which covers:

- Concepts and terminology
- The Today Feed and triage workflow
- Managing sources and subscriptions
- Search, briefings, and recommendations
- Saved and read history
- Sharing articles with other users

For technical documentation (architecture, deployment, authentication), see the
[docs index](docs/README.md).

To preview the docs site locally: `cd website && npm install && npm run start`.

## Synchronizing managed prompts

The application keeps its 19 managed-prompt fallbacks in
`backend/news_dashboard/prompt_catalog.py`. To verify catalog shape and sync behavior without
contacting Langfuse, run:

```bash
dotenv run -- pytest backend/tests/test_prompt_catalog.py -q
```

To publish changed prompts, provide credentials only through your environment or secret manager:

```bash
export LANGFUSE_HOST="https://your-langfuse-host.example"
export LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="<public-key>"
export LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="<secret-key>"
python scripts/sync_langfuse_prompts.py
```

The command compares every catalog entry with its current `production` version. Matching entries
are left unchanged; changed or missing entries get one new version labeled `production`. Output is
limited to prompt names, versions, and status and never prints credentials or prompt content.

To roll back, open the prompt in Langfuse and move the `production` label from the new version to
the previously known-good version. To disable Langfuse entirely and use the catalog fallbacks,
remove `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` from the application environment and restart
the application.

## Deployment

The production image serves the built frontend through FastAPI on port `8080`.

For Kubernetes, start with the [chart installation guide and values reference](helm/news-dashboard/README.md).
The command below upgrades the repository-specific production deployment using
the versioned chart at `oci://ghcr.io/lihor-hub/charts/news-dashboard`. Set
`CHART_VERSION` to the application release version without its `v` prefix.
For a chart from your checkout, replace the OCI reference and `--version` with
`./helm/news-dashboard`. See the [chart versioning policy](helm/news-dashboard/README.md#versioning-policy).

```bash
(
set -euo pipefail
CHART_VERSION="${CHART_VERSION:?set CHART_VERSION to the published chart version}"
IMAGE_DIGEST="${IMAGE_DIGEST:?set IMAGE_DIGEST to sha256:<64 lowercase hex>}"
: "${SESSION_SECRET:?set SESSION_SECRET}"
: "${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:?set POSTGRES_PASSWORD}"
: "${POSTGRES_HOST_PATH:?set POSTGRES_HOST_PATH}"
source ./scripts/production-deploy-lib.sh
production_cutover_enabled || { echo "Ingress cutover is not enabled" >&2; exit 2; }
prepare_production_helm_secret_files

helm upgrade --install news-dashboard oci://ghcr.io/lihor-hub/charts/news-dashboard \
  --version "$CHART_VERSION" \
  --namespace news-dashboard --create-namespace \
  --values ./helm/news-dashboard/values-production.yaml \
  --set-string image.digest="${IMAGE_DIGEST}" \
  --set-string postgresql.persistence.hostPath="$POSTGRES_HOST_PATH" \
  --set-file app.auth.sessionSecret="$PRODUCTION_SESSION_SECRET_FILE" \
  --set-file postgresql.password="$PRODUCTION_POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE"
)
```

The production values expose the app only through a TLS Ingress backed by a
`ClusterIP` Service. Supply secrets and installation-specific persistence as
runtime overrides; do not commit them to a values file. The shared helper writes
the secrets to mode-0600 temporary files, removes them on exit, and keeps secret
values out of Helm's process arguments. Pull-request CI renders this contract
without requiring access to the production appliance.

Public egress excludes private and other non-global networks. For an external
PostgreSQL, SMTP, Keycloak, or other private/custom endpoint, copy
`deploy/additional-egress-values.example.json` outside the repository and set
`ADDITIONAL_EGRESS_VALUES_FILE` to that path for every manual deployment. CI
operators can instead store the same non-secret strict JSON in the production
environment variable `ADDITIONAL_EGRESS_VALUES`; both inputs are re-applied on
every Helm upgrade. Keep credentials in Kubernetes/GitHub secrets, never in
this policy-only values input. YAML syntax, aliases, merge keys, comments, and
multiple documents are intentionally not accepted.

Automated and local live application of this overlay is disabled until the
operator sets `INGRESS_CUTOVER_ENABLED=true` after completing the readiness
checks in issue #1302. `scripts/deploy-local-k8s.sh --render` remains available
without that activation.

For bundled or external PostgreSQL configuration and required credentials, see
the [chart values reference](helm/news-dashboard/README.md#values-reference).
For render-only validation, `scripts/deploy-local-k8s.sh --render` supplies
protected temporary dummy files and never applies the result.

**Existing deployments:** if you previously deployed with the old default
password (`news-dashboard-local-password`), changing the Helm value or
Kubernetes Secret alone does **not** rotate an already-initialized database
password. You must also run `ALTER USER news_dashboard WITH PASSWORD
'<new-password>'` inside PostgreSQL after updating the secret.

For simple Docker deployments (single-node setups), see the
[Self-Hosting guide](https://docs.lihor.ro/docs/self-hosting) for instructions on running
the published image with persistent storage.

Enable auth before exposing an instance outside a trusted network. See
[Authentication (Keycloak)](https://docs.lihor.ro/docs/configuration/authentication) and
[Ingress HTTPS and Caddy migration](https://docs.lihor.ro/docs/configuration/https-caddy).
The live DNS/TLS, Keycloak-route, firewall, and rollback rehearsal requires
appliance access and is tracked in
[human rollout issue #1302](https://github.com/lihor-hub/news-dashboard/issues/1302).
