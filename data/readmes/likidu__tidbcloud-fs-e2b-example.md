# TiDB Cloud FS for E2B

Persistent, shared storage for ephemeral [E2B](https://e2b.dev) sandboxes, backed by
[TiDB Cloud FS](https://www.pingcap.com/tidb-cloud/) via the `ti` CLI.

Two agents in two different sandboxes — the second created only after the first is
destroyed — exchange work through the same mounted filesystem. Then, with every
sandbox dead, the results are read back **with no mount at all**: TiDB Cloud FS is
also an API.

## The demo, in three acts

1. **Agent 1** — a fresh sandbox mounts the shared FS (`ti fs mount-file-system`),
   GLM-5.2 writes `question.txt` through the mount, the sandbox drains pending
   writes, unmounts and dies.
2. **Agent 2** — a brand-new sandbox mounts the same FS, reads the question, writes
   `answer.txt`, dies.
3. **Mountless finale** — from your machine, no FUSE, no sandbox:

   ```bash
   ti fs ls --path /demo
   ti fs cat --path /demo/answer.txt
   ti fs grep --pattern "<any word>" --path /demo
   ```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- An [E2B](https://e2b.dev) API key
- The [`ti` CLI](https://github.com/tidbcloud/ti-cli) installed locally, used once
  to provision a TiDB Cloud FS resource:

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://github.com/tidbcloud/ti-cli/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh -s -- --yes
  export PATH="$HOME/.ti/bin:$PATH"   # add to your shell profile to persist

  ti configure --non-interactive --region-code aws-ap-southeast-1 \
    --tidb-cloud-public-key <key> --tidb-cloud-private-key <key>   # from TiDB Cloud console → Organization Settings → API Keys
  ti fs create-file-system --wait \
    --query fs_token --output text
  ```

  The last command prints an `fs_token` — a credential scoped to that one
  filesystem. Put it in `.env` as `TI_FS_TOKEN`, alongside `TI_REGION_CODE`.
  The filesystem ID is derived from the token, so no filesystem name or ID is
  required. The TiDB Cloud public/private key pair is only needed for this
  one-time provisioning step; nothing else in this repo, including the
  sandboxes, ever sees it.

- An LLM API key for any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. The default configuration
  targets [Z.ai's GLM-5.2](https://docs.z.ai/guides/overview/quick-start) — an
  open-weight (MIT) model — but OpenRouter, Together, or a self-hosted
  vLLM/SGLang server all work: set `LLM_BASE_URL` and `LLM_MODEL`.
  GLM Coding Plan subscribers should set
  `LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4` — plan quota is served
  through the coding endpoint, not the pay-as-you-go one.

## Quickstart

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in TI_REGION_CODE / TI_FS_TOKEN
pnpm build             # build the E2B template (once)
pnpm test              # smoke test: mount, write, read back, mountless verify
pnpm demo              # the 3-act demo
```

## CI

Two GitHub Actions workflows test every PR:

| Workflow | Runs | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `checks` | every PR + push to `main` | `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test:unit` — free, no secrets |
| `e2e` | push to `main`, manual dispatch, or PRs labeled `run-e2e` | full smoke test: rebuilds the E2B template as `tidbcloud-fs-ci`, then `pnpm test` (sandbox mount, write, read-back, mountless verify) |

The E2E workflow needs these repo secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables →
Actions): `E2B_API_KEY`, `TI_REGION_CODE`, `TI_FS_TOKEN`. Because it spends
real E2B sandbox time and touches the shared filesystem, it never runs
automatically on fork PRs — a maintainer opts a PR in by adding the `run-e2e`
label, which approves running that PR's code with the repo secrets (fork PRs
don't receive secrets on ordinary `pull_request` events).

## How the sandbox gets credentials

`ti` has a token-only mode built for exactly this kind of ephemeral machine: no
`ti configure`, no TiDB Cloud API keys, no `~/.ti/` profile files — just
`TI_FS_TOKEN` and `TI_REGION_CODE` as environment variables. `lib.ts`'s
`createSandbox()` passes those two straight from your `.env` into
`Sandbox.create()`'s `envs` option, so every `ti` command run inside the sandbox
picks them up automatically before mounting.

## Also possible with `ti fs` (not shown here)

- **Layers** — copy-on-write branches of the filesystem with diff/commit/rollback
  (`ti fs create-layer`, `diff-layer`, `commit-layer`)
- **Journals** — an append-only coordination log for agents (`ti fs-journal`)
- **Vault** — delegated, scoped access so sandboxes never hold your full key
  (`ti fs-vault create-grant`)
