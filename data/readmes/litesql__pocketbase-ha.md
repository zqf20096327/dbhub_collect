# PocketBase HA
Highly Available Leader/Leaderless [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) Cluster powered by `go-ha` [database/sql driver](https://github.com/litesql/go-ha).

## Features

- **High Availability**: Run multiple PocketBase instances in a leader or leaderless cluster.
- **Replication**: Synchronize data across nodes using NATS.
- **Embedded or External NATS**: Choose between an embedded NATS server or an external one for replication.
- **Remote direct access to Database**: via a secured gRPC endpoint for direct database access from remote clients. Use [terminal](#remote-database-access-from-terminal) or [DBeaver](https://github.com/litesql/jdbc-ha#dbeaver-integration).
- **Undo transactions**: Use `pocketbase-ha cli` (or any gRPC client) to execute [UNDO](#undo-transactions) commands on already commited transactions. 

## Prerequisites

- **Go**: Version `1.25` or later is required.

## Configuration

Set up your environment variables to configure the cluster:

| Environment Variable | Description                                                                 | Default |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `PB_ASYNC_PUBLISHER` | Enables asynchronous replication message publishing. Recommended only when using an external NATS server. | false |
| `PB_ASYNC_PUBLISHER_DIR` | Directory path for storing outbox messages used in asynchronous replication. |    |
| `PB_GRPC_PORT` | TCP Port for the gRPC service to enable remote database access. | |
| `PB_GRPC_TOKEN` | Authentication token for securing remote database access via gRPC. | |
| `PB_LOCAL_TARGET`    | Specifies the service URL to redirect requests when this node is the leader. Useful for enabling leader election. | |
| `PB_NAME`            | A unique name for the node. Defaults to the system's hostname if not provided. | $HOSTNAME |
| `PB_NATS_PORT`       | Port for the embedded NATS server (use only if running an embedded NATS server). | |
| `PB_NATS_STORE_DIR`  | Directory for storing data for the embedded NATS server.                   | /tmp/nats |
| `PB_NATS_CONFIG`     | Path to a NATS configuration file (overrides other NATS settings).         | |
| `PB_REPLICATION_URL` | NATS connection URL for replication (use if connecting to an external NATS server). Example: `nats://localhost:4222`. | |
| `PB_REPLICATION_STREAM` | Stream name for data replication | pb |
| `PB_ROW_IDENTIFY` | Strategy used to identify rows during replication. Options: `pk`, `rowid` or `full`. | pk |
| `PB_STATIC_LEADER`| URL target to redirect all writer requests to the cluster leader | |
| `PB_SUPERUSER_EMAIL` | Superuser email created at startup | |
| `PB_SUPERUSER_PASS` | Superuser password created at startup | |
| `PB_STREAM_MAX_AGE` | Local transactions history and NATS stream max age. Used in undo operations from CLI. Set to zero to disable _history.db | 72h |

## Usage

### Starting a Cluster

1. Start the first PocketBase HA instance:

    ```sh
    PB_NAME=node1 PB_NATS_PORT=4222 pocketbase-ha serve
    ```

2. Start a second instance in a different directory:

    ```sh
    PB_ASYNC_PUBLISHER=true PB_NAME=node2 PB_REPLICATION_URL=nats://localhost:4222 pocketbase-ha serve --http 127.0.0.1:8091
    ```

> **Note**: You can skip setting the superuser password for the second instance.

### Running a NATS Cluster with docker

To run a NATS cluster using Docker Compose, use the following command:

```sh
docker compose up
```

- Superuser e-mail: test@example.com
- Superuser pass: 1234567890

You can define the superuser password using this command:

```sh
docker compose exec -e PB_NATS_CONFIG="" -e PB_LOCAL_TARGET="" node1 /app/pocketbase-ha superuser upsert EMAIL PASS
```

Access the three nodes using the following address:

- Node1: http://localhost:8090
- Node2: http://localhost:8091
- Node3: http://localhost:8092

> **Tip**: Ensure all nodes are synchronized by verifying the logs or using the PocketBase admin interface.

### Event Hooks on replica nodes

On replica nodes (the nodes that users do not directly interact with), only the following events are triggered by the PocketBase event hooks system:

- OnModelAfterCreateSuccess
- OnModelAfterCreateError
- OnModelAfterUpdateSuccess
- OnModelAfterUpdateError
- OnModelAfterDeleteSuccess
- OnModelAfterDeleteError

### Data Replication and Conflict Resolution

**PocketBase HA** uses a last-writer-wins strategy for conflict resolution by default. To implement custom resolution strategies, modify the `ChangeSetInterceptor` in your code.

For applications that require strict consistency, configure a cluster leader to handle all write operations and prevent conflicts entirely.

### Configuring a Cluster Leader

Set `PB_LOCAL_TARGET` or `PB_STATIC_LEADER` environment variables to designate a leader node that processes all write requests:


#### Static Leader

```sh
export PB_STATIC_LEADER=http://leader-addr:8090
```

#### Dynamic Leader
```sh
export PB_LOCAL_TARGET=http://local-advertise-addr:8090
```


This ensures all mutations route through the leader while reads can be distributed across replica nodes.

### Remote database access from terminal

To enable remote access, set `PB_GRPC_PORT` before starting the service:

```sh
export PB_GRPC_PORT=9090
pocketbase-ha serve
```

Then, from another terminal, connect with:

```sh
pocketbase-ha remote http://localhost:9090
```

Then execute any SQL command:

```sh
data.db> SELECT * FROM PRAGMA_table_list;
```

#### Protect the connection with a token

Set `PB_GRPC_TOKEN` to require authentication for remote gRPC access.

```sh
export PB_GRPC_PORT=9090
export PB_GRPC_TOKEN=secret
pocketbase-ha serve
```

Then, from another terminal, connect with:

```sh
pocketbase-ha remote http://localhost:9090 --token secret
```

#### Undo transactions

You can undo transactions using `pocketbase-ha cli` UNDO command:

```sh
# connect
pocketbase-ha remote http://host:port

# undo latest transaction
undo;

# undo last N transactions
undo N;

# undo transactions since time. Ex: undo 5m; (5 minutes ago)
undo <time duration>;

# show the latest transaction
history;

# show the last N transactions
history N;

# show the transactions since time.
history <time duration>;
```
