It is for Go programs that keep their data in SQLite and want to stay plain Go: one static binary, cross-compiled from any machine, no C compiler in the build or in the container. Until now that meant giving up speed. Here the cgo driver is the one that falls behind.

## Benchmarks

Time per operation, lower is better, the median of 6 runs. The best of a row is in bold when its 95% confidence interval overlaps no other driver's. WAL, `synchronous=NORMAL`, the same settings checked on every driver.

Where another driver still wins: work that stays inside SQLite (the join), where this driver runs the same C but as Go assembly, and reading large text values. Why reads and many writers are faster, the versions of each driver, and how to run it all again are in [docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md).

## Install

```sh
go get github.com/liustack/sqlite
```

Go 1.26.6 to 1.27 (see [Moving to a new Go](docs/upstream.md#moving-to-a-new-go)). linux and darwin on amd64 and arm64, windows on amd64.

## Use

```go
import (
	"database/sql"

	_ "github.com/liustack/sqlite"
)

db, err := sql.Open("sqlite", "file:app.db?_pragma=journal_mode(WAL)&_pragma=synchronous(NORMAL)")
```

The name is a file, `:memory:` or a [SQLite URI](https://sqlite.org/uri.html). `_pragma=name(value)` runs a PRAGMA on every new connection, and `_txlock=immediate` makes `BEGIN` take the write lock at once. A connection waits 5 seconds for a lock unless `busy_timeout` says otherwise. The rest is on [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/liustack/sqlite).

SQL functions, aggregates, window functions, collations and virtual tables written in Go go on the connector, so that every connection of the pool has them:

```go
c, err := sqlite.NewConnector("file:app.db",
	sqlite.WithFunction("reverse", 1, reverse, sqlite.Deterministic),
	sqlite.WithAggregate("mode", 1, newMode),
	sqlite.WithCollation("fold", fold),
	sqlite.WithModule("files", connectFiles))
db := sql.OpenDB(c)
```

`sqlite.Register` gives them to every connector `sql.Open` makes after it. An error or a panic in a function or a virtual table fails its statement, not the connection.

Common functions come ready in packages under `ext/`: [`regexp`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/liustack/sqlite/ext/regexp) (the `REGEXP` operator, `regexp_like`, `regexp_substr`, `regexp_replace`), [`uuid`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/liustack/sqlite/ext/uuid), [`hash`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/liustack/sqlite/ext/hash) (md5, sha1, sha256, sha512, crc32), [`stats`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/liustack/sqlite/ext/stats) (variance and standard deviation), [`unicode`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/liustack/sqlite/ext/unicode) (upper and lower case and a case-blind collation for every script), [`csv`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/liustack/sqlite/ext/csv) (a CSV file as a table), [`series`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/liustack/sqlite/ext/series) (`generate_series`) and [`vec`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/liustack/sqlite/ext/vec) (vector distances, to find the rows nearest to an embedding). Each is one option, and `sqlite.Join` hands several over as one:

```go
sqlite.Register(sqlite.Join(regexp.Option(), uuid.Option()))
```

Full-text search ([FTS5](https://sqlite.org/fts5.html)), the spatial index ([R*Tree](https://sqlite.org/rtree.html)), the [math functions](https://sqlite.org/lang_mathfunc.html) and `median` and `percentile` ([percentile](https://sqlite.org/percentile.html)) are built in, with nothing to import. The math functions give the same bits on every target.

The driver registers as `sqlite`, as modernc.org/sqlite and glebarez/go-sqlite do, so a program that imports one of them as well panics at start. Open the database with `sql.OpenDB(sqlite.NewConnector(dsn))` then.

## What changes for you

- **No C anywhere.** `CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build` from a Mac works, and the binary runs in a `scratch` image.
- **Many writers stop waiting on each other.** When goroutines write at the same time, the driver runs their autocommit `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements as one transaction and commits once. Each call still gets its own error, `LastInsertId` and `RowsAffected`, and returns only after the commit, so nothing is less durable. Transactions you open yourself are never merged. [How it works](docs/architecture.md#group-commit)
- **Writers queue instead of failing with `database is locked`.** Inside the driver one connection of your program writes a file at a time, and the others queue for it, up to `busy_timeout`, instead of sleeping in SQLite's busy handler. A transaction that reads first and writes later can still fail when another wrote in between, so start such transactions with `_txlock=immediate`. Other processes still meet SQLite's own locks.
- **Reads cost less.** A call into SQLite is a plain Go call, and on Go 1.27 scanning a number into your variable allocates nothing (a string costs one allocation, its own).

## Why you can trust it

- **Safety comes first, speed second, memory third.** A change that is faster but could lose a write, return a wrong result or weaken a commit is not taken. Group commit keeps a SAVEPOINT around every merged statement for this reason, though it costs speed.
- **The C is SQLite's, unchanged.** `engine/` holds the 3.54.1 amalgamation as released, checked against its hash (`engine/vendor.sh --verify`). The compile options sit in one file, each with its reason.
- **The Go assembly is made, never written.** LLVM compiles the C, and a generator turns what LLVM writes into Go assembly. It stops on anything it has no rule for, and checks the linked binary. `make check-gen` fails when the checked-in assembly is not what the generator makes from `engine/` today.
- **The numbers show where it loses.** The tables above keep the rows where another driver is faster, and [docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md) says how each run was taken and what else ran on the machine.
- **Every push is tested** on linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/arm64 and windows/amd64 (with the race detector, except on windows), with the sqlite3 shell writing the same database at the same time, and with processes killed while they write.

## Not there yet

- No loadable extensions: SQLite is built without `load_extension`.
- No shared cache: `cache=shared` gives an error. For a memory database that all connections of a pool see, use `file:/name?vfs=memdb`.
- Double-quoted strings are identifiers only (`SQLITE_DQS=0`, as SQLite advises): write string literals in single quotes.
- windows/arm64 and other targets do not build.

## Contributing

liustack/sqlite does not accept pull requests. A change here can reach from SQLite's C, through the generator, to group commit and the replicator, and getting it right takes a lot of context, so every line is written and reviewed by one author. Two ways to help:

- **[Open an issue](https://github.com/liustack/sqlite/issues/new/choose).** Bugs, wrong results, slow queries, confusing errors, unclear docs, ideas. A small program that reproduces it helps more than a patch, and issues shape what gets built next.
- **Fork it.** Under MIT your copy is yours to change and publish. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the notes for working on a fork.

Security issues go through a private report, not an issue: see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Thanks

To D. Richard Hipp and the SQLite developers for SQLite, and to musl for the string functions the engine links. To the authors of mattn/go-sqlite3, modernc.org/sqlite and ncruces/go-sqlite3, who showed the ways SQLite can live in Go and whose drivers this one is measured against.
