## 🚀 Quick Start

### Method 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

The simplest and cleanest way to install.

1. **Option A: Docker Compose (Recommended)**
   Create a `docker-compose.yml` and run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Option B: Docker CLI**
   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name litegist \
     -p 3382:3382 \
     -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
     -e ADMIN_USERNAME=admin \
     -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_password \
     lockcp/litegist
   ```

3. **Access & Logs**
   - URL: `http://localhost:3382`
   - Default Username: `admin`
   - Default Password: `admin888`
   
   > **💡 Tip**: If you don't set an `API_KEY` in environment variables, a random one will be generated on startup. You can find it in the container logs:
   
   ```bash
   docker logs litegist
   ```

### Method 2: Manual Installation

Ensure you have **Node.js >= 22.5.0** installed.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```
