Teatro is a self-hosted game library server with a player library,
browser administration, and a focused ROMM-compatible API. SQLite stores the
catalog; game files remain visible on disk. Teatro does not supply games or run
emulators. Import only content you have permission to use.

Teatro is beta, noncommercial source-available software under
[CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](LICENSE). Docker is the main deployment method.
[Published beta images on GHCR](https://github.com/users/lodilorenzo/packages/container/package/teatro)
are available for Linux amd64 and arm64. No local compilation is needed.
There is no stable binary release. The current version is defined in
[`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml).

## Features

- Authenticated browsing, search, game details, covers and browser downloads.
- Uploads and managed-library scans for single files, optical-disc descriptors,
  tracks and multi-disc playlists.
- Metadata and cover editing, optional IGDB matching, and explicit file deletion.
- Read-only and administrator accounts, browser sessions and scoped API tokens.
- CRC32, MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256 hashing with Logiqx XML DAT verification.
- Optional GOG offline-installer extraction into Windows ZIPs.
- Optional browsing and selected-game imports from one remote RomM server.
- Optional same-link IPv4 discovery for compatible clients.

## Quick start with Docker

Use a 64-bit Linux Docker engine. The `0.19.9` image will support amd64 and arm64
when published; there is no `latest` tag.

For a fresh installation:

```bash
docker volume create teatro-data
docker run --detach \
  --name teatro \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --publish 4440:4440 \
  --volume teatro-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/lodilorenzo/teatro:0.19.9
```

Open `http://YOUR_SERVER:4440/setup` and create the first administrator. Use `/`
for the player library and `/admin` for administration. The `teatro-data` volume
holds the database, game files and covers.

**Complete setup on a trusted network. Do not expose port 4440 directly to the
Internet.** Passwords and tokens need HTTPS or a trusted VPN outside that boundary.
For host-only access, replace `--publish 4440:4440` with
`--publish 127.0.0.1:4440:4440`.

Read [Docker deployment](docs/docker.md) before using existing storage, changing
permissions, upgrading, verifying image signatures, or building from source. For
a native build, see [development](docs/development.md#run-from-source).

## Limits and release status

Teatro implements a subset of the ROMM API for browsing and downloads, not the full API.
GOG and remote RomM imports are disabled by default. Remote RomM compatibility
has not been validated against a live server. Server-side import jobs do not
resume after a restart. Archives are hashed as files, not by their members;
split archives and ClrMamePro text DATs are unsupported.

The Docker recipe and beta publishing workflow target native `linux/amd64` and
`linux/arm64` builds. Review the [image security policy](docs/image-publication.md)
before deployment. Stable-release qualification, production recovery,
independent reproducibility and client validation across devices remain pending.
