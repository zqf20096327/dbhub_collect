AILoud transcribes audio and video into a local library, then searches and
summarises it. Speech-to-text runs on your machine; summaries can too.

## Install

Needs [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 24 or newer.

```shell
npm install -g ailoud
```

`setup` installs the tools it drives -- ffmpeg, whisper.cpp, the models --
and `doctor` checks them:

```shell
ailoud setup
ailoud doctor
```

Nothing leaves your machine unless you choose a hosted model for summaries.

## Update

```shell
ailoud self update
```

It checks the registry first, so there is nothing to run before it. A snapshot
moves only to a newer snapshot of the same version, or to a release.

---

## Use it with an agent

```shell
ailoud mcp install
```

It configures one or more agents, at project or global scope:

| Agent      | Scopes          |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| `claude`   | project, global |
| `codex`    | project, global |
| `opencode` | project, global |
| `gemini`   | project, global |
| `hermes`   | global only     |
| `copilot`  | global only     |

It writes the MCP registration and a rules block the agent reads before its
first call. The agent then gets these tools:

```shell
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' | ailoud mcp | jq -r '.result.tools[].name'
```

```
list_recordings
list_untagged
list_tags
search_transcripts
get_transcript
list_speakers
list_reports
get_report
list_templates
job_status
annotate
import_recording
transcribe
summarize
create_template
delete_recording
delete_report
```

Reading tools return matches and file paths, never a whole transcript in one
call; deleting needs a second call carrying a confirmation token. See
[MCP](https://lorem-dev.github.io/ailoud/latest/mcp/).

| `audio import\|transcribe\|annotate\|search\|ls\|show\|rm` | the library and everything over it        |
| `audio summarize`                                          | writes a summary and saves it as a report |
| `report ls\|show\|rm`                                      | saved reports                             |

| `template ls\|new`                                         | what shape a summary of a kind takes      |
| `mcp` and `mcp install\|uninstall\|update`                 | serve the library to an agent             |
| `doctor`, `setup`                                          | check and provision the machine           |
| `self check\|update\|sync`                                 | this installation of ailoud               |

Every verb also works at the top level, and has a one-letter alias. Full
