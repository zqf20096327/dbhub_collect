Timmypanel is a private bookmark dashboard. Every page requires a login, and each account sees only its own groups, cards, wallpapers and settings. It is meant for you, your family or a small team — not as a public link directory.

It ships as **one executable plus one data directory**. The web UI is compiled into the binary, so you do not install Node, a separate web server, or a database. The easiest path is the prebuilt Docker image.

## Features

- Bulk-import browser bookmarks, or add one URL and auto-fetch its title, description and icon
- A bookmarklet for sites the server cannot reach — your browser uploads the icon and title
- Card grid grouped by category, with drag-and-drop reorder (including across groups)
- Search your own cards, plus optional external engines (Google, Bing, Baidu, …); stack several search bars, each with its own default source
- Dual addresses on a card (public + LAN) and one button to flip the whole panel
- Light / dark theme; image, solid or gradient wallpapers
- Floating weather widget in the top-left corner on desktop (optional, never shown on phones): pick a city or district, or use browser geolocation — the server fetches and caches it from Open-Meteo by default (no key). To resolve Chinese districts more reliably, switch to QWeather in the weather settings; your browser never talks to the weather API
- Floating Chinese calendar in the top-right corner on desktop (optional, never shown on phones): lunar dates, the 24 solar terms and traditional festivals, with a full-month panel; public-holiday and make-up workday badges appear for the years covered by the published schedule
- Floating Quick Access card on the right side on desktop (optional, never shown on phones): fast access to frequently visited sites, showing icon and title only with descriptions revealed on hover, selectable and reorderable from your collected sites
- Chinese and English UI; works on phones; can be added to the home screen
- Isolated accounts; JSON / ZIP backup and restore; daily snapshots on the server
- No third-party requests from the browser — icon sets are bundled, not fetched from a CDN. With the weather widget on, the outbound call happens on the server
- About page shows the running version and can check for updates; an admin can copy the host-side upgrade commands (the process cannot replace its own image)

## Deploy

Docker is the recommended path: copy the commands below and it should come up. If you prefer a single binary, skip to [Without Docker](#without-docker-systemd--caddy).

The app listens on `127.0.0.1:8080` only. It is not exposed to the internet until you put a reverse proxy in front. Get a working login first, then add a domain and HTTPS.

### Docker (recommended)

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) first (Compose is usually included). The image is about 58 MB and works on ordinary VPS boxes, Raspberry Pi and Synology NAS (`amd64` and `arm64`).

**1. Create a folder, download the compose file, start**

```bash
mkdir timmypanel && cd timmypanel
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lovetimmy1314/timmypanel/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

**2. Read the initial password and log in**

```bash
docker compose logs timmypanel
```

The logs print the admin username and a random password. Open <http://127.0.0.1:8080>, log in, and change that password immediately.

**3. Later upgrades**

Your data lives in a Docker volume, so upgrades keep it:

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

Or use the upgrade script (it detects compose vs `docker run`):

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lovetimmy1314/timmypanel/main/deploy/update.sh
chmod +x update.sh
./update.sh
```

Settings → About shows the running version and can check for updates. On Docker, an admin can copy the three commands above and run them on the host. The process cannot replace its own image.

**Common tweaks**

- Port 8080 already taken: `TP_PORT=18080 docker compose up -d`, then open <http://127.0.0.1:18080>.
- Pin a version instead of tracking `main`: `TP_TAG=1.2.3 docker compose up -d`. Image tags have **no `v` prefix** — git tag `v1.2.3` produces image `1.2.3`.
- **Do not** set `TP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` for the first password: it would be written in plain text inside the volume. Read the random one from the logs.
- Back up everything:

  ```bash
  docker run --rm -v timmypanel_timmypanel-data:/data -v "$PWD":/out alpine \
    tar czf /out/timmypanel-backup.tar.gz -C /data .
  ```

  That volume name is correct only if the folder from step 1 is named `timmypanel`. If you used another name, run `docker volume ls` and look for the one ending in `timmypanel-data`.

### Put it on the public internet

The panel only listens on localhost. Put Nginx or Caddy in front for HTTPS. A minimal Caddy config (change the domain):

```
nav.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
}
```

A more complete file is in [`deploy/Caddyfile`](deploy/Caddyfile).

The compose file already sets the two values a public HTTPS deploy needs. **Do not** change the port mapping to `8080:8080` (without `127.0.0.1`) — that publishes the panel straight to the internet and bypasses the host firewall.

### One `docker run` instead of compose

```bash
docker run -d --name timmypanel --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 \
  -v timmypanel-data:/data \
  -e TP_SECURE=true \
  -e TP_TRUSTED_PROXIES=172.17.0.1 \
  --stop-timeout 30 \
  ghcr.io/lovetimmy1314/timmypanel:latest

docker logs timmypanel     # the generated admin password is printed here
```

Behind an HTTPS reverse proxy both environment variables are required: `TP_SECURE` so the login cookie is HTTPS-only, `TP_TRUSTED_PROXIES` so login rate limiting sees the real client IP. `172.17.0.1` is the usual default-bridge gateway — confirm it (compose pins its own subnet, so you can ignore this there):

```bash
docker network inspect bridge -f '{{(index .IPAM.Config 0).Gateway}}'
```

The volume name on this path is `timmypanel-data` (no project prefix). Upgrade with `update.sh` above, or by hand in three steps. Use `stop`, not `rm -f`, or SQLite may not finish cleanup:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/lovetimmy1314/timmypanel:latest
docker stop -t 30 timmypanel && docker rm timmypanel
# then re-run the `docker run` above
```

See [`deploy/Dockerfile`](deploy/Dockerfile) for the full list of environment variables.

### Without Docker (systemd + Caddy)

This path needs a Linux binary. CI publishes the Docker image; build the binary yourself with [Build from source](#build-from-source) and copy it to the server.

```bash
# 1. user and directories
sudo useradd -r -s /usr/sbin/nologin timmypanel
sudo mkdir -p /opt/timmypanel/data
sudo chown -R timmypanel:timmypanel /opt/timmypanel
```

```bash
# 2. upload the binary (run this on your own machine)
scp dist/timmypanel-linux-amd64 root@your-server:/opt/timmypanel/timmypanel
```

```bash
# 3. install the service
sudo cp deploy/timmypanel.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo chmod +x /opt/timmypanel/timmypanel
sudo systemctl enable --now timmypanel
sudo journalctl -u timmypanel -n 30    # the initial admin password is in here
```

```bash
# 4. reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS (edit the domain in the Caddyfile first)
sudo cp deploy/Caddyfile /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
sudo systemctl reload caddy
```

Then edit `/opt/timmypanel/data/config.yaml`: set `server.secure: true` and `server.trusted_proxies: ["127.0.0.1"]`, and restart the service. Skip those two and the login cookie / rate limit will be wrong on the public internet.

## Configuration

`data/config.yaml` is created on first start, including a random secret and a random initial admin password.

```yaml
server:
  listen: 127.0.0.1:8080     # loopback only; a reverse proxy faces the internet
  secure: true               # required under HTTPS
  trusted_proxies:           # empty = trust no proxy headers
    - 127.0.0.1
data:
  dir: ./data
auth:
  secret: ...                # generated on first start
  remember_days: 30          # lifetime of "remember me"
  initial_admin:
    username: admin
    password: ...            # only used while the database has no users at all
  allow_register: false      # reserved; registration is not implemented (admins create accounts)
fetch:
  allow_private: false       # allow fetching icons from private IPs (off by default)
  timeout_sec: 8
backup:
  auto_daily: true
  keep: 7
weather:                         # optional instance-wide fallback; each account can also set QWeather in the UI
  qweather_host: xxxxx.xx.qweatherapi.com
  qweather_key: ...
```

Deployment-related values can also be set with environment variables: `TP_LISTEN`, `TP_SECURE`, `TP_DATA_DIR`, `TP_TRUSTED_PROXIES` (comma separated), `TP_SECRET`, `TP_ADMIN_USER`, `TP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `TP_ALLOW_PRIVATE_FETCH`, `TP_WEATHER_PROVIDER`, `TP_QWEATHER_HOST`, `TP_QWEATHER_KEY`.

The two boolean ones (`TP_SECURE`, `TP_ALLOW_PRIVATE_FETCH`) only accept `true` / `false` / `1` / `0`. Anything else (`yes`, `on`, …) is ignored with a warning in the log and the value from the config file is kept — a typo will never silently turn `TP_SECURE` off.

CLI flags: `-config <path>`, `-debug`, `-version`, `-reset-password <username>`.

## Forgot the admin password

> The `initial_admin.password` line in `config.yaml` is **unused once you have changed the password**. It is only read when the database has no users at all. Do not look there.

If another admin account exists, use it: *Account management* lets an admin set someone else's password. Otherwise let the binary reset it — no need to stop the service or touch the database:

```bash
docker exec timmypanel /app/timmypanel -config /data/config.yaml -reset-password admin
```

```bash
sudo -u timmypanel /opt/timmypanel/timmypanel \
  -config /opt/timmypanel/data/config.yaml -reset-password admin
```

A new random password is printed on screen and all existing sessions for that account are signed out. If you just tripped the rate limiter, wait 15 minutes or restart.

## Build from source

Requires Go 1.25+ and Node 20+.

```powershell
.\build.ps1 -Target all
```

Output lands in `dist/`: `timmypanel.exe` and `timmypanel-linux-amd64`. The SQLite driver is pure Go, so a Linux binary can be cross-compiled from Windows with no C toolchain. `-Target windows|linux|all` selects platforms; `-SkipFrontend` rebuilds only the Go side. On Windows you can also double-click `build.bat`.

Building by hand is two steps in a fixed order — the frontend must be built before it can be embedded:

```bash
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build     # writes into backend/internal/web/dist
cd ../backend && go build -o timmypanel .  # embeds it
```

Docker images are normally built by GitHub Actions: every push to `main` cuts the next patch tag (`v1.0.0` → `v1.0.1`), opens a GitHub Release, and publishes that version plus `latest`. To build one locally:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml up -d --build
```

## Development

Two terminals:

```bash
cd backend && go run . -config ../data/config.yaml -debug
```

```bash
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>. The dev server proxies `/api` and `/uploads` to port 8080, so the login cookie is same-origin. The backend prints the generated admin credentials on first start; `TP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=... go run .` sets your own.

Checks to run before committing:

```bash
cd backend && gofmt -l . && go vet ./... && go test ./...
```

```bash
cd frontend && npm run typecheck
```

`npm run build` does **not** type-check, so `npm run typecheck` is not optional.

Three documents in [`docs/`](docs/) carry the context that the code cannot:

| File | Answers |
|---|---|
| [`conventions.md`](docs/conventions.md) | the rules this codebase writes code by |
| [`decisions.md`](docs/decisions.md) | why things are the way they are, and what each choice cost |
| [`plans.md`](docs/plans.md) | what is planned, what is deliberately out of scope, and the manual test checklist |

Read `decisions.md` before deleting anything that looks redundant. Several details are there because removing them compiles and passes tests but breaks the running site.

## Security model

Timmypanel is designed to sit on the public internet with a login in front of it.

- **Sessions are server-side.** The cookie cannot be read by scripts; it holds a random token and the database stores only its hash. Any session can be revoked. No JWT in `localStorage`.
- **Login attempts are rate limited** per IP and per username — 5 failures, 15 minute lockout. "No such user" and "wrong password" return the same message, so accounts cannot be enumerated.
- **Icon fetching refuses private addresses by default**, and the check runs on the IP actually being dialled. Redirects, timeouts and response size are capped.
- **Uploads are typed by content**, not by file extension — common image types only, stored under a random name.
- **Uploaded files require a login** and only the current user's directory is served. Responses are sandboxed so a fetched icon cannot run scripts even if opened directly.
- **Write requests need a custom header**, together with browser cookie rules, to block cross-site request forgery.

Found a security problem? Please open a GitHub issue marked as such, or contact the maintainer privately rather than posting a working exploit.

## Known limitations

- **No embedded iframes of your sites.** Most major sites refuse to be framed, so the feature would be empty boxes for most cards.
- **No uptime monitoring.** Periodic probing brings background jobs, timeouts and false alarms; it is not worth it for a start page.
- **Some sites still refuse to be scraped.** The fetcher is enough for most sites. Stricter bot protection will keep returning errors — upload an icon manually.
- **The fetcher does not use a proxy.** Icons are downloaded by the *server*, not your browser. A site your browser can open may still be unreachable from the machine running Timmypanel. Deploy somewhere with direct access to the sites you care about.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Before opening a PR:

- read [`docs/conventions.md`](docs/conventions.md) — it only documents where this project differs from ordinary practice, and it is short;
- run the checks listed under [Development](#development);
- if your change touches auth, per-user isolation, uploads or fetching, walk the manual checklist at the end of [`docs/plans.md`](docs/plans.md);
- keep `backend/internal/web/dist/index.html` as the placeholder page. `npm run build` rewrites it, but the hashed asset files are not in version control, so committing the built page gives fresh clones a silent white screen. `git checkout -- backend/internal/web/dist/index.html` before committing.

Comments, logs and backend error messages are written in Chinese; identifiers and filenames are ASCII. User-facing strings go through `frontend/src/i18n/`, which requires both a Chinese and an English entry — a missing translation fails the type check.
