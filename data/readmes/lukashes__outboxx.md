**PostgreSQL Change Data Capture in Zig**

Lightweight and powerful tool that streams WAL changes to Kafka.
Built in Zig for minimal resource consumption.

<br clear="left"/>

## What is Outboxx?

Outboxx captures PostgreSQL database changes in real-time and streams them to Kafka topics. Inspired by Debezium but designed for simplicity and low resource usage.

**Key Features:**
- Natively fast
- PostgreSQL streaming replication (pgoutput)
- Initial snapshot of existing rows, consistent with the stream's start
- Multi-table CDC streams
- Kafka producer integration
- TOML-based configuration
- Prometheus metrics and health endpoints
- Memory-safe Zig implementation

## Roadmap

- Schema Registry
- Table/Column Filtering

## Inspired by Debezium

Outboxx is heavily inspired by [Debezium](https://debezium.io/), the industry standard for Change Data Capture. Debezium is an excellent, battle-tested solution with a rich feature set. However, being a JVM-based application, it comes with resource overhead that may not be suitable for all environments:

| Aspect | Outboxx | Debezium |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Runtime** | Native binary | JVM (Kafka Connect) |
| **Memory Usage** | <10 MB | ~200-500 MB |
| **Startup Time** | <1s | 10-30s |
| **Throughput** | ~150k events/sec | ~100k events/sec |
| **Configuration** | Simple TOML | Complex JSON/Properties |
| **Deployment** | Single binary | Kafka Connect cluster |

For a measured run on the same WAL backlog (Apple M1, mixed workload), see the [benchmark results](tests/load/README.md#results).

**Choose Outboxx when:**
- Memory is constrained (containers, edge computing, cost optimization)
- Simple deployment without Kafka Connect infrastructure
- Native binary and minimal dependencies preferred

**Stick with Debezium when:**
- Production-critical workloads requiring mature, battle-tested solution
- Complex transformations and extensive connector ecosystem needed
- Kafka Connect infrastructure already in place
- Enterprise support and maximum feature coverage required

Outboxx aims to bring Debezium's excellent CDC concepts to resource-constrained environments where every MB of RAM matters.

## Configuration Example

For complete configuration examples, see [`docs/examples/config.toml`](docs/examples/config.toml).

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

**PostgreSQL Requirements**: Version 14 or later (tested and supported versions)

**Configure PostgreSQL** (`postgresql.conf`):
```ini
wal_level = logical              # Required for logical replication (CDC)
```

Restart PostgreSQL after configuration changes.

**Create User** (run as PostgreSQL superuser):

```sql
-- Create user with REPLICATION attribute (required for replication slots and WAL access)
CREATE USER outboxx_user WITH REPLICATION PASSWORD 'secure_password';

-- Grant database access
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE my_database TO outboxx_user;

-- Grant schema access (CREATE needed for creating publications)
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO outboxx_user;

-- Grant table access (SELECT needed for logical replication)
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE my_table TO outboxx_user;

-- Enable REPLICA IDENTITY FULL so DELETE events carry the full row.
-- Required (and validated at startup) for tables whose stream tracks DELETE.
-- UPDATE emits only the new row, so it does not need this.
ALTER TABLE my_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
```

**Note**: Outboxx automatically creates replication slot and publication on startup. Currently supports `public` schema only.

**Kafka Setup**:
- Topics are auto-created by default (`auto.create.topics.enable=true`)
- For production: pre-create topics with desired partitions and replication factor
- Outboxx will fail-fast if topic doesn't exist and auto-create is disabled

### 2. Running Outboxx

Run the published Docker image:

```bash
export POSTGRES_URL="postgres://user:your_password@host:5432/dbname?sslmode=require"
docker run --rm \
  -e POSTGRES_URL \
  -v "$PWD/config.toml:/config.toml:ro" \
  ghcr.io/lukashes/outboxx:latest \
  --config /config.toml
```

For local development builds:

```bash
# Build the application
make build

# Run with your configuration
export POSTGRES_URL="postgres://user:your_password@host:5432/dbname?sslmode=require"
./zig-out/bin/outboxx --config config.toml
```

### 3. Production Deployment

⚠️ **Outboxx requires a process supervisor** (systemd, Kubernetes, Docker restart policy, supervisord) as it uses fail-fast error handling. PostgreSQL replication slots preserve state across restarts.
