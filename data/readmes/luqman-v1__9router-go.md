## 🤔 Why 9router-go?

Same idea as [9Router](https://github.com/decolua/9router), minus the Node.js runtime: **one Go binary** serves the proxy APIs + an embedded Svelte dashboard.

**Stop wasting money, tokens and hitting limits:**

- ❌ Subscription quota expires unused every month
- ❌ Rate limits stop you mid-coding
- ❌ Tool outputs (git diff, grep, ls...) burn tokens fast
- ❌ Manual switching between providers

**9router-go solves this:**

- ✅ **RTK Token Saver** — auto-compress tool_result content, save 20-40% tokens
- ✅ **Auto fallback** — Subscription → Cheap → Free, zero downtime
- ✅ **Extended combo routing** — per-combo strategy: fallback, round-robin, sticky, capacity, or fusion
- ✅ **Multi-account** — round-robin between accounts per provider
- ✅ **Proxy per API key** — bind a proxy pool to each provider API key (connection), one-by-one or via **Apply Proxy** across many at once
- ✅ **Custom headers** — add your own request headers to custom compatible providers
- ✅ **Unified custom provider add** — one shared dialog adds OpenAI-/Anthropic-compatible endpoints
- ✅ **Custom usage ranges** — analyze any window (`14d`, `12h`), not just fixed presets
- ✅ **Extended logging** — live console log with level filters & search, plus per-request payload inspector
- ✅ **Single binary** — Go + embedded dashboard, works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Cline, any CLI tool

## ⚡ Quick Start

**1. Install (one line):**

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luqman-v1/9router-go/main/install.sh | bash
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell, no admin needed)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luqman-v1/9router-go/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

🎉 Then start it (defaults: port `20130`, data `~/.9router` — no flags needed):

```bash
9router-go
# Dashboard: http://localhost:20130 (Default password: 123456)
```
> **Already using upstream [9Router](https://github.com/decolua/9router)?** Point 9router-go at the same data dir — it opens the **same `DATA_DIR/db/data.sqlite`**. Your providers, connections, combos, API keys, and usage history carry over as-is. No import step, no migration. See [Sharing a database with 9Router](#-sharing-a-database-with-9router) for the caveats.

**Keep the terminal free (background mode):**

```bash
9router-go start          # same as: 9router-go --background   (or -d)
9router-go status         # is it running? (pid, dashboard, log)
9router-go restart        # replace the running daemon
9router-go logs -n 100    # tail the background log
9router-go stop           # stop it
```

The detached process records itself in `DATA_DIR/run/gateway.pid` and writes its
output to `DATA_DIR/run/gateway.log`. A second `start` while one is running
refuses instead of fighting over the port, and a daemon killed from Task Manager
leaves nothing behind: the stale pid file is cleaned on the next command.
> Windows stops the process with `TerminateProcess` instead of `SIGTERM`, so
> stopping skips the graceful drain; use the dashboard's Shutdown button or
> `9router-go restart` when you want in-flight streams to finish first.

**2. Connect a FREE provider (no signup needed):**

Dashboard → Providers → Connect **Kiro AI** (~50 credits/month free) or **OpenCode Free** (no auth) → Done!

**3. Use in your CLI tool:**

```text
Claude Code / Codex / OpenClaw / Cursor / Cline Settings:
  Endpoint: http://localhost:20130/v1
  API Key:  [Settings → API Keys in the dashboard]
  Model:    kr/claude-sonnet-4.5
```

**That's it!** Start coding with FREE AI models.

**Alternatives:**

```bash
# Docker — no build needed
docker run -d --name 9router-go --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 20130:20130 -v "$HOME/.9router:/data" \
  -e PORT=20130 -e DATA_DIR=/data \
  -e INITIAL_PASSWORD=your-secure-password \
  luqmenul/9router-go:latest

# Manual download — pick your file, no command line guesswork:
# Windows → .exe | Mac M1+ → darwin-arm64 | Mac Intel → darwin-amd64
# Linux VPS → linux-amd64 | Raspberry Pi → linux-arm64
```

## 🔄 Sharing a database with 9Router

**Already running [9Router](https://github.com/decolua/9router) (the Next.js version)? 9router-go reads that exact database. There is no import, no export, and no migration step.**

Both projects default to the same file and speak the same schema:

| | Path |
|---|---|
| macOS / Linux | `~/.9router/db/data.sqlite` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\9router\db\data.sqlite` |
| Docker | `/data/db/data.sqlite` inside the container |

Stop 9Router, start 9router-go, and log in with your existing password. Your provider connections, proxy pools, combos, API keys, model aliases, and usage history are all there — 9router-go's own dashboard renders them, because it *is* the same data.

**You don't even have to stop 9Router** if you want to keep the Node.js dashboard around. Run 9router-go on a different port against the same `DATA_DIR`:

```bash
# 9Router on :20128 (Next.js)  ·  9router-go on :20130 (Go, same DB)
PORT=20130 DATA_DIR=/home/you/.9router ./9router-go
```

Both read the same tables, so a connection you add in either dashboard shows up in the other. SQLite serialises the writes; the supported setup is one active writer, so avoid editing the same combo or settings entry in both at the same moment.

**Running it the other way round** (9router-go first, then pointing 9Router at the same directory) works the same way. 9router-go will have added two columns to `providerConnections` (`lastUsedAt`, `consecutiveUseCount`) and one extra table (`upstream_leases`). Upstream ignores both — its schema sync is additive and doesn't drop unknown columns — so nothing breaks.

What 9router-go will **not** do:

- **Import a legacy JSON export.** If your 9Router data still lives in old JSON files, start upstream once to convert them, then switch.
- **Run destructive migrations or pre-migration backups.** Its bootstrap only ever *adds* — create missing tables, add missing columns, seed missing rows. It never drops or retypes.
- **Interpret `_meta.schemaVersion`.** It's upstream's migration bookkeeping. A database written by a much newer 9Router release should be checked before you rely on it.

Take a backup first if the database matters:

```bash
cp -r ~/.9router/db ~/9router-db-backup   # stop the daemon first — see DATABASE.md
```

Full schema, operator contract, and multi-process limits: [`DATABASE.md`](DATABASE.md). Routing internals: [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## ⚙️ Setup Guide

### Release binary

Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/luqman-v1/9router-go/releases/latest), verify against `SHA256SUMS.txt`.

### 🧪 Experimental builds

Unreleased work also ships as **experimental** builds. They are published
separately and are never offered to a normal install:

- GitHub Releases marks them **Pre-release**, so `releases/latest` — the URL
  `9router-go update` falls back to — keeps pointing at the stable version.
- Docker Hub tags them `exp` (`luqmenul/9router-go:exp`), never `latest`.

```bash
docker pull luqmenul/9router-go:exp
```

Opt in only if you want to help shake out bugs. `9router-go update` will not
install one over a stable release — grab the asset for your platform from the
[pre-releases page](https://github.com/luqman-v1/9router-go/releases) and
replace the running binary with it.

### Build from source

Prerequisites: Go 1.27 and Bun 1.x (dashboard is embedded into the binary, so build web first):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luqman-v1/9router-go.git
cd 9router-go
make web-build   # bun install --frozen-lockfile && bun run build
make build       # embeds VERSION into the Go binary
```

### Run

Defaults are enough for most people — plain `9router-go` listens on port `20130` with data in `~/.9router`:

```bash
9router-go
curl http://localhost:20130/health
./9router-go version
```

Only override when you need something different (`PORT`, `DATA_DIR`/`DB_PATH` — there are no `--port` flags):

```bash
PORT=20129 ./9router-go                        # different port
DATA_DIR=/srv/9router ./9router-go              # different data dir
DB_PATH=/srv/9router/data.sqlite ./9router-go   # explicit SQLite file
HOST=127.0.0.1 ./9router-go                     # localhost only, behind a reverse proxy
```

### 🔑 Dashboard Login & Fresh Install

- **Localhost (`localhost` / `127.0.0.1`)**: First login uses the default compatibility password `123456`. Once logged in, change your password in **Settings → Profile**.
- **Remote / VPS / Docker / LAN**: For security (preventing public takeover of fresh installs with known defaults, CVE-2026-56679), remote access blocks the default `123456` password. You **must** either:
  1. **Set `INITIAL_PASSWORD` on launch (Recommended)**:
     ```bash
     INITIAL_PASSWORD="your-secure-password" ./9router-go
     # Or in your .env file:
     # INITIAL_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
     ```
  2. **Or access via SSH port-forwarding first**:
     ```bash
     ssh -L 20130:127.0.0.1:20130 user@remote-host
     # Open http://localhost:20130, login with 123456, then change password in Settings
     ```

### Client example

```bash
curl http://localhost:20130/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer sk-your-api-key' \
  -d '{"model":"ag/gemini-3.8-flash-high","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"stream":true}'
```

For Claude Messages clients: `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:20130/v1`.

### API surface

```text
POST /v1/chat/completions       OpenAI Chat Completions
POST /v1/messages               Claude Messages
POST /v1/responses              Responses API
POST /v1/embeddings             Embeddings
POST /api/chat                  Ollama-compatible chat
GET  /v1/models                 Model catalog
POST /v1/images/generations     Image generation
POST /v1/videos/generations     Video generation
POST /v1/audio/speech           Text to speech
POST /v1/audio/transcriptions   Speech to text
POST /v1/search                 Web search
GET  /api/usage/stream          Live usage SSE
GET  /health                    Liveness
GET  /api/version               Version metadata
```

### Authentication

- Public: `/health`, dashboard HTML/assets, `/login`, OAuth callbacks.
- Proxy routes need an active client API key (`Authorization: Bearer` / `X-API-Key`).
- Dashboard APIs need a session cookie, CLI token, or API key; destructive ops (shutdown, update, DB import) need a session or CLI token.
- The API server defaults to all interfaces — bind localhost or protect the port outside trusted machines.

### Database compatibility

Go reads/writes the upstream 9router table/JSON shapes and bootstraps the core schema on startup (creates the 11 tables when absent, backfills missing columns, seeds an empty settings row) — a fresh `DATA_DIR` just works, no upstream install needed. Existing databases are never modified beyond additive backfills. Full contract in [`DATABASE.md`](DATABASE.md), routing internals in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 🤝 Contributing

Issues and pull requests use templates, so pick the right one rather than opening a blank report:

- **Bug report** — something behaves incorrectly. Include a reproduction, `9router-go version`, OS, and the log excerpt around the failure.
- **Feature request** — the problem you cannot solve today, the surface it touches, and whether upstream already has it.
- **Upstream parity** — a behaviour `decolua/9router` has and this gateway does not; link the upstream commit or PR.
- **Question** — configuration and usage help.

PRs follow the checks CI runs: `go vet ./...`, `go test -count=1 ./...`, `make test-integration`, plus `cd web && bun test` and `make vet-svelte` for anything touching the dashboard. Before writing code, skim [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — provider isolation and the Go/Svelte conventions there are enforced by review.
