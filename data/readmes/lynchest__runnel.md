> Architected & directed via agentic workflows; strictly tested & verified.

`runnel` is a small HTTP egress gateway for controlling requests to
external APIs and web services on a per-domain basis. It combines rate
limiting, circuit breaking, request queuing, and a bounded response cache in a
single process.

It is intended for scrapers, indexers, workers, and other applications that
make regular requests to external services and need predictable handling of
upstream limits. It is not a general-purpose public forward proxy or an AI
agent runtime.

## How it works

Clients send the target URL to the `/proxy` endpoint:

```text
client → URL/SSRF validation → domain limiter → circuit breaker → upstream
                                           ↓
                                    cache / queue
```

Each upstream domain is tracked independently. A `429` or `503` response opens
the circuit; `Retry-After`, when present, is used to calculate the cooldown.
Once the cooldown expires, one lightweight queued GET request is used as a
canary. If the upstream is healthy again, queued traffic is released. If not,
the cooldown is increased exponentially.

## Features

- Per-domain token-bucket rate limiting with configurable burst and jitter
- Per-domain `CLOSED`, `OPEN`, and `HALF-OPEN` circuit breakers
- Bounded, prioritized in-memory request queues
- `Retry-After` handling and exponential cooldowns
- Lightweight GET canary probes in `HALF-OPEN`
- SQLite-backed cache for GET and HEAD responses honoring upstream `Cache-Control` and `Vary`
- Optional stale-cache responses while a circuit is open
- Singleflight coalescing for identical idempotent requests
- Redirect target validation
- SSRF protection against private, loopback, link-local, multicast, and metadata IPs
- Hop-by-hop header removal and request body limits
- Health, per-domain metrics, and circuit administration endpoints
- `X-Request-ID` propagation and single-line access logging
- CGO-free Go binary

## Security

`runnel` is designed as an internal egress gateway for trusted local services,
**not** a general-purpose public open proxy. It must not be exposed directly to
the public internet or untrusted clients without an authentication proxy or
explicit domain restrictions (`security.allowed_domains`).

By default, `runnel` binds safely to `127.0.0.1:8090`. Before exposing it on any
network interface, ensure you configure the following:

- Keep `security.block_private_ips: true` enabled to prevent SSRF against private,
  loopback, link-local, multicast, and cloud metadata endpoints.
- Use `security.allowed_domains` to explicitly restrict upstream destinations.
- Set a strong `security.admin_token` or `RUNNEL_ADMIN_TOKEN` value. When empty,
  administrative mutations (`POST /_circuit/reset`) are rejected with `403 Forbidden`.
- Never expose administration endpoints (`/_*`) directly to the internet.

For vulnerability disclosure instructions, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Performance

The repository includes integration and soak tests covering the complete
request path. The current local measurements are:

- Idle resident memory: approximately **2 MB RSS** for the running process.
- Local Linux ARM64 development binary: approximately **14.7 MiB** (unstripped).
- Soak test: **10,000 requests** at **32 concurrent workers**, with one upstream
  call due to request coalescing and approximately **10 KB heap growth** during
  the run.
- Real-upstream validation (`v0.1.5`, 2026-09-09): a **15-minute**,
  single-concurrency run against a public HTTP test service completed **90
  upstream requests** and **90 cache hits** with no gateway, cache, circuit, or
  queue errors.

These are baseline measurements from the included test environment, not hard
capacity guarantees. Memory usage increases with concurrent requests, queued
items, and response sizes. Individual upstream responses are bounded at 64 MB;
incoming request bodies are bounded by the configured 10 MB default.

## Installation

> **Note for users and automated agents:** You do **not** need to install Go or build from source. Pre-compiled, zero-dependency binaries for Linux (`amd64`, `arm64`), macOS (`amd64`, `arm64`), and Windows are available in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lynchest/runnel/releases), as well as multi-arch container images on GHCR.

### Run with Docker (Recommended for Services & Sidecars)

Multi-arch container images (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) are published to GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker run -d --name runnel \
  -p 8090:8090 \
  -e RUNNEL_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -v runnel-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/lynchest/runnel:latest
```

The container retains the safe loopback bind by default. Setting
`RUNNEL_HOST=0.0.0.0` is required for a published port. A non-loopback bind
with empty `security.allowed_domains` is refused at startup, so mount a
config that restricts egress (e.g. `-v ./runnel.yaml:/config.yaml -e
RUNNEL_CONFIG=/config.yaml`) and keep the published port on a trusted network.

Or as a sidecar in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  runnel:
    image: ghcr.io/lynchest/runnel:latest
    environment:
      RUNNEL_HOST: 0.0.0.0
      RUNNEL_CONFIG: /config.yaml
    ports:
      - "8090:8090"
    volumes:
      - runnel-data:/data
      - ./runnel.yaml:/config.yaml:ro # must set security.allowed_domains
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  runnel-data:
```

### Run a release binary

Pre-built binaries are available for all major platforms:

| Platform | Architecture | Archive | Executable |

Download the archive for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lynchest/runnel/releases):

#### Linux & macOS

```bash
# Extract archive (example for Linux/macOS):
tar -xzf runnel_*_linux_amd64.tar.gz   # Linux x86_64
# tar -xzf runnel_*_linux_arm64.tar.gz   # Linux ARM64
# tar -xzf runnel_*_darwin_arm64.tar.gz  # macOS Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)
# tar -xzf runnel_*_darwin_amd64.tar.gz  # macOS Intel

./runnel -config runnel.example.yaml
```

Or download via GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Linux AMD64
gh release download -R lynchest/runnel --pattern "*linux_amd64.tar.gz"

# macOS Apple Silicon
gh release download -R lynchest/runnel --pattern "*darwin_arm64.tar.gz"
```

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
Expand-Archive -Path runnel_*_windows_amd64.zip -DestinationPath .
.\runnel.exe -config runnel.example.yaml
```

### Build from source (Developers)

Requirement: Go 1.22 or newer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lynchest/runnel.git
cd runnel
go build -o bin/runnel ./cmd/runnel
```

## Quick start

With the default configuration, the service listens on `127.0.0.1:8090`:

```bash
./runnel -config runnel.example.yaml
# (on Windows: .\runnel.exe -config runnel.example.yaml)
# (or ./bin/runnel if built from source)
```

Send a request through the gateway:

```bash
curl -i "http://127.0.0.1:8090/proxy?url=https://httpbin.org/get"
```

Provide a YAML configuration with `-config` or the `RUNNEL_CONFIG`
environment variable. All supported settings are documented in
[runnel.example.yaml](runnel.example.yaml).

## Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Any | `/proxy?url=<target>` | Validates and forwards a request to the upstream (accepts `X-Request-ID`, generates one when absent, propagates it upstream, and emits a single-line access log without URLs or credentials) |
| GET | `/_metrics` | Prometheus-compatible counters (global + per-domain `domain` labels for 256 tracked domains; queue depth is the tracked-domain total) |
| GET | `/_circuit` | JSON view of domain circuit states |
| POST | `/_circuit/reset[?domain=...]` | Resets one domain or all circuits |

The `/_circuit/reset` endpoint requires an `X-Admin-Token` header or a Bearer
token:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8090/_circuit/reset?domain=api.example.com" \
  -H "X-Admin-Token: your-secret-token"
```

## Cache and failure behavior

Successful GET and HEAD responses can be cached for the configured TTL.
Upstream caching rules are honored: `no-store`, `private`, and `no-cache`
responses are never stored, `s-maxage`/`max-age` shorten freshness (the
configured TTL remains an upper bound), and `Expires` applies when no
explicit freshness directive is present. Response age (`Age` header and
`Date` skew) is subtracted from the lifetime, and ambiguous freshness
directives (unparseable or conflicting repeats) refuse the store.
`Vary: *` responses are never stored; other `Vary` fields are matched
against the request before a HIT, and concurrent requests with different
headers never share one upstream fetch. The documented exception is
`X-Request-ID`: it is per-request unique, so it does not split flights and
responses varying on it are never cached. `must-revalidate` and
`proxy-revalidate` responses may serve fresh hits but are never served stale.
When a circuit is open and an older cached response is available, it is returned with
`X-Cache: STALE` and `Warning: 110` headers. Without a cached response, the
request waits in the domain queue. If the queue is full or its timeout expires,
the gateway returns `503 Service Unavailable` with a `Retry-After` header.

Non-idempotent methods such as POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE are not queued while
a circuit is open; they are rejected with the applicable cooldown information.

To bypass the cache and force a fresh fetch from upstream, send a `Cache-Control: no-cache` header or use `runnel-get --no-cache <url>`.

For troubleshooting, `runnel-get --verbose <url>` prints the effective gateway,
HTTP status, `X-Cache`, and `Retry-After` values to stderr without mixing them
into the response body.

For agent-friendly output from HTML pages, the cross-platform helper can convert
the response locally without changing the gateway cache:

```bash
runnel-get --output markdown "https://example.com"
```

Raw output remains the default. Non-HTML responses are passed through unchanged.
The native `runnel-get` executable is included in every release archive and
does not require Python or another external runtime.

The helper connects to `http://127.0.0.1:8090` by default. Set `RUNNEL_URL` to
the base URL of a remote or differently configured gateway.

## AI Agent Integration (Skill)

`runnel` includes an official agent skill definition ([`skills/runnel/SKILL.md`](skills/runnel/SKILL.md)) compatible with Antigravity, Codex, Cursor, Claude Code, and other agentic coding harnesses. When installed, coding agents automatically route web scraping, external API queries, and documentation fetching through the gateway to eliminate 429 penalties and IP bans.

### Installing the Skill

**Via runnel CLI (Recommended):**
```bash
# Automatically installs embedded skill to ~/.agents/skills/runnel
runnel install-skill

# Or install to a specific workspace directory
runnel install-skill .agents/skills/runnel
```

Check gateway health and get a compact circuit summary with:

```bash
runnel status
```

The legacy `runnel --install-skill` flag remains available for compatibility;
new usage should use the `install-skill` subcommand above.

**Manual Copy:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
cp -r skills/runnel ~/.agents/skills/
```


## Development


```bash
# Tests
go test -v ./...

# Static analysis
go vet ./...
make lint

# Binary
make build

# Race detector (on supported hosts)
make test-race
```

The race detector depends on the Go toolchain and the host operating system's
virtual address space support. The CI workflow runs race tests on Linux AMD64
and builds a matrix for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
