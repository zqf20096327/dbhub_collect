Tradr is a self-hostable journal for options and equities traders. It records the whole
arc of a position — draft, scale-in, partial close — with every fill, fee, and note
attached, then shows you what your record actually says.

It runs as a complete manual journal with **no keys configured at all**. Every external
integration is opt-in, and nothing phones home until you switch it on. It never places an
order.

## How to run it

**Self-hosted, with the quickstart below** — free and completely unlimited, forever. No
feature is fenced off; plan gating is a single deployment setting that ships **off**.

**Hosted at [app.tradr.cloud](https://app.tradr.cloud)**, if you'd rather not run a
server. It is the same software from the same releases, with backups and upgrades handled
for you. The free plan is capped ([what the caps
are](https://docs.tradr.cloud/user-guide/reference/plan-limits/)); Pro lifts them for $10
a month. Nothing in the self-hosted build depends on it.

## Quickstart

Requires Docker with Compose v2 and `openssl`. About two minutes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/madmatt112/tradr.git
cd tradr
./docker/quickstart.sh
```

The script generates the three required secrets, writes your `.env`, starts the stack,
and waits for the API to report healthy. It never overwrites an existing `.env`. When it
finishes, Tradr is on <http://localhost:8080> (override with `WEB_PORT`).

This is the same script CI runs in its `docker-smoke` job, so these instructions are
executed on every push rather than proofread. To do it by hand instead, or to run behind
TLS, against your own Postgres, or on a different port, see the
[self-hosting guide](https://docs.tradr.cloud/self-hosting/docker-compose/).

## Status

**v0.11.x — pre-1.0, and moving quickly.** What that promises:

- **The HTTP API is not stable yet.** Breaking endpoint changes can land in any release
  until v1.0.0. Pin a tag rather than tracking `:latest` if that matters to you.
- **Migrations are forward-only and run automatically on API startup.** There are no
  down-migrations. Schema changes are split expand-then-contract across releases, so
  redeploying the previous image stays a viable recovery.
- **Releases are CI-gated.** A tag publishes images only after CI passes on that exact
  commit.
- **Back up before every upgrade.** See the [deployment runbook](docs/runbooks/deployment.md).

Full policy — what counts as a breaking change, which surfaces are covered — in
[`docs/versioning.md`](docs/versioning.md). Release notes are the changelog: see
[Releases](https://github.com/madmatt112/tradr/releases), which the app also renders
in-product.

## What it does

- **Positions** — draft, open, scale in, close in parts. Multiple fills roll up into one
  position with a correct average and realized P&L, net of per-fill fees.
- **Trade calculator** — position size, R:R, dollar risk, and estimated fees from your
  entry, target, and stop, before anything is at risk.
- **Accounts & ledger** — multiple brokerages and currencies on a running ledger,
  with reconciliation.
- **Performance** — equity curve built from net P&L, broken down daily through all-time.
- **Options tools** — chain lookup, OCC symbol parsing, Black-Scholes pricing with full Greeks.
- **CSV import** — bring years of history from any broker with a column-mapping step.
  Direct read-only broker connections are on the roadmap, not shipped.

## Configuration

Three values must be set; everything else has a working default. `./docker/quickstart.sh`
generates all three:

| Variable            | What it is                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Database password. Compose builds the API's `DATABASE_URL` from the `POSTGRES_*` values — do not set `DATABASE_URL` yourself. |
| `SESSION_SECRET`    | Signs auth session cookies (≥32 chars).                                                                                       |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY`    | 32-byte hex key encrypting stored API keys at rest (AES-256-GCM).                                                             |

`ENCRYPTION_KEY_FINGERPRINT` is optional but recommended — it makes a wrong-key boot fail
fast and loudly instead of failing later when a stored key won't decrypt.

Every key is documented inline in [`.env.example`](.env.example). What a running instance
talks to over the network, and which setting enables each connection, is in
[`docs/external-services.md`](docs/external-services.md). Analytics are **off unless you
set a key** — see [`docs/analytics.md`](docs/analytics.md).

**TLS is yours.** The shipped compose file does not terminate it. Put your own reverse
proxy in front of the `web` container, and add that edge to `TRUSTED_PROXIES` so per-IP
rate limiting stays accurate.
