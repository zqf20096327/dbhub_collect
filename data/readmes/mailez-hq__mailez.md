# mailez — mail easy

Self-hosted email that scales with you: from a personal mailbox of one to
ten-thousand-person organizations — teams, companies and public-sector
agencies alike. Send and receive mail with your own domain, keep your data in
your own hands, and enjoy a webmail that actually feels good to use. One
command deploys the whole thing — mail delivery, spam filtering,
authentication, admin console and webmail.

## Who is it for?

- **Individuals** — a mailbox that is truly yours, not rented from a mail provider
- **Businesses and organizations** — domain mail for everyone, with data kept 100% in-house
- **Public sector** — strict data-sovereignty and privacy requirements, fully covered

The common ground: self-hosted and privacy-first, with no Linux mail expert
required to run it.

## What you get

</p>

### Webmail that feels like a native app

- **Live, not refreshed** — new mail arrives over a real-time push channel, so
  the inbox updates itself; reading, replying and organizing never reload the
  page, and long lists scroll smoothly through 10,000+ messages
- **Conversation view keeps threads readable** — replies under one subject
  merge into a single conversation with its full timeline, and quoted history
  in replies folds away until you expand it

</p>

- **Three-pane layout** — folders, list and reading pane side by side; the
  list column is draggable to your preferred width
- **Search that just works** — type naturally (`from:`, `to:`, `has:attachment`,
  dates…), save frequent searches, and filter with one click for unread,
  starred or messages with attachments
- **Keyboard-first** — press `/` to search, `⌘K` for the command palette, `?`
  for the full shortcut list
- **Day-to-day mail tasks made easy** — conversation threads, quick reply
  right in the action bar, snooze, scheduled send, undo toast for
  bulk move / archive / delete, and drafts that keep every recipient including
  Bcc
- **A workbench, not just an inbox** — the home dashboard surfaces recent
  files and upcoming events, both clickable straight into context
- **Privacy features built in** — PGP sign and encrypt (distinct from your
  personal signature, with an optional auto-signature), two-factor
  authentication, remote-image blocking, a Sieve filter editor, and contacts
  grouped by sender
- **Works offline** — installs as a PWA; light/dark themes and three list
  densities for comfort

### Mail is just the start

- **Calendar** — events with reminders, shared calendars, and subscriptions
  you can plug into Apple Calendar or Google Calendar via a private ICS link
- **Contacts** — vCard import/export, duplicate merging, and CardDAV sync for
  phones
- **Drive** — upload and organize files, share by link, restore from trash;
  recent files show up on the dashboard

### Any device, any client

- **Standard protocols** — SMTP / IMAP / POP3 (implicit TLS available), plus
  CardDAV / CalDAV sync for phones and desktops; popular clients configure
  themselves via autoconfig/autodiscover
- **Delta Chat** — generate a login QR in settings and scan it with the
  Delta Chat app to turn the mailbox into an end-to-end-encrypted chat
  account, server setup included in the scan
- **App tokens** — per-client tokens you can issue and revoke from settings

### An admin console that doesn't feel like admin work

- **Manage everything in one place** — domains, mailboxes, aliases, relays,
  external mailbox fetching and app tokens; deleting a user cleans up their
  engine-side mailbox automatically
- **One-click DKIM** — generate signing keys with a status hint, so your mail
  stops landing in spam
- **Domain health checks** — the Health page live-verifies MX / SPF / DMARC /
  DKIM key comparison / Spamhaus blocklists / autoconfig / MTA-STS for every
  domain, plus engine, database, disk and certificate-expiry probes — each
  item with a status and a fix hint; the DNS wizard lists every record you
  must publish and verifies each one live, so going live is copy-paste
- **See who did what** — audit log of admin actions and role-based access
  (admin / manager / user)
- **Backup or migrate easily** — export and import your whole configuration

### Trust and security under the hood

- **Spam filtering that works** — Rspamd learns from your reporting; DKIM /
  DMARC signing and checking keep your mail deliverable
- **Transport security** — MTA-STS and DANE protect mail in transit;
  per-mailbox quotas and sending rate limits keep the system healthy
- **Malware scanning & content controls** — attachments are scanned for
  macros and known threats

## Quick start

Two self-contained deployment tiers ship as compose files, managed by one
entry point:

| Tier | Engine | Storage |
|---|---|---|
| **dev** (default) | mailezine | SQLite + Pebble + local FS |
| **production** | mailezine | SQLite + Pebble + local FS (MySQL/PostgreSQL optional) |

Both tiers run the **same mailezine engine** — same protocols, same
features at the mail layer, same upgrade path. They differ only in
**orientation** (dev builds from source on the host; production is a fully
containerized stack) and **control-plane storage** (SQLite by
default, with MySQL/PostgreSQL available behind compose profiles).
Existing deployments on the traditional multi-process mail architecture
migrate in place with `mailezine migrate`.

```sh
./deploy/mailezctl.sh up              # dev tier
./deploy/mailezctl.sh up ce    # production tier (pull prebuilt images)
```

The dev tier expects the backend on the host at `:8080` (build the images
once with `docker buildx bake` from the repo root; details in
[`docs/dev-setup.md`](docs/dev-setup.md)). The production tier is fully
containerized and publishes:

| Port | What's there |
|---|---|
| http://localhost:8082 | Admin console |
| http://localhost:8083 | Webmail |
| http://localhost:8081 | Backend API (for developers) |
| 25/465/587/143/993/4190 … | Mail protocols (SMTP / IMAP / ManageSieve) |

Two prerequisites before the first `up`:

- **Sibling checkout.** The mailezine engine image builds from the sibling
  repository — clone both side by side:
  `git clone …/mailez && git clone …/mailezine` (the compose build context
  points at `../../mailezine`).
- **Linux hosts: data-directory ownership.** The backend runs as uid 1000
  and the engine as uid 82; Docker creates `deploy/data/` root-owned on
  first start, which crash-loops both. Pre-create it once:
  `mkdir -p deploy/data && sudo chown -R 1000:82 deploy/data`.
  (Docker Desktop mounts handle this automatically.)

Note that the mail ports above bind to loopback by default (safe for
evaluations); a real deployment publishes them on the external interface
via the compose port mappings.

`mailezctl` reads `deploy/mailez.env` (copy `mailez.env.example`, then set
`MAILEZ_SECRET_KEY` and `MAILEZ_STACK_SECRET`). Raw `docker compose`
invocations must pass `--env-file mailez.env` — the `${MAILEZ_STACK_SECRET:?}`
interpolation reads shell env and `--env-file` only, never the services'
`env_file`. Host port mappings are overridable there too
(`MAILEZ_HTTP_PORT`, `MAILEZ_ADMIN_PORT`, …) for machines where
80/443/8082 are already taken.

TLS is off by default for local testing. For production, follow
[`deploy/certs/README.md`](deploy/certs/README.md) to enable automatic
certificates.

After the stack is up, provision the admin account **inside the container**
(the backend image ships a one-shot seeder; no local Go required):

```sh
docker compose --env-file deploy/mailez.env -f deploy/docker-compose.ce.yml exec backend mailez-seed
# default: admin@$MAILEZ_DOMAIN (admin@example.com on the shipped example
# domain) / MailezDemo2026! — override with
# MAILEZ_ADMIN_EMAIL / MAILEZ_ADMIN_PASSWORD before seeding
```

Then verify the whole mail path end to end (requires Go on the host):

```sh
cd backend
go run ./cmd/e2e    # sends a test mail, checks delivery, DKIM and spam filtering
```

## Tech stack (for developers)

- Backend: Go + Fiber, GORM, Redis
- Frontend: Next.js (React) — separate admin and webmail apps
- Mail engine: **mailezine** (a single Go binary) speaks
  SMTP/IMAP/POP3/ManageSieve behind an engine-agnostic directory contract
  (`/stack/directory/*`) with pluggable KV + blob storage — both the dev
  and production profiles run it; they differ only in storage
  (SQLite/pebble, with optional MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- More details: [`docs/dev-setup.md`](docs/dev-setup.md),
  [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md);

  switch): [`docs/upgrades.md`](docs/upgrades.md)
