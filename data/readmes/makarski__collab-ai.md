# collab-ai

**Codex and Claude, working together in a sandbox.**

- Real-time collaboration with durable messages and automatic delivery.
- An isolated Incus workspace with persistent projects and agent memory.
- Token usage visibility and soft caps for managed Codex; shared caps are not yet available.

## Set up a sandbox

[Provision once](docs/sandbox.md), then use the block below each day.
**Tools are preinstalled—no compilation needed.** Provisioning runs OpenTofu in a
disposable container; no host Terraform/OpenTofu install is needed. Dev has network access; optional
control stays offline. Host credentials and conversations are not imported.

**Host prerequisites:** Python, Git, OpenSSH and Incus; macOS also needs Colima.
[Install commands](docs/sandbox.md#1-install-the-host-tools). No `gh` or browser download needed.

```sh
# First install or upgrade (Incus must be running; upgrades end active sessions)
python3 scripts/sandbox-provision.py rollout
# Pin a version: add --release workspace-vX.Y.Z
```

Run host commands from your provisioning checkout. On Linux, skip Colima commands
and use `local:` / `--remote local`. For host mounts, see the
[`mounts.json` example](docs/sandbox-mounts.md#choose-directories).

```sh
# HOST: run from your provisioning checkout
# Start the Mac VM, then the containers
python3 scripts/sandbox-host.py apply
incus --project collab-ai start colima-collab-ai:secured   # if secured_runtime = true
incus --project collab-ai start colima-collab-ai:workspace

# Check: expect workspace (and secured, if enabled) to show RUNNING
incus --project collab-ai list colima-collab-ai:

# Optional: preview host mounts; uncomment with your file (does not apply)
# python3 scripts/sandbox-host.py mounts-plan --mounts-file /path/to/mounts.json

# Configure SSH once, check the broker, then enter dev
python3 scripts/sandbox-ssh.py --remote colima-collab-ai
ssh -F infra/incus/ssh/config workspace collab status
ssh -F infra/incus/ssh/config workspace

# CONTAINER: all commands below until exit run inside your SSH session
# First use only: uncomment to sign in before starting agents
# Codex: open the printed URL on your host and enter the device code
# command codex login --device-auth
# command claude auth login
# gh auth login --web --git-protocol https  # optional GitHub CLI login
# collab-codescene-login                  # optional CodeScene token; hidden prompt

# First use only: clone if you have not already done so
# git clone https://github.com/makarski/collab-ai.git /workspace/collab-ai
tmux new -A -s collab

# In each tmux window: enter the project, then choose one agent or dashboard
# Ctrl+B then C opens another window
cd /workspace/collab-ai
codex                         # new managed Codex conversation
# codex resume                # choose a saved sandbox conversation
# codex resume SESSION_ID     # resume a specific sandbox conversation
# claude                      # Claude with collaboration channels enabled
# claude --resume             # resume Claude
# dashboard                   # broker status and agent inboxes
# rtk gain                    # estimated shell-output token savings
# docker info                 # rootless Docker inside workspace
# docker compose up -d        # run your project's compose.yaml

# Disconnect: Ctrl+B then D detaches tmux; exit leaves SSH
exit

# HOST AGAIN: optional shutdown; stops agents, keeps persistent files
# incus --project collab-ai stop colima-collab-ai:workspace
# incus --project collab-ai stop colima-collab-ai:secured   # if secured_runtime = true
# colima stop collab-ai
```

Expect `Broker: ready`. Run one Codex and one Claude session; additional sessions
need distinct agent IDs. [Login help](docs/sandbox.md#sign-in-and-network-access).
Both agents should read `/usr/local/share/collab-ai/SKILL.md`.

## Dashboards

Run on your host:

```sh
# Agent connections and pending messages (terminal UI)
ssh -t -F infra/incus/ssh/config workspace collab dashboard

# Containers, resources and logs (browser UI)
incus webui colima-collab-ai:  # Linux: incus webui local:
```

For Incus, open the printed URL and select project `collab-ai`.
The collaboration dashboard is read-only; prompts and approvals stay in agent
terminals. [Controls](docs/dashboard.md) · [UI help](docs/sandbox.md#incus-web-ui).

## How it fits together

With `secured_runtime = true`, Codex, Claude and the read-only dashboard run in
**workspace**; **secured** owns one broker and SQLite database.
The shared Unix socket connects them.
`/workspace` and `/home/agent` persist across container replacement.

## Security

Agent commands run inside the container. Host mounts default to read-only;
writes require a dedicated sharing identity. Writable sharing lets agents
change files that you or host automation may later execute.
[Boundaries](docs/sandbox.md#security-can-agents-execute-code-on-my-host).

## Run on your host

No Incus? Follow the [host quick start](docs/quickstart.md) to build and run locally.
These agents have no Incus isolation.

### Resume or fork

[Host commands and compatibility](docs/host-integration.md#codex-terminal).
Sandbox start/resume commands are in the daily block above.

### Set a Codex soft cap

The sandbox aliases are uncapped by default. Use a [named budget](docs/host-integration.md#codex-soft-cap)
for one managed Codex launcher. Reports can arrive late; overshoot is possible.
Claude and shared budgets are not yet covered.

### Claude Code

The sandbox alias is preconfigured. For host sessions, use the
[dedicated channel config](docs/quickstart.md#3-start-claude-code).
Claude requires channel consent and account/organization support.
