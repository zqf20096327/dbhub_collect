### **🌍 [Website](https://reverfin.ai) • [Community](https://community.reverfin.ai)**

### Evolution of Rever

Over a decade of building Virtual CFO practices taught us two things:
Every growing business has non-standard financial processes

Every standard reporting tool struggles to turn them into actionable insights

The result? Fragmented systems. Overburdened accountants. Missed opportunities.
Rever was born to fix this, an AI-enabled Finance Copilot that simplifies, streamlines, and supercharges the modern finance function.

## **Core Features:**

### 🎯 **Key Features of Rever**

1. **Vendor Management**: Create, view, and manage vendor records in a centralized Vendor Master.
   Maintain critical details such as contact info, bank details, and audit history. Designed to eliminate duplicates and ensure consistent data across all transactions.

2. **Purchase Orders (POs)** Easily create and manage purchase orders with structured fields for items, quantities, and pricing.
   POs are stored in a centralized PO Master, enabling tracking, approvals, and integration with bills for seamless procurement-to-payment workflows.

3. **Bill Management & Two-Way Matching** Create bills manually or ingest them via automation (in future versions).
   Bills can be associated with vendor records and compared against POs through a two-way match, verifying quantities and amounts between bill and PO. This improves accuracy and prevents overbilling or mismatched invoices.

4. **Approval Workflows** Integrated approval flows across both bills and POs, allowing teams to route documents
   for review and sign-off before execution.

5. **Audit History** Every action on a bill: creation, updates, approvals are logged in a detailed audit trail.
   This ensures traceability, supports compliance requirements, and aids in internal or external audits.

### 🎯 **Upcoming Features**

   A module to upload, tag, and manage supporting documents like contracts, invoices, and receipts: all linked to POs and bills.

2. **3-Way Matching**
   Go beyond 2-way matching by comparing POs, Bills, and Goods Receipt Notes for tighter control over payments and deliveries.

3. **Request Receipts**
   Let internal teams or external vendors request receipt confirmations, helping close the loop in procurement workflows.

4. **Advanced Analytics**
   Dashboards and insights to visualize spend patterns, approval cycle times, vendor performance, and more.
