Modeling, a query engine, materialization, access control, and an API — the pieces you used to assemble
from five projects — ship as one server, built assuming the first builder or consumer is an
agent.

Write down what your data means, in [Malloy](https://malloydata.dev): the sources, the joins, the
measures, who may see what. The open-source Malloy [skills](skills/) ship alongside, so an agent can do
the writing — build the model, then the dashboards, notebooks, and data apps on top of it.

Publisher serves that model to every surface — over MCP to Claude, Cursor, Codex, or an agent you
build; over REST to applications and BI tools. Agents compose queries against the model instead of
writing SQL from scratch, so there is no wrong join, no invented column, no fan-out that double-counts
but looks plausible — and the same question returns the same numbers tomorrow.

- **Model** — an agent builds the model with the bundled open-source [skills](skills/), from a
  warehouse or a file, and validates each edit without a restart.
- **Analyze** — Claude, Cursor, Codex, or an agent you build asks over MCP; unattended agents and
  applications use REST. Queries are Malloy, legible enough to review at a glance, and run against
  the model, never your raw tables.
- **Surface** — dashboards declared in Malloy and built by dragging tiles if you like, notebooks,
  and no-build HTML data apps, all shipped inside the package, plus the Console for browsing it all.
- **Govern** — givens, `#(authorize)` and `#(access_filter)` decide who may query and who sees what; discovery curation
  decides what is even visible.
- **Optimize** — one `#@ persist` annotation materializes an expensive source into a table and
  `#@ preaggregate` rolls it up, rebuilt on demand or on a schedule.
- **Run anywhere** — DuckDB built in for CSV, Parquet, JSON, and Excel; BigQuery, Snowflake, Postgres,
  Databricks, MotherDuck, and more by connection; `npx`, Docker, or Compose, in minutes.

## Requirements

Node.js 20 or newer (the server refuses to start on anything older and says so). Building from a clone
also needs [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.3.13+. The Docker image carries its own runtime and needs neither.

## Quick start

### Run the examples

```bash
npx @malloy-publisher/server@latest --port 4000
```

Open **http://localhost:4000**. Three example packages are bundled — [`storefront`](examples/storefront)
(a complete ecommerce model), [`governed-analytics`](examples/governed-analytics) (access control), and
[`html-data-app`](examples/html-data-app) (a no-build dashboard) — all DuckDB-backed, no credentials
required. The first run fetches them from GitHub.

## Start from your own data

### Create a package

```bash
mkdir my-data && cd my-data
npm create @malloy-publisher/malloy-package@latest sales
npm start
```

This writes a package to `./sales` — plus, in the current directory, a small workspace: start and
reset scripts, an MCP config, agent instructions, and the Malloy skills as files your agent can read.
`npm start` serves the package in watch mode, so edits take effect as you save. Keep the `@latest`:
without it npm may reuse a cached, older version. The finer points of `npm create` — caching, workspace
layout, the bare `npx` form — are in [docs/scaffolding.md](docs/scaffolding.md).
Agents: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) sections 1 and 2 have the same steps plus the pitfalls around `@latest`,
the `--` before `--data`, and reconnecting the MCP client after the server starts.

### Bring local data files

```bash
npm create @malloy-publisher/malloy-package@latest sales -- --data ./orders.csv
```

CSV, Parquet, JSON, newline-delimited JSON, or Excel `.xlsx` — DuckDB reads all of them in place. The
`--` is required, and the path is relative to where you run the command. A seeded package starts
small: a row count and an overview, which is the moment to point an agent at it.

### Connect a database

A package is just Malloy, so it is not limited to local files. Add a
[connection](docs/connections.md) — BigQuery, Snowflake, Postgres, Databricks, MotherDuck, and more —
and point the model at it; the same workspace serves a warehouse. Have the warehouse but no model yet?
Ask the agent what is in it: `search_database_schema` ranks a connection's tables against a
plain-English description and hands back the `source:` line for each. Ranking needs no API key; the
optional embedding-backed mode is in
[docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md#semantic-ranking-for-search_database_schema).

## Point your agent at it

### Connect Claude Code

Keep the server from [Quick start](#quick-start) running — or `npm start` from
[Create a package](#create-a-package). On startup it wrote a `.mcp.json` into the directory you ran it
in, pointing at the MCP port it bound. Open a second terminal, **in that same directory**, and start
the agent:

```bash
claude
```

Say yes when the agent asks to trust the folder, use the server it found, and approve the first tool
call — the trust prompt is asked once per directory, and only interactively, so a headless run can't
clear it. Then ask, in plain English:

> _"Use Malloy to explore the storefront sales data and chart revenue by category."_

The agent discovers what exists (`get_context`), grounds itself in real source, view, and field
names, runs the query (`execute_query`), and answers from your model — no schema spelunking, no
hallucinated columns.

If the agent reports no Malloy tools, register the server for yourself instead of relying on that
file:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http malloy http://127.0.0.1:4040/mcp -s user
```

The server skips writing the file in some directories (a git working tree, your home directory, one
that already has a `.mcp.json`) and says so in its startup log. When it is written, why it can go
stale, and how to turn it off:
[docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md#the-mcpjson-the-server-writes).

### Other clients, and unattended agents

Cursor, VS Code, Codex, and Claude Desktop take the same endpoint — `http://localhost:4040/mcp`,
or whatever `--mcp_port` / `MCP_PORT` you set — through their own config; see
[docs/ai-agents.md](docs/ai-agents.md). An agent working unattended that started the server itself uses
the same loop over REST:

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  http://localhost:4000/api/v0/environments/examples/packages/storefront/models/storefront.malloy/query \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"run: order_items -> by_category","compactJson":true}' | jq -r .result
```

The running server serves its full OpenAPI spec at `http://localhost:4000/api-doc.yaml`.

> **Security.** The server — MCP and REST alike — is stateless and unauthenticated, and it can read any
> data your models connect to. Bind it to loopback (`--host 127.0.0.1`) for local use, and put an
> authenticating gateway in front before exposing it more widely.

## What you can do

### Model

- **Build the model with an agent.** The bundled open-source [skills](skills/) carry the whole loop —
  discover what a database holds, define sources and measures, model as you go, review, document,
  publish. A LookML review skill covers coming from Looker.
- **Start from a warehouse.** `search_database_schema` ranks a connection's tables against a
  plain-English description and returns the `source:` line for each.
- **Validate without a restart.** `compile_model` checks an edit without running it;
  `reload_package` recompiles a package from disk. Watch mode does the same for a human editing
  in an IDE.

### Analyze

- **Ask in plain English.** An agent grounds itself with `get_context`, runs
  `execute_query`, and answers from the model, never from raw tables. Analysis skills teach it the
  pitfalls and how to write up a finding — [docs/ai-agents.md](docs/ai-agents.md).
- **Work in notebooks.** `.malloynb` notebooks live inside a package, mix prose and queries, and run on
  the same governed endpoints — [docs/choosing-a-surface.md](docs/choosing-a-surface.md).
- **Explore, no code.** Build and drill into queries visually with [Malloy Explorer](docs/explorer.md);
  every action generates valid Malloy, so metrics stay correct across joins.

### Surface

- **Dashboards declared in Malloy.** A `dashboards/*.malloy` file _is_ the dashboard: filterable,
  clickable, grid-laid-out, no code and no build step. Build it by dragging tiles around a grid in
  the Console if you want the classic feel, or write the tags by hand — same file either way, and it
  reviews like any other source file — [docs/dashboards.md](docs/dashboards.md).
- **No-build HTML data apps.** Ship HTML, CSS, and JavaScript inside a package and Publisher hosts it
  against the model — [docs/html-data-apps.md](docs/html-data-apps.md).
- **The Publisher Console.** Browse packages, models, and every artifact in the built-in web UI, with
  your own [colors, fonts, and dark mode](docs/theming.md) — [docs/console.md](docs/console.md).
- **Your own applications.** The REST API serves any language, and the running server publishes its
  OpenAPI spec. From Python, the standard library is enough: [AGENTS.md section 7](AGENTS.md#7-working-unattended-the-rest-api)
  has a copyable example. A generated client lives in [`packages/python-client`](packages/python-client),
  but it is not published to PyPI.

### Govern

- **Decide who sees what.** [Givens](docs/givens.md) declare runtime parameters and drive filter
  widgets; [row-level access](docs/row-level-access.md) and [`#(access_filter)`](docs/authorize.md) gate
  which rows a caller gets and whether they may query a source at all.
- **Decide what is visible.** Curate what is [discoverable and queryable](docs/discovery-and-access.md)
  separately, so an agent sees only the sources you meant it to.
- **Know the boundary.** [docs/security-posture.md](docs/security-posture.md) lists what Publisher
  defends against and what it leaves to the gateway in front of it.

### Optimize

- **Materialize.** One `#@ persist` annotation turns an expensive source into a table, rebuilt on
  demand, from the `malloy-pub` CLI, or on a cron with the opt-in scheduler —
  [docs/materialization.md](docs/materialization.md).
- **Pre-aggregate.** `#@ preaggregate` rolls a measure up to a coarse grain so covered queries read a
  small table instead of the fact table — [docs/preaggregation.md](docs/preaggregation.md).
- **Store it where you like.** Persist into a [DuckLake](docs/ducklake.md) storage tier, attach a
  DuckLake catalog read-only, and run offline or air-gapped —
  [docs/persist-storage-tutorial.md](docs/persist-storage-tutorial.md).
- **Attribute every query.** [Query metadata](docs/query-metadata.md) tags each statement with a team,
  a workload, a request id, so the warehouse's own reporting can say who asked.

### Run anywhere

- **Any data.** DuckDB is built in for CSV, Parquet, JSON, and Excel; connect BigQuery, Snowflake,
  Postgres, MySQL, Trino, Databricks, MotherDuck, and DuckLake — [docs/connections.md](docs/connections.md).
- **Any host.** `npx`, Docker, or Docker Compose, in minutes — [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md).
- **Alongside dbt.** Where Malloy and dbt fit together, and the plan to close the gaps —
  [docs/dbt-roadmap.md](docs/dbt-roadmap.md).

## Examples

The fastest way to see all of the above is the [`examples/`](examples/) directory. Three are packages
Publisher serves out of the box, and a fourth shows the SDK:

- **[storefront](examples/storefront)** — the flagship ecommerce model: sources, joins, dashboards, a
  notebook, and givens-driven filters. It is the package Quick start serves, and the one the SDK
  example reads from.
- **[governed-analytics](examples/governed-analytics)** — the whole governance story in one small
  package: givens, row-level access, and `#(access_filter)` source gates.
- **[html-data-app](examples/html-data-app)** — a no-build SaaS subscriptions dashboard served from
  a package's `public/` directory, driven by `Publisher.query()`.
- **[data-app](examples/data-app)** — a standalone Vite + React app on
  [`@malloy-publisher/sdk`](packages/sdk), embedding live results in your own UI. Not a served
  package.

## Documentation

The [`docs/`](docs/) folder is the reference hub; start at its [index](docs/README.md). Beyond the
guides linked above: [architecture](docs/architecture.md) for how the pieces fit together,
[api-overview](docs/api-overview.md) for the REST and MCP surface, [packages](docs/packages.md) for
the package format (`publisher.json`, models, data), and the
[Docker runtime deep-dive](packages/server/README.docker.md) for image layout, environment, and
tuning. The complete user guide also lives at
**[docs.malloydata.dev](https://docs.malloydata.dev/documentation/user_guides/publishing/publishing)**.

## Publisher and Credible

Publisher is created and maintained by [Credible](https://www.credibledata.com), the company behind
the **AI Analytics Engine**. The two fit together like this:

- **Publisher is the open-source analytics engine.** It serves Malloy models over REST and MCP, and everything
  an agent needs from the language and the server — the modeling and analysis skills, the MCP tools —
  ships here in the open. Run it on a laptop, in Docker, or wherever you like.
- **Credible is the hosted, governed engine built around it.** You write down what your data means
  once, in Malloy; the engine owns the how — it materializes and indexes the model in storage it
  brings along, enforces access at one gateway on every query, compresses each model into a concept
  index so an agent gets just the slice a question needs, and serves every surface — agents over MCP,
  dashboards and workspaces, the data apps and APIs in your product — from one model.

Run Publisher yourself, or let Credible run it: the model is the same Malloy either way, and moving
between them is a publish, not a rewrite. Where the open-source engine ends and the hosted one begins:
