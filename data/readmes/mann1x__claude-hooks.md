# claude-hooks

Cross-platform Claude Code hooks that auto-recall from **Qdrant** + **Memory KG**
on every prompt and write findings back at the end of the turn.

Install once at the **user level** and every Claude Code session gets
deterministic memory recall + storage — no per-project init, no model
forgetting. Beyond the core:

- **v0.5+** — transparent `api.anthropic.com` proxy with stats DB +
  dashboard + behavior canaries
- **v0.6+** — in-process Python AST code-graph (with optional
  tree-sitter / MCP-server / clustering extras)
- **v0.7+** — session-scoped LSP engine + opt-in ruff PostToolUse hook
- **v0.8+** — Caliber grounding proxy + shared `agent_loop.runner`
- **v1.0** — daemon-first hook execution, stable skill surface,
  pgvector backup + validity canary stack
- **v1.1** — two LLM-to-LLM advisory features built on
  `agent_loop.runner`:
  - **`/get-advice`** — single-model second-opinion advisor talking
    to a configured Ollama backend with project-grounded tool
    access. Multi-turn, effort-budgeted, tool-filtered.
    See [`docs/get-advice.md`](docs/get-advice.md).
  - **`/consultants`** — multi-agent **council** (planner →
    researcher → critic → synthesizer) with full per-role
    LLM-message-history persistence in `transcript.db`, so a
    follow-up against a session reopened from disk produces an
    answer indistinguishable from a still-warm one. **Every role can
    call tools**, not just the researcher — so the critic verifies a
    `path:line` instead of taking the researcher's word for it, and
    reports a `CORRECTIONS:` block when the two disagree. Measured
    cheaper *and* more accurate than the researcher-only surface
    (−30% prompt tokens, and 100% vs 0% detection of false research
    claims — see
    [`benchmarks/consultants/results/2026-08-01/`](benchmarks/consultants/results/2026-08-01/)). Multi-model
    fan-out at `xmedium`/`xhigh`/`xmax` effort tiers, multi-critic
    consensus with meta-critic combine at `xmax`, synthesizer
    failure-fallback model chain, and a degraded-answer composer
    that surfaces the researcher + critic work even when the
    synthesizer can't compose. See
    [`docs/consultants.md`](docs/consultants.md) for the runbook,
    [`docs/consultants-roles.md`](docs/consultants-roles.md) for the
    role-by-role reference (all 6 active roles, including the
    opt-in `tool_executor` + `coder`), and
    the [benchmark index](docs/benchmarks/index.md) for the cloud-model
    evaluation suite (council-role sweeps, coder, per-language
    incl. the `coder_easy` bank — 30 problems × 6 languages = 180
    questions emitted by `benchmarks/consultants/gen_coder_easy.py`,
    graded through `benchmarks/consultants/oracles_mlang.py` —
    tool-executor, stall, and caliber-eval — each with its grading
    protocol).
- **v1.2** — caliber-grounding-proxy cloud-resilience port +
  in-repo caliber-eval cohort at
  [`docs/caliber-eval-results/`](docs/caliber-eval-results/). Verdict:
  `claude-cli` stays the default for caliber init, `glm-5.1:cloud`
  is the recommended non-claude-cli fallback.
- **v1.3** — collapses the per-verb slash-command skills into two
  **dispatcher skills**: `/get-advice <verb>` (verbs:
  `ask`/`model`/`effort`/`tools`) and `/consultants <verb>` (verbs:
  `ask`/`followup`/`list`/`show`/`config`) with implicit `ask`
  default. Cuts the upfront slash-command menu cost from 9 entries
  to 2.
- **v1.4** — adds **mozilla-ai/llamafile** as a fallback-capable
  embedding engine for the `pgvector` + `sqlite_vec` providers,
  supervised by the daemon (spawn-on-demand, 5-min idle reap).
  Installer learns embedder dialogs for sqlite_vec and validate-only
  connectivity reports for qdrant/memory-kg. See
  [`docs/llamafile-integration.md`](docs/llamafile-integration.md).
- **v1.5** — extends the llamafile integration to the
  **chat-completion side**: HyDE / reflect / consolidate /
  get-advice / consultants / caliber-grounding-proxy can route to
  a daemon-supervised local llamafile via a new
  `llamafile://<label>` model-identifier prefix. Multi-instance
  `ChatModelManager` (LRU evict, per-label idle reap, CPU
  fallback), `claude-hooks-models` CLI. See
  [`docs/llamafile-chat-models.md`](docs/llamafile-chat-models.md).
- **v1.7** — brings the `sqlite_vec` provider to **full pgvector
  parity**: hybrid recall (RRF over vector cosine + BM25 via
  FTS5), idempotent `store` on whitespace-normalised
  `content_hash`, and a complete knowledge-graph surface
  (`kg_create_entities` / `kg_add_observations` /
  `kg_create_relations` / `kg_search_nodes`). The `sqlite-vec-mcp`
  launcher grows from 3 to 8 tools (full pgvector-mcp parity).
  See [`docs/sqlite-vec-runbook.md`](docs/sqlite-vec-runbook.md).
- **v2 `/consultants` engine (post-v1.7, on `dev`)** — six-role
  council (`planner`, `researcher` w/ optional PLAN-REPORT split,
  `critic`, `synthesizer`, opt-in `tool_executor`, opt-in `coder`),
  LangGraph-`Send` x-tier multi-model fan-out with proper
  composition under tool_executor (M11c-3), opt-in BaseStore-backed
  cross-session memory (M8) with per-namespace TTL + Caliber-style
  distillation-on-expiry (M14), and a CitationLinter that verifies
  every `path:line` claim before the answer leaves the council
  (#204 / #205 / #207). Default-off opt-ins: see
  [`docs/consultants-roles.md`](docs/consultants-roles.md) for
  what to enable per question shape.
- **Next cut (on `dev`, tentatively ~v1.13.0 — release trigger
  pending)** — two additive, **default-OFF** feature lines on top of the
  v2 engine, each M12 cohort-2 parity-guarded:
  - **`/consultants` dynamic adversarial review** — harden a council
    answer against the *wrong-but-plausible* failure mode: an engine
    **adversary checkpoint** (pause before synthesis for an
    assistant-authored red-team brief; auto-resumes on timeout), an
    automated post-synthesis **adversary role**, a live **critic dial**
    (`lax`/`normal`/`strict`/`adversarial` + a free-text attack focus),
    and a skeptic-panel **`verify_budget`** — plus a committed
    **Workflow-driven council**
    ([`.claude/workflows/consult-with-adversarial-review.mjs`](.claude/workflows/consult-with-adversarial-review.mjs))
    that pipelines *ask → review → skeptic-panel → accept|follow-up*.
    Runbook + worked configure/invoke recipes in
    [`docs/consultants.md`](docs/consultants.md).
  - **Per-project `/consultants` config scope** — a
    `<project>/.claude-hooks/consultants.toml` is now the consistently
    applied **active config** across every `config` command *and* the
    engine, governed by a per-project-only **`override_user_global`**
    directive (auto write-scope, with `--user`/`--project`/`--cwd` to
    override on any `config set-*`, plus a new project-scoped
    `config set-override-user-global on|off` verb). The real file is
    gitignored (it carries host-specific secrets); a placeholder-only
    [`.claude-hooks/consultants.example.toml`](.claude-hooks/consultants.example.toml)
    template is committed.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mann1x/claude-hooks.git
cd claude-hooks
python3 install.py
```

The installer auto-detects your MCP servers, creates the config, and wires
hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json`. Open a new Claude Code session and
you'll see:

> _Started with claude-hooks recall enabled (2 provider(s): Qdrant, Memory KG)._

Check `~/.claude/claude-hooks.log` to confirm hooks are firing.

For the full playbook — LAN-shared proxy setup, systemd unit, statusline
wiring, monitoring, uninstall — see [`docs/deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md).

### Releases & versioning

- Current version: **v1.12.0** — see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full history,
  or [`docs/whats-new.md`](docs/whats-new.md) for the human-readable
  v1.7 highlights (older releases archived alongside:
  [v1.4](docs/whats-new-v1.4.md),
  [v1.1](docs/whats-new-v1.1.md)). Significant unreleased work
  on `dev` since v1.7.0: `/consultants` v2 (M8 store, M11c-3
  proper composition, M14 TTL+distillation, CitationLinter) and the
  next-cut feature lines above — dynamic adversarial review
  (checkpoint / role / critic dial / verify budget + Workflow-driven
  council) and per-project config scope (`override_user_global`). The
  cut (tentatively ~v1.13.0) is triggered manually when ready.
- Tagged releases live on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mann1x/claude-hooks/releases) with auto-generated `Source code (zip / tar.gz)` archives.
- Branch model: `main` is the release branch (every commit shippable, tags live here); `dev` is the working branch (feature work + fixes land here first). See [`docs/RELEASING.md`](docs/RELEASING.md) for the cut procedure.
- To track unreleased work: `git log v1.7.0..origin/dev` after fetching.
- **Optional self-update check** (opt-in via `install.py` or
  `update_check.enabled = true`): the daemon polls
  `https://api.github.com/repos/mann1x/claude-hooks/releases/latest`
  at most once every 24 hours and the Stop hook surfaces a one-line
  notice when a newer tag is available. Fails silently on timeouts,
  retries 5× at 5-minute intervals before deferring to the next
  24-hour window, caps notifications at 10 per release, and can be
  disabled at runtime by flipping `update_check.enabled` in
  `config/claude-hooks.json`.

## Features

### Core (v0.1)
- **Stdlib only** for the core (Qdrant + Memory KG providers, hooks, dispatcher) — no `pip install` needed. Optional features (pgvector, sqlite-vec, code-graph, MCP server, clustering) pull in their own deps via the `[code-graph]` / `[clustering]` / `[mcp-server]` extras.
- **Python 3.10+**, runs identically on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **Auto-detection** of MCP servers from `~/.claude.json`
- **Plugin model**: each memory backend is one file (qdrant, memory_kg, pgvector, sqlite_vec)
- **OpenWolf integration**: injects Do-Not-Repeat and recent bugs from `.wolf/` projects
- **Non-blocking**: every hook exits 0 even on failure

### Intelligence (v0.2)
- **HyDE query expansion** -- generates a hypothetical answer via Ollama before
  searching Qdrant, dramatically improving recall quality. Falls back to raw
  prompt if Ollama is unavailable.
- **Attention decay** -- memories that haven't been recalled recently fade;
  frequently useful ones strengthen. Tracks history in a JSON file.
- **Memory dedup** -- before storing, checks for near-duplicates using text
  similarity. Prevents Qdrant from accumulating redundant entries.
- **Observation classification** -- tags stored memories as `fix`, `preference`,
  `decision`, `gotcha`, or `general` for better downstream filtering.
- **Compact recall** -- when Claude Code compacts context, the SessionStart hook
  re-injects full recalled memory so the model recovers what it lost.
- **Instinct extraction** -- when a bug-fix pattern is detected (error -> edit),
  auto-extracts it as a reusable markdown instinct file under `~/.claude/instincts/`.
- **Progressive disclosure** -- optional: inject only the first line of each memory
  with a char-count hint, cutting injected context by ~3-5x.
- **`/reflect` synthesis** -- CLI command that analyzes recent memories for
  recurring patterns and generates CLAUDE.md rules. Uses Ollama.
- **Autonomous consolidation** -- CLI command to find duplicates, compress old
  memories, and prune stale ones. Uses Ollama.

### Proxy / observability (v0.5+)

- **Local HTTP proxy** in front of `api.anthropic.com` ([`docs/proxy.md`](docs/proxy.md))
  that Claude Code hooks can't see on their own. Opt-in via
  `config/claude-hooks.json`. **`install.py` orchestrates the per-OS
  service** — pick "Use the API proxy?" → either `[1]` install locally
  (systemd unit on Linux, `LaunchAgent` on macOS, UAC-elevated scheduled
  task on Windows) or `[2]` point at an existing proxy on the LAN
  (writes `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` into `~/.claude/settings.json` for you).
- **Warmup short-circuit** (`proxy.block_warmup: true`) — drops the
  subagent-Warmup token drain ([`anthropics/claude-code#47922`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/47922))
  without the all-or-nothing side-effects of
  `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS`. Returns a spec-compliant stub
  (JSON or SSE) so CC never sees an error. The proxy recognises **two
  distinct drain patterns** and blocks both under the same flag:

  | Pattern | Signature (`claude_hooks/proxy/metadata.py`) | What it is |
  |---|---|---|
  | **CLI "Warmup"** | `first_user_text == "Warmup"` | The keepalive Claude Code sends every few turns to keep the context hot. Cheap per-request but runs thousands of times per day. Classic token drain. |
  | **SDK-CLI subagent priming** | `cc_entrypoint == "sdk-cli"` AND `agent_type == "subagent"` AND `num_messages == 1` | The Agent SDK's priming message when a subagent boots. Single user turn, no "Warmup" literal, so it looks like a real prompt to a naïve filter — but it's the same "init the context" intent, just from the SDK-CLI entrypoint. Historically slipped past the old `first_user_text` check and amplified 300M+ cache reads/day on subagent-heavy workflows. |

  Both map to `is_warmup=True` in request metadata and are blocked
  identically when `block_warmup` is on. The dashboard's
  *warmups_blocked* counter aggregates them; `scripts/proxy_stats.py
  --show-sidechain` breaks them out.

  > **Update 2026-04-28** — the literal `"Warmup"` priming call no
  > longer appears in proxy logs starting with Claude Code **2.1.121**
  > (60 blocks on 04-27 → 0 on 04-28 across 1,300+ requests, on a host
  > with no proxy config change). The detector is unchanged; the
  > traffic itself is absent. We're keeping `block_warmup: true` on
  > as a safety net in case the pattern returns. See
  > [`docs/issue-warmup-token-drain.md`](docs/issue-warmup-token-drain.md#update--2026-04-28-warmup-traffic-disappeared)
  > for the per-day evidence and the upstream issue thread.
- **Live weekly-limit %** — proxy captures Anthropic's
  `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*` headers into a rolling state file;
  the dashboard and `scripts/weekly_token_usage.py --current-usage-pct`
  read it. (The status line reads Claude Code's own `rate_limits`
  instead — see [`docs/statusline.md`](docs/statusline.md).)
- **Structured observations** (port from thedotmack/claude-mem) —
  `hooks.stop.summary_format: "xml"` stores memories as
  `<observation><type><title><files_modified>…` so downstream recall
  can filter by type without prose parsing.
- **Metadata-gated rerank** — `hooks.user_prompt_submit.metadata_filter`
  filters candidates by cwd / type / age / tags before vector rerank.
- **Caliber grounding proxy** ([`docs/caliber-proxy.md`](docs/caliber-proxy.md))
  — local OpenAI-compat HTTP server that augments [caliber](https://github.com/caliber-ai-org/ai-setup)
  with project grounding so `caliber init`/`refresh` cite real `path:line`
  references instead of hallucinated ones. Paired with `bin/caliber-smart`
  as a drop-in `caliber` wrapper that falls back to claude-cli when the
  proxy is down.

  > ⚠️ The shipped `bin/caliber-grounding-proxy` defaults
  > `CALIBER_GROUNDING_UPSTREAM=http://192.168.178.2:11433/v1` — the
  > author's home-LAN Ollama proxy. **Override via the systemd drop-in
  > or shell environment** for your install (see the linked doc).

  Caliber-proxy listens on **port 38090** by default
  (`caliber_proxy.listen_port` in `config/claude-hooks.json`). The
  matching `bin/caliber-smart` wrapper makes `caliber refresh` /
  `caliber init` use the proxy when it's up and fall through to a
  vanilla `caliber` invocation otherwise. The native-tools agent
  loop is in `claude_hooks/caliber_proxy/server.py`; design notes for
  picking a small grounding model live in
  [`docs/gemma4-tool-use-notes.md`](docs/gemma4-tool-use-notes.md).

#### Stats DB + dashboard + behavior canaries

The proxy is more than a forwarder. Every request is parsed for
metadata (`effort`, `model_requested`, `model_delivered`, `service_tier`,
`beta_features`, thinking signature bytes, per-tool counts) and rolled
up into a SQLite stats DB. A read-only HTTP dashboard renders the
state, and an opt-in stop-phrase scanner adds behavior-quality canaries
on top:

- **Stats DB** — schema v5 at `~/.claude/claude-hooks-proxy/stats.db`,
  populated by `scripts/proxy_rollup.py` running every 5 min
  (`claude-hooks-rollup.timer`). Per-request `requests` table feeds
  daily / session / model / agent rollups; the same path persists S3
  thinking-depth and S4 per-tool-name canary counts.
- **Dashboard** — read-only HTTP view on **port 38081** (config:
  `proxy_dashboard.listen_port`). Renders today's request count,
  cache hit-rate, rate-limit utilisation, thinking metrics, tool-use
  canaries, behavior canaries, per-day rollups, agent / model
  breakdowns, beta-feature drift, and the
  **`stop-phrases × effort × date`** table that pinned the 2026-05-01
  `xhigh` quality regression in [`docs/cc-xhigh-regression-issue.md`](docs/cc-xhigh-regression-issue.md):

  ![sp-effort dashboard panel](docs/images/sp-effort-xhigh-regression-2026-05-01.png)

  Run `bin/claude-hooks-dashboard` for a one-shot start, or install
  the `claude-hooks-dashboard.service` systemd unit (the proxy
  installer wires it for you). Restart with `systemctl restart
  claude-hooks-dashboard.service` after a code change.
- **In-stream `stop_phrase_guard`** (`proxy.scan_stop_phrases: true`)
  — scans every assistant turn against the
  [stellaraccident #42796](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42796)
  canary phrases (`config/stop_phrases.yaml`, ~8 categories:
  ownership-dodging, permission-seeking, premature-stopping,
  known-limitation labeling, session-length excuses, simplest-fix
  bias, reasoning-reversal, self-admitted error). Hits land in the
  `sp_*` columns of the stats DB and roll up by day, by effort, and
  by category. Rates per-1k requests show whether a route or a model
  variant has drifted in quality without you noticing the symptoms
  one turn at a time.
- **Daily health line** — `claude-hooks-health.timer` fires once a
  day (default 09:07 UTC, after rollups have digested the morning's
  traffic) and runs `scripts/proxy_health_oneliner.py`. The script
  emits a single line summarising request counts, 5xx / 429 totals,
  and per-effort `ownD` / `permS` rates with a `↑` arrow when today
  is ≥ 2× the prior 7-day baseline. Output appended to
  `~/.claude/proxy-health-daily.log` and the journal.

For the full schema, query patterns, and dashboard route inventory
see [`docs/proxy.md`](docs/proxy.md). For the upstream-facing PR /
incident drafts that came out of the proxy data, see
[`docs/issue-warmup-token-drain.md`](docs/issue-warmup-token-drain.md)
and [`docs/cc-xhigh-regression-issue.md`](docs/cc-xhigh-regression-issue.md).

### Code graph (v0.6+)

A built-in, file-based code-structure graph (`graphify-out/graph.json`
+ `GRAPH_REPORT.md`) auto-built per project. Stdlib-only Python `ast`
extractor; opt-in `[code-graph]` extra adds tree-sitter parsing for
JS/TS/Go/Rust/Java/Ruby. SessionStart injects a 2-3 KB structural
summary; per-Grep `code_graph_lookup_enabled` adds one-line "X is at
file:line, N callers" hints when the pattern looks like an identifier.

CLI subcommands (`python -m claude_hooks.code_graph ...`):

| Command | What |
|---|---|
| `build` | Walk the tree, extract symbols + calls + imports, write graph.json + GRAPH_REPORT.md |
| `info` | Print the graph's stats (file/node/edge counts, by-language) |
| `impact <symbol>` | Transitive callers + callees of a symbol (blast radius before refactoring) |
| `changes [--base REF]` | Blast-radius report for the current `git diff` (pre-commit / PR sanity check) |
| `trace <entrypoint>` | Forward call-chain trace from an entry function ("how does X flow through the system?") |
| `mermaid [--center SYM]` | Render a Mermaid module-map or local subgraph diagram |
| `clusters` | Detect functional communities in the call graph (Louvain when `[clustering]` extra installed; file-based fallback otherwise) |
| `companions` | Show detection state for axon + gitnexus + the local code graph |

Optional extras:

- **`pip install claude-hooks[code-graph]`** — `tree-sitter-language-pack` for multi-language parsing.
- **`pip install claude-hooks[clustering]`** — `python-louvain` + `networkx` for Leiden-style community detection.
- **`pip install claude-hooks[mcp-server]`** — `mcp[cli]` to spin up an MCP server (`python -m claude_hooks.code_graph.mcp_server`) exposing the lookup/impact/changes/trace/mermaid/companions tools to any MCP client (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.).

### Companion code-graph engines

When you want richer queries than the built-in `code_graph` provides,
claude-hooks integrates with two heavier engines as **opt-in companion
tools** (silent no-op when absent):

- **[axon](https://github.com/harshkedia177/axon)** (RECOMMENDED for Python/JS/TS) — `pip install axoniq`,
  KuzuDB-backed, dead-code detection, file watcher, 7 MCP tools.
- **[gitnexus](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus)** (ALTERNATIVE for 14 languages or multi-repo) — `npm i -g gitnexus`,
  LadybugDB-backed, hybrid BM25+vector+RRF search, multi-repo `group_*` tools, 16 MCP tools.

claude-hooks detects either via filesystem checks (binary on PATH +
per-project marker dir + global registry), appends a `mcp__axon__*` /
`mcp__gitnexus__*` hint to the SessionStart inject, and spawns the
appropriate `analyze` on Stop when the turn modified files. Both can
coexist; both reindex paths fire when their respective marker dirs
are present. See [`COMPANION_TOOLS.md`](COMPANION_TOOLS.md) §6-7 for
the install + comparison matrix.

The built-in `code_graph` always runs as the floor; the companions
upgrade specific dimensions (live MCP queries, dead-code detection,
multi-language coverage) when present.

### IDE-style feedback loop (v0.7+)

Closes the "I didn't notice the import error until I ran the code"
gap. Three complementary layers — pick one or stack them:

- **`PostToolUse` ruff hook** (built-in, on by default) — runs `ruff
  check` on every Python file Claude Code edits with `Edit` / `Write` /
  `MultiEdit`. Diagnostics are injected as
  `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` so the model sees them in the
  very next prompt — before claiming the change is done. ~50 ms cold,
  catches undefined names, unused imports, syntax errors, etc. Config
  under `hooks.post_tool_use` in `config/claude-hooks.json`. Pairs
  with a `toml_comment_advisor` that nudges Claude to leave a
  `# why: …` line above any non-default value when editing
  hand-edited TOMLs (`.claude-hooks/`, `lsp-engine.toml`) — config
  under `hooks.post_tool_use.toml_comment_advisor_enabled` (default
  on) and `toml_comment_advisor_paths` (default
  `[".claude-hooks/", "lsp-engine.toml"]`).
- **cclsp** (recommended companion, opt-in) — multi-language LSP
  wrapper that fronts pyright / gopls / rust-analyzer / clangd /
  OmniSharp via a single MCP server. Gives Claude Code on-demand
  hover, go-to-definition, find-references, and type diagnostics
  across Python / Go / Rust / C/C++ / C#. See [`docs/lsp-mcp.md`](docs/lsp-mcp.md)
  for the install + Linux/Windows config. Pairs with the ruff hook:
  ruff is the cheap synchronous Python layer, cclsp is the
  multi-language on-demand layer.

#### LSP engine (opt-in, v0.7+)

A session-scoped daemon that loads language servers **once per
project** and follows Claude Code's edits in real time, so
diagnostics queries return in single-digit milliseconds instead of
the 1–3 s pyright cold-start every cclsp call pays. Phases 0–4
shipped (config + lifecycle, daemon + session-affinity locks,
adaptive preload + git watcher, opt-in compile-aware diagnostics,
Windows IPC parity). See [`docs/lsp-engine.md`](docs/lsp-engine.md)
for the user guide and [`docs/PLAN-lsp-engine.md`](docs/PLAN-lsp-engine.md)
for the locked design.

| Phase | What |
|-------|------|
| **Foundations (P0)** | TOML config (`.claude-hooks/lsp-engine.toml`), per-language `LspChild` wrapper, schema validation. Per-project + per-language opt-in. |
| **Daemon + locks (P1)** | Long-lived `claude_hooks.lsp_engine.daemon` per project. UNIX socket IPC (POSIX) / named pipes (Windows). Per-file session-affinity locks serialise multi-session edits cleanly. |
| **Preload + git (P2)** | Adaptive preload of the code-graph hot set warms the LSP index before the first query. Polling git watcher bulk-refreshes open files on branch switch. |
| **Compile-aware (P3)** | Opt-in `[compile_aware.commands]` block merges `cargo check` / `tsc --noEmit` / `mypy` / `go vet` diagnostics on top of the LSP layer. Run `/setup-compile-aware` for a guided proposal of the per-language commands. |
| **Windows parity + bench (P4)** | `multiprocessing.connection.Listener(family="AF_PIPE")` backend, `msvcrt.locking` daemon lock, latency benchmarks. **0.25 ms p50 IPC**, ~13 ms p99 — IPC overhead is 0.1 % of pyright's 280 ms analysis time. Run `python scripts/bench_lsp_engine.py` for a fresh measurement. |

The engine is independent of the `PostToolUse` ruff hook and the
`cclsp` MCP server; you can run all three or any subset.

### Slash command — `/setup-compile-aware`

Proposes a `[compile_aware.commands]` block for
`.claude-hooks/lsp-engine.toml` by detecting build tools in the
current project (Cargo.toml → `cargo`, tsconfig.json → `tsc`,
pyproject.toml + mypy → `mypy`, go.mod → `go vet`, Makefile, …).
Run this once after enabling the engine to wire the compile-aware
layer; it asks for explicit confirmation before writing.

### Scripts

| Script | What |
|---|---|
| `scripts/status.py` | At-a-glance dashboard: systemd state, current rate-limit %, today's Warmup-blocked count. `--json` for scripting. |
| `scripts/weekly_token_usage.py` | Per-day token breakdown against a custom weekly-reset window (default Fri 10:00 CEST). Auto-populates `%Limit` from the proxy. `--show-sidechain` reveals the Warmup share. |
| `scripts/proxy_stats.py` | Ad-hoc proxy-log summaries (per-day requests, Warmup-blocked savings, synthetic-rate-limit detection, per-model counts). `--json` for scripting. |
| `scripts/proxy_rollup.py` | Ingest the proxy's daily JSONL files into `stats.db` (rollups + per-request rows). Driven by `claude-hooks-rollup.timer` (every 5 min, persistent across reboots). |
| `scripts/proxy_health_oneliner.py` | One-line daily health summary: per-effort `ownD`/`permS` rates, model divergences, 4xx/5xx, with `↑` arrows for ≥2× baseline regressions. Driven by `claude-hooks-health.timer`. |
| `scripts/statusline_usage.py` | Usage segment (5h / 7d %) from Claude Code's status-line `rate_limits`. Safe-by-design (never crashes the caller). |
| `scripts/statusline_compose.py` | Complete `statusLine` command: project, context %, model, 5h / 7d usage and an unread-mail badge. No proxy needed; see [`docs/statusline.md`](docs/statusline.md). |
| `scripts/bench_recall.py` | End-to-end recall latency benchmark across the configured providers. p50/p90/p99 + per-stage breakdown. |
| `scripts/bench_lsp_engine.py` | LSP engine vs ruff-only baseline. Measures `did_change` IPC-only and full round-trip (with diagnostics). Use after a new pyright / engine release. |
| `scripts/migrate_to_pgvector.py` | One-shot dump-and-load from Qdrant or Memory KG into the pgvector backend, with delta sync. See [`docs/pgvector-runbook.md`](docs/pgvector-runbook.md). |
| `scripts/episodic_doctor.py` | Checks that episodic-memory's host-built native Node modules (better-sqlite3) load; `--rebuild` rebuilds the ones that don't after a Node major upgrade. See [`docs/episodic-server.md`](docs/episodic-server.md). |
| `scripts/install-caliber-hook.sh` | Installs the Caliber pre-commit hook into the current repo so agent configs stay in sync. |
| `scripts/openwolfstatus.{py,sh,bat}` | OpenWolf status utility. |

### `bin/` shim reference

The `bin/` directory ships small entry-point shims that auto-detect
the conda env and fall back to system Python. Use these from
`settings.json` hooks, systemd `ExecStart` lines, or the shell.

| Shim | What |
|---|---|
| `bin/claude-hook` | Hook dispatcher. Called from `~/.claude/settings.json` for every event; routes to the matching handler under `claude_hooks/hooks/`. POSIX (`claude-hook`) and Windows (`claude-hook.cmd`) variants. |
| `bin/claude-hooks-daemon` | Foreground entry to the long-lived hook executor (`claude_hooks.daemon`). Use under systemd or for debugging. |
| `bin/claude-hooks-daemon-ctl` | Daemon ctl: `status` / `restart` / `kill` against the live daemon socket. |
| `bin/claude-hooks-proxy` | Foreground entry to the API proxy (`claude_hooks.proxy.server`). |
| `bin/claude-hooks-dashboard` | Foreground entry to the read-only stats dashboard (port 38081). |
| `bin/claude-hooks-rollup` | One-shot proxy-log → stats.db ingester. Wired to `claude-hooks-rollup.timer`. |
| `bin/claude-hook-pgvector-mcp` | System-wide stdio MCP server that exposes pgvector recall + KG ops. Lets Cursor / Codex / OpenWebUI use the same Postgres store as Claude Code. Registered in `~/.claude.json` by `install.py` when pgvector is enabled. |
| `bin/caliber-grounding-proxy` | Foreground entry to the Caliber grounding proxy (port 38090). |
| `bin/caliber-smart` | Drop-in `caliber` wrapper that uses the proxy when up, falls through otherwise. |
| `bin/_resolve_python.sh` | Internal helper sourced by every shim to find the right Python. |

### systemd unit reference

`systemd/` ships the unit templates the proxy installer drops into
`/etc/systemd/system/`. Each is `User=root` by default; adjust the
`User=` and `WorkingDirectory=` lines for your install. Linux only;
macOS uses `LaunchAgents`, Windows uses scheduled tasks (the
installer handles all three).

| Unit | What |
|---|---|
| `claude-hooks-proxy.service` | Long-running proxy on port 38080 (configurable). |
| `claude-hooks-dashboard.service` | Read-only stats dashboard on port 38081. |
| `claude-hooks-rollup.service` + `.timer` | Ingests daily JSONL files into `stats.db` every 5 min, plus a 1-min boot delay. `Persistent=true` so a missed tick triggers once on wake. |
| `claude-hooks-health.service` + `.timer` | Daily one-line health summary (default 09:07 UTC). Appends to `~/.claude/proxy-health-daily.log` and the journal. |
| `claude-hooks-daemon.service` | Long-lived per-session hook executor — lets each hook answer in milliseconds instead of paying the 100–300 ms Python cold-start. **v1.4+ also supervises the llamafile embedding engine** (spawn on demand, 5-min idle reap; see [`docs/llamafile-integration.md`](docs/llamafile-integration.md)). |
| `claude-hooks-pgvector-mcp.service` | System-wide stdio MCP server fronting pgvector. Useful when other clients (Cursor, Codex, OpenWebUI) want the same Postgres recall as Claude Code. |
| `caliber-grounding-proxy.service` | Caliber grounding proxy (port 38090) with project-aware tools (`survey_project`, `recall`). |
| `axon-host.service` | Optional Axon code-graph engine companion (Python, Neo4j-based). See [`COMPANION_TOOLS.md`](COMPANION_TOOLS.md). |

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10+**. The recall/store core is **stdlib-only**; only the proxy
  and the optional DB-backed providers (pgvector, sqlite-vec) need wheels.
- **Claude Code** with hooks support.
- **At least one memory backend** — pick from the table below. Multiple can
  run simultaneously; the dispatcher fans out recall in parallel.
- *(Optional)* **Ollama** for HyDE, /reflect, /consolidate, and as
  the embedder primary for the pgvector / sqlite-vec providers.
  As of **v1.4+**, Ollama is no longer strictly required for the
  embedder side — the bundled
  [llamafile engine](docs/llamafile-integration.md) (~1.5 GB,
  daemon-supervised) can serve as an Ollama fallback or replace it
  entirely. HyDE / reflect / consolidate still need an Ollama
  (or OpenAI-compatible) chat backend.

### Memory backends — pick at install time

| Backend | Setup | Extra deps | Strengths |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Qdrant** (HTTP MCP) | Run `mcp-server-qdrant` (we ship a patched version under `vendor/mcp-qdrant/`) | none | mature vector search; the historical default |
| **Memory KG** (HTTP MCP) | Run `mcp-memory` (npm `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory`) | none | typed entity graph + observation keyword search |
| **Postgres + pgvector** | Local docker stack — see [`docs/pgvector-runbook.md`](docs/pgvector-runbook.md). `install.py` handles DSN probe, schema init, embedder pull, and registers a system-wide `pgvector-mcp` stdio server in `~/.claude.json` so other MCP clients (Cursor/Codex/OpenWebUI) can use the same store. | `pip install -r requirements-pgvector.txt` | single SQL backend that replaces both Qdrant + Memory KG; hybrid recall (vector + BM25 RRF); native KG entities/relations/observations |
| **sqlite-vec** | Standalone SQLite file at `~/.claude/claude-hooks-memory.db` | `pip install -r requirements-sqlite-vec.txt` | zero-server, single-file, low-footprint |

### Embedding engines (v1.4+) — for the local-embed providers

The `pgvector` and `sqlite-vec` providers need an embedder. Qdrant and
Memory KG embed server-side (FastEmbed inside the MCP container /
bundled embedder) and don't need this section — `install.py` validates
their connectivity and surfaces a one-line note instead.

| Engine | When | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Ollama** | Default primary when Ollama is reachable | `qwen3-embedding:0.6b` at `num_ctx=16384` by default; installer probes `/api/tags` and offers `ollama pull` if missing |
| **OpenAI-compatible** | Alternative primary | Any `/v1/embeddings` endpoint (OpenAI, LM Studio, vLLM, …); API key may be a `${VAR}` reference |
| **llamafile** (v1.4+) | **Fallback** by default; primary if Ollama is disabled | mozilla-ai/llamafile@0.10.1; supervised by `claude-hooks-daemon` with 5-min idle reap; composite ships as a GitHub Release asset and is fetched + SHA-verified at install time. See [`docs/llamafile-integration.md`](docs/llamafile-integration.md). |

`CompositeEmbedder` tries the primary on every embed and drops to the
fallback on `EmbedderError`. Primary and fallback must agree on
embedding dim (1024 for `qwen3-embedding-0.6b`) — the installer
warns and the runtime guards.

### Conda env + dependency files

The installer creates a `claude-hooks` conda env (Python 3.11) by default
and pip-installs the requirements files relevant to your enabled
backends. Manual install for reference:

```bash
conda create -n claude-hooks python=3.11 -y
conda activate claude-hooks

pip install -r requirements.txt                          # core (httpx[http2])
pip install -r requirements-pgvector.txt                 # if pgvector enabled
pip install -r requirements-sqlite-vec.txt               # if sqlite-vec enabled
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt                      # tests + coverage
```

The `bin/claude-hook` shim auto-detects this env (POSIX layout, Windows
`Scripts/python.exe`, MSYS2 hybrid) and falls back to system `python3`,
so no activation step is needed at hook runtime.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mann1x/claude-hooks.git
cd claude-hooks
python3 install.py
```

The installer will:
1. Detect if you have a conda env and offer to create one (optional -- system Python works fine)
2. Scan `~/.claude.json` for MCP servers matching Qdrant and Memory KG
3. Verify each server with a real MCP call
4. Write `config/claude-hooks.json` with your server URLs
5. Merge hook entries into `~/.claude/settings.json` (idempotent, tagged `_managedBy`)
6. **Drop PATH wrappers for every `bin/*` shim** so skill CLIs
   (`claude-advisor`, `claude-consultants`, …) resolve by bare name
   from Claude Code's bash subprocess. Locations are platform-specific:
   - **POSIX (Linux + macOS)**: `~/.local/bin/<shim>` — POSIX sh
     wrapper that `exec`s the absolute repo path. Almost always
     already on `PATH`; the installer prints a one-line hint if not.
   - **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\claude-hooks\bin\<shim>` (POSIX
     sh wrapper for the MSYS bash that Claude Code uses) plus a
     `<shim>.cmd` sibling for native cmd / PowerShell users. The
     installer also prepends that directory to **HKCU\Environment\PATH
     via `reg add`** (NOT `setx`, which silently truncates User PATH
     to 1024 chars), then broadcasts `WM_SETTINGCHANGE` so new
     processes pick it up without a logoff.
   Wrappers carry an install-time tag string in their first comment
   line so re-runs are idempotent and `--uninstall` removes only the
   tagged ones — hand-rolled wrappers of the same name are left alone.
7. **Ollama chat-side prompts** (v1.4+, `_setup_ollama_chat`).
   First asks whether to use Ollama as a chat backend (validates
   `/api/tags`), then prompts for HyDE model + fallback +
   `num_ctx`, and offers a shared-skills shortcut so the
   `/reflect` and `/consolidate` skills inherit the same model
   and context. Until v1.4 these settings were hard-coded in
   `config.py`; the dialog closes that gap. Writes
   `hooks.user_prompt_submit.hyde_*`, `reflect.*`, `consolidate.*`.
8. **pgvector + sqlite_vec setup with the embedding-engine
   dialog** (v1.4+, `_setup_embedding_engine`). For each
   local-embed provider you enable, the installer asks:
   - Use Ollama for embeddings? (model + `num_ctx`; offers
     `ollama pull` if missing.)
   - OpenAI-compatible primary instead? (mutually exclusive with
     Ollama.)
   - Use llamafile as fallback? (default Yes if a primary is set;
     primary if both Ollama and OpenAI are declined.)
   - llamafile sub-dialog: default model (`qwen3-embedding-0.6b`,
     16 k ctx) or custom GGUF; **GPU mode `auto` vs `cpu`** —
     `auto` spawns with `-ngl 99` and transparently falls back to
     CPU on VRAM exhaustion; `cpu` passes `--gpu disable`.
   On default-model picks the installer downloads the composite
   `qwen3-embedding-0.6b-16k.llamafile` (~1.5 GB) from the v1.4+
   GitHub Release asset and verifies it against the in-tree
   `vendor/llamafile/dist/SHA256SUMS.composite`. Second-provider
   invocations default to "same as previous? [Y/n]" so the
   common case is one dialog total. See
   [`docs/llamafile-integration.md`](docs/llamafile-integration.md)
   for the full architecture.
9. **Qdrant + memory_kg validate-only** (v1.4+,
   `_validate_qdrant_embedding` / `_validate_memory_kg_embedding`).
   Both MCPs embed server-side (FastEmbed inside the Qdrant
   container; bundled embedder in memory_kg); the installer
   probes connectivity, surfaces a one-line note about where the
   model lives, and never overrides their config.
10. Asks **"Install /consultants engine?"**. On yes (opt-in, off
    by default — declines cleanly): creates a dedicated
    `claude-hooks-consultants` conda env (Py 3.11), pip-installs
    the `consultants/` package with its LangGraph + LangServe
    stack, and wires the per-OS service. Two modes:
    - **Always-on** (default): systemd / launchd / Task Scheduler
      unit keeps the engine resident, ~250 MB steady-state RAM.
      First-turn latency is sub-second.
    - **Smart-start** (opt-in): the daemon spawns the engine on
      demand and reaps it after `idle_timeout_seconds` (default
      30 min). Zero RAM idle, ~5-10 s cold start on first request
      after a quiet period.
    Conda is required — install.py aborts with a clear message
    pointing at Miniconda if it's missing, no silent fallback to
    bare venv. Everything goes through the dedicated env so the
    LangGraph dep tree never leaks into the main `claude-hooks`
    conda env that the test suite runs in.
11. Asks **"Use the API proxy?"**. On yes:
   - **`[1]` Local install** — pip-installs `httpx[http2]>=0.27` into
     the chosen Python env, then drops the per-OS service:
     - **Linux** — `claude-hooks-proxy.service` + `rollup.service` +
       `rollup.timer` + `dashboard.service` in `/etc/systemd/system/`,
       `daemon-reload` + `enable --now`.
     - **macOS** — `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-hooks.proxy.plist`
       (`KeepAlive=true`, `RunAtLoad=true`), loaded via `launchctl`.
     - **Windows** — UAC-elevated logon-triggered scheduled task
       `claude-hooks-proxy` (pythonw + `run_proxy.py` to avoid a
       persistent cmd window).
     Optionally writes `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:38080` into
     `~/.claude/settings.json` (LAN listen hosts auto-translate to loopback
     on the client side).
   - **`[2]` Remote URL** — prompts for the proxy URL of an existing host
     on the LAN (e.g. `http://192.168.178.2:38080`) and writes
     `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` into `~/.claude/settings.json`. No local service.
   - Idempotent on re-run: already-installed services are detected and
     left alone unless you confirm reinstall.

### Installer flags

```bash
python3 install.py --dry-run         # show changes, don't write
python3 install.py --non-interactive # CI-friendly, fail on prompts
python3 install.py --uninstall       # remove all claude-hooks entries
python3 install.py --probe           # force tool-probe detection
```

### Verify it works

After install, open a new Claude Code session. You should see the
`SessionStart` status line. Then check the log:

```bash
tail -20 ~/.claude/claude-hooks.log
```

You should see `recall` entries for each provider on every prompt.

## Configuration

After install, `config/claude-hooks.json` lives in the repo (gitignored).
Full schema with all options: [`config/claude-hooks.example.json`](config/claude-hooks.example.json).

### v0.2 features (all opt-in via config)

| Feature | Config key | Default | What it does |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| HyDE query expansion | `hooks.user_prompt_submit.hyde_enabled` | `false` | Generates a hypothetical answer via Ollama to improve search recall |
| Attention decay | `hooks.user_prompt_submit.decay_enabled` | `false` | Fades old memories, strengthens frequently useful ones. `halflife_days` = how fast (14 = gentle, 7 = aggressive) |
| Progressive disclosure | `hooks.user_prompt_submit.progressive` | `false` | Shows only first line + char count per memory, ~3-5x less context |
| Memory dedup | `providers.qdrant.dedup_threshold` | `0.0` | Text similarity threshold before storing. Set to `0.85` to skip near-duplicates |
| Observation classification | `hooks.stop.classify_observations` | `true` | Tags memories as fix/preference/decision/gotcha/general |
| Compact recall | `hooks.session_start.compact_recall` | `true` | Re-injects memories after context compaction so nothing is lost |
| Instinct extraction | `hooks.stop.extract_instincts` | `false` | Auto-creates markdown "instinct" files from bug-fix patterns |
| /reflect synthesis | `reflect.enabled` | `true` | Requires Ollama. Analyzes memory patterns and generates CLAUDE.md rules |
| Consolidation | `consolidate.enabled` | `false` | Requires Ollama. Deduplicates, compresses, and prunes old memories |
| Auto-consolidation | `consolidate.trigger` | `"manual"` | `"session_start"` runs `consolidate()` automatically every `min_sessions_between_runs` (default 10) sessions. CLI invocation always works regardless. |
| PreToolUse memory warn | `hooks.pre_tool_use.warn_on_tools` / `warn_on_patterns` | `["Bash","Edit","Write"]` / `["rm ","DROP TABLE","git reset --hard"]` | Match a tool + a substring in its args; recall against that command and inject as advisory `additionalContext`. Never blocks. |
| PreToolUse file-read gate | `hooks.pre_tool_use.file_read_gate` / `file_read_gate_tools` | `false` / `["Read","Edit","MultiEdit"]` | Port 5 from thedotmack/claude-mem. When `Read`/`Edit`/`MultiEdit` touches a path with prior memories, inject those memories regardless of `warn_on_patterns`. |
| Detached store | `hooks.stop.detach_store` | `true` | Fork the dedup-and-store fan-out into a detached subprocess so Stop returns immediately. ~200–500 ms saved per noteworthy turn, and — the reason it is on by default since 2026-07-25 — it takes the embed off the Stop hook's critical path, so a multi-KB memory can no longer be dropped by the hook timeout. Trade-off: store failures are logged, not surfaced in the systemMessage. See [`docs/daemon.md`](docs/daemon.md#latency-tiers-and-detach_store). |
| Daemon (long-lived hook executor) | `hooks.daemon.enabled` (auto via installer) | platform-dependent | Single Python process owns providers + config across hook invocations. Each hook answers in milliseconds instead of 100–300 ms. See [`docs/daemon.md`](docs/daemon.md). |

### HyDE model

Default: `gemma4:e2b` with `qwen3:4b` fallback. Any small Ollama model
works -- it just needs to produce a short hypothetical answer for search
expansion. If Ollama is down, HyDE degrades gracefully to the raw prompt.

## Commands Reference

### Slash commands (inside Claude Code)

These are available as skills after running the installer. Type the
command in the Claude Code prompt.

| Command | Since | Requires | Description |
|---------|-------|----------|-------------|
| `/reflect` | v0.2 | Ollama | Analyze recent memories for recurring patterns, generate CLAUDE.md rules |
| `/consolidate` | v0.2 | Ollama | Find duplicate memories, compress old entries, prune stale ones |
| `/wrapup` | v0.5 | -- | Produce a restore-ready session state summary before compacting / pausing |
| `/episodic <query>` | v0.6 | episodic-server | Search past Claude Code conversations by semantic query |
| `/save-learning` | v0.7 | -- | Save a user instruction/preference as a persistent learning |
| `/find-skills` | v0.7 | caliber | Search the public skill registry for community skills |
| `/setup-caliber` | v0.7 | caliber | Set up Caliber pre-commit hooks for config drift detection |
| `/setup-compile-aware` | v0.7 | LSP engine | Detect build tools in the current project and propose a `[compile_aware.commands]` block for `.claude-hooks/lsp-engine.toml`. Asks for confirmation before writing. |
| `/get-advice [ask] <query>` | **v1.3** | claude-advisor + Ollama | Multi-turn LLM-to-LLM second-opinion conversation with a configured Ollama advisor. Project tools (read_file, grep, glob, list_files, recall_memory) available to the advisor. Subverbs: `ask` (default, implicit — bare `/get-advice <query>` works), `model [name [ctx]]` (report or set), `effort [tier]` (report or set `low`/`medium`/`high`/`max`), `tools [csv\|all\|none]` (report or set the project-tool list exposed to the advisor). See [`docs/get-advice.md`](docs/get-advice.md). |
| `/consultants [ask] <query>` | **v1.3** (engine v2 on `dev`) | claude-consultants | Multi-agent council consultation with per-role message-history persistence in `transcript.db`. v2 engine ships 6 roles: `planner`, `researcher` (Mode A inline / Mode B PLAN-REPORT split), `critic`, `synthesizer`, opt-in `tool_executor`, opt-in `coder`. Opt-in cross-session memory (M8 BaseStore) with per-namespace TTL + distillation-on-expiry (M14). CitationLinter verifies every `path:line` claim before the answer leaves the council. Subverbs: `ask` (default, implicit — bare `/consultants <query>` works), `followup [<sid>] <question>` (iterate on a prior session; failed-session-aware), `list [--limit N]` (past sessions), `show <sid> [--raw]` (re-read a stored summary), `config [<args>...]` (interactive walk-through to toggle roles, change per-role models, set context pins, switch effort tier `low`/`medium`/`high`/`max`/`xmedium`/`xhigh`/`xmax`, change service mode). See [`docs/consultants.md`](docs/consultants.md) for the runbook, [`docs/consultants-roles.md`](docs/consultants-roles.md) for the role-by-role reference (when to enable `tool_executor` / `coder`, what their shortcomings are). |

```

## Per-project opt-out

```bash
touch your-project/.claude-hooks-disable
```

Any directory with this marker file (or any ancestor) will skip all hooks.
The nearest marker wins, so a subdirectory can say something different.

An empty marker turns everything off. To keep some parts, name them:

```bash
echo 'keep: memory, mailbox' > your-project/.claude-hooks-disable
```

| part | what stays on |
|---|---|
| `memory` | recall on every prompt, recall after a compaction, and the per-turn store at Stop |
| `mailbox` | registration (on every SessionStart, resume and compaction included), mail announcements, the during-turn notice, and unregistering at SessionEnd |
| `guards` | the PreToolUse process guard — denies commands that would kill or wait on themselves, and waiters that cannot notice a failure ([docs/process-guard.md](docs/process-guard.md)) |

Everything else stays off, and that is guaranteed by construction rather
than by switches: a project with a marker never runs the normal hook
handlers, only a restricted path (`claude_hooks/hook_parts.py`) that can
call the memory and mailbox functions and nothing else. The code graph,
LSP engine, linters, guards, companion reindexing and the episodic
transcript push are off, and so is any feature added to the hooks later
until it is added to that path on purpose. Unknown names are logged and
ignored; they never enable anything. This is the setting for developing
claude-hooks itself.

The filename can be changed via the top-level `disable_marker_filename`
config key (default `.claude-hooks-disable`) if you need a different
sentinel name for your organisation.

## Uninstall

```bash
python3 install.py --uninstall
```

This removes the 4 hook entries tagged `_managedBy: "claude-hooks"` from
`~/.claude/settings.json`. Your other hooks and settings are left intact.

## Adding a new provider

1. Create `claude_hooks/providers/<name>.py` implementing the `Provider` ABC
2. Add it to `claude_hooks/providers/__init__.py` `REGISTRY`
3. Re-run `python3 install.py`

The 4 methods a provider implements (`detect`, `verify`, `recall`, `store`)
are the entire contract. Providers may optionally override `batch_recall`
and `batch_store` for backends with native bulk operations — the default
implementation parallelises single-shot calls.

## Pgvector backend (optional)

For users who'd rather run a single Postgres-backed memory store than
Qdrant + Memory KG, claude-hooks ships an opt-in pgvector provider plus
a docker stack and a migration script.

The full walkthrough lives at **[`docs/pgvector-runbook.md`](docs/pgvector-runbook.md)**:
docker compose at `/shared/config/mcp-pgvector/`, idempotent migration
+ delta sync via `scripts/migrate_to_pgvector.py`, a benchmark harness
at `scripts/bench_recall.py`, and the design rationale at
[`docs/PLAN-pgvector-migration.md`](docs/PLAN-pgvector-migration.md).

Bench-driven default embedder pick (since 2026-04-28) is
`qwen3-embedding:0.6b` (1024 dim, native 32k ctx). It replaces the
earlier `nomic-embed-text` default after a head-to-head bench showed
tighter cosine distances on niche queries and full 32k context that
eliminates the silent 8k truncation cliff on long Stop summaries.
Speed cost is real (~85 ms p50 embed vs ~38 ms for nomic) but total
recall stays under 100 ms end-to-end on HNSW. **Tables are
model-namespaced** (`memories_<short>`) because the embedding dim is
part of the column type — see the runbook's *Swapping the embedding
model* section if you want to change it.

Pgvector runs alongside Qdrant + Memory KG until you decide to retire
them — there's no flag day.

## Plugin Extraction

Some Claude Code plugins inject `additionalContext` on every `PreToolUse`
event, which accumulates context rapidly and can cause premature compaction.
The `extract_plugin.py` utility extracts the useful parts (skills, agents,
commands) as standalone files and disables the plugin's hooks:

```bash
python3 extract_plugin.py
```

This currently targets `code-analysis@mag-claude-plugins`, which intercepts
every Grep, Glob, Bash, Read, and Task call with claudemem enrichment.
After extraction, all skills (`/code-analysis--investigate`,
`/code-analysis--deep-analysis`, etc.) remain available on-demand — only the
automatic per-tool-call injection is removed.

Re-run after a plugin version bump to pick up new skills.

## Vendored MCP servers

### `vendor/mcp-qdrant` — patched `mcp-server-qdrant` with score threshold

Upstream [`mcp-server-qdrant`](https://github.com/qdrant/mcp-server-qdrant)
always returns `QDRANT_SEARCH_LIMIT` results on every `qdrant-find` call, no
matter how weak the cosine similarity. On a realistic memory store this
injects low-confidence noise into your prompt context on every turn.

`vendor/mcp-qdrant/` contains a Dockerfile + idempotent build-time patch that
adds a `QDRANT_SCORE_THRESHOLD` env var, forwarding Qdrant's native
`score_threshold` into the MCP server. Set it to e.g. `0.40` and anything
below that similarity is dropped before reaching `claude-hooks`.

Same image, same endpoints as upstream — just one extra env var. See
[`vendor/mcp-qdrant/README.md`](vendor/mcp-qdrant/README.md) for the full
build/run instructions and how to pick a threshold for your embedding model.

## Optional PreToolUse / Stop hooks (opt-in)

Three optional hooks are bundled but disabled by default. Enable them
individually in `config/claude-hooks.json` after reading the doc for
each one.

### `stop_guard` — force the assistant to keep working

Scans the last assistant message on `Stop` events for
ownership-dodging phrases ("pre-existing issue", "known limitation"),
session-quitting phrases ("good stopping point", "continue in the
next session"), and permission-seeking mid-task ("should I continue?").
If matched, returns `decision: block` with a correction so the
assistant resumes working instead of stopping. Respects
`stop_hook_active` to avoid infinite loops.

```json
"hooks": {
  "stop_guard": { "enabled": true }
}
```

Patterns are opinionated defaults (derived from rtfpessoa's CLAUDE.md
golden rules). Override with your own
`patterns: [{"pattern": "regex", "correction": "message"}, ...]` in
config. Source: [`claude_hooks/stop_guard.py`](claude_hooks/stop_guard.py).

**User-intent wrap-up escape**: by default the guard skips its check
when the last user message contains a wrap-up marker (e.g. "wrap up",
"compact the context", "save state", "continue another time",
"/wrapup"). This lets `/wrapup` and similar explicit hand-off requests
finish cleanly without being blocked. Disable with
`skip_on_user_wrap_up: false`, or extend the marker list via
`user_wrap_up_markers: ["…", …]`.

**Meta-context escape**: by default the guard skips its check when the
match is only inside a quoted span (`"…"`, `'…'`, `` `…` ``) or the
message contains a meta-marker phrase like "trigger phrase",
"would trigger", "stop_guard", "testing the hook", etc. This avoids
false positives when the assistant is documenting, testing, or quoting
the guard's rules. Turn off with `skip_meta_context: false`, or
extend the marker list via `meta_markers: ["…", …]`.

### `safety_scan` — ask-before-running on dangerous commands

PreToolUse scanner that matches dangerous patterns **anywhere** in a
Bash command (after pipes, chains, `find -exec`, subshells), not just
as a prefix. Emits `permissionDecision: "ask"` on match so the user
always makes the call; never auto-denies. Complements the
prefix-based allow-list in `~/.claude/settings.json`.

```json
"hooks": {
  "pre_tool_use": {
    "safety_scan_enabled": true,
    "safety_log_retention_days": 90
  }
}
```

Default pattern list covers `sudo`, `rm -rf`, `mkfs`, `dd`,
`curl | sh`, destructive git operations, `npm install -g`,
`DROP TABLE`, and more. See
[`claude_hooks/safety_patterns.py`](claude_hooks/safety_patterns.py).
Matches are logged as JSONL under `~/.claude/permission-scanner/`
with daily rotation (90-day retention by default).

### `rtk_rewrite` — transparent command rewrite for token savings

PreToolUse hook that shells out to [`rtk`](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk)
(a Rust CLI) to rewrite verbose `find` / `grep` / `git log` / `du`
style commands into terser rtk equivalents. rtk-ai claims 60-90%
token savings on matching commands.

```json
"hooks": {
  "pre_tool_use": {
    "rtk_rewrite_enabled": true,
    "rtk_min_version": "0.23.0"
  }
}
```

Requires the `rtk` binary (>= 0.23.0) on `PATH`. Install from
https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk (Homebrew, curl installer, or download
the Windows zip). If `rtk` is missing or too old, the hook silently
passes the command through — safe to enable on partially-deployed
fleets. **Name collision warning**: there's an unrelated "Rust Type
Kit" crate also named `rtk` on crates.io — uninstall it first
(`rm $(which rtk)` if `rtk --version` shows `0.1.x` without a
`rewrite` subcommand). Source:
[`claude_hooks/rtk_rewrite.py`](claude_hooks/rtk_rewrite.py).

**Safety interaction with rtk** — when rtk produces a rewrite, the
hook emits `permissionDecision: "allow"`, which **bypasses** the
prefix allow-list in `~/.claude/settings.json`. To keep that safety
net, `rtk_scan_rewrites: true` (default) runs the scanner on
rtk-rewritten commands even when `safety_scan_enabled: false`:

- `rtk_rewrite_enabled=true, safety_scan_enabled=false, rtk_scan_rewrites=true` (default): rtk rewrites `ls && rm -rf /tmp` → scanner catches `rm -rf` → "ask".
- `rtk_rewrite_enabled=true, safety_scan_enabled=false, rtk_scan_rewrites=false`: same input → "allow" (user opted out of the safety net).
- `rtk_rewrite_enabled=true, safety_scan_enabled=true`: scanner runs on every Bash command, rewritten or not.

## Other configurable features

### HyDE query expansion (UserPromptSubmit recall)

HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) rewrites your prompt into a
hypothetical answer before vector search, which usually lands better in
"answer space" than the raw question. Enabled via
`hooks.user_prompt_submit.hyde_enabled: true`. Tunables:

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `hyde_model` | `gemma4:e2b` | Primary Ollama model |
| `hyde_fallback_model` | `gemma4:e4b` | Fallback if primary fails |
| `hyde_url` | `http://localhost:11434/api/generate` | Ollama endpoint |
| `hyde_timeout` | `30.0` | Per-call timeout (seconds) |
| `hyde_max_tokens` | `150` | Output length cap for the hypothetical answer |
| `hyde_keep_alive` | `"15m"` | Ollama `keep_alive` — keeps the model resident between calls so cold-start doesn't hit every prompt |
| `hyde_grounded` | `true` | Two-phase grounded pipeline: query Qdrant raw first, then feed top hits to the LLM as grounding before generating the expansion. Prevents hallucinated domain terms poisoning the search. |
| `hyde_ground_k` | `3` | How many raw hits to use as grounding context |
| `hyde_ground_max_chars` | `1500` | Cap on the grounding context size |

If raw recall finds nothing (garbage query), grounded mode short-circuits
and skips HyDE entirely — cheaper than an ungrounded hallucinated
expansion.

**Precedence with `metadata_filter`** — when both are enabled, the
metadata filter applies first: each provider returns
`recall_k * over_fetch_factor` candidates, the filter trims by
cwd/type/age/tags, and only the survivors form HyDE's grounding pool.
So a too-narrow filter will silently disable grounded HyDE (zero raw
hits ⇒ no grounding ⇒ HyDE skipped). Loosen the filter before
suspecting HyDE quality. See [`docs/hyde.md`](docs/hyde.md) for the
full pipeline.

### Per-provider `dedup_threshold`

On `Stop`, providers that expose cosine similarity (qdrant, pgvector,
sqlite_vec) can skip storing a turn summary if an existing entry is
above the given cosine threshold. Set on the provider entry:

```json
"providers": {
  "qdrant": { "dedup_threshold": 0.85 }
}
```

`0.0` disables (the default for most providers). `0.85` is a sensible
floor for "don't bother, we already have this." Higher = stricter.

The threshold is a **cosine similarity** (range 0.0–1.0, higher = more
similar), computed via the provider's own embedding model on the
truncated summary (first 500 chars). Don't confuse with `1 - distance`
in some pgvector queries — claude-hooks normalises providers to
similarity-space internally so `dedup_threshold` always means "skip
storing if any existing memory has cosine ≥ this value."

### `classify_observations` and instincts extraction (Stop hook)

The Stop hook tags each stored memory with an `observation_type`
(`fix`, `decision`, `preference`, `gotcha`, `general`) so downstream
tooling can filter. Toggle with `hooks.stop.classify_observations`.

`hooks.stop.extract_instincts` (opt-in) additionally runs a lightweight
heuristic to pull persistent rules from the assistant's message and
write them to `hooks.stop.instincts_dir` (default `~/.claude/instincts`)
as a sidecar you can promote to CLAUDE.md manually. Experimental.

### `summary_format`: markdown vs XML

`hooks.stop.summary_format` controls the layout of stored memories:

- `"markdown"` (default) — backward-compatible plain-text bullet list.
  What every Qdrant corpus written before v0.5 contains.
- `"xml"` — structured `<observation>` block (port from
  thedotmack/claude-mem). Each field is addressable, so downstream
  recall can filter by type without prose parsing:

  ```xml
  <observation ts="2026-04-29T12:34:56Z">
    <type>fix</type>
    <title>bcache make-bcache --wipe-bcache rebuild</title>
    <subtitle>/srv/dev-disk-by-label-opt/dev/claude-hooks</subtitle>
    <cwd>/srv/dev-disk-by-label-opt/dev/claude-hooks</cwd>
    <prompt>...truncated 600 chars...</prompt>
    <result>...truncated 1200 chars...</result>
    <files_modified>
      <file>/etc/fstab</file>
      <file>/etc/bcache.conf</file>
    </files_modified>
    <files_read>...</files_read>
    <commands>
      <command>make-bcache --wipe-bcache /dev/sda3</command>
    </commands>
  </observation>
  ```

  When `summary_format: "xml"` is on, the Stop hook also reads the
  `<type>` tag back to seed `metadata.observation_type` directly
  (skipping the heuristic classifier when the model has already
  declared it).

Mixing formats inside one corpus works but mucks up search ranking —
pick one per corpus and stick with it. The format the entry was
written with is recorded in `metadata.summary_format` so you can
filter or re-write later.

### Claudemem auto-reindex

[`claudemem`](https://github.com/MadAppGang/claudemem) is a semantic
code-search tool with its own AST-aware index. Upstream ships a git
post-commit hook (`claudemem hooks install`), but that doesn't cover
**uncommitted mid-session edits**. This hook plugs the gap:

- **Stop event**: if the turn ran any `Edit`/`Write`/`MultiEdit`/
  `NotebookEdit`, spawn `claudemem index --quiet` detached so the
  hook adds no latency.
- **SessionStart event**: if the index is older than `staleness_minutes`
  AND any source file is newer than the index, reindex.

All triggers silently no-op if `claudemem` isn't on PATH or the project
has no `.claudemem/` directory — safe to leave enabled on partially-
configured fleets.

Config (`hooks.claudemem_reindex`):

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Master toggle |
| `check_on_stop` | `true` | Reindex on turns that touched files |
| `check_on_session_start` | `true` | Staleness check when a new session opens |
| `staleness_minutes` | `10` | Cooldown — reindex at most every N min |
| `max_files_to_scan` | `2000` | Cap on the stale-scan walk (set higher for monorepos) |
| `ignored_dirs` | `[]` | Extra dir names to skip (appended to built-in: `.git`, `.claudemem`, `node_modules`, `.venv`, `__pycache__`, `.wolf`, `.caliber`, `dist`, `build`, …) |
| `lock_min_age_seconds` | `60` | Cooldown on the `.claudemem-reindex.lock` file to prevent pile-ups |

For **commit-time** reindexing on every project, run:
```bash
claudemem hooks install   # in each git repo
```

## Credits

The three optional hooks above are Python ports of the Bash hooks in
[rtfpessoa/code-factory](https://github.com/rtfpessoa/code-factory):

- `stop_guard` ← [`hooks/stop-phrase-guard.sh`](https://github.com/rtfpessoa/code-factory/blob/main/hooks/stop-phrase-guard.sh)
- `safety_scan` ← [`hooks/command-safety-scanner.sh`](https://github.com/rtfpessoa/code-factory/blob/main/hooks/command-safety-scanner.sh)
- `rtk_rewrite` ← [`hooks/rtk-rewrite.sh`](https://github.com/rtfpessoa/code-factory/blob/main/hooks/rtk-rewrite.sh)

Design changes for claude-hooks: pure-Python implementation (no bash /
jq dependency), pattern lists surfaced as config, integration between
`rtk_rewrite` and `safety_scan` so rewrites are still scanned before
auto-approval. See
[`docs/PLAN-code-factory-integration.md`](docs/PLAN-code-factory-integration.md)
for the full integration plan.

## Scripts

### `scripts/install-caliber-hook.sh` — fast caliber pre-commit hook

Caliber's default pre-commit hook runs `caliber refresh` and
`caliber learn finalize` synchronously — each calls an LLM, and on
event-heavy sessions the combined wait can block `git commit` for
**20 minutes or more**. This installer replaces that hook with a
portable non-blocking version:

- backgrounds `caliber refresh` so commits return instantly (refreshed
  docs land in the next commit)
- drops `caliber learn finalize` (the SessionEnd Claude Code hook
  already runs the `--auto` version, and 240-event LLM passes on the
  commit path were hitting caliber's internal 600 s timeout)
- bounds the inner Claude CLI call at 60 s via
  `CALIBER_CLAUDE_CLI_TIMEOUT_MS`
- wraps the refresh in GNU `timeout 30` when available (skipped on
  Windows Git Bash, where `timeout.exe` is a `sleep` with different
  semantics)

Measured on a 240-event session: `~20 min` → `~0.7 s` per commit.

```bash
sh scripts/install-caliber-hook.sh         # install / update
sh scripts/install-caliber-hook.sh --dry   # preview
```

Existing `.git/hooks/pre-commit` is backed up to
`.git/hooks/pre-commit.bak-<timestamp>` before being replaced. Re-run
on every machine that clones the repo — git doesn't version-control
`.git/hooks/` so the install can't be automatic.

### `scripts/openwolfstatus` — OpenWolf dashboard status

Shows all registered OpenWolf projects, their dashboard/daemon port
assignments, and PM2 process status. Warns if the PM2 state hasn't been
saved (i.e. new daemons won't survive a reboot).

```bash
# Linux
./scripts/openwolfstatus.sh

# Windows
scripts\openwolfstatus.bat
```

### PM2 auto-start on boot

OpenWolf daemons run under PM2. After starting or changing daemons, run
`pm2 save` to persist the process list. Then set up auto-start:

**Linux (systemd):**

```bash
pm2 startup          # generates and enables a systemd service (pm2-<user>)
pm2 save             # saves current process list for resurrection
```

This creates `/etc/systemd/system/pm2-<user>.service` which runs
`pm2 resurrect` on boot.

**Windows:**

```bash
npm install -g pm2-windows-startup
pm2-startup install  # adds a registry entry for auto-start on login
pm2 save             # saves current process list
```

This adds a `PM2` entry under
`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` that launches
`pm2 resurrect` at login.

> **Important:** Every time you add or remove an OpenWolf daemon, run
> `pm2 save` again. Without it, the new daemon won't be restored after
> a reboot.

## Tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt   # pytest + coverage
python -m pytest tests/ -q            # ~1.5k tests, mostly unit + a handful of integration
```

The exact pass count drifts as new modules ship — `pytest --collect-only -q | tail -1` for the current total. Run with `pytest -k <module>` to scope.

Branch coverage gate (target ≥ 80 %):

```bash
coverage run -m pytest tests/
coverage report
# Re-run `coverage report` for the current figure — the number
# drifts as new modules ship.
```

## Where the system listens

Default ports the framework introduces or expects. All bind to `127.0.0.1`
by default; the proxy supports a LAN-listen mode for shared installs.

| Port | Service | Configurable as |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| 38080 | API proxy | `proxy.listen_port` |
| 38081 | Stats dashboard | `proxy_dashboard.listen_port` |
| 38090 | Caliber grounding proxy | `caliber_proxy.listen_port` |
| 38092 | **Llamafile embedding engine** (v1.4+, daemon-supervised; HTTP `/embedding`) | `embedding.port` (see [`docs/llamafile-integration.md`](docs/llamafile-integration.md)) |
| 38093–38099 | **Llamafile chat engine** (v1.5+, one port per registered label; HTTP `/v1/chat/completions`) | `claude-hooks-models add ... --port N` (see [`docs/llamafile-chat-models.md`](docs/llamafile-chat-models.md)) |
| 38095 | `/consultants` engine HTTP server (opt-in) | `consultants.http_port` (see [`docs/consultants.md`](docs/consultants.md)) |
| 38096 | `/consultants` smart-start forwarder shim (opt-in mode only) | `consultants_forwarder.listen_port` |
| 47018 | claude-hooks-daemon HMAC RPC (long-lived hook executor) | `--port` to `claude-hooks-daemon` (see [`docs/daemon.md`](docs/daemon.md)) |
| 11435 | Episodic-memory HTTP server | `episodic_server.listen_port` (see [`docs/episodic-server.md`](docs/episodic-server.md)) |
| 11433 | (host-specific) Ollama upstream — used as `CALIBER_GROUNDING_UPSTREAM` default; **override for your install** | env / systemd drop-in |
