## What is mq-bridge?

`mq-bridge` is an asynchronous Rust library that moves messages and data between systems: Kafka, NATS, RabbitMQ, MQTT, MongoDB, PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite, Postgres CDC, ClickHouse, Redis Streams, HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC, ZeroMQ, AWS SQS/SNS, IBM MQ, cloud object storage, files, and in-memory channels. Every endpoint sits behind the same batch-shaped `receive_batch` / `send_batch` traits, so any source can feed any sink.

A **route** connects one input to one output. In between, it can transform, filter, fan out, retry, rate-limit, deduplicate, or answer a request, all by configuration. Where configuration isn't enough, you add a handler in Rust, Python or Node.js. Batching, ack/nack, commit ordering and broker I/O stay in the Tokio-based core, so your code works with plain `CanonicalMessage`s and doesn't handle Kafka offsets or AMQP nacks.

It is a **library you embed in your own service**, not a daemon or platform you operate. If you'd rather not write code, [`mq-bridge-app`](apps/mq-bridge-app) runs the same engine and config as a CLI, server, desktop app, and MCP server.

## Quick Start

Install the library for your language:

| Language | Package | Install |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Rust | [`mq-bridge`](https://crates.io/crates/mq-bridge) | `cargo add mq-bridge --features kafka,nats,yaml` |
| Python | [`mq-bridge`](python/mq-bridge-py/README.md) ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mq-bridge/)) | `pip install mq-bridge` |
| Node.js | [`mq-bridge`](node/mq-bridge-node/README.md) ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mq-bridge)) | `npm install mq-bridge` |

Describe a route — here Kafka → NATS with retries — in `routes.yaml`:

```yaml
kafka_to_nats:
  input:
    kafka: { url: "localhost:9092", topic: "orders", group_id: "bridge" }
  output:
    middlewares:
      - retry: { max_attempts: 5 }
    nats: { url: "nats://localhost:4222", subject: "orders.processed" }
```

Run it:

```python
from mq_bridge import Route
Route.from_file("routes.yaml", "kafka_to_nats").run()  # blocks; use start() to keep going
```

```js
import { Route } from "mq-bridge";
Route.fromFile("routes.yaml", "kafka_to_nats").start();
```

```rust
mq_bridge::deploy_file("routes.yaml").await?; // every route in the file, in the background
```

Attach a handler (`with_handler` / `withHandler`) when you need business logic in between. **No code at all?** [`mq-bridge-app`](apps/mq-bridge-app) runs the same engine from the command line or a desktop UI:

```bash
mqb copy 'kafka://localhost:9092?topic=orders' 'nats://localhost:4222?subject=orders.processed'
```


## Benchmarks

Throughput is tracked continuously on the public [benchmark dashboard](https://marcomq.github.io/mq-bridge/dev/bench/). Like-for-like ETL comparisons, measured through the zero-code [`mq-bridge-app`](apps/mq-bridge-app):

| Scenario | mq-bridge | Compared with |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| CSV → JSONL, 1M mixed-type rows (~116 MiB) | **2,824,858 rows/s**, ~28 MiB RAM | Meltano (`tap-csv` → `target-jsonl`): ~19,500 rows/s, ~444 MiB RAM — **~145x slower**<br>DuckDB, all cores: 2,036,659 rows/s — mq-bridge **~1.4x faster**, ~17x less memory |
| Kafka → file, 1M rows, no transform | **~65% faster** than Sea Streamer | Sea Streamer, both on mimalloc (~80% faster vs. its default-allocator build) |

CSV figures: mq-bridge 0.4.12. DuckDB is a throughput ceiling for the conversion itself, not an ETL tool. Methodology and reporting rules are in [`benches/ETL_BENCHMARKS.md`](benches/ETL_BENCHMARKS.md); the raw numbers, baselines and reproducible helpers are in the [ETL benchmark harness](apps/mq-bridge-app/benches/etl/README.md).


**External benchmark:** both the Rust library ([`mq-bridge`](https://www.http-arena.com/#sort=rps:-1&q=rust)) and the Python binding ([`mq-bridge-py`](https://www.http-arena.com/#sort=rps:-1&q=python)) are entries on the third-party [http-arena.com](https://www.http-arena.com/) leaderboard, which compares HTTP frameworks by requests per second (live, so rankings shift over time). It measures mq-bridge's HTTP (and WebSocket) serving path, which is one endpoint among many, not broker or ETL throughput; those are covered under [Benchmarks](#benchmarks). See [the Python analysis notes](python/mq-bridge-py/README.md#analysis) for the local comparison harness.


## Why mq-bridge

What you get from one engine, whichever language you call it from:

*   **16+ native transports, 100+ more via plugin, one API**: every connector listed above, plus `dir_spool` (a crash-safe directory FIFO queue), behind the same `receive_batch` / `send_batch` shape.
*   **Redpanda Connect reach**: the [Connect plugin](https://github.com/marcomq/mq-bridge-connect) adds Redpanda Connect's production-proven components — **51 inputs and 63 outputs as endpoints, plus 68 processors**, most of which also run as middleware on any endpoint — while mq-bridge keeps routing, batching, retries, DLQ and deduplication.
*   **Change Data Capture**: stream row-level changes from **Postgres** (logical replication / `pgoutput`) and **MongoDB** (change streams) as flat rows with an operation marker.
*   **Restart-safe delivery**: batch-aware ack/nack with commit sequencing for cumulative-ack brokers; the integration suite shows **no data loss during in-flight broker restarts**, including a Postgres CDC restart-safety test.
*   **Reliability middleware, not a framework**: retries, dead-letter queues, deduplication, rate limiting, and cookie/session persistence wrap any endpoint.
*   **Polyglot on one engine**: the same Rust core ships as native **Python** and **Node.js** bindings; routing, batching, and broker I/O stay in Rust.
*   **TLS everywhere, one config shape**: a single `TlsConfig` block (CA bundle, client cert/key for mTLS, insecure-skip) is reused across transports.
*   **Self-hosted, no daemon**: generate config in the optional UI, paste it into your code, run it in-process. No hosted control plane, no separate scheduler.

**Prefer not to write code?** [`mq-bridge-app`](apps/mq-bridge-app) runs the exact same engine as a **standalone, zero-code ETL service** configured entirely by **YAML or environment variables**. It ships a **Postman-style UI** to build, send, and inspect messages against a route, and can **import Postman collections and AsyncAPI documents** to scaffold routes and endpoints. Everything about the app — install, CLI, UI, cookbook, tuning — is in the [📖 book](https://marcomq.github.io/mq-bridge/).

### When to use mq-bridge
*   **Hybrid Messaging**: Connect systems speaking different protocols (e.g., MQTT to Kafka) without writing a custom adapter for every pair.
*   **Batch-heavy Pipelines**: Increase throughput by moving messages in batches while keeping per-message ack/nack decisions.
*   **Infrastructure Abstraction**: Write business logic against `CanonicalMessage`s and swap the underlying transport later.
*   **Resilient Pipelines**: Apply retry, DLQ, deduplication, limiter, and cookie/session behavior consistently around endpoints.
*   **Database Integration**: Combine databases with message brokers, for example by ingesting messages into SQL/MongoDB or forwarding outbox rows to a broker.
*   **Sidecar / Gateway**: Run the bridge beside another service to ingest, filter, and route messages before they reach the core application.

### When NOT to use mq-bridge
*   **Stateful Stream Processing**: For windowing, joins, or complex aggregations over time, dedicated stream processing engines are more suitable.
*   **Domain Aggregate Management**: If you need a framework to manage the lifecycle, versioning, and replay of domain aggregates (Event Sourcing), use a specialized library. `mq-bridge` handles the *bus*, not the *entity*.
*   **Protocol-Specific Power Features**: `mq-bridge` intentionally exposes a common subset: publish/consume, pub/sub where possible, request-reply where possible, batching, middleware, and ack/nack handling. If your application depends on highly specific broker features, using that broker's native client directly may be better.

## Documentation

The **[📖 mq-bridge book](https://marcomq.github.io/mq-bridge/)** covers the library and the app. Connectors, middleware and
tuning use the same settings in both.

## Status

`mq-bridge` is young (created in 2025), but its reliability behavior is exercised by an automated integration and performance suite across **every** supported endpoint, in each of the queue and subscriber modes that endpoint supports:

*   All endpoints showed **no data loss during in-flight broker restarts**; MQTT publish confirmation was hardened until a chaos test drove in-flight loss to **zero**.
*   Postgres CDC has a **restart-safety test**: an un-acked, in-flight batch is redelivered after a database restart with no loss and no gap.

Known rough edges:

- old or very new broker-server versions, or unusual broker settings
- subscribe/event and response patterns where the backend has no native equivalent (emulated); MongoDB request/reply is only covered by automated tests so far
- NATS without JetStream (integration tests run with JetStream only)
- **TLS**: one `TlsConfig` shape is shared by all transports and covered by automated tests, but per-backend certificate matrices are still being expanded, so verify non-trivial TLS setups yourself

## Running Tests
The project includes integration and performance tests. Most backend tests require Docker.

To run the performance benchmarks for all supported backends:
```sh
cargo test --test integration_test --release -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
```

To run the criterion benchmarks:
```sh
cargo bench --features "full"
```
Criterion numbers vary with the machine they run on; for comparable throughput figures use the integration performance test above, or see the [benchmark dashboard](https://marcomq.github.io/mq-bridge/dev/bench/).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup notes, code style, and pull request guidelines.

## AI Disclaimer

This library was written with a lot of AI assistance. The core started as my own code; many endpoints and docs were expanded with Gemini, CodeRabbit, Claude, and Codex, which made adding transports much faster once the endpoint traits were stable.

Generated code can look plausible while missing important details, so I review every commit manually, clean up and refactor the output, and rely on the integration suite to catch regressions. **I trust the current code as much as if I had written it myself.** Given the large feature set there may still be open issues; the current focus is testing and documentation.
