# Upstox Visualizer

A full-screen charting terminal for Upstox: OAuth login, the complete NSE, BSE and
MCX instrument master in SQLite, and a canvas charting engine with 86 technical
indicators, 43 drawing tools and 19 chart types.

FastAPI + SQLite on the backend, React 19 + openalgo-charts on the frontend.
No `.env` file: credentials live in the SQLite database and are entered through
the setup screen.

## What it does

- **Search 124,000+ instruments.** The full Upstox BOD master across 12 segments,
  downloaded into SQLite after login. Ranked typeahead: exact ticker first, cash
  and index ahead of derivatives, option and future chains ordered by nearest
  expiry.
- **Chart anything you find.** Search results carry their `instrument_key`, so an
  index or a specific option contract charts as itself with no ambiguity.
- **86 indicators** across Trend, Momentum, Volatility and Volume, each with a
  settings form generated from its descriptor rather than hand written.
- **43 drawing tools**: trend lines, Fibonacci, Gann, channels, cycles, position
  tools, brushes, with magnet snapping and undo.
- **19 chart types**, including Heikin Ashi, Renko, Range, Line Break, Point and
  Figure and Kagi.
- **Intervals from 1m to 1w**, served from Upstox and cached in SQLite so the
  chart still renders after the access token expires.
- **Layout persistence** per symbol: indicators, drawings, viewport and chrome
  come back when you return to an instrument.

The chart lives in a plain `ChartTerminal` class with no React import. React owns
the shell and calls into it, so a 60 fps crosshair never enters React state.

## 1. Register the redirect URL on Upstox

The redirect URL is where Upstox sends the authorization code after you log in.
It has to be registered on your Upstox app **before** the first login, and it
must match what this backend listens on exactly.

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/callback
```

1. Open <https://account.upstox.com/developer/apps> and create an app.
2. Paste the URL above into the **Redirect URI** field.
3. Save the app, then copy the **API key** and **API secret**.

Things that break the login:

| Rule | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Exact string match | `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` are different URLs to Upstox. |
| No trailing slash | Register `/api/auth/callback`, not `/api/auth/callback/`. |
| Keep the port | If you change the port in `backend/app/config.py`, re-register. |
| Avoid `.php` | Upstox filters redirect URLs ending in `.php`. |
| `http` is fine locally | Upstox accepts plain http on a loopback address. |

## 2. Run it

```powershell
cd backend
uv sync
uv run python run.py
```

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8000>. The API and the built frontend are served from
one origin on port 8000.

For frontend work, `npm run dev` starts Vite on port 5173 with hot reload and
proxies `/api` to the backend. Both modes work with the same registered redirect
URL: the login flow carries the calling origin through the OAuth `state`
parameter.

`start.ps1` does the build-then-serve sequence in one step.

### Or run it in Docker

One container: the frontend is built during the image build and served by the
same FastAPI process, so the port and the redirect URL are identical to a local
run and nothing has to be re-registered on Upstox.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8000>, same as above.

| Detail | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Published port | `127.0.0.1:8000` only, never the LAN |
| Database | Named volume `upstox-data`, mounted at `/app/data` |
| DB path override | `UPSTOX_DB_PATH`, defaults to `backend/upstox.db` off Docker |
| User | Unprivileged `upstox`, uid 10001 |
| Health | `GET /api/health`, wired to a Docker healthcheck |

The volume is what makes a rebuild safe: the API key, secret, access token,
instrument master and candle cache live there, not in the image. To start over,
`docker compose down -v` and set up again.

Logs and lifecycle:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
docker compose restart
docker compose down
```

Rebuilding after a code change is `docker compose up -d --build`. The image
pins nothing to the host, so `backend/.venv` and `frontend/node_modules` are
not needed to run this way.

## Deploy to a server

`docker-compose.prod.yml` is a second, self-contained stack: nginx terminates
TLS and enforces a password, certbot keeps the Let's Encrypt certificate alive,
and the app publishes no port at all. The local `docker-compose.yml` is
untouched and keeps working.

**Read this first.** The app has no user accounts. Every route, including
`POST /api/settings`, is open to anything that can reach port 8000, and the
database behind it holds your API key, secret and access token in plain text.
nginx is not decoration, it is the access control. Never publish the app
container's port next to this stack.

### Before you start

- A domain whose A record points at the server. It must not be proxied behind
  a CDN while the certificate is issued: Let's Encrypt has to reach this host
  directly. On Cloudflare that means the grey cloud, "DNS only".
- Ports 80 and 443 open. Both, not just 443: the ACME challenge uses 80.
- If the server is IPv4 only, make sure no AAAA record exists for the name.
  Let's Encrypt prefers IPv6 and will fail against an address nothing answers.
- Docker Engine with the Compose plugin, and roughly 1 GB of free RAM for the
  npm build. On a 1 GB box, add swap first.

### Deploy

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> upstox-visualizer
cd upstox-visualizer
cp .env.example .env          # then set APP_DOMAIN, ACME_EMAIL, APP_USER
```

Issue the certificate and generate the front door login. The script checks DNS
before spending an attempt, because Let's Encrypt allows only five validation
failures per hostname per hour:

```bash
./deploy/bootstrap-tls.sh              # or --staging to rehearse
```

It prints the generated password once. Save it. Then bring the stack up:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

### Why the bootstrap step exists

nginx will not start without a certificate file, and certbot's webroot method
needs nginx running to serve the challenge. The script breaks the deadlock by
issuing the first certificate in standalone mode, with certbot binding port 80
itself. Every renewal after that goes through the webroot with no downtime:
the certbot container retries twice a day and nginx reloads every six hours,
since nginx only re-reads a certificate on reload.

### Register the redirect URL

The one on the Upstox developer app has to change, because the loopback URL
from the local setup no longer describes where the browser lands:

```
https://<your-domain>/api/auth/callback
```

`UPSTOX_PUBLIC_URL` is derived from `APP_DOMAIN` by the compose file, so the
setup screen already suggests exactly this string. It must match byte for byte.

Then browse to `https://<your-domain>`, pass the basic auth prompt, and connect
as in step 3 below.

### What the stack does

| Control | Where |
| --- | --- |
| TLS, auto-renewed | certbot over ACME, nginx 308s HTTP to HTTPS |
| Password on every route | nginx `auth_basic`, bcrypt htpasswd, switchable with `APP_AUTH_REALM` |
| App unreachable directly | No published port, internal network only |
| Read-only root filesystem | `read_only: true`, only `/app/data` and a tmpfs `/tmp` are writable |
| No privilege escalation | `no-new-privileges`, `cap_drop: ALL`, uid 10001 |
| Resource ceiling | `APP_CPUS` / `APP_MEMORY`, default 1 CPU and 768 MB |
| Database permissions | dir 700, file 600, set by `db.py` on every start |
| Log rotation | json-file, 10 MB x 5 per container |
| Restart gating | nginx waits on the app's healthcheck |
| Upstream re-resolution | nginx resolves `app` per request, so recreating it does not strand 502s |
| Port 80 exposure | `HTTP_BIND_ADDR`, but keep it public: HTTP-01 renewal needs port 80 even behind a CDN |

### Operations

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
```

Update to the latest commit:

```bash
git pull && docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

Check certificate status, or force a renewal:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml run --rm --entrypoint certbot certbot certificates
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml run --rm --entrypoint certbot certbot renew --webroot -w /var/www/certbot --force-renewal
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec nginx nginx -s reload
```

Change the front door password:

```bash
docker run --rm httpd:2.4-alpine htpasswd -nbB USER 'newpassword' > deploy/htpasswd
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec nginx nginx -s reload
```

Back up the database. Use SQLite's own backup rather than copying the file,
which is in WAL mode and will tear under a plain `cp`:

```bash
DC="docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml"

$DC exec -T app python -c "import sqlite3; src=sqlite3.connect('/app/data/upstox.db'); dst=sqlite3.connect('/app/data/backup.db'); src.backup(dst); dst.close(); src.close()"
$DC cp app:/app/data/backup.db "./upstox-backup-$(date +%F).db"
$DC exec -T app rm /app/data/backup.db
```

That backup contains your API secret and access token in plain text. Treat it
like a key file.

### Still on you

- **A token expires every morning.** Upstox invalidates it at 3:30 AM IST, so
  somebody has to open the site and log in again each trading day. Nothing here
  automates that, and Upstox does not offer a refresh token for this flow.
- **Secrets are unencrypted at rest.** Anyone with root on the server, or with
  access to the `upstox-data` volume, can read your API secret and token.
- **No rate limiting.** Requests are bounded only by the password. If you want
  it, nginx `limit_req` is the place to add it.
- **One instance only.** SQLite plus in-process background tasks means a single
  container. Do not scale `app` past one replica.

## 3. Connect

1. Go to **Setup**, paste the API key and secret, save.
2. Click **Log in with Upstox** and complete the login.
3. You land on **Chart**. The instrument master downloads in the background.

Access tokens expire at 3:30 AM IST the day after they are issued. The hairline
under the toolbar drains as the token burns down.

## Instrument master

`POST /api/market/instruments/download` fetches
`assets.upstox.com/market-quote/instruments/exchange/complete.json.gz`, which is
a public asset and needs no access token, then rebuilds `instrument_master` in
one transaction. About 125,000 rows land in roughly three seconds.

| Segment | Rows |
| --- | --- |
| NSE_FO | 35,584 |
| NSE_COM | 28,187 |
| MCX_FO | 15,931 |
| BSE_EQ | 12,696 |
| NSE_EQ | 9,655 |
| BCD_FO | 9,304 |
| NCD_FO | 8,844 |
| BSE_FO | 4,308 |
| NSE_INDEX | 139 |
| BSE_INDEX | 77 |
| GLOBAL_INDEX | 10 |
| GLOBAL_INDICATOR | 3 |

Counts from a 2026-08-19 download. Upstox refreshes the file daily around 6 AM.

Two field quirks worth knowing, both handled at ingest: `expiry` arrives as epoch
milliseconds and is stored as an IST `YYYY-MM-DD` string, and `tick_size` is
published in paise, so divide by 100 before showing a rupee tick.

## Tables

| Table | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `app_settings` | Single row: API key, secret, redirect URL |
| `broker_session` | Single row: access token, profile, issue and expiry timestamps |
| `instruments` | The curated shortlist with friendly names |
| `instrument_master` | The full Upstox BOD master, rebuilt on each download |
| `instrument_sync` | State of the last master download |
| `candles` | OHLCV cache keyed by instrument, unit, interval, timestamp |
| `sync_log` | One row per successful fetch |

To start over, stop the backend and delete `backend/upstox.db`. That erases the
stored credentials and token, so you will have to set up and log in again.

## Security

`backend/upstox.db` holds your API key, API secret and access token in plain
text. It is gitignored and must never be committed or shared. Anyone with that
file can trade on your account until the token expires.
