Dense-Mem is a standalone HTTP MCP memory server using Streamable HTTP. It
stages exact evidence, derives semantic state through validated server policy,
and returns active evidence contexts with graph-shaped Relationship handles.
PostgreSQL is the durable authority for knowledge, lifecycle, provenance,
search, authorization, and audit; Redis is coordination only. A single-node
deployment may use process-local coordination; a multi-instance deployment
requires Redis or an equivalent distributed coordination implementation.

The host LLM owns conversation and judgment. Dense-Mem owns durable evidence,
owner authorization, lifecycle events, support eligibility, and bounded recall.
The external memory automation contract is MCP at `/mcp`; browser routes are
first-party interfaces, not an alternative public automation API.

Dense-Mem is part of the research preprint
[Governed Enterprise AI Memory Beyond RAG: From Vector Retrieval to Permissioned
Knowledge Graphs](https://zenodo.org/records/21403316).

</p>

## Why Dense-Mem

- Evidence is exact, durable, and append-only. A lifecycle action changes its
  effective state without deleting provenance or trace lineage.
- Entity and typed Value are semantic nodes. Owner-alias-owned Relationships
  become active graph edges only when their evidence support is eligible.
- Provider output is a proposal. Closed-schema validation and deterministic
  server policy decide durable state.
- Default recall excludes candidates and Hypotheses and returns evidence only
  when its active Relationship support path is eligible for the requested time.
- Team visibility and owner mutation authority are distinct. An author can
  change only their own evidence or owned semantic records.

Authentication resolves one immutable actor as `team + identity + membership +
permanent owner alias + optional credential`. An SSO browser session uses the
selected membership's permanent owner alias and has no direct credential. An
API-key request carries a credential whose stable ID is also its permanent
owner alias. Team, identity, membership, and credential fields never let a
client choose or replace the semantic owner.

## 60-Second Quickstart

Download the local compose example and environment template, configure the
required secrets, and start Dense-Mem:

```bash
mkdir dense-mem-local
cd dense-mem-local

curl -fsSLo docker-compose.yml \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markhuangai/dense-mem/main/examples/docker-compose.base.yml
curl -fsSLo .env.example \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markhuangai/dense-mem/main/examples/.env.example

cp .env.example .env
# Fill in POSTGRES_PASSWORD, CONTROL_PORTAL_TOKEN, and AI_API_KEY.
${EDITOR:-vi} .env

docker compose up -d
```

The base stack uses PostgreSQL with pgvector as the only durable authority.
The v2.6.2 release requires the compatible cutover marker created by the
stopped-service migration; it has no legacy database runtime or fallback. The
local ports are:

```text
MCP:            http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp
User portal:    http://127.0.0.1:8080/ui
Control portal: http://127.0.0.1:8090/
```

Open the control portal with `CONTROL_PORTAL_TOKEN`, then create a team and its
first credential/API key. For control-plane automation, use the same private
API:

```bash
control_token="<CONTROL_PORTAL_TOKEN from .env>"

curl -fsS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/control/api/teams \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${control_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"primary-memory"}'

curl -fsS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/control/api/teams/<team-id>/credentials \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${control_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"default credential"}'
```

Operational diagnostics use one process logger for console and the private
control portal. `LOG_LEVEL` accepts `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`,
or `fatal` and defaults to `trace`; `fatal` records severity and does not stop
the process. PostgreSQL slow-query logging uses
`POSTGRES_SLOW_QUERY_THRESHOLD_MS`, which defaults to 200 and must be a
positive value. The operation-log sink is required for readiness and reports
gaps and recovery when it is unavailable. Startup and the OAuth compatibility
harness use console-only logging until a PostgreSQL operation-log sink is
available; they do not claim that pre-attachment events were persisted.

The control portal's Logs view filters by severity, correlation ID, request
hash, Remember attempt, execution/replay/conflict classification, and retry
eligibility. A team's Remember diagnostics open on admitted calls and link to
canonical attempts. Capture bodies are loaded only for an authorized detail
view and are labelled as observed preparation, write, disconnect, or unknown
receipt; a captured response does not prove delivery to the caller. Existing
seven-day capture expiry, legal holds, erasure, and bounded unavailable or
truncated states remain in force.

The release image contains one project executable, `/app/server`. It applies
pending PostgreSQL migrations under a database session lock before serving, so
the Compose stack does not need a separate migration container. Multiple server
replicas that share one writable primary serialize this startup step. Keep
ordinary rolling-deployment migrations backward compatible with the previous app
version. The v2.6.1 synchronous Remember migration remains the stopped-service
boundary; v2.6.2 evidence-first activation runs after it. For the v2.6.1
migration, stop every server instance, take the required PostgreSQL snapshot,
and apply the stopped-service boundary before starting the new binary. Independent databases
must each be migrated by a server connected to that database. Administration
stays on the private control portal/API, while dreaming and automatic conflict
review run as server background workers.

The image healthcheck allows the default 30-minute migration window and becomes
active after its first success. If `POSTGRES_MIGRATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` is set
above 1800, override the deployment healthcheck start period to at least the
same duration.

Release candidates use `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` and `demo-vX.Y.Z-rc.N`. Stable releases use
`vX.Y.Z`, `latest`, and `demo-vX.Y.Z`; there is no rolling demo tag.

The server requires complete embedding and verifier configuration at
startup: `AI_API_URL`, `AI_API_KEY`, `AI_API_EMBEDDING_MODEL`,
`AI_API_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS`, and `AI_VERIFIER_MODEL`.
The compose examples provide OpenAI defaults for embeddings; choose the chat
models explicitly in `.env`.

`AI_REMEMBER_MODEL`, `AI_CONFLICT_REVIEW_MODEL`, `AI_DREAM_GRAPH_MODEL`,
`AI_DREAM_EVIDENCE_MODEL`, and `AI_COMMUNITY_SUMMARY_MODEL` are optional
overrides for their existing AI sessions. An unset or whitespace-only override
uses `AI_VERIFIER_MODEL`; a configured model failure is returned without trying
the fallback model.

Verifier and assessor calls send `temperature: 0` by default. Set
`AI_VERIFIER_DISABLE_TEMPERATURE=true` to omit the field for providers or models
that reject temperature.

### Fully Local Setup (Ollama)

Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint can provide embeddings and verification. With
[Ollama](https://ollama.com) running on the Docker host:

```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

```text
AI_API_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1
AI_API_KEY=ollama
AI_API_EMBEDDING_MODEL=nomic-embed-text
AI_API_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS=768
AI_VERIFIER_MODEL=llama3.1:8b
AI_VERIFIER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300
```

Use `host.docker.internal`, not `127.0.0.1`, because the server calls the
provider from the compose network. `AI_API_KEY` must remain non-empty because
startup validation requires a complete provider configuration.

- Set `AI_VERIFIER_MODEL` to a model that exists on the selected chat endpoint.
  Startup validates the model configuration before the service accepts memory
  writes. A 7B-8B class model works for local smoke tests; larger models can
  exceed the default 60-second timeout while they load. Remember runs
  synchronously within the request deadline; use the idempotency key to retry
  after a client timeout or transient provider failure.

## Evidence Lifecycle

`remember` durably stages exact evidence, completes provider validation and the
semantic commit, then returns a terminal result. The response includes the
owner-scoped processing and search state; it does not expose provider output or
internal run IDs.

Callers submit logical Entity, predicate, and Value proposals rather than text
offsets. `remember` does not accept `span`, `surface`, or relationship `supports`
fields. Each optional Relationship lists the zero-based `evidence_indices` that
support it; proposals may be omitted, and their indices do not need to cover every
evidence item. The single assessor session reviews every evidence item for security
and grounds or normalizes only submitted Relationship proposals against their
cited evidence. It never searches memory or discovers Relationships. Closed-schema
validation and deterministic server policy decide what is safe to commit.

Each Relationship may also list up to 20 explicit `known_evidence_ids`. These UUIDs
are resolved only from evidence visible to the caller and remain read-only assessor
context; they do not receive security results. A stored Relationship must still cite
at least one submitted `evidence_indices` span. Entity grounding accepts current
canonical or alias names, and a pronoun only when the assessor is given a server-issued
anchor for an earlier exact name span. Inaccessible or stale known evidence leaves the
Relationship unsupported without revealing whether an ID exists. The aggregate known
evidence content in one request is bounded to 20,000 Unicode code points before
assessor boundary expansion; larger requests return `input_budget_exceeded`. The
current public contract is `dense-mem.v2.6.3`; `dense-mem.v2.6.2` remains accepted
for compatible replays.

To replace a specific current evidence item you own, put its UUID in the new
item's `supersedes_evidence_ids`. Direct targeting is separate from advancing a
source revision with `previous_source_revision`; do not combine them.

```json
{
  "evidence": [
    {
      "content": "Dense-Mem now uses PostgreSQL as its only deployment target.",
      "source_type": "manual",
      "supersedes_evidence_ids": ["<owned-current-evidence-uuid>"]
    }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "ref": "deployment-target",
      "subject": {
        "name": "Dense-Mem",
        "entity_kind": "project"
      },
      "predicate": {
        "proposed_key": "uses_as_only_deployment_target"
      },
      "object": {
        "entity": {
          "name": "PostgreSQL",
          "entity_kind": "product"
        }
      },
      "polarity": "+",
      "evidence_indices": [0]
    }
  ],
  "idempotency_key": "deployment-target-correction-batch-20260729"
}
```

Direct supersession is staged with the complete batch. The target is retired
only inside the accepted semantic transaction; a failed submission leaves it
active. This prevents a replacement that never becomes supported memory from
invalidating current evidence.

Remember uses one assessor conversation for the complete batch. Every evidence
item receives a security result, including evidence-only submissions. Unsafe
evidence fails the complete batch with `submission_policy_rejected` and no
semantic, search, or embedding writes. Safe evidence is stored and indexed even
when no Relationship is proposed or accepted. The assessor may ground and
normalize only submitted Relationship proposals against their cited evidence; it
does not search memory, find support for evidence, or discover Relationships.
Every submitted Relationship ref gets a `stored` or `not_stored` disposition;
unsupported proposals are completed-result warnings. Exact client-owned changes
after staging are reported as `stale_input`. Provider, configuration, database,
and internal faults are typed operational failures. All accepted semantic effects
commit atomically, with no partial replacement or interactive placement review.

Remember requires one top-level `idempotency_key`; evidence-level and derived
keys are not accepted. If a complete batch needs correction, submit the entire
batch again with a new key.

To retract evidence without a replacement, call `retract_evidence` with owned
current IDs, a bounded reason, and an idempotency key:

```json
{
  "evidence_ids": ["<owned-current-evidence-uuid>"],
  "reason": "The source was withdrawn.",
  "idempotency_key": "withdrawn-source-20260729"
}
```

Both operations append lifecycle events. They never physically delete evidence
or trace lineage. Current recall excludes retired evidence, while a historical
`known_at` view before the event can still show what the system knew then.

`correct_relationship` replaces a specific active Relationship owned by the
caller's permanent owner alias. It does not rewrite or delete the original
record. The caller
supplies the current Relationship version, its exact effective evidence spans,
a bounded reason, and only the endpoints or predicate that need correction:

```json
{
  "action": "submit",
  "relationship_id": "<owned-active-relationship-uuid>",
  "expected_version": 1,
  "patch": {
    "object_entity": {
      "entity_id": "<correct-same-team-entity-uuid>"
    }
  },
  "supports": [
    { "evidence_id": "<supporting-evidence-uuid>", "start": 0, "end": 38 }
  ],
  "reason": "The object was resolved to the wrong Entity.",
  "idempotency_key": "relationship-correction-20260808"
}
```

On acceptance, Dense-Mem atomically supersedes the original Relationship,
creates or reuses the active successor, copies the effective support lineage,
and appends the correction event and `corrects` cross-reference. A different
owner in the same team may read team-visible memory but cannot correct the
author's Relationship. Ambiguous Entity names require one owner confirmation;
the original remains active until that confirmation succeeds.

## Recall and Graph State

`recall_memory` is evidence-first but support-path gated. Its `results[]`
contain evidence contexts only after final hydration proves an active,
query-relevant Relationship support path remains eligible for the requested
`valid_at` and `known_at` view. Related Relationships, communities, and
Hypotheses are separate bounded fields; candidates and Hypotheses are not
default memory results.

```text
remember evidence (+ optional Entity/Relationship proposals)
        |
        v
durable staging -> validated terminal commit -> active eligible Relationships
        |                                      |
        +-- lifecycle event -------------------+
                                               |
                                               v
                         support-gated evidence recall and trace lineage
```

## MCP Tool Catalog

Discover the current closed-schema catalog with MCP `tools/list`; callers do
not select a contract version. The server applies the same scope, feature, and
visibility checks to `tools/call`.

| Tool | Used by | Registration | Use case and capability |
|------|---------|--------------|-------------------------|
| `remember` | Both | Production and evaluation images | Production evidence intake; the harness also imports corpus rows through this real intake path. |
| `retract_evidence` | Production | Production and evaluation images | Retire caller-owned evidence while preserving append-only provenance. |
| `correct_relationship` | Production | Production and evaluation images | Owner-only replacement of an active supported Relationship; supersedes the original and preserves support lineage. |
| `recall_memory` | Production | Production and evaluation images | Recall active evidence contexts and Relationship handles. When enabled features produce an actionable follow-up, the result includes `suggested_actions`. |
| `trace_memory` | Production | Production and evaluation images | Trace one same-team Relationship through evidence, decisions, and lineage. |
| `submit_recall_session_feedback` | Production | Conditional in both images | Record bounded session-level recall quality feedback. Registered only while recall feedback is enabled. |
| `list_dreams` | Production | Conditional in both images | List reviewable Hypotheses without treating them as memory. Registered only when Dreaming is effective for the authenticated team. |
| `get_dream` | Production | Conditional in both images | Fetch one authorized Hypothesis and its source references under the same team Dreaming gate. |
| `resolve_dream_feedback` | Production | Conditional in both images | Confirm independently supported or refuted Hypotheses; uncertain items remain unresolved. Uses the same team Dreaming gate. |
| `export_memory_pack` | Production | Production and evaluation images | Export selected active Relationships with support provenance. |
| `eval_list_knowledge_refs` | Evaluation harness | Evaluation image only | Page stable team-scoped knowledge references used to map seed documents to stored records. |
| `eval_run_dream_cycle` | Evaluation harness | Evaluation image only | Run an isolated, bounded manual Dream cycle, optionally with seed Hypotheses, for evaluation. |
| `eval_run_recall_case` | Evaluation harness | Evaluation image only | Execute current recall logic and return ranked/context references for deterministic scoring. |

The private control portal exposes bounded Dream investigation reads at
`/control/api/teams/:teamId/dreaming/runs/:runId/diagnostics` and
`/control/api/teams/:teamId/dreams/:dreamId/diagnostics`. They explain run,
proposal, feedback, and confirmation outcomes without entering the memory
graph. Retained provider projections expire after seven days and report
unavailable or expired captures explicitly.

The production release binary is compiled without the `evaluation` build tag,
so no environment variable or control-panel setting can register evaluation
tools in a live release. The evaluation target adds only the three harness tools
above. `eval_get_manifest`, `eval_get_knowledge_item`,
`eval_list_recall_feedback_events`, `eval_get_recall_feedback_event`, and
`eval_score_retrieval_case` are removed because the current harness does not use
them.

When recall feedback is enabled and the feedback snapshot is stored,
`recall_memory.suggested_actions` points to
`submit_recall_session_feedback` with the matching recall ID. When effective
team Dreaming is enabled and recall returns Hypotheses, it also points to
`resolve_dream_feedback`: confirm true or false only with independent evidence,
and leave uncertain Hypotheses unresolved.

For local evaluation, the committed compose example builds the evaluation
target and loads the ignored repository-root `.env` by default:

```bash
docker compose -p densemem_eval \
  -f examples/docker-compose.evaluation.yml up -d --build

go run ./cmd/eval-seedgen \
  --preset local_eval_100 \
  --out tests/eval/seeds/local_eval_100 \
  --suite tests/eval/suites/local_eval_100.jsonl
```

The `local_eval_100` CLI preset emits the versioned `local_eval_100_v2` seed
identity with 100 corpus rows and 25 scored cases. It is a smoke check for the
evaluation image and harness plumbing, not a replacement for the approved
deterministic 1k release gate. Use `IMPORT_CONCURRENCY=5` for this smoke; the
full evaluation remains configurable up to the harness limit of 10.

Memory-pack export emits the current `dense-mem.memory-pack.v2.4` artifact. Import
and candidate-discovery workflows are not part of the public contract.

## Supported HTTP Surfaces

| Surface | Path | Intended use |
|---------|------|--------------|
| Streamable HTTP MCP | `GET /mcp`, `POST /mcp` | Supported external memory integration contract. |
| User portal | `/ui` and `/ui/api/*` | First-party browser interface. |
| Control portal | `/control/api/*` | Private or dedicated administrative ingress. |
| Health | `/health`, `/ready` | Container liveness and readiness checks. |

There is no supported public REST memory API. Do not automate browser routes or
depend on retired `/api/v1` paths.

## Telemetry Overlay

Prometheus telemetry is optional and off by default. To collect HTTP, embedding,
verifier, assessor, recall feedback, Remember, conflict-review, cost, Dream, and
Relationship lifecycle telemetry, start the base stack with the telemetry
overlay:

```bash
export TELEMETRY_SCRAPE_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
export GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
docker compose \
  -f examples/docker-compose.base.yml \
  -f examples/docker-compose.telemetry.yml \
  -f examples/docker-compose.grafana.yml \
  up -d
```

The telemetry overlay starts Prometheus at `127.0.0.1:9090`, and the optional
Grafana overlay starts Grafana at `127.0.0.1:3000`. It provisions the Prometheus
datasource and dashboards from `examples/grafana/`; use the Grafana time picker
for chart ranges and the `Rolling totals` selector for counters and canonical
ledger windows. Select the Prometheus datasource and bounded scrape job in
Grafana; dashboard JSON contains no credentials or installation-specific IDs.

Existing scoped telemetry metrics retain team and profile labels for the
first-party API. Grafana aggregates them into system-wide values without
selecting or grouping by those labels. New operational metrics add no identity
labels, and metric labels contain no evidence or request text. Missing provider
usage or pricing stays no-data and is called out separately from a real zero.
Ledger collector failure suppresses its gauges and exposes collector health.
Counter measures aggregate across instances and preserve the telemetry service's
sparse first-sample behavior; range rates use Grafana's query step. Durable
ledger gauges use `max` across replicas and never use `rate` or `increase`. The operator dashboards are system-wide
because canonical lifecycle measures carry no team or credential dimensions.

The control Metrics and user Usage dashboards were removed after real Grafana
and Prometheus parity validation. Team-overview request summaries, private
diagnostics, settings, and the control telemetry reader used by conflict-queue
health remain. See [`examples/grafana/README.md`](examples/grafana/README.md)
for provisioning and the series map.

### Grafana series map

`internal/operations/telemetry_catalog.go` defines the retained control
telemetry series and their availability rules. Grafana panel descriptions map
to these identifiers. The metric names and labels remain available to operators.

| Dashboard series | Prometheus source | Owner | Zero and failure meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `http_requests`, `http_errors`, `http_rps`, `http_errors_rps`, `avg_http_latency` | `densemem_http_requests_total`, `densemem_http_request_duration_seconds` | `internal/http/middleware` and `internal/observability` | A successful scrape with no requests is zero; HTTP error and latency series require request activity. |
| `embedding_requests`, `embedding_errors`, `embedding_tokens`, `avg_embedding_latency` | `densemem_embedding_requests_total`, `densemem_embedding_errors_total`, `densemem_embedding_tokens_total`, `densemem_embedding_duration_seconds` | Embedding provider instrumentation in `internal/observability` | Missing provider usage stays unavailable when embedding calls occurred. |
| `verifier_requests`, `verifier_tokens`, `avg_verifier_latency` | `densemem_verifier_requests_total`, `densemem_verifier_tokens_total`, `densemem_verifier_duration_seconds` | Assessor and provider instrumentation in `internal/observability` | Missing provider usage stays unavailable when verifier calls occurred. |
| `recalls`, `avg_recall_results`, `p95_recall_latency`, `recall_results`, `recall_p95_latency` | `densemem_recall_requests_total`, `densemem_recall_results`, `densemem_recall_duration_seconds` | `internal/recall` | Results and latency are unavailable until a Recall request provides a sample. |
| `llm_recall_used_rate`, `llm_recall_answer_supported_rate`, `llm_recall_quality_score`, `llm_recall_missing_context_rate`, `llm_recall_irrelevant_rate` | `densemem_recall_feedback_total`, `densemem_recall_feedback_quality_score` | `internal/recall/feedback.go` | No host feedback is unavailable, not a negative judgment. `llm_recall_feedback_events` is an internal parent activity series. |
| `dream_feedbacks` | `densemem_dream_feedback_total` | `internal/dream` | An ignore count comes from an explicit ignore action; absence of feedback creates no event. |
| `remember_requests`, `avg_remember_duration`, `p95_remember_duration` | `densemem_remember_acknowledgements_total`, `densemem_remember_acknowledgement_duration_seconds` | `internal/remember` | A successful scrape with no acknowledgements is zero. |
| `assessor_requests`, `assessor_request_failures`, `assessor_validation_failures`, `assessor_tokens`, `avg_assessor_duration`, `assessor_duration`, `assessor_terminal_failures` | `densemem_assessor_requests_total`, `densemem_assessor_validation_failures_total`, `densemem_assessor_tokens_total`, `densemem_assessor_duration_seconds`, `densemem_assessor_terminal_failures_total` | Integrated assessor instrumentation | Token usage is unavailable when the provider does not report usage. |
| `ai_cost_usd`, `verifier_cost_usd`, `embedding_cost_usd` | `densemem_ai_operation_cost_usd_total`, `densemem_ai_operation_unpriced_total` | `internal/observability/telemetry_cost.go` | Missing usage, pricing, or rate configuration remains unavailable, not zero cost. |
| `avg_conflict_review_duration`, `conflict_review_duration` | `densemem_conflict_review_duration_seconds` | Conflict-review application | Requires a completed review sample. |
| `conflict_queue_collection_success` | `densemem_conflict_queue_collection_success` | Conflict queue collector in `internal/observability` | Zero means collection failed; queue gauges are omitted on failure. |
| `relationships_<status>`, `relationship_transitions_<status>`, `relationship_corrections` | `relationship_records`, `relationship_transition_events`, `relationship_correction_events` through the lifecycle reader | `internal/operations/postgres` | A successful ledger read with no matching rows is zero; ledger failure is unavailable. Status suffixes follow the current Relationship status registry. |

Additional operational families are `densemem_mcp_transport_requests_total`,
`densemem_mcp_transport_duration_seconds`, `densemem_mcp_tool_results_total`,
`densemem_logical_operation_attempts_total`,
`densemem_logical_operation_duration_seconds`,
`densemem_logical_operation_recoveries_total`,
`densemem_remember_phase_duration_seconds`, `densemem_dream_cycle_attempts_total`,
`densemem_dream_cycle_duration_seconds`, `densemem_dream_provider_attempts_total`,
`densemem_dream_provider_duration_seconds`, `densemem_dream_feedback_actions_total`,
`densemem_recall_hypothesis_expansions_total`,
`densemem_recall_hypotheses_returned_total`,
`densemem_operation_provider_tokens_total`, and
`densemem_operation_provider_usage_unpriced_total`. They distinguish MCP HTTP
status from logical tool outcome, Remember execution/replay/conflict/recovery,
bounded phase and provider usage, Dream run/provider outcomes, Recall hypothesis
expansion, and canonical ledger state. New families use closed labels without
team, profile, request, model, or content values. Their histogram buckets
include the 180-second Remember budget and larger overruns. The canonical ledger collector reports
`densemem_operational_ledger_collection_success`; a zero collection status
means its other gauge families are omitted for that scrape. It uses a
two-second read-only collection deadline.

To compare baseline and candidate overhead, run
[`compare_telemetry_load.py`](tests/eval/scripts/compare_telemetry_load.py)
against isolated deployments with matching data and configuration. It warms
both servers, sends paired authenticated `tools/list` requests, and scrapes
both metrics endpoints during the measured run. It fails when candidate p95
latency or throughput regresses by more than 10 percent. Set a shared
`DENSE_MEM_LOAD_TOKEN` or the per-deployment
`DENSE_MEM_BASELINE_LOAD_TOKEN` and `DENSE_MEM_CANDIDATE_LOAD_TOKEN`; set
`DENSE_MEM_LOAD_SCRAPE_TOKEN` for both metrics endpoints. Use the optional
`DENSE_MEM_BASELINE_SCRAPE_TOKEN` and `DENSE_MEM_CANDIDATE_SCRAPE_TOKEN` when
the two scrape endpoints use different credentials. The JSON receipt is
written under the ignored evaluation runtime directory.

## Responsibility Boundary

| Area | Dense-Mem owns | Host LLM owns |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| Evidence | Exact staging, provenance, lifecycle, and owner checks | Choosing what source material to submit |
| Semantic state | Validation, deterministic policy, support eligibility | Proposing optional Entity/Relationship hints |
| Recall | Active evidence contexts and Relationship handles | Selecting what to cite or ask in the conversation |
| Corrections | Authorized supersession, retraction, and append-only lineage | Deciding whether a correction is warranted |
| Operations | Teams, memberships, credentials, API keys, audit, and portals | MCP client configuration |

## Data Egress and Consistency

Dense-Mem can send evidence text, proposal context, and recall queries to the
configured embedding and verifier providers. Self-hosted providers keep that
traffic within your boundary; hosted providers do not. Embeddings are derived,
versioned state and cannot overwrite newer sources. Startup checks prevent
mixing incompatible embedding models or dimensions.
