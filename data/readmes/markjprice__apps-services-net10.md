## Technologies covered in the book

![Technologies covered in Apps and Services with .NET 10](docs/assets/apps-services-net10-diagram.png)

## Code solutions

Visual Studio, VS Code + C# Dev Kit, and Rider can use the same code solution files and projects for each chapter, found here: [/code](/code). 

> **For VS Code:** To use the chapter solution files with VS Code, install the **C# Dev Kit** extension. Then open the `ChapterNN` folder that contains a `ChapterNN.sln` solution file and wait for the **SOLUTION EXPLORER** pane to appear at the bottom of the **EXPLORER**.

> **Warning!** If you use multiple code editors to open these solutions, then be aware that the build process can conflict. This is because Visual Studio has its own non-standard build server that is different from the standard build server used by .NET SDK CLI. My recommendation is to only have a solution open in one code editor at any time. You should also clean the solutions between closing and opening in different code editors. For example, after closing the solution in one code editor, I delete the `bin` and `obj` folders before then opening in a different code editor.
