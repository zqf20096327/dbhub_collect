# kb — Prolog Knowledge Base

A local-first, hyper-relational knowledge base with content-addressable storage (CAS).
Built as a Master's thesis prototype.

## What it is

- **Hyper-relational graph**: Knowledge is stored as `statement(Subject, Predicate, Object, Properties)`. Subjects and objects can themselves be statements (reification), enabling claims about claims.
- **Content-addressable storage**: Files are staged, SHA-256 hashed, and committed atomically alongside their graph metadata. Deduplication is automatic.
- **Time-travel**: Updates create new statement versions linked via `replaces_id`. `pl history` walks the version chain.
- **Prolog-first**: [Trealla Prolog](https://github.com/trealla-prolog/trealla) is the main runtime. SQLite and Raylib are accessed via C shared libraries loaded through FFI.
- **Interactive GUI**: A Raylib-based graph viewer with image previews, a query bar, and node search.

## Build

**Dependencies**: Clang, X11 (Linux) or Xcode CLT (macOS). Trealla Prolog, Raylib, raygui, and SQLite are included as submodules.

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules <repo-url>
cd kb
make
```

This builds `libcas.so`, `libgui.so`, and `libsqlite3.so` in the project root. Raylib is compiled from source during `make`.

To build Trealla from source:

```sh
cd vendor/trealla && make
```

Then ensure `tpl` is on your `$PATH`.

## Usage

```sh
# Load a context into memory and open a REPL
tpl -l main.pl -- pl load concept(mathematics)

# Assert a new statement
tpl -l main.pl -- pl assert \
  "statement(concept(mathematics), foundation_of, concept(logic), [])"

# Full-text search
tpl -l main.pl -- pl search mathematics

# View version history of a term
tpl -l main.pl -- pl history concept(mathematics)

# Ingest a file into CAS
tpl -l main.pl -- cas add document.pdf

# List CAS objects
tpl -l main.pl -- cas list

# Launch the GUI
tpl -l main.pl -- gui

# Check database consistency
tpl -l main.pl -- pl verify

# Run garbage collection
tpl -l main.pl -- pl gc
```

```

## Data model

Every piece of knowledge is a `statement/4` term:

```prolog
statement(Subject, Predicate, Object, Properties)
```

Subject and Object are Prolog terms or integer IDs pointing to other rows in the `statement` table, enabling arbitrary nesting. The SQLite schema mirrors this with `ANY`-typed columns and a `replaces_id` foreign key for versioning.

Example:

```prolog
% Alice claims (with certainty 0.9) that Bob likes pizza
statement(
  person(alice),
  claims,
  statement(person(bob), likes, food(pizza), []),
  [certainty(0.9)]
)
```

Context loading uses bidirectional recursive CTEs to pull only the subgraph reachable from a seed term into Prolog's in-memory working set.
