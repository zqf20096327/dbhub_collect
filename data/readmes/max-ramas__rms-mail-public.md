## 🖥️ Why Browser-First?

Traditional desktop email clients break down at scale:
- tens of gigabytes of cached mail
- duplicated local databases
- RAM-heavy indexing
- slow synchronization
- poor remote/VPS workflows

RMS Mail moves indexing, synchronization, and storage to the server layer.

Result:
- lightweight clients
- instant access from anywhere
- centralized indexing
- lower hardware usage
- easier backups
- better multi-device workflows

---

## 💡 Why RMS Mail Exists

Modern self-hosted email is still broken. Most webmail clients:
* feel outdated (stuck in 2005)
* become painfully slow on large mailboxes
* have terrible search
* collapse under multi-account workflows
* ignore automation
* bolt AI on top as an afterthought
* force users into desktop apps that cache gigabytes locally

RMS Mail was built from real operational pain:
* many accounts
* millions of emails
* constant context switching
* support-heavy workflows
* browser-first work environments
* AI-assisted operations
* IDE-native automation

**The goal is simple: Make self-hosted email fast, programmable, scalable, and actually pleasant to use.**

---

## 🚀 What Makes RMS Mail Different?

### ⚡ Built for Huge Mailboxes
RMS Mail is designed for:
* tens of accounts
* hundreds of folders
* hundreds of thousands of emails per single mailbox (100K+ validated)
* bulk operations at scale

Unlike traditional IMAP clients: search is locally indexed using native DB engines, metadata is normalized, UI rendering is virtualized, and operations run directly against internal transactional DB pipelines.
**Result:** instant search, smooth scrolling, no IMAP `SEARCH` freezes, and bulk operations executed instantly on huge data sets.

**Multi-client parity:** read, starred, and answered states reconcile with Gmail, Apple Mail, and any other IMAP client — changes propagate in both directions without stale UI.

### Why Go + Next.js?

Go provides predictable memory usage, true concurrency, and low operational overhead.

Next.js delivers a modern browser UI while keeping deployment straightforward.

The combination allows RMS Mail to scale from a Raspberry Pi running Mono to enterprise PostgreSQL deployments without changing the application model.

### 🤖 AI Is Native — Not Bolted On
AI is integrated directly into the Web UI, Telegram, MCP, and IDE workflows. The AI can:
* search your inbox
* summarize threads
* draft replies
* categorize emails
* execute mailbox actions
* operate through tool-calling

**Supported providers:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, DeepSeek, Ollama, OpenRouter, Qwen, XAI, OpenCode.
*(Your providers. Your keys. Your infrastructure.)*

### 🧠 Unified Multi-Account Workflow
Unified edition solves one of the biggest missing features in self-hosted email: Real multi-account workflows.
**Features:** unified inboxes, unified project groups, cross-account search, cross-account bulk actions, unified notifications, centralized AI workflows.
**Designed for:** agencies, freelancers, operations teams, infrastructure engineers, support-heavy environments.

---

## 🧠 The Programmable Inbox

RMS Mail is an orchestration layer, not just a client. Control your mailbox from anywhere:

### 🔌 MCP Server & IDE Integration
RMS Mail ships with a native MCP server. Use your mailbox directly from **Cursor, Zed, Claude Desktop**, custom agents, orchestrators, and IDE-integrated workflows.
Available capabilities:
* `search_emails` (fully isolated by MCP API Key context — keys scoped per mailbox account)
* `get_email`
* `email_agent` (Natural language email operations with native tool-calling maps)

*MCP works behind HTTPS reverse proxies (Mono and Unified): SSE and JSON-RPC on `/mcp/*` through the UI entrypoint.*

*This is not an "AI wrapper" integration. Your mailbox becomes part of your agent ecosystem.*

### 💬 Deep Telegram Integration
RMS Mail includes a deeply integrated Telegram bot.
Capabilities:
* inbox summaries
* instant notifications
* AI-assisted chat
* mailbox search
* quick actions (`/archive`, `/delete`, `/reply`)
* workflow automation
* signed webhook payloads (`{ "event": "email.received", "email": { ... } }`) with HMAC-SHA256

*The same AI + mailbox system works consistently across browser UI, Telegram, MCP, and agents.*

---

## 🛠️ Inbox Mastery at Scale

We fixed the most annoying UX limitations of self-hosted email:

* **Smart Mail Auto-Discovery:** Dynamic Mail Server Resolver automatically discovers IMAP/SMTP hosts, ports, and encryption methods based purely on your email domain. No Thunderbird-style setup hell.
* **Resilient IMAP Sync Batching:** Synchronization queries data in strict 500-UID increments with per-batch checkpoints. Streaming fetch writes raw MIME to disk with bounded memory — safe on 200,000+ message folders and large attachments.
* **Multi-account Gmail on one host:** `IMAP_PER_HOST_CONN` limits concurrent dials to `imap.gmail.com` (not open IDLE sessions); sync status shows real OAuth errors (`invalid_grant` → re-authorize in Settings).
* **Camo image proxy:** external images in newsletters proxied with privacy; broken/marketing-mangled URLs degrade gracefully (no console 502 spam).
* **Newsletter fidelity:** email iframe allows HTTPS stylesheets (Google Fonts, bank CDNs) while keeping scripts blocked.
* **IMAP IDLE + watchdog:** Push sync via IDLE with configurable timeouts and reconnect watchdogs; non-INBOX folders scanned on a schedule (Sent, Archive, Drafts with localized mailbox name detection).
* **Full IMAP flag sync:** `\Seen`, `\Flagged`, and `\Answered` reconcile with the server in both directions; outbound changes batch `STORE` (200 UIDs); opening a message can trigger an immediate flag refresh.
* **Unlimited Bulk-by-Filter Actions:** Works on ANY folder density. Select all emails and apply read/unread/delete mutations instantly. No "visible rows only" limitations. No pagination or heavy JSON processing memory overhead.
* **Real-time inbox & counters:** Server-Sent Events drive the open list, folder badges, and filter counts together — with a 30 s fallback poll when SSE reconnects after sleep or proxy drops.
* **AI categories & rules:** Configurable taxonomy (Settings) with per-category auto-read and auto-move after AI tagging; filter chips in the inbox toolbar.
* **Auto-Draft:** AI can prepare reply drafts in the background; viewer shows a “draft ready” banner with one-click open.
* **Thread Chains (Conversations):** Full Gmail-style conversation threading. Smart grouping with a per-user toggle to switch between classic list and threaded views on the fly.
* **Configurable Send Delay (Undo Send):** Persistent outbound queue — Redis ZSET on Unified (and planned Mono Pro); SQLite `scheduled_emails` on Mono. Graceful shutdown preserves pending sends.
* **Folder management:** Create, rename, and delete IMAP folders from the UI with system-folder protection.
* **Smart Notifications:** Browser push notifications via SSE, Telegram push alerts, AI-priority notifications, Rule-based notifications, and real-time IMAP IDLE events.
* **Command Palette & Custom Hotkeys:** Fully rebindable physical position-based keyboard shortcuts (`event.code` layout independent) with a fuzzy-search command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) for lightning-fast, mouse-free navigation.
* **PWA (Installable App):** Install RMS Mail as a standalone, native desktop or mobile application with isolated windows and OS-level integration.

### Mono Pro (Paid)
> **Mono isolation. Enterprise infrastructure.**

Keeps the **Mono product model**: each user profile maps to **one mailbox**, with no unified multi-account inbox and no cross-account project groups. Swaps SQLite for the **Unified enterprise stack** — PostgreSQL, Redis (AOF persistence), and Asynq-backed async workers (Telegram, avatars, webhooks, scheduled send).

**Best for:** self-hosters and MSPs who want Mono-style 1:1 isolation and licensing, but need PostgreSQL scale, durable Redis queues, and production-grade session/rate-limit infrastructure — without adopting a multi-inbox agency workspace.

**Everything from Mono, on PostgreSQL + Redis, plus:**
* hash-partitioned email storage (PostgreSQL)
* persistent Undo Send & webhook retry queues (Redis ZSET / Asynq)
* strict unactivated limit (1 admin account) with license enforcement
* horizontal-ready job queues (same async foundation as Unified)
* dedicated build and local-testing environments (`run-mp.sh`, `beta-mp.sh`, `bp-mp.sh`)

---

### Unified (Freemium)
> **All your inboxes. One workspace.**

Designed for users managing many inboxes, client accounts, infrastructure mail, support-heavy workflows, and personal + business communication.

🎁 **Summer Promotion:** Use code **`SUMMER15`** before August 31 to get **15% off** on your Unified license.

</p>

---

**Everything from Mono plus:**
* unified inbox & native cross-account PostgreSQL `tsvector` FTS
* unified project groups with live aggregated count subqueries
* 64x Hash Partitioning on emails table for B-Tree safety
* persistent Redis backing (AOF mode) for sessions, jobs and rate limiters
* Asynq task queue — Telegram, avatars, webhooks, scheduled send with retries (`/mon/` dashboard)
* dual PostgreSQL pools — sync workers isolated from HTTP handlers
* OAuth2 Applications configuration layer (BYOA)
* dual unread counters (individual account vs unified inbox)
* centralized notifications
* license enforcement with live backend limits (Free vs Premium)

**Docker images:** `maxramas/rms-mail:u-latest` + `maxramas/rms-mail:u-ui-latest`.

### Teams
> **Email-native collaboration.**

Extends **Unified** (multi-account workspace **and** PostgreSQL + Redis + async workers) for support teams, agencies, and operations teams living inside shared inboxes.

**Mono Pro vs Teams (short):**

| | **Mono Pro** | **Teams** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Product model** | Mono — 1 user ↔ 1 mailbox | Unified — many accounts, unified inbox & groups |
| **Infrastructure** | PostgreSQL + Redis + async | Same (inherits Unified) |
| **Collaboration** | — | Shared mailboxes, assignments, SLA, internal comments, RBAC |

**Everything from Unified plus:**
* shared mailboxes
* assignments
* SLA tracking
* internal comments
* role-based access
* team notifications
* shared automation

## ⚡ Native Database FTS & Performance Pipeline

RMS Mail does not rely on slow IMAP search or memory-heavy external indexing sidecars. Every email passes through a zero-overhead pipeline ensuring instant access even inside massive directories.

```
┌─────────┐     ┌────────────────────────┐     ┌───────────────────────────────┐     ┌─────────┐
│  IMAP   │ ──▶ │   SQLite FTS5 (Mono)   │ ──▶ │  Go Memory Pre-parsing        │ ──▶ │   UI    │
│ Server  │     │ Postgres GIN (U, MP, T)│     │  zstd Raw Payload Compression │     │ (React) │
└─────────┘     └────────────────────────┘     └───────────────────────────────┘     └─────────┘

```

**Pipeline:**

1. Batch-based IMAP synchronization (500 UID chunks) with streaming MIME to disk.
2. Metadata normalization and cross-language UTF-8 strict sanitization.
3. Native full-text index generation (SQLite FTS5 virtual engine / PostgreSQL `tsvector` + GIN).
4. Keyset cursor pagination `(is_pinned, date_sent, id)` — O(1) depth at any inbox offset.
5. PostgreSQL production tuning (v3.1.0): covering index `(folder_id, is_read, is_muted, is_pinned DESC, date_sent DESC, id DESC)` eliminates sort on filtered reads; BRIN index on `date_sent` for compact time-series aggregations; connection pool `min(20, CPU*4)` prevents OOM in Docker; `ANALYZE emails` after bulk sync prevents Seq Scan; `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor = 0.05` triggers vacuum promptly on insert-heavy workloads.
6. Real-time UI virtualization (TanStack Virtual + `measureElement`).

**Result:** typically sub-100 ms text search, instant filter counting, fast bulk operations on six-figure mailboxes.

## 🔒 Production (HTTPS / Reverse Proxy)

After Quick Start, terminate TLS on your domain and proxy to **port 3000** (recommended for both shipped editions). Full nginx / aaPanel examples: **[reverse-proxy.md](./reverse-proxy.md)**.

In `.env`:

```env
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-domain.com
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com
```

**Mono:** point the reverse proxy at **`:3000` only** — the backend stays on the Docker network. Next.js rewrites `/api/*`, `/mcp/*`, and `/internal/*` to Go. Forward `X-Forwarded-Host` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` (`$scheme`) for correct HTTPS MCP links.

For SSE (`/api/events`, `/mcp/sse`):

```nginx
proxy_buffering off;
proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
```

## 💭 Philosophy

RMS Mail is built around several core ideas:

* email should be fast
* email should scale to hundreds of thousands of entries natively
* email should be highly programmable
* email should integrate with AI naturally
* users should strictly control their data storage infrastructure
* self-hosted software should not feel outdated

This project is heavily shaped by support workflows, operational reality, multi-account overload, browser-first workflows, AI-assisted productivity, and real infrastructure constraints.

Good software should remain fast as data grows, not only on day one.

---

## Design Principles

RMS Mail intentionally avoids unnecessary abstractions.

Every subsystem is designed around a few engineering principles:

* predictable latency
* bounded memory usage
* streaming over buffering
* native database capabilities instead of external services
* minimal infrastructure
* backwards-compatible evolution

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

**Current release: v3.1.2 (2026-06-29)** — see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full history.

**Recently shipped:**
* **Docker production i18n fix (v3.1.0)** — standalone Next.js builds now correctly bundle and serve all 45 translation namespaces; resolved `MISSING_MESSAGE` errors in production containers.
* **Priority on-demand mail sync (v3.1.0)** — Unified edition: clicking an account in the sidebar triggers an immediate out-of-band IMAP scan (INBOX + all folders), independent from background workers.
* IMAP `\Seen` bidirectional sync (3.0.4) → full `\Flagged` / `\Answered` parity + reply→answered (3.0.7)
* Streaming sync, keyset pagination, denormalized unread counts, smart-category exclusion (3.0.5–3.0.6)
* AI categories, auto-rules, Auto-Draft, folder management UI (3.0.6)
* Atomic inbox SSE refresh, Docker Hub `maxramas/rms-mail`, Mono single-port HTTPS proxy (3.0.7)
* Webhook payload v2, MCP per-account keys, API hardening (3.0.7)
* IMAP multi-account Gmail: dial-only connection cap, OAuth `invalid_grant` surfacing (3.0.7)
* Camo proxy + newsletter CSS in email iframe; About update channel badge (3.0.8)
* Email body text selection fix; SSE `email_updated` payload with real status fields; `is_pinned`/`is_muted` SSE sync (3.0.9)
* **Mono Pro** edition — Mono isolation on PostgreSQL + Redis + async

Current priorities:

* **Teams** edition launch — collaboration layer on top of Unified
* **Mono Pro**/**Teams** edition ecosystem
* onboarding simplification
* deeper IDE integrations
* more automation workflows
* expanded AI orchestration

## 🔑 Security: Database Encryption & Key Rotation

RMS Mail securely encrypts sensitive data at rest using **AES-256-GCM**.

* **Key Derivation:** Raw keys provided via environment variables are hashed using SHA-256 to guarantee a 32-byte length. Per-domain key separation for IMAP passwords, OAuth tokens, MCP keys, and Telegram tokens.
* **Storage:** A secure, random 12-byte nonce is generated for every database entry. The result is stored as a base64-encoded string (`nonce + ciphertext`) and is fully supported on both PostgreSQL and SQLite.
* **API auth:** JWT via `Authorization` header or `rms_token` cookie — query-string `?token=` is rejected on API routes (legacy MCP SSE paths excepted).
* **Rate limits:** login, global API, AI (30/min), and search (60/min) tiers with Redis or in-memory fallback on Mono.

### Zero-Downtime Key Rotation

The system supports seamless key rotation. The `ENCRYPTION_KEYS` environment variable accepts a comma-separated list of keys (`encKeys` array).

* **Encryption:** The `encryptPassword` function always uses the primary key (`encKeys[0]`).
* **Decryption:** The `decryptPassword` function iterates through the entire `encKeys` array, returning the result from the first key that successfully decrypts the payload.

To rotate your encryption keys without downtime, follow these steps:

**1. Add the new key**
Update your environment variable. Place the new key at the beginning of the list, keeping the old key as a fallback.

```bash
export ENCRYPTION_KEYS="new-secret-key,old-secret-key"

```

**2. Re-encrypt existing data**
Run the application with the `-rekey` flag. This triggers the `store.RekeyAll()` method, which iterates through the `accounts.password_encrypted` and `mcp_keys.key_encrypted` fields. It decrypts each record using the available fallback keys and re-encrypts them using the new primary key (`encKeys[0]`).

```bash
./rms-mail -rekey
# Expected output: "Rekey complete" "re_encrypted"=5

```

**3. Remove the old key**
Once the rekey process is complete, the old key is no longer needed. You can safely remove it from your environment.

```bash
export ENCRYPTION_KEYS="new-secret-key"

```
