**NiceDB is a desktop database client built around one rule: production is read-only until you decide otherwise.**

It connects to PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, MongoDB, Redis, ClickHouse and the other engines listed below, and it is made for the people who open those connections every working day: the software house that looks after its customers' servers, the company whose business system lives in a database. Free software under the GPL, written in Rust with Tauri 2 and Svelte 5.

## Writing to production

Four things stand between you and a production table, in this order.

1. **The stamp.** A production connection is marked wherever it appears: tree, tab, title bar, status line. It opens read-only.
2. **The unlock.** Writing opens for ten minutes, with the time left in view, then locks again by itself. You can choose to keep it open until you disconnect.
3. **The name.** Before a change is applied, NiceDB shows what it touches and asks you to type the connection's name. `UPDATE` and `DELETE` without `WHERE`, `DROP` and `TRUNCATE` ask before they run.
4. **The log.** Every statement that changed something is kept, with who, when, where and how many rows.

Every write passes through one place in the core, so no screen can skip a step. Each one is set in Settings, under Safety.

## A working day

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/readme/plan.gif" alt="A query typed and explained: the plan drawn with its slowest step marked, the step opened, then the same plan as a list" width="100%">
</p>

**Ask why a query is slow.** Explain draws the plan: line width is rows, the marked track is where the time goes, and the notes name the missing index with the `CREATE INDEX` to copy. Plans are read for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, Oracle, Db2, SAP HANA, Firebird, SQLite, DuckDB, CockroachDB, TiDB, ClickHouse, MongoDB, Cassandra and Elasticsearch.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src=".github/readme/activity.webp" alt="Activity: sessions, a blocked UPDATE and the open transaction holding the lock"></td>
    <td width="50%"><img src=".github/readme/er.webp" alt="ER diagram with one table selected and its relations drawn"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>See who blocks whom.</b> Sessions, locks and slow queries, and the session to close.</td>
    <td><b>Read the schema.</b> A selected table draws its relations and lists what points to it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><img src=".github/readme/documents.webp" alt="A MongoDB collection as documents, the selected one as a typed tree"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><b>Open any kind of database.</b> A MongoDB collection opens as documents, a Redis database as keys, an Elasticsearch index takes console requests. The data grid, the editor and the tools adapt to what each engine can do.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The rest of the day is there too: completion that knows the schema, editing in the grid with a dry run before commit, foreign keys to follow, schema and data comparison, test data, backups with each engine's own tools, CSV, JSON, Excel and Parquet import and export, a security check of the server's configuration.

              TiDB · PlanetScale                             MySQL protocol
documents     MongoDB
key-value     Redis · Valkey

others        any database with an ODBC driver
```

</p>

Paste the URL from your provider and the form fills itself; the password goes to the keychain. SSH tunnels with jump hosts, SOCKS5 and HTTP proxies, client certificates and per-workspace variables are in the same form.

## Four styles

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/readme/styles.webp" alt="The same production table in the four styles, dark: Price list, Ledger, Drawing, Signal box" width="100%">
</p>

| Style | Modelled on |
| --- | --- |
| **Price list** | A trading-floor price sheet: dense figures, hairlines and signals. The default. |
| **Ledger** | An account book: ruled paper, pencil and ink. |
| **Drawing** | A technical drawing: film, title block and revisions. |
| **Signal box** | A railway signal box: enamel tiles, lamps and keys. |

One set of controls, drawn four ways. Each style has three palettes, light and dark, and follows the system theme.

## Figures

Measured on a catalog of 20,000 tables and on local servers.

| Measure | Time |
| --- | ---: |
| Interface ready after a cold start | 210 ms |
| First rows on screen, from the server's first byte | 36–55 ms |
| Completion, from key to list | 45 ms |
| Scrolling 1.2 million rows | 60 fps |
| Catalog of 10,000 PostgreSQL tables | 186 ms |
| Catalog of 8,000 SQL Server tables, in one round trip | 0.41–0.50 s |

## Where your data stays

Profiles stay in a local database. Passwords, tokens and key passphrases go to the system keychain, never into a profile or a log. There is no account and no telemetry. The one request NiceDB makes by itself is a daily update check, which you can turn off; updates are signed and installed only when the signature matches the key built into the app.

## Status

NiceDB is young and moves fast. Bug reports and feature requests are welcome in the issues.

**A note on engine coverage.** NiceDB uses mature, well-tested drivers for every engine, and the most common paths are tested against real servers. Still, covering every combination of versions, configurations, extensions and edge cases across 25 engines is a huge job for one person. I use SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL and MongoDB daily; the others get less real-world mileage.

If you use NiceDB, or plan to use it, against production databases, **please be careful**, and report anything that looks wrong: the engine and version, what you did, what you expected and what happened, ideally with a small way to reproduce it. That's how I can fix the problems I can't see from my own setup.

## Platforms

- **Linux** x86_64: binary, AppImage and `.deb`, for distributions with glibc 2.35 or newer and WebKitGTK 4.1.
- **Windows** x86_64: a single `.exe` or a per-user installer, on the system WebView2.
- **macOS**: a universal `.app` for Apple silicon and Intel.

Binaries are not code-signed yet, so SmartScreen and Gatekeeper will ask once before the first start.

## Build from source

You need:

- **Rust 1.98.0**, pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`: rustup installs it by itself on the first `cargo` command.
- **Node.js 22.12** or newer and **pnpm 11** (the exact version is the `packageManager` field of `app/ui/package.json`).
- A C and C++ compiler, CMake and pkg-config.
- On Linux, the [Tauri 2 prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) (WebKitGTK 4.1) and the D-Bus headers.

On Debian and Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential cmake pkg-config libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev \
  libsoup-3.0-dev libjavascriptcoregtk-4.1-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev \
  libxdo-dev libssl-dev libdbus-1-dev
```

On Fedora:

```sh
sudo dnf install gcc-c++ cmake pkgconf-pkg-config webkit2gtk4.1-devel gtk3-devel libsoup3-devel \
  javascriptcoregtk4.1-devel libappindicator-gtk3-devel librsvg2-devel openssl-devel dbus-devel
```

Then, from the repository root:

```sh
pnpm -C app/ui install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm -C app/ui build                    # the interface, embedded into the binary
cargo build --release -p nicedb-app     # target/release/nicedb
```

The first build compiles SQLite, DuckDB and unixODBC from source, so it takes a while and needs a few GB of disk.

To work on the app with the interface reloading as you edit it:

```sh
cd app/src-tauri && ../ui/node_modules/.bin/tauri dev
```

The interface also runs in a browser against an in-memory backend with made-up connections and data, which is where the pictures on this page come from:

```sh
pnpm -C app/ui dev                      # http://localhost:5183/?demo=1&locale=en&style=listino&theme=dark
```

`style` takes `listino`, `registro`, `tavola` or `banco`; `theme` takes `light` or `dark`. Release packages for all three systems are made from Linux with `scripts/build-all.sh linux windows macos`, which builds Linux in a container and cross-compiles the other two.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the checks to run before a pull request, and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) to report a vulnerability.

## Inside

A Rust core (`crates/nd-core`) talks to one crate per engine (`crates/nd-drv-*`) through a common driver contract (`crates/nd-driver`). SQL dialects, quoting and statement splitting live in `crates/nd-sql`, plan readers in `crates/nd-plan`. The Tauri 2 shell is `app/src-tauri`; the Svelte 5 interface, its Italian and English translations and the built-in manual are `app/ui`.
