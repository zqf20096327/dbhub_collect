mxMarkEdit is a free software for Mac for writing texts and todo items in [Markdown format](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) and easily exporting them to other formats with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org), if it’s installed in the system in use. In each document, it’s available an Excel-like grid useful to manage various sets of data, and a file manager to search for a sentence in all the documents or spreadsheets contained in a folder. It’s also possible to use the app as a simple presentation manager. Finally, mxMarkEdit has a built-in bibliographic manager which may use the bibliography stored in the grid to compile the citations within a document in a way that resembles the one used by BibLaTex. Data from Zotero may be imported directly.

The software has been written in [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org) with [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org) and is released under the GPL version 3 license or following, available in www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html. The software runs in English or Italian.

mxMarkEdit *doesn’t use Electron* because of its performance and [security issues](https://medium.com/@flynn.kelseyelizabeth/dont-use-electron-until-you-ve-read-this-article-52d30401303d). The formatting of Markdown text is made by an original algorithm written in Free Pascal.

mxMarkEdit has been deeply influenced by [Org-mode](https://orgmode.org). Although it has far less functionalities and customizations than the latter, it’s a standard Mac app which benefits of Apple artificial intelligence and spell checking, and uses standard shortcuts.

### Privacy

mxMarkEdit does not collect any user data and does not access autonomously to his or her pictures, files or any other personal data. The data created with the app are stored only on the computer of the user and possibly on his or her cloud.

## Formatting

Some Markdown markers are hidden, as the text that follows them or is contained within them is properly formatted. This behavior may be changed in the options of the app. These markers are:

* headers (beginning with `#`, `##`, `###`, `####`, `#####` and `######`);
* italics (`*` or `_`), bold (`**` or `__`) and bold italics (`***` or `___`);
* code, shown in monospace font (`` ` ``);
* citations, which start with the character `>` followed by a space, that are shown with a lighter or darker background, according to the mode in use.

Other Markdown markers are not hidden, but are shown in a different color defined by the user:

* lines of code, shown in monospace font, among two markers `` ``` `` at the beginning of a paragraph;
* footnotes, like `[^1]` and `[^1]: Text of the footnote`;
* inline footnotes, like `^[Text of the footnote.]`;
* links to websites or files, like `[my web site](www.mywebsite.com)`;
* links to pictures, like `![my picture](img.jpg)`.

To show temporarily a picture in the text after its link or in a another window, see below for the proper shortcuts.

The markers cannot be escaped as far as the formatting of mxMarkEdit is concerned. Pandoc should instead manage them properly.

To have a Markdown document properly exported in other formats with Pandoc, the paragraphs must be separated by an empty line, except in the lists, numbered or not.

When a paragraph starts with a list heading (`*`, `+`, `-` or a number followed by a dot and a space), the `Return` key creates a new paragraph with the same heading. The numbered lists are properly renumbered if necessary.

To move a heading and all its relative content, included possible headings of lower level (that is, having more `#` at the beginning), in another position of the text, move the cursor within this heading without doing any selection and cut all in the clipboard with the shortcut `Meta` + `Shift` + `X`. The text in the clipboard can then be pasted elsewhere.

Links are properly recognized and formatted if the formatting is not disabled. Anyway, if they contain some Markdown markers, like `*` or `_`, these markers are hidden, although they are still present and the link works normally when clicked upon. To show the link with all its characters, even possible markers, format it as a line of code including it among two `` ` ``. Anyway, when the link is formatted as a proper Markdown link, like `[my web site](www.mywebsite.com)`, the possible Markdown markers are properly shown.

The formatting should work instantly, without delaying the typing, at least up to about 250,000 characters (test made in a Mac Pro with M1 chip and 8 GB of RAM). To work speedily with bigger documents, disable the formatting and, if necessary, also the titles and todo list (see below the `Edit` menu notes). In this way, even a text of few millions of characters may be modified without any delay in typing.

By default, the app deactivate text formatting for documents bigger than 250,000 characters. This value can be modified in the options of the app (see below) to fit the performance of one’s own Mac. The size of the document is calculated by the size of the file, not counting the characters, so it could be a bit inaccurate.

The inline footnotes should be preferred over the traditional ones, because deleting a reference of a footnote and not the corresponding text or vice versa could compromise the match between other footnotes and their references.

## Titles and todo list

At the left of the text, there’s a list of the titles (starting with `#`) and todo items (starting with `– [ ]`  or `– [X]`). By clicking on an item in this list, the cursor moves to the corresponding title or todo item. While moving the cursor in the text, the corresponding title or todo item is highlighted.

Above this list there is combo box in which it’s possible to select the level of the headings to be shown. The todo items and the heading under which the cursor is located are always shown.

In the todo items, it’s possible to add a deadline. The format of the date should be `year-month-day`, where month and day are always of two digits. The date must be followed by 3 separator characters before the title of the todo item. For instance: `- [X] 2024-12-05 • Buy some food`. The shortcut `Meta + T` mentioned also below insert automatically the todo marker and the deadline in the proper format with a delay in days that is specified by the user in the options of the app (the default is 7 days).

To assign a todo item to one or more resources (persons), insert their names everywhere in the title of the item preceded by `@`; each resource name must end with a space, a period, a comma, a colon or a semicolon. For instance: `- [X] 2024-12-05 • @Mark, @John - Buy some food`, or `- [X] 2024-12-05 • @Mark; @John. - Buy some food`. It will be possible to filter the todo items by resource in the todo form.

## Tables

At the bottom of the text there’s an Excel-like grid of 105 columns and 10,000 rows which may contain simple tables, which are horizontal portions of this grid. This is hidden by default, and can be shown dragging up with the mouse the splitter at the bottom of the text, or with the shortcut `Meta` + `Shift` + `T`. In the first column on the left, named `Tables names`, the user must type the name of a table (e.g. `Books`), and in the columns at its right (`A1`, `B1`, etc.) all the necessary fields (e.g. `Author`, `Title`, `Year`, etc.). The name in the first column is shown with the color of the `headings 2`, while the fields have the color of the `headings 3`. Below the fields, it’s possible to insert any kind of data. It’s possible to add more tables in the grid, adding other names under the `Tables names` column followed by some fields, like in the second screenshot above. To mark the bottom row of a table not followed by another table, type something in the `Tables names` column just after it.

If it’s necessary to insert dates in a field, use the format `year-month-day`, where month and day are always of two digits (e.g. `2025-01-05`), so that the sorting on this field will produce a correct result. See below for some shortcuts useful to insert and change the dates.

The content of the grid is saved in a separate file with the same name of the one in use, but with the `.csv` extension. In this file the items are separated by tabs, and it may be easily imported in a spreadsheet. When the current document is exported to Pandoc, if there are some data in the grid, the software creates a new file with the extension `.export` which contains both the document and the tables properly formatted in Markdown format. In the converted document in Word or Writer format, the tables are located at the end of the text.

When a `.csv` file is loaded, the grid is not automatically shown, but in the status bar at the bottom, after the name of the `.md` file, it’s shown the label `& .csv`, to alert the user that there are some data inside the grid.

In the grid, it’s possible to select more cells dragging the mouse or holding the `Shift` key and pressing the arrow keys. The selected text can be copied in the clipboard and pasted in another position of the grid or in a document, or deleted. It’s possible also to paste some data copied from a spreadsheet like Excel or Numbers. See below for the shortcuts useful to do that. It’s also possible to auto resize the width of the columns with a double click at the right of their headings.

To edit easily a cell in the grid, it’s available an extended editor activated with the shortcut `Ctrl + Space`. In this editor no formatting is available, but the links are properly recognized. At the left bottom there are 4 buttons to show the cell at the left, above, at the right and below the current one, mapped to the shortcuts `Meta + Opt + Left / Up / Right / Down arrow`. To quit the editor, use the `Close` button or press `ESC`.

At the bottom, there’s the `Find` field useful to search for data contained in the grid. Type within it the text to be found and press `Return` or the shortcut `Meta + G` to select the following cell after the current one in just the current field (column) of the current table that contains that text, or `Shift + Return` or the shortcut `Meta + Shift G` to select the previous cell before the current one in just the current field (column) of the current table that contains that text. Anyway, if the selected column is the first, containing the table names, the search will look for the following or previous table name. The search is case insensitive. To continue the search, select again the field and press `Return` or `Shift + Return`, or use the shortcut `Meta + G` or `Meta + Shift + G` when the grid is focused.

At the right of the `Find` field there is the `Filter` field useful to filter the rows of the current table. To activate the filter, write something in this field and press `Return` to filter the rows of the current table which in the current field contain the typed text. Other filters will be added to the existing one(s), to emulate the `and` condition. To clear the filters in the current table and calculate the formulas, clear the content of the `Filter` field and press `Return` or use the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + F`.

In the `Find` and `Filter` fields, numbers must be typed with possible thousand separators.

If a cell contains a formula, in the cell below it will be reported the result of the calculation of all the numbers contained in the previous cells of the same field (column) and of the same table. The result will be updated when a value in those cells will be changed. Textual contents and improperly formatted numbers will not be considered. The name of the table and of the field (column) must be specified, otherwise no result will be shown.

The formulas are the followings:

- `------` or `---sum`: reports the sum of the numbers;
- `---max`: reports the bigger number;
- `---min`: reports the smaller number;
- `---avg`: reports the average of the numbers;
- `---count`: reports the total number of the rows, also nonnumeric;

The formulas are shown in the color set by the user for the code (see below the option of the app for more information). The possible filter doesn’t hide the formulas and the following result fields, and the rows not filtered are not included in the computations. Deleting a row activate the computation of the formulas, but not move a row in another table. Before closing the document, remove the filters from each table, so that the result fields are saved with the values relative to all the data of the column.

It’s possible to sort the content of the current column of the current table with the shortcut `Meta` + `Ctrl` + `S` (ascending) or `Meta` + `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `S` (descending). Numeric content are put before textual ones, and the possible empty lines before numbers. If a formula is present in any column, the sorting is limited to the rows before it. If no formula is present and the table is not followed by another table, with a name in the table names column, it’s necessary to mark the bottom row of the current table typing something in the `Tables names` column just after it.

To replace the content of the grid with the tables contained in a `.csv` file created with mxMarkEdit, use the menu item `File - Import tables...`. To delete the content of the grid so that it’s not loaded any more, delete the related file with the `.csv` extension when it’s not loaded.

See below for some useful shortcuts available in this grid.

## Bibliographic management

mxMarkEdit may be used to manage a bibliography and to insert citations of the books and articles into a document appropriately formatted, in a way similar to BibLaTex. To use this feature of the app, proceed as follows.

### Creating one or more bibliographic tables

In mxMarkEdit, the tables containing a bibliography must be structured as follows.

The first column on the left must contain the name of the table, as usual. Several bibliographic tables may be inserted in sequence with different names to structure the bibliographic material in various areas.

The second column (A1) must contain the key of the work, that is, some words or numbers that identify it uniquely within all the tables contained in the grid. It is suggested to use the surname of the first author followed by a space and the year of publication. If there are multiple works by the same author published in the same year, a progressive lowercase letter may be added after the year. For example, to report the bibliographic data of a book written by R. Taylor in 2024, the key could be `Taylor 2024`. If there were multiple works published by the same author in 2024, the subsequent works would have the key `Taylor 2024a`, `Taylor 2024b`, etc. It is the user’s responsibility to verify that the key assigned to a work is unique, that is, it has not already been assigned to another work. To do this, use the shortcut `Meta` + `Ctrl` + `K`, active just in this column, to make it unique. If the key is composed as `surname + year`, sorting the works by key will sort them by author and then by year.

The third column (B1) must contain the author or authors of the work with the formatting required for the bibliography that will be inserted at the end of the document. In order for the authors to be ordered alphabetically, their surname must be inserted before their name.

The fourth column (C1) must contain the author or authors of the work with the formatting required for footnotes. Normally, the name is bulleted and precedes the surname.

The fifth column (D1) must contain the full title of the work; it’s necessary to insert the italics markers (asterisks) if needed.

The sixth column (E1) must contain the abbreviated title of the work, which will be used for citations of a work after the first; it’s necessary to insert the italics markers (asterisks) if needed.

The seventh column (F1) must contain the details of the citation for the bibliography, such as the publisher, place of publication, year and total pages (not relating to the single citation) in the case of articles or miscellanies.

The eighth column (G1) must contain the details of the citation for the footnotes, such as the publisher, place of publication and year.

In the following columns can be freely insert the data considered useful, also using the extended editor that is activated with `Ctrl + Space`. For example, it may be needed a field in which to insert comments on the work, even of a certain length, or the name of the relative PDF file, a link to the publisher’s website, and so on. The columns after F1 will be ignored by the app for the purposes of compiling citations.

It’s possible to import one or more citations from Zotero in the form `Zotero`, shown by the functionality `Tools` – `Zotero...`. Even if the access to Zotero database is read only, so there is no possibility to change it, it’s better to work on a copy. In any case, check that the path and the file name at the left bottom of the form corresponds to the original Zotero database or to a copy.

In one or both fields `Title contains` and `Author contains`, type some text to be searched for in the Zotero database and press `Return` or click on the button `Find`. The results, that is, the author names and the titles, are shown in the top left grid. Select an item in this grid to have the full citation compiled in the citation field below the grid for the columns A1 – E1, according to the mentioned pattern: the key, the authors and the titles. Check the `Author initial name` checkbox to have only the author initial names and `Titles in italics` to have the titles in italics. Then compile manually the details of the citation for the column F1: double click or press `Return` on the various useful items in the top right grid to have them added in the citation field separated by `|` among two spaces. The field `pages` will be preceded by `#`, which will be automatically removed when inserting the quote in the grid. The text of the quote may be changed directly if necessary. To insert the content of this field in a new row of the grid, click on the button `Insert in grid` or use the shortcut `Meta` + `I`. The key will be made unique automatically. The G1 column will be compiled as the F1, except the pages of articles or sections of books.

Finally, it’s possible to keep and update all the bibliography in just one `.csv` file to avoid scattering it in many files. Then it’s easy to update the bibliographic tables of each other file in use with the latest version of data importing that main bibliographic file with the menu item `File - Import tables...`.

### Inserting citations in the text

To insert a citation of a work in the document, normally in the footnotes, just insert its identification key between two curly brackets, followed by all the detailed elements necessary for the single citation. For example, `Cf. {Taylor 2024}, pp. 23-46.`. It’s necessary to be careful in typing correctly the key of the work to be quoted, respecting uppercase and lowercase. To do this, just display the bibliographic table, identify the key to be reported, copy it in clipboard with the shortcut `Meta + Opt + C` and paste it into the text.

To have visual feedback of the citation related to a key without opening the grid, use the shortcut `Meta + Shift + K` when the cursor is inside the key, that is among the two curly brackets that surround it. Press `Esc` or click outside the preview to close it.

If it’s necessary to quote an ancient text contained in a modern edition and to mention a number or chapter of its passage after the original title, use the key just for the modern work, and quote manually the first. For instance: `S. Augustine, *De Civitate Dei* I, 1-36, in {Augustine 2020}, 50.`. Of course, only the modern edition will appear in the bibliography.

### Producing a document with bibliography

Once the document has been completed and the keys of the various works have been inserted, the menu item `Tools - Compile bibliography` can be used. In this way, mxMarkEdit creates another file in the same folder as the one in use, with the same name and the extension ` - with bibliography`, convert it with Pandoc and open it with the word processor without adding the possible content of the table at the end of the text. In this file, the various keys are replaced by the actual citations of the works, in the following way.

- The first citation of a work is composed by associating the contents of columns C1, D1 and G1.
- The second citation of a work is composed by associating the contents of columns C1, E1 (abbreviated title) and G1.
- If a citation is about the same work as the immediately preceding citation, the word `Ibidem` is inserted in italics in place of its bibliographic data.
- The bibliography is inserted at the end of the text. It contains all and only the works cited in the document, and is created associating the content of columns B1, D1 and F1. The bibliography is ordered alphabetically.
- The contents of the B1 and C1 columns are followed by the `Author separator`, specified in the options.
- The contents of the D1 and E1 columns are followed by the `Title separator`, specified in the options.
- To have the authors formatted in small caps in the text exported with Pandoc, select `Authors in small caps` in the options. To have the same formatting for some text in other fields, use this format: `[M. Regan]{.smallcaps}`.
- To have the authors’ names in the C1 column removed in the repeated citations, include them among two `~` (e.g.: `~M.~ Taylor - ~L.~ Tracy`).

In citations, if an author is the same as the previous one, it is replaced by `Idem`. It is the user's responsibility to verify that the two authors are not homonyms but the same person.

If a `Ibidem` is followed by the same page numbers of the previous citations, they may be removed manually if this is required by the editorial rules.

In case the citations need to be formatted differently to correspond to other methodological requests, correct only the content of the columns and then to regenerate the document with bibliography. So, there’s no need to correct all the individual citations contained in the document.

### mxMarkEdit and other reference managers

As is apparent from these notes, the bibliographic manager of mxMarkEdit, while not having the functionality of more specialized software such as Zotero and Mendeley, is a much simpler and more usable tool, both for those who plan to dedicate themselves to research only temporarily, to simply write a dissertation, and for those who find the system of composing citations based on style sheets too complex and dangerous.

This approach allows to reformat all the citations of a document simply by changing the style sheet in use, but it becomes tricky when there’s no style that perfectly matches the methodological needs of one’s institution or publisher. Furthermore, there is always the risk that in particular cases the style sheet does not give the desired results. The approach used by mxMarkEdit is much more solid, as the citation, even the part that follows the title, is composed by the user in its final form, and therefore is certainly correct. Even if this involves the need to rewrite it if it’s necessary to adapt to other methodological requests, the user never runs into dangerous malfunctions.

So, it's possible to use Zotero as main bibliographic manager and import from its data all the items that are relevant for a specific article or book inserting them in a bibliographic table with the procedures shown above. In this way, one sticks with a solid and fully featured bibliographic manager but may use at the same time the simpler and secure bibliographic system of mxMarkEdit to compile the citations.

Finally, the mxMarkEdit bibliographic database, being contained in a `.csv` file, can always be read and modified, maybe by writing some code, so that it can be imported into other software.

## Presentations

it’s possible to use the app for presentations:

1. load a document, possibly with some tables, containing the sequential text of the slides in Markdown format, with many paragraphs under titles and subtitles, like a normal text;
2. make mxMarkEdit window full screen and enlarge possibly the font size of the document so that it can be seen easily by the participants;
3. share the interface of mxMarkEdit with a video projector or on a video call with apps like Webex, FaceTime or Zoom;
4. use the shortcut `Meta` + `E` to begin the presentation showing the paragraph following the current one, or `Meta` + `Shift` + `E` to do that showing the paragraph previous the current one, both in black or white, according to the theme in use, skipping the empty lines, and fading the other text; when the presentation mode is enabled with one of these two shortcuts, the following or previous paragraphs may be selected also with the shortcuts `Meta` + `Arrow down` and `Meta` + `Arrow up`;
5. comment the content of the paragraph in black or white; the participants see the text that is currently focused, and its position in the structure of the document in the left bar, which anyway can be hidden;
6. if the reference to some tables is needed, show the grid, locate the table and comment its data with the participants using possibly the zoom functionalities of Mac to make visible the small numbers.

In presentation mode, the status bar is hidden, and the spell checking is automatically disabled. To quit the presentation mode, press `Esc` or click anywhere in the text. Possibly, reenable the spell checking.

If in the document there is a link to a picture at the beginning of a paragraph and properly formatted (e.g. `![Data on sales](file:///Users/massimo/Downloads/sales-data.jpg`), that picture will be shown during the presentation in a wider window. To close the picture, click on it or press `ESC`.

Keep the presentation in standard Markdown format, to be able to export it with Pandoc without any trouble, and then create a copy of it optimized for mxMarkEdit with the menu item `Tools` - `Optimize presentation...` if it has to be presented with mxMarkEdit.

To export an mxMarkEdit presentation in PDF so that it can be shown on any computer, save all the screenshots from the current position to the end of the document with `Meta + Ctrl + E`; the text will be scrolled automatically, and it will take 2 seconds to get each screenshot; press `ESC` to interrupt the process. Then select all the screenshots in the `Download` directory, `Ctrl + click` on them and choose the `Quick Options - Create PDF`. The screenshots are numbered progressively. To restart the number of the ones to be created, restart the app. The pictures will not be shown nor exported.

## Files management

The `File - Search in files...` menu item open a form to search a word or a sentence within all the `.md` (document) and `.csv` (tables) files contained in a folder specified by the user, including its possible subfolders. Specify the folder to search in with the button `Set folder`, whose value will be remembered by the app, and then type the text to search for in the field `Find`. Then press `Return` or click on the button `Find`.

The `\n` code finds the `Line feed`, which in macOS or Linux are the paragraph breaks, the `\r` code finds the `Enter` while the `\t` code finds the tabs. In document written on Windows systems, the paragraph breaks are made by `Line feed` + `Enter`.

In the grid above the buttons it will be shown a row for each occurrence of the text to be found both in the documents and in the tables files, along with the context in which it appears (some words before and after it). The columns of the grid – path, file name and context – can be sorted with a click on their headers. Press `Return` on a row of the grid, or double click on it to open the corresponding file and to move the cursor to the position of the text to be found, or, if the file is a `.csv` one, to the cell that contains it.

The search in files returns maximum 100 recurrences for each document or spreadsheet analysed, and stops at 5,000 global recurrences, asking the user to possibly specify more words to find. Emojis too can be searched for. Press `Esc` to stop the search.

Moving the mouse over the label of the file path and name, at the bottom left of the main interface of the app, a hint appears with the complete content, even if in the label it’s truncated due to its length.

## Using the app in a team

The app can be used in a team, giving team members access to the various files. To keep track of who made which changes, use management software like GitHub, manually downloading the files to one's Mac, editing them, and then uploading them again. The app doesn't have any features to simplify this process.

More simply, share the various files on a cloud or a shared folder on a server on a local network, ensuring everyone can access them and only some can edit them. Read-only files should be opened using the `File – Open as read-only...` menu item. If they were opened normally, the app, unable to save them to their original location, might not quit and prompt the user to save them to another location. This option is intended for personal use of the app, to avoid the risk of losing data if it's not possible to save them to their original location.

## Menu items

The last eight opened files are available in the `File` menu. When they are opened, the cursor move to the last position it had during the last editing, and the width of the columns of the grid is restored.

The `File – Open as read-only...` menu item opens a file without giving the user the possibility to edit it. The file name is not added to the list of recently opened files.

The `Edit - Find` menu item opens the standard Apple panel to find and replace text. See below for some useful shortcuts to use these functionalities. 

The `Edit - Insert link to file` menu item allows to select one or more files and to insert their paths and names in the text within the Markdown markers and preceded by the `file://` heading. All the possible spaces are converted with `%20`, so that the file name may be properly recognised as a link. It’s not possible to insert relative links due to macOS restrictions.

The `Edit - Show current title or todo` menu item shows at the top of the left list, after five other items if existing, the title or todo item the cursor is under to.

The `Edit - Show todo form` menu item opens a form with the list of all the todo items. Pressing `Return` or double clicking on one of them selects the corresponding item in the document. Click on the headers of the columns of the form sorts the data, initially sorted by deadline. The date of the expired items is shown in red. The combo list at the bottom allows to show only the todo items assigned to a resource. The check box at the bottom allows to hide the todo items already done. The button `Toggle state` changes the state of the selected todo item from to be done to done, and vice versa. The button `Copy` copies into the clipboard the visible todo items; the values are separated by tab, so that they may be pasted in the grid or in a spreadsheet. See below for the shortcuts active on this form.

The `Edit - Show duplicate words` menu item shows in red all the words of each sentence that are present twice in the same sentence or in the previous one, to alert the user to use possibly a synonym. Moving the cursor or clicking somewhere in the text remove the red color.

The `Show words recurrence form` menu item opens a form with the list of all the words used in the current document, excluded the possible YAML headings (`title:`, `author:` etc.), and their recurrence, that is how many times they appear in the document. By default, the list is sorted by recurrence, but it’s possible to click on the radio item `Sort by words`, at the right bottom, to sort the list by name. Below the grid there is a field in which it’s possible to type the words that should not be considered, like articles, separated by commas. These words are automatically sorted. Below this field, there are some buttons to include the word selected in the grid within the words to skip, to update the results after having changed the words to skip, to copy in the clipboard the content of the grid and to close the form.

The `Edit - Disable formatting` menu item prevents the formatting of the text, except the normal font name, its color, size and line spacing, greatly improving the performance of the app with very large documents. In the options, it’s possible to set the number of characters of a document beyond which it’s loaded without formatting, that is just activating automatically this functionality.

The `Tools - Optimize presentation...` menu item creates a copy of the current presentation optimized to be shown with mxMarkEdit, and saves it with the name of the file in use plus ` - mxMarkEdit` addition. Basically, the various items of first level are separated by an empty paragraph, and the repeated titles of the slides are removed.

The `Tools - Convert with Pandoc` menu item converts the current document and its possible tables into another format specified in the options of the software. The converted file is created in the same folder of the current document.

The `Tools - Convert with Pandoc without table` menu item converts the current document without its possible tables into another format specified in the options of the software. The converted file is created in the same folder of the current document.

The `Tools - Open another window` menu item opens another instance of the software if the app is in the `Applications` directory.

The `Tools - Transparency` menu item activate or deactivate two levels of transparency of the interface of the software, giving the impression to watch or type on a dark or clear glass, according to the mode in use. This functionality is just for aesthetic reasons.

The `Tools - Options` menu item opens the options of the app, where are specified 

- the name and the color of the font of the text;
- the name and the color of the font for code;
- the color of the links;
- the color of the footnotes;
- the color of the todo items;
- the color of the first level titles; 
- the color of the second level titles;
- the color of the other levels titles;
- the size of the normal font;
- the size of the code font;
- the possibility to show the Markdown markers while leaving active the formatting;
- the line spacing value (1.0 is the default);
- the delay in days for the new deadlines (7 is the default);
- the number of characters of a document beyond which it’s loaded without formatting; it’s calculated by the size of the file, not counting the characters, so it could be a bit inaccurate;
- the separators added in the citations between the author(s) and the title;
- the separators added in the citations between the title and the details;
- the option to use *Idem* when the author is the same of the previous citation in the Pandoc output file;
- the option to make the author(s) in small caps in the Pandoc output file;
- the Pandoc options;
- the path of the Pandoc executable;
- the possible template (a file of Word, PowerPoint, Writer, etc.) to use as a reference;
- the format of the file the note should be converted to (`.docx`, `.odt`, etc.);
- two buttons to reset the colors of the text in black and white or in various colors; these colors are different for dark and light mode.

A green or red circle is shown at the right of the fields of the path of the Pandoc executable and of the template to inform that the files are present or not. See the Pandoc manual for more information.

The `Help` - `Shortcuts list` menu item shows a list of all the shortcuts available that are not related to menu items.

## Backup

When a `.md` file that has been modified is closed, a backup copy is created with the `.bak` extension. The same happens for the `.csv` file, with the `.csv.bak` extension.

## Configuration files

The software creates these two configuration files that can be deleted to reset the configuration of the app, included the user defined colors:

- `/Users/[username]/Library/Preferences/mxmarkedit`
- `/Users/[username]/Library/Preferences/mxmarkedit.plist`

# Troubleshooting

- If the app cannot open the Zotero library in the `Documents` or `Downloads` directory, it’s probably a matter of file permission. Open a `.md` file in this folder, give the app the permission to access the folder, quit and run again the app.
- If the title of a document in the YAML section contains a colon, Pandoc cannot translate it in Word, and simply nothing happens. So include the title among two `'` (e.g. `title: 'Light: from nature to art'`).
