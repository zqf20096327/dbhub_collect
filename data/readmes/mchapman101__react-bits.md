# REACT BITS

I put this repo together for folks looking to learn React, primarily at
DevMountain but really for anyone else too.

This repo doesn't address learning ES2015. I have another repo for that purpose,
[here](https://github.com/zacanger/es6-and-builds).

## READ THIS FIRST

[This. Read this.](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

--------

### Editors

You may want to take a moment to get your editor comfortable with JSX.
* For vim, use your plugin manager to get
  [this](https://github.com/mxw/vim-jsx) and don't forget to set `let
  g:jsx_ext_required = 0` in your .vimrc/init.vim.
* For Atom, `apm install react language-babel`.
* For Sublime Text, search for `Babel` in Package Control.
* For VS Code, `tsd install react-global` or `typings install --ambient react-global`

--------

### JSX Gotchas

* Don't try to comment your JSX.
* Don't try `if` statements in your JSX.
* All tags must be closed (including void tags like `hr` and `img`).
  * But, all tags can be _self_ closing (eg `<div />`), which is nice.

### Learn Things

* To get started learning React, I _highly_ recommend [this course](http://survivejs.com).
* [This is another very good beginner's course](http://reactjsprogram.teachable.com/courses/reactjsfundamentals).
* [How-To for Beignners](https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto).
* [a short guide on transitioning from angular to react](https://reactjsnews.com/an-angular-developers-first-react-app).
  * [and additional materials on the same](http://angulartoreact.com/).
* [This](https://www.gorkahernandez.com/blog/build-wikipedia-viewer-react-way) is a good **short** first-time React
  project.
* [Here's a book](https://www.fullstackreact.com), plus an awesome very in-depth [Yelp clone tutorial](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/react-tutorial-cloning-yelp).
* I have some React-related cheatsheets over
  [here](https://github.com/zacanger/doc.git).
* Webpack is awesome, but it's a huge pain. Really. A giant pain.
  [So consider using this.](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/hjs-webpack)
