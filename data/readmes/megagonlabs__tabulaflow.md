TabulaFlow is an open-source data agent built on a modular Python library.
See the [documentation](https://megagonlabs.github.io/tabulaflow/).

Think of it as Claude Code for data: describe in natural language what you want
to analyze, visualize, or transform. It works with all kinds of data, including
SQL and graph databases, files, Hugging Face datasets, Wikidata, and web pages.

Unlike existing coding-agent harnesses, which are built around files and the
shell, TabulaFlow treats tables as first-class citizens, as its name suggests:

- **Agent ergonomics.** The agent writes only queries and visualization
  specifications. TabulaFlow handles data resolution and rendering, so the
  agent never wastes tokens handcrafting data values or HTML to create visual
  artifacts.
- **Human ergonomics.** Data provenance is automatically tracked: each
  visualization exposes its underlying data table, and each table exposes the
  query that produced it.
- **Shell-independent.** The core harness remains fully functional for data work
  even when shell and filesystem access are disabled (e.g., when building
  hosted applications).

Like a general-purpose coding agent, TabulaFlow can also write code, run shell
commands, and browse the web.

## Get started

Install TabulaFlow with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), set a model provider
key, and launch it:

```bash
uv tool install tabulaflow
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
tabulaflow
```

See [Models and providers](https://megagonlabs.github.io/tabulaflow/models/) for
Anthropic, vLLM, and other providers.

We also recommend installing Chromium to enable agent-driven web browsing:

```bash
uv tool run --from playwright playwright install chromium
```

TabulaFlow opens with bundled sample data, so you can start exploring
immediately.

## TabulaFlow as a Python Library

At the core of TabulaFlow is a minimalist, async-native Python library for building
and researching data agents. It was the first thing we built when we started this project because existing libraries
lacked the abstractions we needed. Its building blocks allow you to write agent
logic that runs across different database backends and research benchmarks. The same library
powers the [TabulaFlow data agent](https://megagonlabs.github.io/tabulaflow/).

You can use any of these building blocks to create
data applications with (e.g. data agents) or without an LLM (e.g., interactive dashboards). Choose the
building blocks you need:

- [Data connectors](https://megagonlabs.github.io/tabulaflow/library/data-connectors/): inspect schemas and query SQL
  databases, Neo4j, SPARQL endpoints, files, and datasets through a unified
  async interface.
- [Extraction and enrichment](https://megagonlabs.github.io/tabulaflow/library/extraction-and-enrichment/): turn documents
  into structured records and enrich DataFrames with new fields.
- [Chat sessions](https://megagonlabs.github.io/tabulaflow/library/chat-sessions/): use `ChatSession` to converse
  across multiple data sources, run tools, and stream answers and progress,
  with automatic context compaction for long conversations.
- [Structured outputs](https://megagonlabs.github.io/tabulaflow/library/structured-outputs/): let agents produce tables, charts, maps,
  and graphs as structured artifacts by defining declarative specifications, with optional lazy data resolution for
  parameter-driven interaction.
- [Custom agents](https://megagonlabs.github.io/tabulaflow/library/custom-agents/): combine reusable query, visualization, and
  document tools with your own functions and actions, without adopting `ChatSession`.
- [Schema and result formatting](https://megagonlabs.github.io/tabulaflow/library/api/output/#formatting): turn structured
  schemas and query results into readable text for LLM prompts or human
  inspection.

These building blocks are fully typed and organized into four layers:
`core <- data <- output <- agents`. See the
[API reference](https://megagonlabs.github.io/tabulaflow/library/api-reference/) for how they fit together.

### Quick start

Add TabulaFlow to your Python project:

```bash
uv add tabulaflow
```

With `OPENAI_API_KEY` set, compare sales and support data from separate
in-memory databases, then inspect the structured chart and table results:

```python
import asyncio

import pandas as pd

from tabulaflow.agents import ChatSession
from tabulaflow.data import DataConnectorRegistry, SQLConnector
from tabulaflow.output.specs import ChartArtifactSpec, TableArtifactSpec


async def load_sample_data(sales: SQLConnector, support: SQLConnector) -> None:
    await sales.write_dataframe_async(
        pd.DataFrame(
            columns=["order_id", "region", "revenue_usd"],
            data=[
                (1001, "West", 1200),
                (1002, "West", 800),
                (1003, "East", 900),
                (1004, "East", 600),
            ],
        ),
        "sales",
    )
    await support.write_dataframe_async(
        pd.DataFrame(
            columns=["ticket_id", "subject", "priority", "status"],
            data=[
                (201, "Checkout payment failures", "high", "open"),
                (202, "Invoice downloads unavailable", "high", "open"),
                (203, "Profile image upload issue", "low", "open"),
                (204, "Password reset emails delayed", "high", "resolved"),
            ],
        ),
        "support",
    )


async def main() -> None:
    async with DataConnectorRegistry() as registry:
        sales = await SQLConnector.from_url_async("sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:", read_only=False)
        registry.register("sales", sales)
        support = await SQLConnector.from_url_async("sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:", read_only=False)
        registry.register("support", support)
        await load_sample_data(sales, support)

        async with ChatSession(
            registry=registry,
            model="openai:gpt-5.6-sol",
            reasoning="low",
        ) as session:
            result = await session.run(
                "How does revenue compare across regions, and which high-priority "
                "support tickets are still open? Show revenue as a bar chart "
                "and the tickets in a table."
            )
            print("Answer:", result.text)

            for artifact in result.output.artifacts:
                if isinstance(artifact, (TableArtifactSpec, ChartArtifactSpec)):
                    data = await session.output_store.resolve_artifact_source(artifact.source_id)
                    print("Artifact:", artifact.label)
                    print("Source:", data.metadata.connector_alias)
                    print("SQL:", data.metadata.query)
                    print("DataFrame:\n", data.df)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

`result.text` contains the answer; `result.output` contains structured artifact
specifications linked to their source data.

Query data and inspect its structured schema without an API key. This example
creates an in-memory inventory database and finds products to restock:

```python
import asyncio

import pandas as pd

from tabulaflow.data import SQLConnector


async def main() -> None:
    stock = await SQLConnector.from_url_async("sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:", read_only=False)
    async with stock:
        await stock.write_dataframe_async(
            pd.DataFrame(
                columns=["product", "on_hand", "reorder_point"],
                data=[
                    ("USB-C dock", 3, 10),
                    ("Laptop stand", 18, 8),
                    ("HDMI cable", 4, 12),
                ],
            ),
            "inventory",
        )
        table = stock.schema.tables[0]
        print("Table:", table.name)
        print("Columns:", [(column.name, column.dtype) for column in table.columns])

        result = await stock.run_query_async(
            "SELECT product, reorder_point - on_hand AS units_to_order "
            "FROM inventory WHERE on_hand < reorder_point ORDER BY product"
        )
        if result.error is not None:
            raise RuntimeError(result.error.message)
        print("DataFrame:\n", result.df)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## TabulaFlow for Researchers

TabulaFlow Research extends the main Python library for AI and database researchers working
on text-to-SQL and data agents. Its main building blocks include benchmark
loaders, agents, evaluation metrics, and experiment pipelines. It is
designed around principles that enable flexible, rapid, and transparent
experiments:

- **Benchmark-ready.** Run BIRD-SQL, Spider 2.0, Beaver, ARCS, AMBROSIA-S, and
  CypherBench with managed setup and official leaderboard metrics.
- **Reusable agent logic.** One agent implementation runs on all benchmarks.
- **Transparent and fully typed.** Work with typed tasks, schemas, and
  predictions rather than black-box dictionaries or schema strings. Write
  Python instead of YAML.
- **Async-native for large-scale concurrency.** Task inference, LLM calls, and
  database queries are async and parallelizable, with configurable concurrency
  controls that can make full use of provider limits.
- **Modular and extensible.** Use any building blocks you need, or extend them by
  implementing their public protocols.
- **Built-in tracking.** Record trajectories, token usage, and latency for
  analysis, with optional Langfuse and Phoenix tracing.
- **Simple and performant agents.** Simple yet state-of-the-art agent
  implementations provide a performant starting point.

### Quick start

With the TabulaFlow tool installed and `OPENAI_API_KEY` set, download BIRD-SQL
and run the bundled research example:

```bash
tabulaflow benchmark download bird-sql
tabulaflow examples run research-quick-start
```

To adapt the workflow in your own project, add TabulaFlow with `uv add
tabulaflow`, then run experiments from Python:

```python
import asyncio

from tabulaflow.research.agents import BasicAgentConfig, FullSchemaAgent
from tabulaflow.research.benchmarks import BirdSQLDatasetLoader
from tabulaflow.research.metrics import BirdSQLEx
from tabulaflow.research.pipelines import evaluate_async, execute_async, predict_async
from tabulaflow.research.types import SimpleNL2QTaskOutput


async def main() -> None:
    dataset = await BirdSQLDatasetLoader().get_split_async(
        "dev",
        databases=["california_schools"],
        subsample_size=3,
    )

    try:
        result = await predict_async(
            FullSchemaAgent,
            BasicAgentConfig(),
            dataset,
            batch_size=3,
        )
        await execute_async(result, dataset, batch_size=3)
        first = result.tasks[0]
        assert isinstance(first, SimpleNL2QTaskOutput)
        assert first.pred_query is not None
        assert first.pred_query.exec_result is not None
        print("Question:", first.question)
        print("Predicted SQL:", first.pred_query.query)
        print("Query result:")
        print(first.pred_query.exec_result.df)

        await evaluate_async(result, dataset, metrics=[BirdSQLEx()], batch_size=3)
        print("Execution accuracy:", result.aggregated_eval_metrics["bird_sql_ex"]["avg"])
    finally:
        await asyncio.gather(*(connector.close_async() for connector in dataset.db_connectors.values()))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

To keep the predictions, scores, and readable reports together, save the result
after evaluation inside the `try` block:

```python
result.to_directory("runs/full-schema")
```

The saved run has this structure:

```text
runs/full-schema/
├── result.json
├── result_summary.csv
└── readable/
    └── <qid>/
        ├── task_readable.md
        └── trajectory/
            └── <trajectory-id>.md
```

Inspect queries, scores, agent trajectories, token usage, and latency without
rerunning the agent.
