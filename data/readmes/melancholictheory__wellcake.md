![Status: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-experimental-orange.svg)

A Kubernetes operator for [Valkey](https://valkey.io/). It manages Valkey across
four topologies — **Standalone, Replication, Sentinel, and Cluster** — with
operator-driven failover, proactive zero-downtime rolling restarts, cluster
bootstrap/scale/reshard, S3 backups, multi-region replication, and no-restart
secret rotation.

`wellcake` ships the `valkey-operator` controller plus Helm charts for the
operator and for individual clusters. It is an independent project; the goal is
to replace hand-rolled StatefulSets and chart-based Redis/Valkey deployments with
a single declarative CRD that understands Valkey's failure and scaling semantics.

> **Status:** early / experimental. APIs are `v1alpha1` (served) and `v1beta1`
> (hub/storage). Run it in a non-critical environment first.

## Why

Running Valkey on Kubernetes well means encoding its operational rules — quorum,
failover, slot ownership, reshard safety — into the control loop, not into
runbooks. Generic StatefulSet charts leave those rules to humans. `wellcake`
aims to:

- cover **all four common deployment shapes** behind one CRD, with cluster-mode
  as a first-class topology rather than a bolt-on;
- make **failover and rolling restarts safe by default** — promote a healthy
  replica _before_ taking down a primary, instead of reacting after an outage;
- keep **data-correctness paths** (bootstrap, scale, reshard, restore) atomic and
  idempotent, including Valkey 9.1+ Atomic Slot Migration;
- treat **persistence, TLS, ACLs, backups and secret rotation** as declarative
  spec rather than out-of-band procedures.

## Topologies

| Topology    | Status | Failover                                           |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Standalone  | ✅     | none                                               |
| Replication | ✅     | operator-driven via `REPLICAOF`                    |
| Sentinel    | ✅     | Sentinel quorum                                    |
| Cluster     | ✅     | native gossip + operator recovery on majority loss |

## CRDs

| Kind            | Purpose                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `ValkeyCluster` | Deploy Valkey in one of the four topologies. |
| `ValkeyACL`     | Declarative ACL users on a `ValkeyCluster`.  |

## Features

- All four topologies: Standalone, Replication, Sentinel, Cluster
- **Dual-track profiles**: `Cache` (allkeys-lru, persistence off, 1Gi PVC) and
  `Durable` (noeviction, RDB+AOF, 10Gi PVC)
- **Operator-driven failover** for Replication: TCP survey every 15s, promote the
  replica with the max offset, split-brain protection after a pod-0 restart
- **Split read/write Services** for Replication: a `<cluster>-primary` Service
  resolving to the current primary only (for writes) and a `<cluster>-replicas`
  Service across the replicas only (for reads), driven by a
  `valkey.wellcake.io/role` pod label the operator moves on failover — separate
  from the load-balanced cluster-wide `<cluster>` Service
- **Proactive rolling restart** (ADR 0004, opt-in via annotation
  `valkey.wellcake.io/proactive-rollout: "true"`, default OFF) for Replication /
  Cluster / Sentinel: the StatefulSet switches to `OnDelete`, the operator rolls
  pods one at a time and performs handover (replica promote / `CLUSTER FAILOVER`
  / `SENTINEL FAILOVER`) _before_ restarting the old primary — downtime window
  ~0 instead of the reactive ~15–20s
- **Cluster bootstrap** via a one-shot Job with `valkey-cli --cluster create`
- **Cluster scale-up / scale-down** via `add-node` / reshard-away + `del-node`;
  `autoReshard` (default) rebalances slots automatically, so changing `shards`
  converges with no manual steps; on Valkey 9.1+ resharding uses Atomic Slot
  Migration (ASM, version-gated, ADR 0001) — atomic, no open-slot left behind on
  interruption
- **Per-shard workload** (`spec.perShardWorkload`, opt-in / immutable /
  Cluster-only, experimental): one StatefulSet + Service per shard — enables
  shard-aware anti-affinity and clean shard scale-down (delete the leaving
  shard's StatefulSet)
- **Cluster majority-loss recovery** (ADR 0006): when a Cluster loses more than
  half its primaries at once — the one outage gossip cannot vote a failover
  through — the operator fences the dead primaries (k8s liveness + a data-path
  check) and issues `CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER` on each shard's surviving replica.
  Automatic for Cache, opt-in for Durable (`valkey.wellcake.io/quorum-takeover`)
- **Sentinel** with its own StatefulSet, ConfigMap and Service on port 26379
- **ValkeyACL** — a separate CRD for managing users via `ACL SETUSER ... reset`
  (idempotent through the `reset` token); for Cluster it is applied to all nodes
  of a shard
- **Least-privilege replication user**: replicas authenticate to their primary as
  a dedicated `replicator` ACL user (`+psync +replconf +ping`, no key access)
  instead of the full-access default user, so a leaked replication credential
  can neither read nor write data (reserved against ValkeyACL)
- **S3 backups** (CronJob with `valkey-cli --rdb`, retention, SSE, per-shard for
  Cluster) and restore via `spec.restoreFrom`
- **Multi-region** async replication between clusters via `spec.replicateFrom`
  (including `replicateFrom.caSecret` — the operator merges the local CA and the
  source cluster's CA into a single trust bundle for cross-CA mTLS)
- **No-restart secret rotation**: password rotation in place via annotation
  `valkey.wellcake.io/rotate-password` (live `ACL SETUSER`, no replication blip);
  TLS cert auto-reload on cert-manager renewal (live `CONFIG SET tls-cert-file`)
- **Prometheus metrics** + optional ServiceMonitor and PrometheusRule with alerts
- **`kubectl valkey` plugin** (status / cli / backup / restart / reshard /
  failover / hibernate / certificate / report)
- **TLS** via a cert-manager Issuer or an existing Secret
- **PDB + TopologySpreadConstraints** across zones by default
- **NetworkPolicy** (optional): default-deny + same-namespace + valkey-to-valkey
- **CEL XValidation**: immutable `topology` / `profile` / `storageClassName`,
  expand-only `storage.size`, conditional `shards` / `sentinel`
- **Config hash → rolling restart**: sha256 of `ConfigMap.Data` in the pod template
- **`maxmemory` auto** = 60% of `resources.limits.memory`
- **Version-gated 9.x resilience directives** in `renderValkeyConf` (by image
  version): `cluster-allow-replica-migration no` (Cluster), `shutdown-on-sigterm
failover` (≥9.0), `tls-auto-reload-interval 3600` (TLS + ≥9.1) — overridable
  via `spec.config`
- **InitContainer** for runtime-config generation (no scripts baked into the CM)
- **Always PVC, never emptyDir** — ephemeral-storage pressure can trigger
  eviction, which for an in-memory service means downtime
- **Deletion finalizer** with a topology-aware cleanup hook

## Install the operator (one command)

```sh
make deploy-operator
```

Installs/upgrades the operator via Helm into the `valkey-system` namespace
(created automatically): CRDs + RBAC + Deployment, pulling the image from
`ghcr.io/melancholictheory/wellcake:latest`. Overrides: `OPERATOR_TAG=git-<sha>`,
`OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=<ns>`, `HELM_ARGS="--set webhooks.enabled=true"`. Remove with
`make undeploy-operator`.

Equivalent directly via Helm:

```sh
helm upgrade --install valkey-operator charts/valkey-operator \
  --namespace valkey-system --create-namespace --set image.tag=latest
```

The Helm charts (`valkey-operator` and `valkey-cluster`) are also published to
GitHub Container Registry as OCI artifacts under
[`ghcr.io/melancholictheory/charts`](https://github.com/users/melancholictheory/packages/container/package/charts%2Fvalkey-operator),
so you can install without cloning the repo:

```sh
helm upgrade --install valkey-operator \
  oci://ghcr.io/melancholictheory/charts/valkey-operator
```

> Webhooks (validating / mutating / conversion) are opt-in
> (`--set webhooks.enabled=true`, require cert-manager) and disabled by default.

Operator options:

- `rbac.scope=namespace` or `watchNamespace=<ns>` — single-namespace mode
- `metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled=true` — for the Prometheus Operator
- `--skip-crds` — skip CRDs when managing them via GitOps

## Deploy a cluster (Helm)

```sh
helm upgrade --install my-cache charts/valkey-cluster -n apps \
  --set topology=Replication --set profile=Cache --set replicas=3
```

## Quickstart (out-of-cluster)

```sh
make manifests generate
make install
make run
kubectl apply -f config/samples/cache_v1alpha1_valkeycluster.yaml
```

See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for details.
