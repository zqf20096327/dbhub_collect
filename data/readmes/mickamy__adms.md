> Status: the read / write API and the bundled admin UI both ship, including CSV / JSON export, keyboard shortcuts, an
> a11y pass, and a schema ER diagram.

## TL;DR

Point `adms` at a database and you get two ways in: an HTTP API the frontend can call directly, and an optional
browser-based admin UI hosted from the same binary. No service layer, no codegen, no schema duplicated in two places.

### As an HTTP API

```yaml
# adms.yaml
driver: postgres
dsn: "${ADMS_DSN}"
```

```sh
ADMS_DSN="postgres://postgres@localhost/myapp?sslmode=disable" adms
```

```sh
# list active users, newest first, with their three latest posts embedded
curl 'http://localhost:7777/users?status=eq.active&order=created_at.desc&limit=10&select=id,name,posts(id,title)'
```

```json
[
  {
    "id": 42,
    "name": "alice",
    "posts": [
      {
        "id": 1001,
        "title": "Hello"
      },
      {
        "id": 998,
        "title": "Notes on B-trees"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### As a browser UI

```yaml
# adms.yaml
driver: postgres
dsn: "${ADMS_DSN}"
ui:
  enabled: true
```

```sh
ADMS_DSN="postgres://postgres@localhost/myapp?sslmode=disable" adms
# → open http://localhost:7778/
```

You land on an admin console (light or dark, following your OS) with schema-grouped tables in the sidebar, sortable /
filterable / pageable row views in the main pane, FK-aware embedded rows, inline editing, typed insert forms, CSV / JSON
export, a built-in schema viewer, and a whole-schema ER diagram. No `node_modules`, no separate deploy — the UI is
embedded in the binary.

The same idea drives both surfaces: reads, writes, joins, ordering, paging, counting — all defined by your database
schema.

## Why

Two friction points in every admin tool you have ever built:

1. **The backend is generic, but you keep writing it.** List endpoints with filters, sorting, paging, related rows,
   CRUD — the shape is already in the database schema, but every project hand-writes it again.
2. **The frontend is generic too, eventually.** Once the API exists, the dashboard becomes "tables with filters and
   forms" yet again. Spinning up a React app, picking a component library, and wiring it up is a separate, parallel
   project.

`adms` collapses both into a single binary. It introspects your database on startup and exposes
a [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/)-style HTTP API automatically. Set `ui.enabled: true` in the config and the same
binary serves a complete admin frontend — no extra deploy, no separate codebase.

The closest neighbor is PostgREST itself: excellent, but PostgreSQL only and API only. `adms` aims for **PostgreSQL +
MySQL** and **API + (optional) UI**, with no extra dependencies to install beyond the binary.

## Install

Prebuilt binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows are attached to each
[release](https://github.com/mickamy/adms/releases). Install via Homebrew or `go install`:

```sh
# Homebrew (tap)
brew install mickamy/tap/adms

# go install
go install github.com/mickamy/adms@latest
```

Or build from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mickamy/adms
cd adms
make build
./bin/adms --version
```

## Quickstart

`adms` reads a YAML or TOML config file. With no positional argument it auto-detects `adms.yaml`, `adms.yml`, then
`adms.toml` in the current directory; otherwise pass the path explicitly (e.g., `adms /etc/adms.yaml`). Strings in the
config are expanded from the environment via `${VAR}` / `$VAR`, so secrets stay out of the file.

### PostgreSQL

```yaml
# adms.yaml
driver: postgres
dsn: "${ADMS_DSN}"
```

```sh
ADMS_DSN="postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/myapp?sslmode=disable" adms
```

### MySQL

```yaml
# adms.yaml
driver: mysql
dsn: "${ADMS_DSN}"
```

```sh
ADMS_DSN="user:pass@tcp(localhost:3306)/myapp?parseTime=true" adms
```

On boot, `adms` introspects the target database, builds an in-memory schema model, and starts listening on `:7777`
(override with `listen:` in the config). Every introspected table becomes a resource at `/<table_name>`. With
`ui.enabled: true`, a second listener on `:7778` (override with `ui.listen:`) also serves the bundled admin UI from
the same process.

Verify it works:

```sh
curl http://localhost:7777/                  # schema dump (JSON)
curl http://localhost:7777/healthz           # → "ok"
curl http://localhost:7777/<some_table>      # first 100 rows as JSON
```

## The HTTP API

`GET /<table>` returns rows. Everything else — filtering, projection, ordering, paging, embedding — is driven by URL
query parameters. Writes use `POST` / `PATCH` / `DELETE` with JSON bodies. The shape mirrors PostgREST so existing
clients and mental models transfer.

### Reading data

#### Filters

A filter has the form `?<column>=<op>.<value>`. Multiple filters are AND-combined.

| Operator     | Example                | SQL equivalent                                             |
|--------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `eq`         | `status=eq.active`     | `status = 'active'`                                        |
| `gt` / `gte` | `age=gte.18`           | `age >= 18`                                                |
| `ilike`      | `name=ilike.AL*`       | `name ILIKE 'AL%'` (MySQL: case-insensitive via `LOWER()`) |
| `in`         | `id=in.(1,2,3)`        | `id IN (1, 2, 3)`                                          |
| `is`         | `deleted_at=is.null`   | `deleted_at IS NULL`                                       |
| `like`       | `name=like.al*`        | `name LIKE 'al%'`                                          |
| `lt` / `lte` | `score=lt.100`         | `score < 100`                                              |
| `neq`        | `status=neq.banned`    | `status <> 'banned'`                                       |
| `not`        | `status=not.eq.banned` | `NOT (status = 'banned')`                                  |

Wildcards in `like` / `ilike` use `*` (translated to `%`); `_` remains a single-character wildcard.

```sh
curl 'http://localhost:7777/users?status=eq.active&age=gte.18&deleted_at=is.null'
```

#### Projection (`select`)

By default, every column is returned. Use `select` to pick columns:

```sh
curl 'http://localhost:7777/users?select=id,name,email'
```

Use `*` to mean "all columns of this row":

```sh
curl 'http://localhost:7777/users?select=*,created_at'
```

#### Embedding related rows

`adms` reads foreign keys from the schema and lets you embed related rows by table name in parentheses:

```sh
# user → posts (one-to-many via posts.user_id → users.id)
curl 'http://localhost:7777/users?id=eq.1&select=id,name,posts(id,title,created_at)'
```

```sh
# post → author (many-to-one), with an alias
curl 'http://localhost:7777/posts?select=*,author:users(id,name)'
```

Embeds nest:

```sh
curl 'http://localhost:7777/users?select=*,posts(id,title,comments(id,body))'
```

Embedded relations resolve to JSON arrays for one-to-many, and JSON objects for many-to-one, derived from the FK
direction.

#### Ordering and paging

```sh
curl 'http://localhost:7777/users?order=created_at.desc,id.asc&limit=20&offset=40'
```

`limit` defaults to 100 when omitted and is capped at 1000.

#### Counting rows

To get a total count alongside the page, send `Prefer: count=exact`:

```sh
curl -i -H 'Prefer: count=exact' 'http://localhost:7777/users?limit=20'
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Range: 0-19/1342
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Writing data

All write methods accept JSON bodies (`Content-Type: application/json` assumed).

#### Insert

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:7777/users \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name": "carol", "status": "active"}'
```

```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: /users?id=eq.42
```

#### Bulk insert

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:7777/users \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '[{"name": "dave"}, {"name": "eve"}]'
```

#### Update

`PATCH` requires at least one filter — `adms` rejects an unfiltered `PATCH` with `400 Bad Request` to prevent accidental
table-wide updates.

```sh
curl -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7777/users?id=eq.1' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"status": "inactive"}'
```

#### Delete

Same rule as `PATCH`: a filter is mandatory.

```sh
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:7777/users?id=eq.1'
```

#### `Prefer` header

| Value                                 | Effect                                      |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `count=exact`                         | `Content-Range` header with total row count |
| `return=minimal` (default for writes) | Empty body, `Location` header for inserts   |
| `return=representation`               | Body contains the affected rows             |

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:7777/users \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Prefer: return=representation' \
  -d '{"name": "frank"}'
```

```json
{
  "id": 43,
  "name": "frank",
  "status": null,
  "created_at": "2026-05-21T08:12:00Z"
}
```

### Errors

Errors follow a PostgREST-shaped JSON envelope with adms-specific codes (prefixed `ADMS_`):

```json
{
  "code": "ADMS_UNKNOWN_COLUMN",
  "message": "column \"foo\" does not exist in table \"users\"",
  "details": null,
  "hint": "available columns: id, name, status, created_at"
}
```

| HTTP | code                    | When                                    |
|------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 400  | `ADMS_INVALID_FILTER`   | Bad operator or value format            |
| 400  | `ADMS_UNFILTERED_WRITE` | `PATCH` / `DELETE` without any filter   |
| 400  | `ADMS_UNKNOWN_COLUMN`   | Column name not in schema               |
| 403  | `ADMS_READ_ONLY`        | Write attempted while `read_only: true` |
| 404  | `ADMS_UNKNOWN_TABLE`    | Table name not in (allowed) schema      |
| 409  | `ADMS_CONFLICT`         | DB-level unique / FK violation          |
| 422  | `ADMS_INVALID_BODY`     | JSON body fails column-type validation  |
| 500  | `ADMS_INTERNAL`         | Anything unexpected                     |

### Schema endpoint

`GET /` returns the introspected schema as JSON. A frontend (yours or the bundled admin UI) uses this to render forms,
infer column types, and discover relations without bundling a schema of its own.

```sh
curl http://localhost:7777/
```

```json
{
  "tables": [
    {
      "schema": "public",
      "name": "users",
      "primary_key": [
        "id"
      ],
      "columns": [
        {
          "name": "id",
          "type": "bigint",
          "nullable": false,
          "default": "nextval(...)"
        },
        {
          "name": "name",
          "type": "text",
          "nullable": false
        },
        {
          "name": "status",
          "type": "text",
          "nullable": true
        },
        {
          "name": "created_at",
          "type": "timestamptz",
          "nullable": false,
          "default": "now()"
        }
      ],
      "foreign_keys": [],
      "referenced_by": [
        {
          "table": "posts",
          "columns": [
            "user_id"
          ],
          "references": [
            "id"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## The admin UI

Enabled with `ui.enabled: true` in the config. Off by default, so API-only deployments stay lean. When on, the UI is
served on a **separate listener** (`ui.listen`, default `:7778`) by the same process. The API at `:7777` stays
untouched, with table names occupying the full URL root. The UI calls the same HTTP API documented above, with CORS
auto-configured between the two listeners — it is not a parallel implementation, it is the first-class client of it.

The UI is a single-binary affair: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are embedded into the `adms` executable via `embed.FS` —
including the tree-shaken minified Tailwind CSS bundle, so deployments in closed networks need no external CDN access.
No `node_modules`, no separate frontend deploy. It is rendered server-side with Go's `html/template` and made
interactive with vanilla `fetch` against the same HTTP API documented above.

### What you get

- **Sidebar** — schema-grouped table list with incremental search.
- **Table view** — row list with PostgREST-style filter inputs (kind-aware placeholders, bare values auto-prefixed with
  the kind-default operator), column-header sort, paging, FK arrows that jump to the referenced row, and CSV / JSON
  export of the current filtered query.
- **Keyboard** — `Cmd`/`Ctrl`+`K` opens a fuzzy table palette; `↑` / `↓` move the row selection and `Enter` opens the
  highlighted row.
- **Row detail** — type-aware inputs by column kind (`<select>` for booleans, `type="number"` / `type="date"`,
  `<textarea>` for JSON), outgoing FK link that live-updates as you edit, and a "Referenced by" section listing
  incoming relationships as filtered table views.
- **Edit** — double-click any cell for in-place editing, or open the row in a modal via the row's "edit" button. Both
  paths submit `PATCH /:table?<pk>=eq.<id>` and refresh the visible rows on success.
- **Insert** — kind-aware form on `/t/{table}/new`. Empty inputs are omitted from the POST so column defaults / NULL
  apply.
- **Delete** — confirm dialog → `DELETE /:table?<pk>=eq.<id>`.
- **Schema viewer** — at `/t/{table}/schema`: columns (name / type / nullable / default / generated-or-identity /
  comment), primary key, outgoing FKs, incoming FKs (Referenced by), and indexes (name, columns, UNIQUE, method,
  partial-index predicate). FK / Referenced-by entries link to the other table's schema page.
- **Schema diagram** — at `/schema`: a force-directed ER diagram of every table and its foreign keys; drag to pan,
  scroll to zoom, click a table to open its schema page.

### Design

- **Light and dark themes** — follow your OS preference by default, with a toggle that is remembered per browser.
- **Responsive** down to tablet widths (>= 768px).
- **Read-only gating** — when `read_only: true` the UI hides every write affordance (`+ New`, edit / delete buttons,
  inline-edit, modal, Save / Delete on row detail) and `/t/{table}/new` returns 404.
- **Type-aware forms** — boolean / integer / number / date / JSON / text inputs and the JS value parser dispatch on the
  same Go-side `inputKind` classifier so client and server agree on the column shape.

### Access

The UI calls the same HTTP API you would. Cross-origin calls between the two listeners are handled automatically —
`adms` adds the UI's origin to the API's allowed origins, so you do not need to list it in `cors_origins`. When
`auth.mode` is `static`, the UI carries the resolved token on every request.
When `read_only: true`, the UI hides edit / insert / delete affordances. The UI does not introduce its own login
flow — keep it behind your network or gateway.

## Security

`adms` is designed to sit behind your authn layer (reverse proxy, API gateway, etc.), but it ships several built-in
safety nets so an accidental misconfiguration is not catastrophic.

### Identifier allowlist

Table and column names from query parameters are checked against the introspected schema before they are interpolated
into SQL. Unknown identifiers return `400 Bad Request`, never reach the database, and never appear in error messages
echoed back to the client unsanitized.

### Read-only mode

```yaml
read_only: true
```

Returns `403 Forbidden` for `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`. The admin UI hides write affordances in this mode. Useful for
staging dashboards, demos, or anywhere writes must be impossible by construction.

### Schema and table allowlist

Restrict which schemas (or tables) are exposed:

```yaml
allowed_schemas: [ public, reporting ]
allowed_tables: [ users, posts, comments ]
```

Anything outside the allowlist is invisible — at `GET /`, at the per-table endpoints, and in the UI sidebar.

### Bearer token

```yaml
auth:
  mode: static
  static:
    token_env: ADMS_TOKEN
```

With `auth.mode: static`, `adms` reads the bearer token from the env var named by `static.token_env` and requires
every request to include `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The admin UI carries the token automatically (the resolved
value is exposed via a meta tag that an inline fetch wrapper picks up and attaches to every API-origin request). This
is intentionally simple — a single shared secret. The token value itself never appears in the config file, so it does
not leak into version control. `auth.mode` defaults to `none`, which leaves the API open.

### OIDC / JWT

```yaml
auth:
  mode: oidc
  oidc:
    issuer: https://your-tenant.auth0.com/
    audience: adms
    roles_claim: https://adms/roles   # optional
```

With `auth.mode: oidc`, `adms` validates the `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` on every request against the issuer's
published keys. The JWKS is fetched from the issuer's OIDC discovery document at startup and refreshed automatically on
key rotation, so no key material lives in the config. The signature, issuer, audience, and expiry are all checked; a
token that fails any of them is rejected with `401`. `roles_claim` names the claim carrying the caller's roles (a JSON
array or a space-separated string); it is surfaced on the request principal for future role-based authorization. An
unreachable issuer fails startup rather than silently serving an open API. adms itself has no login flow — obtain
tokens from your identity provider (Auth0, Cognito, Keycloak, …) and present them as bearer tokens.

The bundled UI has no token to forward in this mode (there is no shared secret), so front it with a gateway
(oauth2-proxy, Cloudflare Access, GCP IAP, ALB OIDC) that terminates OIDC and injects `Authorization` on requests to
the API; otherwise the UI's own API calls will be rejected with `401`. adms logs a warning at startup when `ui.enabled`
is combined with `auth.mode: oidc`.

### CORS

```yaml
cors_origins:
  - "https://admin.example.com"
  - "https://staff.example.com"
```

Defaults to no CORS headers, so the API is only reachable from same-origin contexts unless you opt in. When
`ui.enabled: true`, the bundled admin UI's origin is automatically added to the allowed origins — you do not need to
list it here.

### Mandatory filters on writes

`PATCH` and `DELETE` without a `where` clause return `400` — there is no "update every row" path, in the API or the UI.

## CLI

```
adms [config-file]

If the argument is omitted, adms looks for adms.yaml, adms.yml, then adms.toml
in the current directory. Pass a path to use a specific config file.

Flags:
  --version, -v   Print version
  --help, -h      Show help
```

The config file is the single source of configuration — there are no per-setting CLI flags or `ADMS_*` reserved
environment variables. Strings in the config file are expanded via `${VAR}` / `$VAR` from the environment so secrets
(DSN, bearer token, etc.) stay out of source control; the env var names you reference (`ADMS_DSN`, `DATABASE_URL`,
anything you like) are entirely your choice. Unset variables expand to `""`, and literal `$` cannot be escaped, so
put values containing `$` in an environment variable.

## Configuration (config file)

A minimal config:

```yaml
driver: postgres
dsn: "${ADMS_DSN}"
```

TOML works the same way:

```toml
driver = "postgres"
dsn = "${ADMS_DSN}"
listen = ":7777"
read_only = false
allowed_schemas = ["public"]

[ui]
enabled = false
listen = ":7778"
```

Working examples live in [`examples/adms.yaml`](examples/adms.yaml) and [`examples/adms.toml`](examples/adms.toml).

## Why not PostgREST?

Use PostgREST if you are PostgreSQL-only and want a battle-tested project with a large community — it is genuinely
excellent, and `adms` borrows heavily from its URL conventions.

Reach for `adms` when:

- you are on MySQL, or operating a fleet with both PostgreSQL and MySQL, and want one server to manage,
- you want a UI shipped in the same binary as the API, not a separate frontend project,
- you prefer a single self-contained Go binary with no Haskell runtime to deploy,
- you want a tighter scope focused on admin dashboards — opinionated defaults, identifier allowlists, mandatory filters
  on writes — rather than a general-purpose data API.

## Acknowledgements

The URL conventions, the embedding syntax, and the `Prefer`-header semantics in this project are taken almost verbatim
from [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/). The admin UI is styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/),
generated by the standalone tailwindcss CLI and bundled into the binary at build time. Standing on giants'
shoulders — thank you.

## Sponsor

If `adms` saves you time, consider supporting ongoing development
via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/mickamy). Sponsorships pay for the maintenance time that keeps
Postgres / MySQL parity, security fixes, and new features moving.
