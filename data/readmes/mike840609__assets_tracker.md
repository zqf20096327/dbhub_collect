**Open-source, self-hosted net worth & portfolio tracker.**

A private, multi-currency home for tracking your net worth, investments, cash, property, liabilities, and long-term financial goals.

> Formerly Assets Tracker. Same project, now branded as **astt**.

## Why astt?

- **Own your data** — run your own instance with PostgreSQL using Docker or deploy to Vercel and Neon.
- **One financial view** — combine bank accounts, brokerages, crypto wallets, property, liabilities, and options.
- **Multi-currency by design** — keep original balances and view history in your preferred base currency.
- **Current market data** — refresh stocks, ETFs, crypto, options, and exchange rates through supported providers.
- **Planning and automation** — track recurring cash flow, recurring investments, daily snapshots, goals, and FIRE projections.
- **Desktop and mobile** — responsive UI, themes, English/Traditional Chinese, and an installable PWA.

The [Live Demo](https://astt.app) is built from [`src/lib/demo/demo-data.json`](./src/lib/demo/demo-data.json). Import that file through Settings → Restore from backup to load the same sample portfolio into your own instance.

## Quick Start

For production self-hosting with Docker Compose:

```bash
./scripts/setup-env.sh   # writes .env and generates your secrets
docker compose --profile full up --no-build -d
```

The script prints the password you sign in with. It refuses to overwrite an
existing `.env`, and the app will not start while a secret is still the
`.env.example` placeholder.

See [Deployment and Self-Hosting](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for required environment variables, HTTPS, backups, upgrades, Vercel + Neon, and other production details.

Developing astt locally? See the [Development workflow](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Install with AI

Prefer to let an AI coding agent handle the setup? Paste this prompt into your agent:

> Install astt by following the guide: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mike840609/assets_tracker/master/docs/INSTALL_WITH_AI.md

The guide covers both local development and production self-hosting.

## How It Compares

<details>
<summary><b>How astt compares to Ghostfolio, Firefly III and Actual Budget</b></summary>

astt focuses on net worth and investments. If you mainly want double-entry bookkeeping or envelope budgeting, [Firefly III](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii) and [Actual Budget](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual) are excellent at that — here is where each tool fits:
