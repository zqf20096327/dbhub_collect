> **Send transactional email from your own server.** No subscriptions. No per-email pricing. No vendor lock-in.

A self-hosted alternative to SendGrid, Resend, and Postmark: built in TypeScript on Bun + Elysia, with a REST API, web dashboard, DKIM signing, an email queue with retries, webhooks, templates, inbound SMTP, and Gmail-style trash. Ships in a single Docker container.

## Why BunMail?

| | BunMail | SendGrid / Resend | Postal | Mailcow |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Self-hosted** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Free** | ✅ MIT | $20/mo+ | ✅ MIT | ✅ |
| **API-first** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ (mail hosting) |
| **One container** | ✅ | n/a | ❌ (multiple services) | ❌ (heavy stack) |
| **Modern stack** | Bun + Elysia + Drizzle | n/a | Ruby + RabbitMQ | PHP + many services |
| **Web dashboard** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Templates** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Inbound SMTP** | ✅ | $$ | ✅ | ✅ |

BunMail targets developers who want a **programmatic transactional email API** and nothing else: Postal is heavier, Mailcow targets full mail-server hosting with end-user webmail, and the SaaS options charge per email.

## Quick Start (60 seconds)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohamedboukari/bunmail.git && cd bunmail
cp .env.example .env
echo "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 16)" >> .env
docker compose up -d
```

Then seed your first API key and send a test email:

```bash
docker compose exec app bun run src/db/seed.ts
# copy the bm_live_... key it prints

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/emails/send \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer bm_live_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from": "hello@yourdomain.com",
    "to": "user@example.com",
    "subject": "Hello from BunMail",
    "html": "<p>It works.</p>"
  }'
```

Open the dashboard at <http://localhost:3000/dashboard> (set `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` in `.env` to enable).

> Local dev without Docker? See [docs/self-hosting.md](docs/self-hosting.md).

## Will my mail land in inbox?

**Honest answer: it depends on your sending setup, not on BunMail.** Self-hosted transactional email is a reputation problem, not a code problem.

- ✅ **You'll land in inbox** if you send from a domain with a clean reputation, your server's IP isn't on a blacklist, and you've published correct SPF / DKIM / DMARC records (BunMail handles SPF/DKIM/DMARC for you, see [docs/self-hosting.md](docs/self-hosting.md)).
- ⚠️ **You'll likely land in spam** if you send from a brand-new `.xyz`/`.top`-style domain on a fresh budget VPS IP. That's not a BunMail bug: Gmail and Outlook penalise both factors heavily for any sender.
- 🛠️ **Workarounds:** warm up your domain over 2 to 3 weeks (low volume, real recipients), or plug in a reputable SMTP relay (Postmark, SES, Resend) as the actual sender while keeping BunMail's queue, dashboard, and templates. *Relay mode is on the [roadmap](https://github.com/mohamedboukari/bunmail/issues).*

## Features

- **Direct SMTP delivery**: sends straight to recipient MX servers, no relay needed
- **SMTP submission**: apps (Infisical, Netbird, Dify, any Nodemailer backend) send *through* BunMail over SMTP using an API key as the password; switch an app off SendGrid/Brevo with a credentials-only change ([docs/smtp-submission.md](docs/smtp-submission.md))
- **DKIM signing**: auto-generates 2048-bit RSA keys per domain
- **SPF / DKIM / DMARC verification**: DNS checks built into the dashboard
- **Email queue**: Postgres-backed with 3 retries, crash recovery, and exactly-once delivery semantics
- **Templates**: Mustache-style `{{variable}}` substitution
- **Webhooks**: HMAC-signed events with timestamp-bound replay protection: `email.sent`, `email.failed`, `email.bounced`, `email.received`, `email.complained`
- **Inbound SMTP**: receive and store incoming mail with DNSBL, recipient validation, and per-IP rate limiting
- **Inbound notifications**: per-domain "you have new mail" summary email on receive, DKIM-signed from the recipient domain; opt-in via each domain's `notify_email`
- **API key auth**: SHA-256 hashed Bearer tokens with sliding-window rate limiting
- **Trash + auto-purge**: Gmail-style soft delete on outbound and inbound, restorable until purged after `TRASH_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 7)
- **Suppression list**: per-API-key list of addresses we refuse to send to; gate runs at `POST /emails/send` so bounced/unsubscribed recipients can't re-tank IP reputation
- **DMARC aggregate report ingest**: daily `rua` reports from Microsoft / Google / Yahoo are auto-parsed (gzip / zip / raw XML) and surfaced in the dashboard so misaligned source IPs are visible at a glance
- **Web dashboard**: server-rendered (Elysia JSX), bulk operations, real-time stats (24h sent, success rate, queue depth)
- **OpenAPI 3.0**: interactive docs at `/api/docs`
- **Type-safe**: strict TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, no `any`

## API Endpoints

All endpoints (except `/health`) require `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>`. Full reference: [docs/api.md](docs/api.md).

                              Recipient MX servers (port 25)
```

Inbound mail arrives via the built-in SMTP server (port 25/2525), gets parsed by `mailparser`, and is stored in `inbound_emails`. Webhooks fire `email.received` on inbound and `email.sent` / `email.failed` on outbound. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for full diagrams.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run dev            # start dev server (--watch)
bun test               # run all tests
bun test test/unit     # unit tests only
bun test test/e2e      # integration tests only
bunx tsc --noEmit      # type check (TypeScript 7, native)
bun run lint           # oxlint (type-aware)
docker compose up -d   # full stack with Postgres
```

## Deliverability Setup

For inbox placement on Gmail / Outlook / Yahoo, you need:

1. **A clean sender domain**: older, no spam history.
2. **A clean IP**: check at [mxtoolbox.com/blacklists](https://mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx).
3. **PTR (reverse DNS)** matching `MAIL_HOSTNAME` in `.env`.
4. **SPF, DKIM, DMARC records**: BunMail's dashboard tells you exactly what to publish per domain.
5. **Patience**: fresh domain + IP combos take 2 to 3 weeks of low-volume sending to build reputation.

See [docs/self-hosting.md](docs/self-hosting.md#dns-records) for the exact DNS record values.

## Roadmap

Active issues: [github.com/mohamedboukari/bunmail/issues](https://github.com/mohamedboukari/bunmail/issues)

Near-term highlights:

- Webhook delivery persistence + replay (in-memory retries today)
- Trash purge tombstones for audit trail
- Optional SMTP relay mode (use Resend / SES / Postmark as the underlying sender)
- Bun-native SMTP client (subsumes per-domain TLS observability and `requireValidCert`)
