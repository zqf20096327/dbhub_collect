## Features

Track monthly budgets with variable-income support, fixed expenses, a daily transaction log, and a spend/invest split that adapts automatically to your income history. The dashboard gives a live view of total equity, budget health, asset allocation, and a running net worth chart.

Assets covers your investment portfolio, property equity, crypto, and cash reserves with tax-aware calculations and a 15-year growth projection. The loan calculator handles first-time buyer, homeowner, and buy-and-sell scenarios with full amortization schedules and tax benefit calculations. Supports NOK, USD, or any custom currency, and ships with full Norwegian and English translations.

## How to run it

Three ways to run Headroom. All of them keep your data on your own machine, with nothing in the
cloud and no account to create. Pick one:

| | Best for | What you need |
|---|---|---|
| **[A. Download the app](#a-download-the-app)** | Anyone who just wants to use it | A Mac or Windows PC |
| **[B. Docker](#b-docker)** | Keeping it always-on, on a laptop, server or NAS | Docker |
| **[C. Build it yourself](#c-build-it-yourself)** | Changing the code, or preferring not to run a binary someone else built | Node 24 and git |

They are the same application. The desktop app runs the same server, the same SQLite database and
the same backups as the container, only wrapped so it starts on its own.

## A. Download the app

Download it from the [latest release](https://github.com/mortennordbye/headroom/releases/latest)
and open it like any other program. No Docker, no terminal.

| Your computer | File to download |
|---|---|
| Mac with Apple chip (M1 and newer) | `Headroom-<version>-arm64.dmg` |
| Mac with Intel chip | `Headroom-<version>.dmg` |
| Windows | `Headroom-Setup-<version>.exe` |

Not sure which Mac you have? Click the Apple menu, then **About This Mac**. If the Chip line says
Apple, take the arm64 file.

### Installing

**macOS** — open the `.dmg` and drag Headroom into the Applications folder, then eject the disk
image.

**Windows** — run the `.exe`. It installs for your user only, so it does not ask for an
administrator password, and it adds a Start menu and desktop shortcut.

### The first time you open it, your computer will warn you

The app is not signed with a paid developer certificate, so neither system recognises who published
it. The warning is about an unknown publisher, not about anything found in the app. You have to
tell your computer once that you meant to open it:

**Windows** — "Windows protected your PC" → click **More info** → **Run anyway**.

**macOS (Sequoia / macOS 15 and newer)** — double-click Headroom. macOS refuses and offers only
**Done**. Click it, then go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll to the Security
section where it says Headroom was blocked, and click **Open Anyway**. Confirm with Touch ID or
your password. (On macOS 14 and older you can instead right-click the app and choose **Open**.
Apple removed that shortcut for unsigned apps in macOS 15.)

You only do this once. After that it opens by double-clicking like anything else.

Want to check the file is the one CI built before you run it? Every release also carries a
`SHA256SUMS.txt`. Compare it against your download with `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt` (macOS:
`shasum -a 256 -c`), or on Windows `Get-FileHash Headroom-Setup-<version>.exe` in PowerShell.

Would rather not click past a security warning at all? [Build it yourself](#c-build-it-yourself).
An app compiled on your own machine never triggers it.

Your data is stored on your own computer and never leaves it:

- **macOS** — `~/Library/Application Support/Headroom/data`
- **Windows** — `%APPDATA%\Headroom\data`

That folder also gets the same automatic daily backups as the Docker version (see
[Backups](#backups)). To move to a new version, download the new file and install over the old one.
Your data is in a separate folder, so it is untouched.

## B. Docker

The way to run it always-on, or on a machine that isn't a Mac or Windows PC. All you need is Docker:

- **macOS / Windows** — [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (free).
- **Linux** — [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name headroom \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8080:3001 \
  -v headroom_data:/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/mortennordbye/headroom:latest
```

Open **http://localhost:8080** and you're done — **no config files, no environment variables required.**

- The `--restart unless-stopped` flag means it comes back automatically after you reboot, so it's always there when you open the browser.
- Everything you enter is saved in the **`headroom_data`** volume on your machine. It survives restarts, reboots, and updates (see [Updating](#updating) and [Data persistence](#data-persistence)).

**Later, want it on a home server or another device?** Change the port binding (`-p 8080:3001` for all interfaces, or map it into a reverse proxy) — nothing else changes. Read [Security](#security) first: there's no login, so don't expose it to the open internet without a proxy or VPN in front.

## C. Build it yourself

Nothing here is a black box. Both the container image and the desktop installers are ordinary
builds you can reproduce with the same commands CI runs.

**As a container** (also needs [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mortennordbye/headroom.git
cd headroom
make build              # builds the image and starts it on http://localhost:8080
```

**As a Mac or Windows app** (needs [Node 24](https://nodejs.org/)):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mortennordbye/headroom.git
cd headroom
npm install
npm run build           # builds the frontend

cd desktop
npm install             # also rebuilds the SQLite binding for Electron
npm run dist            # installer lands in desktop/release/
```

`npm run dist` builds for the machine you are on. It packages the server and the frontend into the
app, then checks that they really are inside it (`npm run verify`, which the build runs for you).

Worth knowing: an app you built yourself **does not show the unidentified-developer warning**. That
warning is triggered by the quarantine flag your browser attaches to a download, and a file you
built locally never has one. If the warning is what puts you off the release download, building it
yourself sidesteps it entirely.

For how the wrapper works and how releases are cut, see [`desktop/README.md`](desktop/README.md).

## Updating

New versions never touch your data. To move to a newer version:

**The desktop app (A):** it tells you. On launch it checks whether a newer release exists and, if so,
offers to open the download page — or to skip that version and stop asking about it. You can also
just download the new installer from the
[latest release](https://github.com/mortennordbye/headroom/releases/latest) yourself. Either way,
install it over the old one: your data sits in a separate folder, so it carries over untouched.

The check asks GitHub for the latest release number and nothing else — it sends no data about you and
nothing about your finances. If it cannot reach GitHub it stays quiet.

**Docker (B) — pre-built image:**

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/mortennordbye/headroom:latest   # get the new version
docker rm -f headroom                                # remove the old container (NOT the volume)
docker run -d \
  --name headroom \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8080:3001 \
  -v headroom_data:/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/mortennordbye/headroom:latest              # start the new one, same volume
```

**From source (C):**

```bash
git pull
make build
```

Because you re-attach the same `-v headroom_data:/data` volume, or reuse the same Docker Compose volume via `make build`, **all your budgets, transactions, and settings carry over untouched.** Only `docker-compose down -v` or deleting the volume by hand ever removes data.

> **Tip:** before a big update, it costs nothing to take a snapshot first — `make backup`, or **Settings → Export** in the app (see [Data persistence](#data-persistence)).

> **Pinning to a specific version (and rolling back).** `:latest` always moves to the newest build. Every CI build is *also* published under an **immutable `sha-<short-commit>` tag** — e.g. `ghcr.io/mortennordbye/headroom:sha-0112d73`. Pin to one for a reproducible deploy, and if an update misbehaves just start the previous `sha-` tag again (same volume, your data is untouched): swap `:latest` for `:sha-<short>` in the `docker run`/`docker pull` commands above. Browse the available tags on the [package page](https://github.com/mortennordbye/headroom/pkgs/container/headroom).

> **Browser shows an old version after updating?** The app is a PWA and caches itself. Accept the "new version available" prompt, or hard-reload (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+R). Your data is unaffected — this is only the UI cache.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make build` | Build image and start (also rebuilds if already running) |
| `make up` | Start without rebuilding |
| `make down` | Stop all containers |
| `make restart` | Restart without rebuilding |
| `make backup` | Copy the SQLite database to `./backups/` (timestamped) |
| `make mcp-install` | Register the [AI access (MCP)](#ai-access-mcp) server with Claude Code |

## Local development (without Docker)

_For contributors hacking on the code — if you just want to **use** Headroom on your laptop, use [How to run it](#how-to-run-it) above instead._

For iterating on the frontend you can run the API and Vite dev server directly:

```bash
npm install
node server/index.js          # API on :3001 (writes to ./data)
npm run dev                   # Vite on :5173, proxies /api → :3001
make seed-local               # optional: seed ./data with demo data
```

`npm test` runs the Vitest suite; `npm run lint` runs ESLint.

## AI access (MCP)

Headroom ships a local [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server
(`mcp/`) that lets an AI assistant (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, …) read your financial
data, compute insights, and make guarded changes. It runs on **your machine over stdio**
and talks to the running app's local API — nothing is exposed to the network.

- **Numbers match the app** — the tools reuse Headroom's own tested `src/lib` math.
- **Writes are safe** — every change goes through the same `/api/data` guards as the UI
  (validation, optimistic-concurrency `rev`, whole-blob preserve) and touches exactly one
  slice, so it can't quietly drop the rest of your data.

Set it up (with the app running via `make up`):

```bash
make mcp-install                 # registers it with Claude Code (this project)
# override the app URL if needed:
make mcp-install HEADROOM_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

Then restart Claude Code and ask it something like *"give me a financial overview"* or
*"where can I improve my budget?"*. For Claude Desktop, or the full tool list and env
options, see [`mcp/README.md`](mcp/README.md). Remove it with `make mcp-uninstall`.

If the app has the [optional password](#optional-password) enabled, set
`HEADROOM_PASSWORD` in the MCP server's env so it can authenticate.

## Security

Headroom has **no login by default** (there's an [optional password](#optional-password) below) — it's built for single-user self-hosting, and anyone who can reach the port can otherwise read and overwrite your entire financial picture. So there are exactly **two safe ways to run it:**

1. **Local only (default).** The port binds to `127.0.0.1` (loopback), so the app is reachable only from the machine it runs on. This is the recommended setup for a laptop.
2. **In a locked-down homelab, reached over a private tunnel.** Host it on a home server and get to it through **WireGuard**, **Tailscale**, or a VPN — nothing is exposed to the public internet, and only your own devices (including your phone) can reach it.

**Do not put it directly on the open internet.** If you want it reachable from a browser without a VPN, it must sit behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Traefik) that adds authentication (basic auth or an SSO/identity layer) — and ideally HTTPS.

Only change the port binding to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) if you understand that this exposes unauthenticated access to everyone who can reach that network.

**Optional hardening:** set `ALLOWED_HOSTS` (see [Configuration](#configuration)) to reject requests whose `Host` header isn't one you expect — a small guard against DNS-rebinding. It's off by default so the app works behind any hostname without configuration.

### Optional password

A single shared password can gate the app (single-user, so it's one password — not user accounts). **Off by default.** Two ways to turn it on:

- **In the app:** Settings → **Access** → set a password. Stored only as a `scrypt` hash.
- **Via environment:** set `AUTH_PASSWORD` (e.g. a Kubernetes Secret). This forces auth on and takes precedence over the in-app setting, which then shows as "managed by server". Unset it to hand control back to the app.

Sessions last 90 days (an httpOnly cookie). Health checks (`/healthz`) stay open. This gates the app's API — it is **not** a substitute for the reverse-proxy / VPN options above, and a password sent over plain `http://` on an untrusted network is weak, so only rely on it behind HTTPS. If you forget the password: unset `AUTH_PASSWORD`, or clear the `auth_config` row in the SQLite DB (or delete the DB to start fresh).

## Use it on your phone

Headroom has a full mobile layout and is a **PWA (installable web app)** — you can add it to your phone's home screen and it opens fullscreen with its own icon, just like a native app. There's nothing to install from an app store.

**This only works if your phone can reach the server.** That rules out the laptop-only setup (`localhost` is just the laptop) — you need the **homelab + private tunnel** option from [Security](#security): host it on a home server and connect your phone over **WireGuard** or **Tailscale** first. Then open the app's address (e.g. `http://headroom.local` or the server's IP) on the phone.

**iPhone / iPad (Safari)** — iOS only installs web apps from Safari, not Chrome:

1. Connect your WireGuard/Tailscale tunnel so the phone can reach the server.
2. Open the app's URL in **Safari**.
3. Tap the **Share** button (the square with an upward arrow).
4. Scroll down and tap **Add to Home Screen**.
5. Keep the name "Headroom", tap **Add**.

It now sits on your home screen and launches fullscreen in the mobile view.

**Android (Chrome):** open the URL, tap the **⋮** menu → **Install app** / **Add to Home screen**.

> **HTTPS recommended.** For the full PWA experience — offline app-shell caching and the "new version" update prompt — serve it over HTTPS (a reverse proxy with a certificate, or Tailscale's HTTPS). Over plain `http://`, iOS still lets you Add to Home Screen, but the service worker (offline caching) won't register.

## Configuration

All optional — the defaults are sensible and nothing needs to be set.

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `DATA_DIR` | `/data` (in Docker) | Where the SQLite database is stored. |
| `PORT` | `3001` | Port the server listens on inside the container. |
| `BIND_HOST` | _(unset — all interfaces)_ | Address to bind to. The desktop app sets `127.0.0.1`; in Docker the loopback restriction comes from the port mapping instead. |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | _(unset — all hosts allowed)_ | Comma-separated hostname allowlist, e.g. `finance.example.com,localhost`. When unset, no host filtering is applied. |
| `AUTH_PASSWORD` | _(unset — auth off)_ | When set, forces the [optional password](#optional-password) on with this password, overriding the in-app Settings toggle. |
| `DEMO_MODE` | _(unset — off)_ | Set to `1` to run this instance as a [public read-only demo](#public-demo-mode). |

## Public demo mode

**A live one runs at [headroom.nordbye.it](https://headroom.nordbye.it).**

`DEMO_MODE=1` turns an instance into a public showcase — something you can link
from a blog post and let strangers click through, without them reaching any real
data or leaving anything behind.

The demo is filled from `src/lib/demoData.ts`, a fictional dataset built to
exercise the whole app rather than just render non-empty: an 11-year career
across three employers with raises, promotions and a job change; bonuses,
overtime and hours-worked history; imported payslips for the recent months
alongside tax-estimated older ones; roughly six months of categorised
transactions across two accounts, with categorisation, label and transfer rules
applied; budgets that sit both under and over; property, second-home scenarios,
pension, debts and goals. Transaction dates are relative to the day you open it,
so the current month is always populated and nothing is ever dated in the future.

What changes:

- **The API is closed to writes.** Every non-GET request under `/api/` is refused
  with `403`, and the whole `/api/bank/*` namespace is refused outright (its GETs
  aren't safe reads — one proxies to Enable Banking on the instance's own
  credentials, another completes a bank link). This is enforced server-side in
  `server/demo.js`, so it holds no matter what a client sends.
- **Each visitor gets their own sandbox.** The app detects demo mode at boot (via
  `GET /api/config`) and fills itself with the fictional dataset in
  `src/lib/demoData.ts`, generated in the browser. It never fetches or posts
  `/api/data`. Visitors can edit anything; their changes stay in their own tab and
  disappear on reload. No visitor can affect what another sees.
- **The UI drops what doesn't apply.** No exit-demo button (there is no real data
  behind it), no password settings, no restore points, no SQLite-backup restore,
  no "delete all data". A "Reset sample data" button puts the dataset back.
- **No background jobs.** Rotating backups and scheduled bank sync are both
  skipped — a demo instance has nothing worth backing up and no bank to sync.

A demo instance needs no persistent volume; give it ephemeral storage and no bank
credentials. Run it as a **separate instance** from your real one — `DEMO_MODE`
protects the API, but pointing it at your own data volume still serves that data
to the internet on `GET /api/data`.

```yaml
# docker-compose snippet for a demo instance
environment:
  DEMO_MODE: "1"
  ALLOWED_HOSTS: "demo.example.com"
```

## Data persistence

Everything you enter lives in one SQLite database inside the named Docker volume **`headroom_data`** on your machine — there is no browser storage and nothing in the cloud. The volume is independent of the container, which is what makes your data stick around.

**Your data survives:**
- Stopping/starting the app (`make down` / `make up`, or `docker stop`/`start`)
- Rebooting your laptop
- Updating to a new version (see [Updating](#updating))

**Your data is only removed if you explicitly delete it:**
- `docker-compose down -v` (the `-v` deletes the volume), or
- `docker volume rm headroom_data`

### Backups

The volume is the only live copy, so keep a backup — three options:

1. **Automatic rotating snapshots (on by default).** The container writes a timestamped SQLite snapshot into `/data/backups` on a schedule and prunes to the newest N, so you always have recent copies without remembering to run anything. Tune via `docker-compose.yml`: `BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS` (default `24`, set `0` to disable) and `BACKUP_KEEP` (default `7`). These live on the same volume, so pair them with an occasional off-volume copy (below).
2. **In-app export (best, portable).** **Settings → Export** downloads your entire state as a single JSON file. This is the safest backup: it's independent of Docker, survives losing the volume, and can be imported on a fresh install or a different machine via **Settings → Import**. Because it holds your full accumulated transaction history, an occasional export is a complete backup.
3. **Database snapshot (off-volume).** `make backup` copies the live SQLite file to the host `./backups/` (timestamped, gitignored).

> **No backup carries the bank connection — on purpose.** `make backup` copies `/data/database.sqlite` and nothing else, and the JSON export holds your finance data alone. The Enable Banking link lives beside the database as its own files in the volume (`eb-config.json`, `eb-session.json`, `eb-pending.json`, `eb-key.pem`, `eb-master.key`), and it is left out of both because those files hold OAuth tokens and a private key — credentials that have no business sitting in a file you copy around or hand to another machine. They stay in the volume, so this only shows up when you restore onto a fresh one (see [Restore](#restore)).

### Restore

Both paths open a **preview** first, where you pick which sections to restore (income & work, budget & spending, assets/debt/goals, settings) — the rest of your data is left untouched — and a safety copy of your current data is downloaded before anything is replaced.

- **From a JSON export:** open the app and use **Settings → Import** (drop the file or browse).
- **From a SQLite snapshot (in-app):** **Settings → Import → "restore from a SQLite backup (.sqlite)"**, then pick a `make backup` file. The server reads the finance blob out of the uploaded database and hands it to the same import preview — no terminal needed.
- **From a SQLite snapshot (manual):** `docker cp backups/<file>.sqlite headroom:/data/database.sqlite && make restart` (for the pre-built image, replace `make restart` with `docker restart headroom`).
- **From an automatic snapshot:** list them with `docker exec headroom ls /data/backups`, copy one out with `docker cp headroom:/data/backups/<file>.sqlite ./backups/`, then use either SQLite-restore path above.

> **Restoring onto a fresh volume? Link the bank again.** All your money data comes back, but the bank connection does not — its credential files were never in the backup (see [Backups](#backups)). Nothing announces this: the app looks complete and simply stops pulling new transactions. Go to **Settings → Bank sync**, re-enter the Enable Banking application ID, callback URL and key, and connect the bank again. Transactions already in the restored data are kept; the sync picks up from there.

> Bank sync only reaches ~90 days back per fetch, but stored transactions are never dropped — they accumulate as you keep syncing. So your history keeps growing on your machine, and an export captures all of it. Sync regularly (don't leave gaps longer than ~90 days) and export now and then, and you have a durable, ever-growing record.

### HTTP API

The app is a thin JSON API over the single-blob store (no per-field endpoints). It's **unauthenticated by default** (single-user, loopback-bound — see [Security](#security)) unless you enable the [optional password](#optional-password); either way, don't expose it to an untrusted network. The endpoints the UI drives:

| Method & path | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `GET /healthz` | Liveness probe (touches the DB). |
| `GET /api/version` | Running `version` + build `sha`. |
| `GET /api/config` | Server-side switches the client needs before it decides how to boot (currently just `demoMode`). |
| `GET /api/data` | The whole finance blob; `X-Data-Rev` header carries the revision. |
| `POST /api/data` | Overwrite the blob (shape-validated, last-write-wins with an optimistic-concurrency `X-Data-Rev` check → `409` on a stale write). |
| `POST /api/restore` | Restore helper: upload a `make backup` SQLite file (raw body, `application/octet-stream`); the server opens it **read-only**, extracts the `headroom` JSON blob and returns `{ data }`. **It never writes** — the client applies it through the normal import preview/confirm. Rejects a non-SQLite / non-Headroom file with `400`. |
| `GET /api/history` | Recent revisions (metadata only), newest first — backs the Settings restore-points card. |
| `POST /api/history/:rev/restore` | Re-commit a past revision as the new current state (itself recorded in history, so a restore is reversible). |
| `GET /api/auth/status` | Whether the optional password is enabled, its source, and whether the current session is authenticated. |
| `POST /api/auth/login` | Verify a password and set the session cookie. |
| `POST /api/auth/logout` | Clear the session cookie. |
| `POST /api/auth/config` | Enable/disable the optional password (or change it). Refused once it's env-forced. |
| `GET /api/inflation?from=YYYY-MM&to=YYYY-MM` | SSB CPI series (cached; `stale` flag when served from cache). Add **`&force=1`** to bypass the once-per-hour upstream-fetch cooldown for a user-initiated refresh. |
| `GET /api/wage-stats` | Curated national median-wage series. |
| `GET /api/kvmpris?postnr=####&type=…` | Average m²-price + sale count for the kommune a postnummer belongs to, by dwelling type (SSB) — backs the Loan page's estimated property value. Same cache/cooldown/serve-stale shape as inflation. |
| `GET /api/policyrate` | Norges Bank key policy rate series — backs the Loan page's compare-rate card. Same cache/cooldown/serve-stale shape as inflation. |
| `GET/POST/DELETE /api/bank/*` | Enable Banking transaction sync (`status`, `aspsps`, `link`, `callback`, `sync`, `config`, `key`, `connection/:id`) — see `scripts/enable-banking/`. |

## CI/CD workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| [**CI**](.github/workflows/build.yml) | Push to `main`, PRs, manual | Typecheck, lint, test, then build and push the Docker image to GHCR |
| [**Release**](.github/workflows/release.yml) | Push to `main` | release-please keeps a release PR open; merging it cuts the release and attaches the desktop installers |
| [**Desktop build**](.github/workflows/desktop-build.yml) | All PRs, manual | Builds the Mac and Windows installers so a break surfaces before release. Installers build only when a PR touches what they package; the `Desktop installers` check reports either way, so it can be a required check |
| [**Dependency Review**](.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml) | PRs | Blocks PRs that introduce known-vulnerable dependencies |
| [**Scorecard**](.github/workflows/scorecard.yml) | Push to `main`, weekly | OpenSSF supply-chain score published to the Security tab |
| [**Container Scan**](.github/workflows/container-scan.yml) | Push to `main`, weekly | Trivy scan of the image; findings to the Security tab |
| [**Dependabot**](.github/dependabot.yml) | Weekly | Grouped dependency-update PRs (npm root, `server/`+`desktop/` paired, GitHub Actions, Docker). Security fixes and non-major bumps [auto-merge](.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml) once the required checks pass |
