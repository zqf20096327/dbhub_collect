---

Claude Code, Codex and Cursor each keep their sessions in their own format, on
whichever laptop happened to run them. The work one developer's agent does is
invisible to everyone else's, and to that developer's own agent next week, in a
different tool. Every session starts cold and re-derives a decision somebody
already made.

Motif collects all of it onto a server you host, and hands it back when it is
needed.

## Install

```bash
npm i -g getmotif        # the binary is `motif`
motif up                 # server + live sync on 127.0.0.1:4680
motif mcp install        # register with Claude Code, Codex and Cursor
```

That is the whole setup. Your existing sessions import on first run and your
agents can query them immediately, no account, no cloud, no API key, and nothing
leaves the machine. Prefer not to install anything? `npx getmotif up` does the
same thing. Node 22 or newer.

Want to see it populated before pointing it at anything real?

```bash
npx getmotif demo        # a team's week replays live, in five acts, you rule, the Weaver acts
```

Sessions stream in, memory catches two of them contradicting each other, you
pick the winner from the terminal, and the Weaver aligns a real (throwaway) git
repository with your ruling, the diff on screen. No reader runs; your own
history is never opened.

## How it works

Motif works in three movements, **remember**, **verify**, **act**, and every
verb under them is a command you can run today.

### Remember

### 01 · Collect, one memory for the whole team

A small daemon watches Claude Code, Codex and Cursor on every machine and streams
sessions to your server as they happen, attributed to the person and the tool
that produced them. Nothing leaves your infrastructure, and there is no telemetry.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/motif-Labs/motif/main/docs/assets/overview.png" alt="The Overview: the team's week of sessions, the decisions it produced, and what still needs a human" width="880" />
</p>

<p align="center"><sub>The whole team's memory at a glance: the week's activity, the latest decisions, and what needs a human.</sub></p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/motif-Labs/motif/main/docs/assets/dashboard.png" alt="Every member's sessions across Claude Code and Codex, on one timeline" width="880" />
</p>

Joining a team shares nothing by default, everything uploads as `personal` until
you say otherwise:

```bash
motif projects team ~/work/payments-api      # this project goes to the team
motif projects exclude ~/personal --purge    # this one never does
```

### 02 · Ask, the agent that lived it answers

A collected archive is still an archive. Asking is what makes it a participant.
`ask` resumes a past session **read-only on the machine that owns it**, so the
answer comes from the agent that had the full context, not from a summary.

```bash
motif ask 4f2a9c "what did we rule out here, and why?"
```

It works on your own sessions and, with a teammate's daemon running, on theirs.
Claude Code and Codex sessions can be asked; Cursor has no resume command, so
Cursor sessions are collected and searchable but not askable.

### 03 · Recall, and your agents query it themselves

```console
$ motif recall "why do we fail open when the token service times out"

# Team context for "why do we fail open when the token service times out"

## From past sessions

**Auth middleware fails open when the token service times out, make it fail closed.**
@ben, 12 days ago · `claude-code:88b19192`
> Flipped it to fail closed, with one carve-out: the internal health route keeps
> working so the load balancer does not pull every node when the token service blips.

**The public API has no rate limiting, and it has to survive a restart.**
@ada, 3 weeks ago · `codex:99bfccc0`
> Fail open, and log loudly. Rejecting live payment traffic because a cache is
> unreachable is worse than briefly serving unlimited requests. ADR-014.

230 tokens from 5 sessions. Cite session ids when you use this.
```

Two teammates, two different tools, one answer with the reasoning still attached.
**Your agents get the same bundle over MCP, without being asked**, you are not
meant to open a dashboard. One command registers Motif with all three:

```bash
motif mcp install
```

| tool                                | what it does                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `recall`                            | the distilled answer, decisions, human notes, cited excerpts, ~1.5k tokens |
| `search_sessions` · `list_sessions` | find the session                                                           |
| `get_session`                       | read a transcript                                                          |
| `ask_session`                       | **put a question to a past session**, the agent that lived it answers      |

`ask_session` is the unusual one: your Claude Code agent can question a Codex
session from three weeks ago, and the machine that owns it answers.

And in the other direction, from the code back to the conversation:

```bash
motif blame src/limiter.ts     # which sessions produced this file, freshest first
```

"Why is this like this" starts from the file itself: each hit names the person,
the tool, the session, and `motif show` opens the conversation.

**Measured, not asserted.** Against **1.77M tokens** of real session history,
`recall` answers **8 of 9** questions inside a 1,500-token budget, a median
bundle of 1,496 tokens, **1,186× smaller** than the history it searched.
Reproduce it on your own corpus with `npm run bench`, or on the built-in demo
corpus (same numbers on any machine) with `npm run bench:demo`.

Every claim carries one **confidence** number, corroboration and a human's vouch
raise it; conflict, staleness and age lower it, and recall ranks and labels by
it, so an agent knows how much to trust each line.

No embeddings, no vector store, no API key. Ranking comes from full-text search
over the graph the sessions already form, handoff lineage, shared files, shared
entities, plus the notes people pinned. Every item says why it was picked.

### See it, the record as a graph

Everything the sessions form, decisions, files, topics, and the sessions that
produced them, is a graph, not a list. The **Weave** view draws it: entities
are diamonds, sessions are dots, and edges are the real relationships (a session
that informs an entity, a note that contests another, a handoff lineage). It is
the same graph recall walks to answer in ~1.5k tokens instead of the whole
history, now visible. Two entities a single session both touched are drawn as
**related**, so decisions and the files and topics they shaped form one causal
weave, and each entity is sized by its confidence. The same idea seen in two
projects is one knot, not two, so cross-project ties pull together. Hover any
node for its kind, confidence and how many ties it holds.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/motif-Labs/motif/main/docs/assets/weave.png" alt="The Weave: a team's decisions, files and sessions drawn as one graph, with a hovered node showing its confidence and ties" width="880" />
</p>

### Verify

### 04 · Decide, every decision, with the reason still attached

As sessions go idle the server distils them into entity notes: the decisions, the
files they touched, the topics they belong to, each carrying the reasoning it came
from. New knowledge **supersedes** old rather than overwriting it, and
contradictions are **flagged** instead of quietly piling up. A team session
becomes shared memory; a personal one becomes memory only its owner can recall,
so distillation earns its keep whether you run a team or work alone.

```bash
MOTIF_LLM_PROVIDER=claude-code motif server      # uses your local CLI, no key
# or: anthropic · openai · openai-compatible (Ollama, vLLM, OpenRouter)
```

This is the one part that calls a model, and it is off unless you configure a
provider.

### 05 · Verify, memory that earns its trust

Distilled memory is a machine's claim about what your team decided. Claims age,
and sessions contradict each other. Motif refuses to paper over either: a
contradiction is **flagged**, a note whose source files were reworked without it
is marked **possibly stale**, and both wait for a person in the Review inbox,
in the dashboard, or:

```bash
motif memory review                    # proposals, conflicts (both sides), stale notes
motif memory admit 52                  # a proposed team decision enters recall
motif memory reject 52                 # ...or it never does, kept in the record
motif memory prefer 47 --over 12       # rule: this claim wins, that one is superseded
motif memory confirm 31                # vouch for a claim, verified beats machine-only
motif memory retire 8                  # out of service, never out of the record
```

A new team **decision** does not enter recall on its own: it lands as a
**proposal** and waits for a human to admit it, so no single session's (or a
whole fleet's) inference becomes what the team relies on unreviewed. Files,
topics and personal notes are admitted on sight; conflicts are adjudicated as
before.

Rulings never delete, and the ruling itself is recorded, who ruled, over what,
and why. Recall serves the outcome: retired notes disappear, human-verified
ones outrank machine-only ones, and an unresolved conflict is shown to agents
with both sides and a warning, never as one quiet wrong answer.

### Act

### 06 · Weave the record back into the repo

A ruling fixes the memory; the repository can still say what the losing claim
said. And the record can see changes the repo never tested, a fix or a feature
that shipped with no test. The **Weaver** closes both, on projects you opt in:

```bash
motif weaver enable ~/work/payments-api    # let the Weaver act here (draft PRs only)
motif weaver scan                          # untested fixes and features it could close
motif weaver run src/limiter.ts            # write the missing test → draft PR
```

When a ruling lands, or you queue a gap, a daemon holding the project claims the
job, works in a **throwaway worktree**, and opens a **draft PR** on a `motif/`
branch, the ruling or the session that made the change cited in the body. The
rails do not bend: your checkout is never touched, a default branch cannot be
pushed, an agreeing repo produces no PR, and a job born from personal evidence
is never queued. The agent is handed the record's own context, the session that
made the change, so it writes the change instead of searching for it: pointed at
a receipt a human picked, never wandering, and cheap because it reads the graph
rather than the whole tree.

The loop closes: `motif weaver resolve <id> merged|closed` records a PR's fate,
and a fix born from a ruling that gets **closed** returns that ruling to review,
the record learning from what its own hands produced.

### 07 · Move, any agent, any teammate

None of this asks anyone to change tools. A session started in one agent continues
natively in another: Motif writes the target tool's own session file and registers
the thread in its state database, so the tool opens it as its own history.

```bash
motif handoff 4f2a9c --open                # continue it here, in the other tool
motif handoff 4f2a9c --to-member "Ada"     # hand it over, lands in THEIR tool
```

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/motif-Labs/motif/main/docs/assets/handoff.gif" alt="Handing a live Claude Code session to a teammate, who picks it up in Codex" width="820" />
</p>

<p align="center"><sub>One command hands a live Claude Code session to a teammate. Their daemon materialises it as a Codex<br />thread on their own machine, and <code>codex resume</code> opens it as history, not as a paste.</sub></p>

</p>

<p align="center"><sub>The same conversation inside Codex on the other machine, including the question asked<br />a minute earlier in Claude Code. Codex answers about work it never did.</sub></p>

Claude Code ⇄ Codex in both directions, verified against Codex 0.151.0. Cursor
sessions convert into either. The tool is a preference; the memory is shared.

## You do not need a team

None of this needs one to be worth running. `motif up` on a single machine makes
your own history queryable **and distils your own sessions into memory you can
recall**: the decision you made three weeks ago, in a tool you have since stopped
using, answered from the session where you made it, with its reasoning and
confidence attached, and `handoff` moves that session into whichever agent you
use now.

Your solo work stays yours. A personal session is distilled into a **private**
memory only you can recall; if you later join a team it stays owner-only, never
shown to anyone else, never counted toward another note's confidence, and never
able to supersede a shared decision. The benchmark above was measured on one
developer's corpus.

## Running it for a team

One server per team, one daemon per machine.

```bash
# on the server
docker compose up -d                       # or: MOTIF_TOKEN=<token> npx getmotif server

# on each developer's machine, once
npx getmotif connect https://motif.internal.yourco.dev \
  --token <team-token> --name "Ada" --email ada@yourco.dev
motif daemon install                       # start at every login
```

**Step by step, including the details that bite: [docs/TEAM-SETUP.md](docs/TEAM-SETUP.md).**

Everything lives in one SQLite file, that file _is_ your team. Start the server
against the same path and the team token, every member and all history survive a
restart; start it against a different one and you have a new, empty team. Backup
is `cp`. Put TLS in front with any reverse proxy for teams outside a trusted
network.

## Privacy and security

**Two credentials, two levels.** A _team token_ is shared once and grants read
access plus the right to register. A _member token_ is minted per person and
device by `motif connect`; only its hash reaches the server. Every write is
attributed to the token's owner, a claimed name or header changes nothing, so
members cannot write as each other.

**Filtering runs before upload.** Exclude globs keep whole trees local, and ten
redaction patterns, API keys, AWS ids, GitHub tokens, JWTs, private key blocks,
scrub secrets out of message text _and_ tool inputs on the source machine.
Handoffs and asks only ever execute on the machine that owns the session, through
its own daemon. Full model in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Independence and compatibility

Motif is an independent project, not affiliated with or endorsed by Anthropic,
OpenAI or Anysphere. It reads and writes files those tools keep on **your own
machine**, in formats that are private and undocumented, worked out from real
files and from the tools' own open-source code where it exists. Nothing is
scraped and no service is called on your behalf.

Two things follow, and you should know both before relying on it:

- **Formats can change without notice.** Every reader parses tolerantly and never
  fails a whole sync on an unknown shape, and conformance fixtures pin what we
  understood at the time, but an upstream release can still break a handoff. A
  failing fixture plus a corrected parse is the most useful pull request you can
  send.
- **`ask` runs under the session owner's own account.** When a teammate questions
  your session, _your_ daemon resumes it with _your_ CLI and _your_ subscription,
  and only ever for sessions you own. It is off unless you run the daemon, and
  `motif daemon pause` stops it.

## Contributing

New session readers are the most welcome contribution, Motif is only as useful
as the tools it can collect from. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the
setup, the DCO sign-off and what a good pull request looks like here;
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) has the invariants worth knowing before touching sync,
handoff or scope.
