## The problem

I quit *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* three times. Not because it's
hard — I understood most of what was on the page. **The problem was the rest:
unfamiliar terms that broke the flow.** Eventual consistency. Attention
mechanism. B-tree. Writing each one down to look up later works until you
have 40 of them and you've lost the thread anyway.

Summarizing books away defeats the point. The only way to get deep
understanding is to read them — but the friction has to go.

## What TextStack does

**Tap any term → translation in your native language, aware of the book's
domain.** Tap "attention" in an ML book and you get *увага (механізм у
нейромережах)* in Ukrainian or *внимание (механизм в нейросетях)* in
Russian — not the everyday meaning of the word. Explanation mode (no
translation) is also available for native English readers who want the
term clarified instead of translated. Powered by OpenAI `gpt-4.1-nano`,
swap-in friendly — any `ILlmService` impl works. 18+ target languages
supported, with Russian and Ukrainian as the focus during current
development.

Terms you don't recognize enter a **capped weekly SRS queue** — no infinite
backlog, no guilt. Common words and the top 15K English words are filtered
out; only technical vocabulary gets surfaced.

| Other tools | TextStack |
|---|---|
| Dictionary translation, word-by-word | Context-aware translation that knows the domain |
| Infinite SRS queue | Capped weekly — no review spiral |
| Generic content for casual learners | Built for dense technical books |
| Static Kindle Word Wise (2014) | LLM-powered (2026), 18+ target languages |

## Try it

1. [textstack.app](https://textstack.app) — sample chapters open without
   signup.
2. Tap any word you don't recognize.
3. That's the whole pitch.

## Features

**Reader**
- Kindle-like experience — themes (light/sepia/dark), fonts, fullscreen,
  keyboard shortcuts
- **Explain** — select any technical phrase → 2-3 sentence explanation in
  your native language, aware of the book's domain. Uses OpenAI
  `gpt-4.1-nano`. Includes a concrete analogy when the term is technical
  (see GIF above).
- Text selection extras — contextual translation in 18+ languages,
  dictionary fallback (Free Dictionary API), highlights
- TTS — Edge TTS via direct WebSocket (200+ voices, 0.75×–2.0× speed, two-
  layer cache)
- Offline reading — PWA with IndexedDB caching, download manager

**Vocabulary SRS**
- Auto-added while reading — sentence context, definition, translation
- 5 stages (New → Recognition → Recall → Context → Mastered)
- Capped weekly queue + LLM-generated distractors and hints (Ollama
  `gemma4:e2b`)
- Review modes: multiple choice, classic flashcard

**Library**
- 1,500+ curated technical and classic books (starter corpus, self-hostable)
- Your own uploads — EPUB / PDF, auto-parsed with metadata enrichment
- **PDF content-quality pipeline** — heuristic extraction first (instant,
  readable), then a gated Claude pass cleans flagged chapters in the
  background (running headers, fragmented paragraphs, line-wrap hyphens).
  Every fix is logged so deterministic rules can absorb recurring patterns
  and Claude usage trends down. See
  [architecture](docs/01-architecture/README.md#pdf-content-quality-pipeline).
- Reading progress sync, bookmarks, highlights, reading stats

**Mobile**
- React Native (Expo), Android on Google Play
- Offline-first, same UX as web

**Admin** ([textstack.dev](https://textstack.dev))
- Book/author/genre CRUD, chapter editor, ingestion queue
- SSG rebuild, auto-publish, SEO backfill

## MCP server

TextStack is also a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** — connect it to
Claude Desktop, Cursor, or ChatGPT and your AI client can search the library,
read chapters, ask grounded questions, and manage your highlights and
vocabulary. Run it locally (`dotnet tool install -g TextStack.Mcp`) or point a
client at the hosted endpoint `https://textstack.app/mcp`.

Setup, the 7 tools, auth, and troubleshooting: [docs/05-features/mcp.md](docs/05-features/mcp.md).

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | ASP.NET Core (.NET 10), Minimal APIs |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 + EF Core (snake_case) |
| Search | PostgreSQL FTS |
| Web | React 19, Vite, pnpm |
| Mobile | React Native (Expo 55) |
| LLM | OpenAI `gpt-4.1-nano` (explanations + translation) + Ollama `gemma4:e2b` (distractors, local) |
| TTS | Edge TTS (WebSocket, no API key) |
| SSG | Puppeteer prerender, nginx serves static first |
| Telemetry | OpenTelemetry → Aspire Dashboard |
| Infra | Docker Compose, Cloudflare Tunnel, nginx |

**Architecture**: `API → Application → Domain ← Infrastructure` (modular
monolith). Worker runs ingestion + SRS scoring + SSG jobs.
