## What is Cosmo?

Most developers use PostgreSQL every day without actually knowing what's happening inside it. Cosmo fixes that.

It connects directly to your Postgres database and gives you a live view of everything — active queries, WAL activity, connection health, lock contention — all updating in real time, right in your terminal.

No browser. No external service. No configuration beyond a database URL. Just run it and watch your database breathe.

## Flight Deck

**Database vitals**

- connection load and idle sessions
- cache efficiency with health-aware status
- database size, version, uptime, and transaction count
- rolling connection and cache sparklines

**Workload**

- active session count and trend
- PID, state, duration, and normalized query text
- fast visual distinction between active, idle, and idle-in-transaction sessions

**WAL + MVCC**

- real-time WAL throughput and recent trend
- current WAL LSN
- live and dead tuple counts from `pg_stat_user_tables`
- table bloat signal and last autovacuum

**Contention**

- waiting and granted locks
- lock type, table, PID, wait event, and query
- clear system state when no lock pressure exists

**Interface**

- animated telemetry boot sequence
- responsive four-panel and compact single-panel layouts
- numbered panel navigation and visible keyboard hints
- active-panel focus treatment
- manual refresh plus sync age

## Demo

![Demo](demo.gif)

The GIF shows:
1. Cosmo booting up with the mission control startup animation
2. The full dashboard appearing with all 4 panels populated with live data
3. A `SELECT pg_sleep(20)` query being run in pgAdmin
4. The query appearing live in the Active Queries panel with duration counting up
5. The query finishing and disappearing from the panel

## How it works

Cosmo queries PostgreSQL system views directly — the same views that Postgres uses internally to track its own state. These are:

**pg_stat_activity** — every connection and what it's doing right now. This is how Cosmo shows active queries, their state, and how long they've been running.

**pg_stat_database** — database-level statistics like cache hits, block reads, transaction counts, and database size. The cache hit ratio is calculated from blks_hit and blks_read.

**pg_stat_checkpointer** — checkpoint statistics in PostgreSQL 17+. This is how Cosmo tracks how many checkpoints have happened.

**pg_locks** — every lock currently held or waited on. Cosmo joins this with pg_stat_activity and pg_class to show which table is involved and what query is holding the lock.

**WAL rate** is calculated by tracking the change in WAL LSN (Log Sequence Number) between refreshes. LSN is a byte position in the write-ahead log — by comparing two consecutive positions and dividing by elapsed time, Cosmo calculates the write throughput in MB/s.

Cosmo uses a connection pool via pgxpool to avoid connection conflicts when multiple queries run concurrently every 2 seconds.
