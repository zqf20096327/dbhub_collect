## Getting Started

### New to Weaviate? 🚀

**Try our quick local sandbox with Docker!** Perfect for learning and development:

```bash
cd sandbox
docker-compose up -d
python3 populate.py
```

This spins up a fully-configured Weaviate instance with sample jeopardy questions, vector embeddings, and backup support enabled. [Learn more →](sandbox/readme.md)

### Try Query Profiling Locally

For the release-ready profiling workflow, start the dedicated sandbox with its local text-vectorizer and seed the three searchable demo collections:

```bash
cd sandbox
docker compose -f docker-compose.profiling.yml up -d
docker compose -f docker-compose.profiling.yml ps
node seed-query-profiling.cjs
```

Connect to `http://localhost:8080` with API key `test-key-123`. The sandbox creates `ProfileTest`, `TravelGuide`, and `ProductCatalog`; `TravelGuide` and `ProductCatalog` support normal **Text (Semantic)** search. In Data Explorer, select **Vector Search**, enable **Profile** beside **Run Vector Search**, run a search, then select **View profile** when you need the timing breakdown. The preference is remembered across Data Explorer panels and collection changes. [Profiling sandbox instructions →](sandbox/readme.md#2-start-the-query-profiling-sandbox)

### Connecting to Weaviate

1. **Install** Weaviate Studio from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=prasadmuley.weaviate-studio) or [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/prasadmuley/weaviate-studio).
2. **Open the Weaviate Studio panel** from the VS Code sidebar.
3. **Add a connection** to your Weaviate instance (local, on-prem, or cloud).
4. **Explore your schema, run queries, and manage your data—all within VS Code!**

## Telemetry & Privacy

Weaviate Studio collects anonymous usage telemetry (extension activation and error categories) to help improve the extension. We **never** collect prompts, queries, data, credentials, collection names, or personally identifiable information.

Telemetry requires **dual consent** — both VS Code telemetry and the `weaviate.telemetry.enabled` setting must be enabled. Disable either to opt out completely. All collected events are documented in [`telemetry.json`](telemetry.json).

---

## Development & Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup, development, and pull request guidelines.

Need a quick Weaviate instance for development or learning? Check out our [local sandbox environment](sandbox/readme.md) with pre-configured Docker setup and test data.

### Architecture

Weaviate Studio uses a modular architecture with external React components for enhanced UI:

- **Add Collection UI**: Powered by [`weaviate-add-collection`](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-add-collection) ([Live Demo](https://weaviate.github.io/weaviate-add-collection/)) - a standalone React component for creating, cloning, and importing collections
- **Extension Core**: TypeScript-based VS Code extension
- **Generative Search**: Self-contained module (`src/rag-chat/`) for generative search with its own panel, API wrapper, and React webview
- **Webviews**: React-based UIs with Monaco editor integration

For details on updating external dependencies, see the [Working with Dependencies](CONTRIBUTING.md#working-with-dependencies) section in CONTRIBUTING.md.
