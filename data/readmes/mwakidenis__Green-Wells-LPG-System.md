## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <https://github.io/mwakidenis/Green-Wells-LPG-System>
cd <Green-Wells-LPG-System>

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Environment Setup

All environment variables are automatically configured through Lovable Cloud:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Anon key for client-side operations
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` - Project identifier

M-Pesa credentials are securely stored as backend secrets:
- `MPESA_CONSUMER_KEY`
- `MPESA_CONSUMER_SECRET`
- `MPESA_PASSKEY`
- `MPESA_SHORTCODE`

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Preview the production build locally
npm run preview
```

The build output will be in the `dist/` directory.

### Deployment

#### Vercel (Recommended)

The application is optimized for deployment on Vercel:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import the project in Vercel
3. Vercel will automatically detect the Vite configuration
4. Set your environment variables in Vercel dashboard
5. Deploy!

**Important**: The `vercel.json` configuration file is included to handle client-side routing. This ensures that refreshing non-root pages doesn't result in 404 errors. The rewrite rule redirects all routes to `index.html`, allowing React Router to handle the routing. Note: If you plan to add API routes in the future, you'll need to exclude them from this rewrite rule.

#### Other Platforms

For deployment on other platforms (Netlify, AWS Amplify, etc.), ensure your hosting platform:
- Serves the `dist/` directory as the root
- Redirects all routes to `index.html` for client-side routing
- Supports environment variables for Supabase configuration

#### PWA Assets

To enable full PWA functionality, add icon files to `public/images/`:
- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

These icons are referenced in `manifest.json` for the Progressive Web App features.

### Available Routes

The application includes the following pages and routes:

**Public Routes:**
- `/` - Landing page with product information and sign-up
- `/login` - User authentication page

**Protected Routes (requires authentication):**
- `/dashboard` - User dashboard with order history and account overview
- `/order` - Place new LPG cylinder orders
- `/tracking` - Real-time order tracking with GPS location
- `/safety` - Safety hub with guidelines and emergency protocols
- `/youth-hub` - Gamified youth energy hub with challenges and achievements
- `/rewards` - Rewards marketplace for redeeming loyalty points
- `/teams` - Team challenges and collaborative competitions
- `/support` - Customer support hub with tickets, live chat, and FAQ
- `/feedback` - Feedback dashboard for ratings and reviews
- `/driver` - Driver application for delivery personnel
- `/warehouse` - Warehouse management system for inventory control
- `/admin` - Admin dashboard for platform management (admin access required)

---

## 🎨 Design System

The application uses a semantic token-based design system for consistent theming:

```css
/* Core color tokens */
--primary: HSL value for brand color
--secondary: HSL value for secondary actions
--accent: HSL value for highlights
--background: Adaptive background color
--foreground: Adaptive text color

/* Gradients */
--gradient-primary: Brand gradient
--gradient-subtle: Subtle backgrounds

/* Shadows */
--shadow-elegant: Elevation effects
--shadow-glow: Accent highlights
```

All components use semantic tokens rather than hardcoded colors for maintainability and theme flexibility.
