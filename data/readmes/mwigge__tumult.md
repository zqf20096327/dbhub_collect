Tumult is a Rust-native chaos engineering platform for running observable,
repeatable resilience experiments from a CLI or Model Context Protocol (MCP)
client — and for governing, storing and reporting them from the bundled
`tumultd` daemon and web UI.

## Quick start

Prerequisites: Rust 1.92.0 or newer and Docker with Compose.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mwigge/tumult.git && cd tumult
cargo build --release -p tumult-cli
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --wait postgres redis kafka mysql sshd
target/release/tumult validate examples/redis-chaos.toon
target/release/tumult run examples/redis-chaos.toon
```

The run writes a TOON journal and, unless disabled, ingests it into the embedded
DuckDB analytics store. Follow the [guided walkthrough](QUICKSTART.md) for
analysis, observability, GameDays, and MCP usage.

## Capabilities

- A five-phase experiment lifecycle with steady-state probes, fault actions,
  controls, recovery sampling, and rollback.
- Script plugins for containers, databases, Kafka, load testing, network
  faults, processes, Pumba, stress, and time-related failure modes.
- Native Rust executors for SSH, userspace TCP fault injection, Kubernetes,
  cloud APIs, and Windows.
- TOON journals, Arrow conversion, DuckDB analytics, and Parquet, CSV, JSON,
  and Arrow IPC export.
- OpenTelemetry traces and metrics across experiment execution, plugins,
  analytics, SSH, Kubernetes, MCP, and agentic test paths.
- Statistical baselines, cross-run trends, GameDay orchestration, compliance
  evidence mapping, ChaosGraph, service topology, and policy-gated autopilot.
- Deterministic and live-proxy fault injection for AI agents, plus adapters for
  Claude Code and Codex.

Run `tumult discover` to obtain the authoritative plugin and action catalog for
the installed build.

## How Tumult differs

Against the incumbent chaos tools (Gremlin, Chaos Mesh, LitmusChaos), Tumult
bets on four things:

- **Agent-first.** A 40-tool MCP server where every tool declares safety
  annotations and role gating (read-only tools need `viewer`, writers and
  fault executors need `operator`) — plus deterministic and live-proxy fault
  injection for agentic AI systems themselves
  (`demo/experiments/demo-agentic*.toon`).
- **Always-on evidence.** The `tumultd` daemon ingests OTLP telemetry
  (gRPC and HTTP) around the clock into one DuckDB lake (Kronika), so
  analytics, trends and audit trails accrue without exporting anything.
- **Governance built in.** Risk-tiered approvals, hash-chained audit trails
  and compliance evidence packs (`tumult-compliance/`) mapped to DORA, NIS2,
  ISO 27001 and SOC 2.
- **One Rust binary.** The daemon embeds the lake, the schedulers and the
  web UI in a single `tumultd` binary; the CLI is another.

The launch post has the longer story:
[Introducing Tumult](docs/blog/01-introducing-tumult.md).

## The daemon, lake and web UI

*The chronicle of your resilience work.*

This is the analytics half of Tumult: the `tumultd` daemon, the unified
DuckDB lake, and the embedded SvelteKit web UI. The CLI is the engine that
executes experiments. The daemon is where they are registered, approved,
executed under guardrails, stored, and reported. The crate and binary
layout is documented in
[docs/architecture/kronika-architecture.md](docs/architecture/kronika-architecture.md).

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    accTitle: Tumult platform: engine, daemon and lake
    accDescr: The CLI and MCP clients execute experiments through the tumult engine and emit OTLP telemetry. The tumultd daemon ingests that telemetry into one DuckDB lake, executes registered definitions itself behind an approval workflow, and serves the web UI, JSON API and compliance reports from the same store.

```

- **Run registry and daemon-run execution** — definitions are validated
  through the CLI's exact pipeline and content-hash-deduped
  (`POST /api/runs/validate`). You can preview them with a dry run. The
  daemon executes them itself on a bounded worker pool, with e-stop and
  crash-time orphan rollback reconciliation (ADR-011).
- **Approval workflows** — every run is classified into a risk tier (T0–T3)
  at request time. Gated runs wait behind a hash-pinned, quorum- and
  TTL-bound approval with segregation of duties. Production-tier runs also
  sit behind a fail-closed autopilot gate. A break-glass override exists
  and leaves evidence (ADR-013).
- **Authentication and RBAC** — server-side sessions (argon2id, opaque
  cookies) or revocable `kro_`-prefixed API tokens. One route table with
  `viewer < operator < approver < admin` roles and optional
  per-environment scopes (ADR-012).
- **Automatic ingest** — OTLP/gRPC (`:4317`, tumult's exporter) and
  OTLP/HTTP protobuf (`:4318`, `/v1/*`) on one daemon. You can also import
  CSV files and tumult journal JSON by hand (`tumultd import <file>`).
- **Unified DuckDB store + parquet lake** — telemetry, run state, manual
  evidence and the analytics family in one store behind one writer.
  Incremental, watermark-driven export writes immutable day-partitioned
  parquet (`KRONIKA_LAKE_DIR`, `KRONIKA_LAKE_INTERVAL`,
  `POST /api/lake/export`). Retention is optional
  (`KRONIKA_RETENTION_DAYS`, default keep forever; the manual-evidence
  tables are never deleted). Write-once parquet plus hash-chained audit
  trails form a WORM-shaped evidence trail (ADR-010).
- **Semantic metrics layer** — YAML metric views (`metrics/*.yaml`)
  compiled to strictly validated SQL.
- **Compliance-grade reports** — R1 executive resilience digest (with
  org-hierarchy rollups), R3 per-run game-day report, and an R2 evidence
  pack (DORA/NIS2/ISO 27001/SOC 2, including the approval-chain
  change-management section). Rendered as embedded-Typst PDFs plus
  print-HTML previews. Includes Gremlin-style resilience scoring and a
  draft → verified manual-evidence lifecycle (reviewer ≠ enterer,
  append-only hash-chained audit).
- **Web UI + query API** — a SvelteKit SPA embedded into the `tumultd`
  binary (Overview, Scores, Experiments, Runs, Author, GameDays, Approvals,
  Manual evidence, Logs, Traces, Metrics, Topology, Ask, Reports, Events,
  Schedules, plus admin-only Users and Webhooks — and a two-click stop-all
  kill switch on the Runs page). It is backed by a JSON
  API under `/api/*`, including a guarded NL→SQL ask path
  (`tumult_intelligence::sql_guard`).

Try it (full platform, demo seed included):

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # fill in the three KRONIKA_* values — the stack refuses to start without them
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.kronika.yml up -d --build
# open http://localhost:14318/ (log in with the admin password you set in .env)
```

The compose stack builds the UI and the `tumultd` binary in Docker, seeds a
demo experiment suite plus manual-evidence records, and exports a report
into `demo-out/`. To build locally instead, run
`cd web && npm ci && npm run build` before compiling `tumultd` — the binary
embeds `web/build/`. The CLI-only path above needs none of this: `tumult
run` writes its journal and ingests into the same unified store. If you
have older standalone database files lying around, `tumult store
import-legacy` pulls their data into that store (see the
[CLI reference](docs/guides/cli-reference.md)).

### Screenshots

All captured on the seeded demo stack above; the full click path (login →
register → approve → run → e-stop → evidence pack) is in the
[platform walkthrough](docs/guides/platform-walkthrough.md).

## MCP server

Tumult exposes 40 tools over stdio or streamable HTTP:

```bash
# Stdio
tumult-mcp

# HTTP, loopback only when authentication is not configured
tumult-mcp --transport http --port 3100

# Authenticated HTTP
TUMULT_MCP_TOKEN='replace-with-a-secret' tumult-mcp --transport http --port 3100
```

| Area | Tools |
|---|---|
| Experiments | `tumult_run_experiment`, `tumult_validate`, `tumult_discover`, `tumult_create_experiment`, `tumult_list_experiments` |
| Journals and analytics | `tumult_read_journal`, `tumult_list_journals`, `tumult_analyze`, `tumult_analyze_store`, `tumult_store_stats`, `tumult_query_traces`, `tumult_report`, `tumult_compliance`, `tumult_trend` |
| GameDays | `tumult_gameday_run`, `tumult_gameday_analyze`, `tumult_gameday_create`, `tumult_gameday_list` |
| Intelligence | `tumult_recommend`, `tumult_coverage`, `tumult_agents`, `tumult_fault_catalog`, `tumult_scaffold_experiment` |
| Agentic testing | `tumult_agentic_list_scenarios`, `tumult_agentic_smoke`, `tumult_agentic_run_experiment` |

| Access | `tumult_whoami` |

Thirty tools return structured content with an advertised output schema. Every
tool declares MCP safety annotations. Read-only tools require the `viewer` role;
writers and fault executors require `operator`. The destructive tools are four:
`tumult_run_experiment`, `tumult_gameday_run`, `tumult_autopilot_run` (when
`execute=true`), and `tumult_autopilot_respond` (when `approve=true`).

See the [MCP guide](docs/guides/mcp-guide.md) for configuration, resource URIs,
authentication, pagination, schemas, and client examples.

## Configuration

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | OTLP endpoint for traces and metrics. |
| `TUMULT_LAKE_PATH` | Override the persistent DuckDB store path (default `~/.tumult/lake.duckdb`). |
| `TUMULT_PLUGIN_PATH` | Add script-plugin discovery directories. |
| `TUMULT_MCP_TOKEN` | Configure one MCP operator bearer token. |
| `TUMULT_MCP_AUTH_CONFIG` | Configure multiple viewer/operator tokens. |
| `TUMULT_TRACE_UI_BASE` | Add trace links to generated reports. |
| `TUMULT_CLICKHOUSE_URL` | Enable ClickHouse/SigNoz correlation. |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_BIN`, `CODEX_BIN` | Override local agent adapter binaries. |

Provider-specific credentials use their standard environment variables. Tumult
does not store those credentials in journals.

## Safety and evidence scope

Chaos actions are intentionally disruptive. Review every experiment, target,
rollback, guard, and credential scope before using Tumult outside an isolated
environment. MCP HTTP binds without authentication are restricted to loopback.

Compliance reports are evidence summaries, not legal or audit attestations.
Framework mappings and their evidence strength are documented in the
[regulatory mapping](docs/regulatory-mapping.md).
