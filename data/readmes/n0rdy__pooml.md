# pooml - Logs + Metrics in One Binary

Pooml (stands for "Poor Man's Logger") is a self-hosted, single-binary log and metrics server on top of SQLite, built
for solo developers and small teams who want observability for their side projects and VPS deployments without running
an ELK stack, a Prometheus + Grafana pair, or paying per-GB SaaS prices.

One binary, two SQLite files, a web UI. Ship logs from FluentBit or plain HTTP, push metrics via OTLP or let pooml
scrape Prometheus endpoints, query everything with real SQL, draw charts, build dashboards, and get alerts on your
phone.

The assumption is that you will self-host pooml on a VPS or a small cloud instance (Coolify, plain Docker, a systemd
unit - anything works).

## What it does

- **Logs**: FluentBit-compatible HTTP ingestion with automatic format detection per line (JSON, Common Log Format, plain
  text), full-text search (SQLite FTS5), live tail, infinite scroll, SQL querying
- **Metrics**: OTLP/HTTP push and Prometheus scrape targets, a quick-query builder that compiles to SQL
  (`increase(http_requests_total) per 1h last 24h by service`), charts. Two metric types on purpose: counters and
  gauges - histograms and summaries are downcast to their `_sum`/`_count` counter series
- **Dashboards**: typed logs/metrics dashboards with stream, chart, and number panels
- **War Room**: metrics and logs on one timeline for incidents - one time window rules the page, drag across any chart
  to zoom, every view is a shareable URL. Alerts can carry a War Room link centered on the firing moment
- **Alerts**: SQL-based alert rules on either signal, delivered via Pushover or Once Campfire
- **Ops**: hourly retention cleanup, scheduled S3 backups, Prometheus `/metrics` self-observability - pooml can monitor
  itself
- **AI-ready (MCP)**: [`@pooml/mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pooml/mcp) gives Claude (or any MCP client)
  read-only SQL access to your logs and metrics - LLMs already speak SQL, so there's no query DSL for the model to
  hallucinate around
- **One login**: a single shared secret for the UI, API keys for ingestion

## Open-source but closed-contribution

Pooml is open-source, but I do not accept external contributions. This is a personal project, and I want to keep full
control over the codebase and direction of the project. Also, I don't feel I have enough free time to review and manage
contributions (if any).

Therefore, please do not open PRs.

If you find any bugs, have questions or suggestions, use the `Discussions` section for that.

## Quick start

### Docker

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name pooml \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -e POOML_UI_SECRET=your-ui-login-secret-min-32-chars-long \
  -e POOML_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-encryption-key-min-32-chars-long \
  -e POOML_DB_DIR=/data \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 8081:8081 \
  -v pooml-data:/data \
  mykonordy/pooml:latest
```

Open `http://localhost:8081`, log in with your `POOML_UI_SECRET`, create an API key in Settings, and point your log
shipper at port 8080.

Port 8080 is the ingestion API, port 8081 is the UI. The two are separate servers on purpose: expose the API to your
services, keep the UI behind your VPN or reverse proxy.

### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  pooml:
    image: mykonordy/pooml:latest
    container_name: pooml
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      POOML_UI_SECRET: your-ui-login-secret-min-32-chars-long
      POOML_ENCRYPTION_KEY: your-encryption-key-min-32-chars-long
      POOML_DB_DIR: /data
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "8081:8081"
    volumes:
      - pooml-data:/data
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD", "curl", "-fsS", "http://localhost:8080/healthcheck" ]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3

volumes:
  pooml-data:
```

`docker compose up -d`, and the same two ports apply. Both examples use a named volume on purpose: pooml runs as a
non-root user (uid 1001), and a bind-mounted host directory is created root-owned on Linux, which crash-loops the
container. If you prefer a bind mount, `chown -R 1001:1001` the host directory first. This is also the shape platforms
like Coolify accept as a one-service compose deployment.

### Binary (Linux)

Download the archive for your architecture from [Releases](https://github.com/n0rdy/pooml/releases), then:

```bash
tar -xzf pooml_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
chmod +x pooml-linux-amd64 && sudo mv pooml-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/pooml

POOML_DB_DIR=~/pooml-data \
POOML_UI_SECRET=your-ui-login-secret-min-32-chars-long \
POOML_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-encryption-key-min-32-chars-long \
pooml
```

### From source

Requires Go 1.27+ and a C compiler (CGO). The `sqlite_fts5` build tag is mandatory - without it the binary builds but
fails at startup with `no such module: fts5`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n0rdy/pooml && cd pooml
go build -tags sqlite_fts5 .
```

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables. Required variables fail fast at startup with a clear message.

## Shipping logs

### FluentBit

```ini
[OUTPUT]
    Name http
    Match *
    Host your-pooml-host
    Port 8080
    URI /api/v1/ingest/${container_name}/${HOSTNAME}
    Format json
    Header X-API-Key ${API_KEY}
    Retry_Limit 5
```

### Plain HTTP

Anything that can POST works; the format of each line is auto-detected (JSON, CLF, plain text):

```bash
curl -X POST "http://your-pooml-host:8080/api/v1/ingest/my-service/my-host" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"level":"error","message":"payment declined","order_id":42}'
```

## Shipping metrics

Pooml stores exactly two metric types: **counters** and **gauges**. Everything richer is normalized down to them -
histograms and summaries become `<name>_sum` / `<name>_count` counter pairs (enough for rates, totals, and averages via
SQL), and untyped Prometheus samples are treated as gauges. If you need native histogram buckets and quantiles, that's
Prometheus territory.

**Push (OTLP/HTTP)**: point your OpenTelemetry SDK or collector at `http://your-pooml-host:8080/api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics`
with the `X-API-Key` header. Both protobuf and JSON encodings are accepted.

**Pull (Prometheus scrape)**: add scrape targets in Settings - URL, interval, optional auth header. Pooml scrapes them
and normalizes the samples into `metrics.db`.

The full HTTP API is documented in [openapi.yaml](./openapi.yaml).

## MCP: ask your AI what broke

Because pooml's query language is SQL, your AI assistant already knows how to use it. [
`@pooml/mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pooml/mcp) is a small MCP server that runs on your machine and connects any
MCP client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, ...) to the query API above - strictly read-only, through the same validation
stack, with your credentials never leaving your machine.

It rides on the query API, which is **disabled by default** - enable it on the pooml server first:

```
POOML_QUERY_API_ENABLED=true
POOML_QUERY_API_AUTH_SECRET=<min 32 chars, its own secret - not an ingest API key>
```

Then, on the machine where your MCP client runs:

```bash
claude mcp add pooml \
  -e POOML_URL=https://your-pooml-host:8080 \
  -e POOML_QUERY_API_AUTH_SECRET=your-query-secret \
  -- npx -y @pooml/mcp
```

Then ask things like *"what broke in payment-svc last night?"* or *"chart-worthy: which service's error rate spiked this
week?"* - the model writes the SQL, pooml answers it. Setup details (including running behind a Cloudflare Tunnel) in
the [pooml-mcp repo](https://github.com/n0rdy/pooml-mcp).

## Retention

Logs default to 30 days, metrics and alert history to 90 - all configurable in Settings (1 to 3650 days). Cleanup runs
hourly in small batches so ingestion never stalls, and freed pages are reclaimed with incremental vacuum.

## Backups

Pooml backs up all three databases to any S3-compatible storage (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, Backblaze B2) on a cron
schedule, using SQLite's online backup API - writes continue during the backup. Configure bucket, credentials, and
schedule in Settings; credentials are encrypted at rest with `POOML_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

Each run uploads to one timestamped folder, so a restore is "take all three files from one folder" - stop pooml, place
them in `POOML_DB_DIR`, start pooml:

```
{bucket}/{prefix}/2026-04-27T030000Z/logs.db
{bucket}/{prefix}/2026-04-27T030000Z/metrics.db
{bucket}/{prefix}/2026-04-27T030000Z/meta.db
```

### Expiring old backups

Pooml never deletes backups and never needs delete permissions - even a fully compromised pooml cannot destroy your
backup history. Expire old backups with your provider's lifecycle rules instead:

**AWS S3 / Cloudflare R2:**

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket my-backups \
  --lifecycle-configuration '{"Rules":[{"ID":"expire-pooml-backups","Status":"Enabled",
    "Filter":{"Prefix":"pooml/"},"Expiration":{"Days":30}}]}'
```

(For R2, add `--endpoint-url https://<account_id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`.)

**MinIO:**

```bash
mc ilm rule add --expire-days 30 --prefix "pooml/" myminio/my-backups
```

The minimum credentials policy pooml needs is `s3:PutObject` on the bucket.

## Monitoring pooml itself

Set `POOML_METRICS_ENABLED=true` and `POOML_METRICS_AUTH_SECRET`, and pooml exposes its own operational metrics at
`:8080/metrics` (Prometheus text format) - and registers itself as a scrape target, so its own metrics land in
`metrics.db` and are graphable in its own dashboards. No separate monitoring stack needed; external Prometheus can
scrape the same endpoint with the secret in `X-API-Key`.

## Security notes

- Keep the UI (port 8081) off the public internet, or at least behind a reverse proxy with TLS. The ingestion API (8080)
  is what your services need to reach.
- Login and API-key failures are throttled per IP. If you run behind a reverse proxy, set
  `POOML_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true` (and make sure the proxy overwrites `X-Forwarded-For`).
- Secrets configured in the UI are encrypted at rest; `logs.db` and `metrics.db` content is not. Backups inherit that,
  so enable server-side encryption on the bucket if you need encryption at rest.
- Scrape targets and the Campfire base URL are fetched server-side: anyone with UI admin access can point them at
  internal network addresses. That is consistent with pooml's single-admin model (the same admin already runs arbitrary
  SQL), but worth knowing if the pooml host sits inside a sensitive network.
