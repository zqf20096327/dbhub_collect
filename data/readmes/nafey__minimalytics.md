## Installation

### Linux and macOS

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nafey/minimalytics.git
   cd minimalytics
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash

   ```

3. Install the binary system-wide:
   ```bash
   sudo mv build/minim /usr/local/bin/
   ```

### Docker

1. Build the image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t minimalytics .
   ```

2. Run the container:

## Usage

### Starting the Server

1. Check if the server is running:
   ```bash
   minim status
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   minim server start
   ```

### Recording Events

To record an event, send a `POST` request to the event API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3333/api/event/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"event": "<EVENT_NAME>"}'
```

Replace `<EVENT_NAME>` with the name of the event you want to track.

### Accessing the Web Dashboard

1. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3333/
   ```

2. Go to **"First Dashboard"** and click **"Add Graph"**.

3. Select the appropriate properties and click **"Done"**.

4. Your dashboard is now ready to display event data.

### Disabling Web Access

To disable access to the web dashboard, run:
```bash
minim web disable
```

## Why Minimalytics?

This project was born out of the need for a lightweight analytics tool to track internal services on a resource-constrained VPS. Most SaaS analytics products either lack the scalability or exceed their free tier limits when tracking millions of events per month. Minimalytics addresses this gap by offering a **minimalist, high-performance solution** for resource-constrained environments.

---

## How It Works

- **Event Aggregation**: Minimalytics saves space by aggregating events, storing only aggregate features (e.g., total invocations per day) instead of individual events.
- **SQLite Storage**: Event data is stored in an SQLite file, initialized during the first run of `minim`.
- **Server Hosting**: The `minim` CLI starts a server that:
  - Hosts the API endpoint for event submission.
  - Serves the web UI (built using [minimui](https://github.com/nafey/minimui) and placed in the `static` folder).
- **Web UI**: Source for the Web UI is available at [minimui](https://github.com/nafey/minimui).

---

## Future Features

- Support for **sum, avg, min, and max** on event values.
- Improved **UI/UX**.
- Multiple metrics in the same graph.
- Additional visualizations: **Bar Chart, Pie Chart**, etc.
- **User ID-based analytics**: Funnels, cohorts, and more.

---

## Unsupported Features

- Details on individual events.
- Hourly event resolution beyond 48 hours.
- Minute resolution beyond 60 minutes.
