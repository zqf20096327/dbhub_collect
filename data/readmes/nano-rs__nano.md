---

nano is built around a small set of beliefs:

- **The UDM is the contract.** Logs land in 75+ explicit columns; ad-hoc fields
  go in `ext`. Searches stay fast because the schema does the work.
- **nPL beats SQL for hunting.** A piped query language (`error | stats count
  by src_ip | where count > 10`) keeps analyst muscle memory portable.
- **Detections have a lifecycle.** Rules move Staging → Live → Alerting. Match
  counts and signals are visible at every step.
- **Restraint over decoration.** 1px borders, 11–13px text, mono for IDs and
  timestamps. The UI is the same density a terminal user expects.

This repository is the open-core engine, licensed under **AGPL-3.0**. Hosted
plans, the pivt AI assistant, Cases, incidents, and risk scoring are
available from [nano.rs](https://nano.rs).

## Install

One command on any host with Docker:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.nano.rs | bash
```

    <img alt="Watch the 45-second install demo on YouTube" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/cyL6lkPZfbw/maxresdefault.jpg" width="900">
  </a>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <em>One command. 45 seconds. Working nano instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/cyL6lkPZfbw">▶ Watch on YouTube</a></em>
</p>

The installer clones this repo to `~/nano`, generates secrets, pulls the
prebuilt images from `ghcr.io/nano-rs`, brings up the stack
(postgres + clickhouse + api/search/jobs/web + vector + nginx), and walks
you through creating the first admin account. Open `http://localhost`
when it finishes.

**Prereqs:** Docker, docker compose v2, git, openssl, curl.

**Minimum host:** 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM — the lowest stable spec, suitable for up to ~10 GB/day of ingest. Below this, ClickHouse and the API will OOM under load.

For non-interactive installs, pre-set `NANO_ADMIN_EMAIL`,
`NANO_ADMIN_NAME`, `NANO_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `NANO_BASE_URL`, and optionally
`NANO_SCHEMA_PROFILE` (`udm` | `ocsf`, see [below](#schema-profile-udm-or-ocsf))
before piping. See [`.env.opensource.example`](./.env.opensource.example) for
the full env-var surface.

### HTTPS / TLS

The default stack serves plain HTTP on port 80. To serve HTTPS, bring your
own certificate — drop a cert chain and private key into `config/nginx/ssl/`:

```
config/nginx/ssl/fullchain.pem   # certificate (leaf + intermediates)
config/nginx/ssl/privkey.pem     # private key
```

Get them however you like — Let's Encrypt/certbot, your own CA, or a
self-signed pair for testing (`./config/nginx/generate-ssl.sh`). Both `*.pem`
files are gitignored. Then bring the stack up with the TLS overlay:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.opensource.yml -f docker-compose.tls.yml up -d
```

nginx serves HTTPS on :443 and redirects :80 → :443. Set `BASE_URL=https://your.domain`
in `.env` so login cookies get the `Secure` flag. Renew certs out of band and
`docker compose ... restart nginx` to pick them up. See
[`config/nginx/ssl/README.md`](./config/nginx/ssl/README.md) for details.

## Schema profile: UDM or OCSF

At install time nano asks which storage schema you want — and it's largely a
matter of preference:

- **UDM** (Unified Data Model) — nano's native schema. Short, explicit field
  names (`src_ip`, `dest_ip`, `process_name`, …) comparable to Splunk's Common
  Information Model (CIM). This is the default and the path of least
  resistance: the broadest out-of-the-box parser and detection coverage, and
  the terser field names most analysts already have in muscle memory.
- **OCSF** (Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework) — the open, vendor-neutral
  standard schema. Choose it if you're standardizing on OCSF across tools, feed
  an OCSF-native data lake, or simply prefer the open spec. Same engine, same
  nPL, same UI — events land in OCSF-shaped tables instead.

Both run the identical search, detection, and triage stack; the difference is
the field universe your events are stored and queried in. Pick whichever
matches how you think about your data (or how the rest of your pipeline is
shaped) — there's no wrong answer for a fresh deployment.

```sh
# Interactive install prompts for this. To preset it (e.g. non-interactive):
NANO_SCHEMA_PROFILE=ocsf curl -fsSL https://get.nano.rs | bash
```

> **Pick once.** The schema profile is fixed at first install. It selects the
> ClickHouse tables, parsers, and fields the whole stack runs against, so it
> can't be switched after you've ingested data without a full re-ingest into a
> fresh deployment. Defaults to `udm` if unset.

## What's in the box

- **Ingestion** — Vector-based collectors with VRL parsers (HTTP push,
  syslog, S3 pull). Parser content is published separately under Apache-2.0.
- **Storage** — ClickHouse for events (daily partitions, 90-day default TTL),
  PostgreSQL for metadata.
- **Search** — nPL parser, ClickHouse SQL generator, field-stat sidebar,
  bloom-filter-aware tokenization.
- **Detection** — scheduled (cron) + real-time (materialized view) rules,
  signal logging, prevalence-based noise reduction.
- **Alerts** — lifecycle (new → triaged → resolved), grouping, dedup.
- **Marketplace** — install + configure out-of-the-box enrichment
  providers (threat intel, identity, asset inventory, geolocation).
  Coverage indicator across UDM fields.
- **Web UI** — React SPA, lazy-loaded, runs in any modern browser.

## Develop from source

The [Install](#install) flow above is the right path if you just want
to run nano. To hack on the engine itself:

- Prereqs: Rust stable, Node 20+, PostgreSQL 18+, ClickHouse 24+
- Bring up Postgres + ClickHouse via your usual local tooling
- `./scripts/start-microservices-dev.sh` — launches `nanosiem-api` (3000),
  `nanosiem-search` (3002), and `nanosiem-jobs` with sane local defaults
- `cd nanosiem-web && npm install && npm run dev` (port 5173)

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the day-to-day dev workflow
and what env vars to override.

## Architecture

```
+------------+     +------------+     +-------------+
|  Vector    | --> | nanosiem-  | --> | ClickHouse  |
|  parsers   |     | api  :3000 |     | (events)    |
+------------+     +------------+     +-------------+

                         v                   |
                   +------------+     +------+------+
                   | PostgreSQL |     | nanosiem-   |
                   | (rules,    |     | search:3002 |
                   |  alerts,   |     +-------------+
                   |  audit)    |             ^
                   +------------+             |
                                       +-------------+
                                       | nanosiem-   |
                                       | web (SPA)   |
                                       +-------------+
```

- `nanosiem-api` — rules, alerts, settings, ingestion, OpenAPI at `/swagger-ui`
- `nanosiem-search` — query execution, field stats, log fetch
- `nanosiem-jobs` — scheduled detection runner, repository sync
- Both Postgres + ClickHouse are required. The DualPool abstraction wires
  the two together; boot fails fast if either is unreachable.

## Documentation

- **[Getting Started](https://nano.rs/docs/getting-started/first-feed/)** —
  bring up nano and ingest your first feed
- **[Search Commands (nPL)](https://nano.rs/docs/search-commands/)** —
  pipe commands, eval functions, syntax reference
- **[Detection Authoring](https://nano.rs/docs/user-guide/detections/)** —
  write rules, manage lifecycle, tune for noise
- **[UDM Reference](https://nano.rs/docs/reference/udm-fields/)** — the
  75+ explicit columns the schema is built around
- **[Coding Agents](https://nano.rs/docs/coding-agents)** — manage
  searches, parsers, and detections via Claude Code / Codex pointed at
  your nano instance. The hosted plan ships an in-app AI assistant
  (pivt); coding-agents brings equivalent leverage to open-core
  deployments, locally.

## Ecosystem

The engine works on its own, but a small set of companion repos ships
the content layer most teams want on day one:

- **[nano-enrichments](https://github.com/nano-rs/nano-enrichments)** —
  threat-intel feeds, identity providers, and asset-inventory adapters
  wired into the in-app marketplace
- **[parsers](https://github.com/nano-rs/parsers)** — Vector + VRL
  parsers for common log sources (proxy, EDR, cloud audit, Windows)
- **[rules](https://github.com/nano-rs/rules)** — curated detection
  rules, importable into nano via the rule library
- **[nanodac](https://github.com/nano-rs/nanodac)** —
  detection-as-code: define rules in Git, sync to nano via GitOps
- **[models](https://github.com/nano-rs/models)** — LiteLLM model
  catalog backing pivt's AI features

## What's open vs. hosted

This repository is the open-core engine — functionally complete for
ingestion, search, detection, and alerting. Some platform features ship
only in the hosted distribution at [nano.rs](https://nano.rs):

- **Cases** — investigation management, collaborative notebooks
- **Incidents** — multi-case orchestration, queue routing
- **pivt** — ambient AI assistant covering detection generation, rule
  tuning, query review, parser editing, and shadow investigation
- **Risk scoring** — entity-level risk across users, hosts, and cloud
  accounts
- **Auto-tuning** — AI-driven false-positive reduction

Self-hosting nano with these features requires a commercial license —
[hello@nano.rs](mailto:hello@nano.rs).

## Roadmap

- Public detection-rule library (community-contributed)
- OpenTelemetry log/trace ingestion
- Parser SDK for community-authored VRL parsers
- Saved-query API + CLI client
- See [open issues](https://github.com/nano-rs/nano/issues) for the
  active backlog

## Contributing

We accept community contributions under a CLA — see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and
[.github/ICLA.md](./.github/ICLA.md). DCO is not sufficient because nano is
open-core; the CLA grants Nano LLC the sublicensing right needed to keep
parts of the platform proprietary while still accepting your patches.
