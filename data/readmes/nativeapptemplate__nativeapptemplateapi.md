# NativeAppTemplate API

[![Mentioned in Awesome Rails](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://github.com/gramantin/awesome-rails#startersboilerplates)

A [Rails 8.1](https://rubyonrails.org/) API backend for NativeAppTemplate iOS/Android mobile applications. It's a multi-tenant SaaS application with token-based authentication, role-based authorization, and RESTful API endpoints.

Extracted from the Rails API backend for [MyTurnTag Creator for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/myturntag-creator/id1516198303) and [MyTurnTag Creator for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myturntag.myturntagcreator).

Want a customized backend generated for you? [nativeapptemplate-agent](https://github.com/nativeapptemplate/nativeapptemplate-agent) is a Claude Code agent that turns a one-sentence spec (e.g. *"a walk-in queue for a barbershop"*) into a coherent three-platform implementation — this Rails 8.1 API plus matching [SwiftUI iOS](https://github.com/nativeapptemplate/NativeAppTemplate-Free-iOS) and [Jetpack Compose Android](https://github.com/nativeapptemplate/NativeAppTemplate-Free-Android) apps — renamed and adapted to your domain, with validation built in.

## Requirements

You'll need the following installed to run the template successfully:

* Ruby 4.0.2+
* PostgreSQL 16+
* Libvips - `brew install vips`
* [Overmind](https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind) - `brew install tmux overmind` - helps run all your processes in development

If you use Homebrew, dependencies are listed in `Brewfile` so you can install them using:

```bash
brew bundle install --no-upgrade
```

Then you can start the database servers:

```bash
brew services start postgresql
```

## Initial Setup

First, edit `config/database.yml` and change the database credentials for your server.

Run `bin/setup` to install Ruby and JavaScript dependencies and setup your database and seed initial data to the database.

```bash
bin/setup
```

Push notifications (used by the paid iOS/Android clients) need APNs and FCM credentials. Add them per environment with `bin/rails credentials:edit --environment <env>` under `action_push_native:apns` and `action_push_native:fcm`; see `config/push.yml` for the expected keys.

## Running NativeAppTemplate API on your Wi-Fi

Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and set `HOST` to your current Wi-Fi IP. On macOS: `ipconfig getifaddr en0`. `bin/dev` binds Rails to that address so the dev server is reachable from both the host browser and from any phone on the same network at `http://<wifi-ip>:3000`. When your Wi-Fi IP changes, update `HOST` here and the matching `NATIVEAPPTEMPLATE_API_DOMAIN` in the mobile apps (Xcode scheme for iOS, `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` for Android) — Rails fails loudly if `HOST` is unset, which keeps the three sides honest. Never use `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, or `0.0.0.0`.

To run your application, you'll use the `bin/dev` command:

```bash
bin/dev
```

This starts up Overmind running the processes defined in `Procfile.dev`. We've configured this to run the Rails server out of the box.

## Deployment

The API deploys with [Kamal 2](https://kamal-deploy.org) to any Linux server with SSH access: `Dockerfile` builds the image, `config/deploy.yml` describes the server, and images are pushed to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io). PostgreSQL runs on the same server as a Kamal accessory, and Solid Queue runs inside Puma, so one small VPS is enough. The server sits behind Cloudflare: the zone's SSL/TLS mode is "Full (strict)", kamal-proxy serves a Cloudflare Origin Certificate, and the server firewall admits port 443 from [Cloudflare's ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/) only. (Without Cloudflare, switch `proxy` in `config/deploy.yml` to the Let's Encrypt variant shown in its comment.)

1. Edit `config/deploy.yml`: the server IP (`servers` and `accessories.db.host`), `image` and `registry.username` (your GitHub user or org), and `proxy.host` (also `app.domain` in `config/settings.yml`).
2. Export the secrets `.kamal/secrets` reads: `KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` (a GitHub token with `write:packages`) and `NATIVEAPPTEMPLATEAPI_POSTGRES_PASSWORD`. `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` comes from `config/credentials/production.key`.
3. Create an Origin Certificate in the Cloudflare dashboard (SSL/TLS → Origin Server) and save both halves outside the repo. Copying from the dashboard can lose the line breaks, so rewrap while saving:

```bash
pem() { ruby -e '
  s = STDIN.read
  m = s.match(/-----BEGIN ([A-Z ]+)-----(.*?)-----END \1-----/m) or abort "not a PEM"
  puts "-----BEGIN #{m[1]}-----", m[2].gsub(/\s+/, "").scan(/.{1,64}/), "-----END #{m[1]}-----"
' ; }
mkdir -p ~/.config/nativeapptemplateapi && chmod 700 ~/.config/nativeapptemplateapi
pbpaste | pem > ~/.config/nativeapptemplateapi/origin-cert.pem   # "Origin Certificate" copied
pbpaste | pem > ~/.config/nativeapptemplateapi/origin-key.pem    # "Private Key" copied
chmod 600 ~/.config/nativeapptemplateapi/origin-*.pem
openssl x509 -in ~/.config/nativeapptemplateapi/origin-cert.pem -noout -subject -enddate
```

4. First deploy:

```bash
bin/kamal setup
```

Later deploys are `bin/kamal deploy`; `bin/kamal console`, `bin/kamal logs` and `bin/kamal dbc` are defined as aliases.
