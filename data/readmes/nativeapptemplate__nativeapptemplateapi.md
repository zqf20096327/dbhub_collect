# NativeAppTemplate API

[![Mentioned in Awesome Rails](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://github.com/gramantin/awesome-rails#startersboilerplates)

A [Rails 8.1](https://rubyonrails.org/) API backend for NativeAppTemplate iOS/Android mobile applications. It's a multi-tenant SaaS application with token-based authentication, role-based authorization, and RESTful API endpoints.

Extracted from the Rails API backend for [MyTurnTag Creator for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/myturntag-creator/id1516198303) and [MyTurnTag Creator for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myturntag.myturntagcreator).

Want a customized backend generated for you? [nativeapptemplate-agent](https://github.com/nativeapptemplate/nativeapptemplate-agent) is a Claude Code agent that turns a one-sentence spec (e.g. *"a walk-in queue for a barbershop"*) into a coherent three-platform implementation — this Rails 8.1 API plus matching [SwiftUI iOS](https://github.com/nativeapptemplate/NativeAppTemplate-Free-iOS) and [Jetpack Compose Android](https://github.com/nativeapptemplate/NativeAppTemplate-Free-Android) apps — renamed and adapted to your domain, with validation built in.

## Requirements

You'll need the following installed to run the template successfully:

* Ruby 4.0.2+
* PostgreSQL 16+
* Libvips - `brew install vips`
* [Overmind](https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind) - `brew install tmux overmind` - helps run all your processes in development

If you use Homebrew, dependencies are listed in `Brewfile` so you can install them using:

```bash
brew bundle install --no-upgrade
```

Then you can start the database servers:

```bash
brew services start postgresql
```

## Initial Setup

First, edit `config/database.yml` and change the database credentials for your server.

Run `bin/setup` to install Ruby and JavaScript dependencies and setup your database and seed initial data to the database.

```bash
bin/setup
```

Push notifications (used by the paid iOS/Android clients) need APNs and FCM credentials. Add them per environment with `bin/rails credentials:edit --environment <env>` under `action_push_native:apns` and `action_push_native:fcm`; see `config/push.yml` for the expected keys.

## Running NativeAppTemplate API on your Wi-Fi

Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and set `HOST` to your current Wi-Fi IP. On macOS: `ipconfig getifaddr en0`. `bin/dev` binds Rails to that address so the dev server is reachable from both the host browser and from any phone on the same network at `http://<wifi-ip>:3000`. When your Wi-Fi IP changes, update `HOST` here and the matching `NATIVEAPPTEMPLATE_API_DOMAIN` in the mobile apps (Xcode scheme for iOS, `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` for Android) — Rails fails loudly if `HOST` is unset, which keeps the three sides honest. Never use `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, or `0.0.0.0`.

To run your application, you'll use the `bin/dev` command:

```bash
bin/dev
```

This starts up Overmind running the processes defined in `Procfile.dev`. We've configured this to run the Rails server out of the box.
