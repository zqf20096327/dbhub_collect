**Clevis turns the GitHub API into a dashboard.** Track repository activity, audit organization security posture, and run privileged maintenance jobs — from a single, dense, self-hosted control panel.

## What it does

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Overview** | At-a-glance stats across your repositories and organization. |
| **Activity** | Repository and org event streams pulled from the GitHub API. |
| **Repositories** | Browse and inspect repositories with their key signals in one place. |
| **Health & Security** | A computed **security score** backed by six automated checks — **MFA enforcement**, **branch protection**, **secret scanning**, **Dependabot alerts**, **code scanning alerts**, and **default-branch force-push protection** — each with a **pass**, **fail**, **error**, or **not_applicable** status and remediation guidance. |
| **Collaborators** | See who has access across the surface you manage. |
| **Automation** | Run privileged maintenance jobs (e.g. clearing GitHub Actions caches) with **dry-run** support and a full **audit trail**. |

Every privileged action is recorded in an immutable audit log, and long-running work is dispatched to a background worker through a Postgres-backed job queue.

---

## Architecture

Clevis is three independently deployable services around one shared check library:

| Component | Stack | Responsibility |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **`apps/api`** | FastAPI · SQLAlchemy 2 · Alembic | REST backend — auth, analytics, RBAC, and job enqueueing. |
| **`apps/worker`** | Python · psycopg3 | Polls the job queue (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`) and executes GitHub API tasks. Scales to multiple replicas safely. |
| **`apps/ui`** | Next.js 15 · React 19 · TanStack Query | The dashboard — dense, dark, keyboard-friendly. |
| **`packages/checks`** | `clevis-checks` (Python) | The security-check engine — six checks (MFA, branch protection, secret scanning, Dependabot alerts, code scanning alerts, default-branch force-push protection) — with built-in GitHub pagination. |

**Security model:** Access is enforced per route with JWT auth dependencies (`require_auth`, `require_workspace_admin`) and org-scoped roles (`require_org_role("member"|"admin")`). GitHub credentials may be stored as Fernet-encrypted rows in `saved_tokens` (legacy PAT path); job payloads are also Fernet-encrypted at enqueue time and decrypted only when the worker processes them. Prefer a connected GitHub App installation so the API can mint short-lived installation tokens instead. Every request carries a propagated `X-Request-ID` for traceability.

## Quickstart

**Prerequisites:** Docker + Docker Compose.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nazarli-shabnam/clevis
cd clevis
cp .env.example .env        # fill in every variable — none have defaults
docker compose up --build -d
```

Then open the UI at **`http://localhost:3000`**.

Full env var reference, GitHub App registration, and production hardening notes live in [`docs/self-hosting.md`](docs/self-hosting.md). Local dev without Docker is covered in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md#running-locally).

## Get started

Once the instance is running, here's how to go from a fresh deploy to a connected GitHub org:

1. **Create the first account.** The first visit lands on `/setup`, which creates the initial admin. After that, sign in with a password or the "Sign in with GitHub" button.
2. **Connect a GitHub org or account.** Go to **Settings → Connected GitHub accounts** and click **Install GitHub App** — this sends you to GitHub to authorize Clevis for that org/account, which is what grants read access to its repos. GitHub redirects you back into the app once you approve it, and the org/account shows up under "Connected GitHub accounts" a few seconds later. (The App itself is a one-time setup step for whoever deployed the instance — see [`docs/self-hosting.md`](docs/self-hosting.md) if that hasn't been done yet.) If you install into a brand-new org and the connection doesn't complete, sign out and back in with **"Sign in with GitHub"** once (this is what verifies your admin access on that org) and retry the install.

That's it — Overview, Activity, Repositories, Collaborators, Health & Security, and Cache all work off the connected org from step 2. A legacy personal access token (**Settings → Personal access tokens (legacy)**) is only ever needed as a manual fallback for an org that has no GitHub App installation — it is not a required step.

**Pasting a PAT connects the org only if you're a GitHub admin of it.** When a workspace admin saves a token whose `read:org` scope lets Clevis confirm they own/administer that org, Clevis connects it then and there (same Org + membership records the App-install and OAuth paths create). If the token lacks `read:org`, or GitHub reports you as a plain member rather than an admin, the token is still saved but only powers Overview's `/me/analytics/overview` endpoint — Repositories, Activity, Releases, Automation, and Collaborators need the step-2 App connection (or, for a non-admin, an accepted org invite) first, and those pages return a clear "isn't connected to Clevis yet" error until then.
