Facet is a local photo-analysis and culling engine. It scores each image across 9 dimensions — from aesthetic quality to face sharpness — then lets you browse, cull, and organize through a web gallery. Everything runs on your machine; no cloud, accounts, or API keys.

## How It Works

1. **Scan** — Point Facet at a folder of photos. Each image is analyzed for quality, composition, and faces. Supports JPG, HEIF/HEIC/HIF (Canon HDR PQ `.HIF` stills are decoded with the SMPTE ST 2084 PQ transfer function and tone-mapped to SDR sRGB automatically), 10 RAW formats (CR2, CR3, NEF, ARW, RAF, RW2, DNG, ORF, SRW, PEF), and PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP, TIFF, and AVIF stills (AVIF needs a Pillow built with AVIF support, native from 11.3). A RAW LibRaw can't decode — such as a Lightroom "Merge to HDR/Panorama" DNG (`-HDR.dng`, `-Pano.dng`) or a camera newer than the installed LibRaw — falls back to its largest embedded preview via `exiftool` (needs a preview at least 1024 px on the long edge; scores then come from that preview, not a full RAW decode). Lightroom Classic 13+ merges (and Enhance) store that preview as JPEG XL; Facet decodes it directly.
2. **Browse** — Open the web gallery to explore your library with filters, search, and multiple view modes.
3. **Cull** — Facet detects bursts, flags blinks, groups similar photos, and surfaces top picks. Exposure brackets and panorama/HDR sets are recognized and kept whole rather than culled apart.

GPU is auto-detected and optional. Facet runs CPU-only or with up to 24 GB VRAM.

## Features

### Score

Each photo is scored across 9 dimensions: aesthetic quality, composition, face quality, eye sharpness, technical sharpness, color, exposure, subject saliency, and dynamic range. Photos are categorized by content (portrait, landscape, macro, street, etc. — 30+ categories) and scored with category-specific weights. A **Top Picks** filter ranks the library by a combined score.

Hover over any photo for a tooltip with the score breakdown and EXIF data.

### Cull

- **Burst detection** — groups rapid-fire shots and auto-selects the best one based on sharpness, quality, and blink detection
- **Sequence protection** — exposure brackets, panorama sweeps, and HDR panoramas (`--detect-sequences` / `--detect-panoramas`) are recognized as deliberate multi-frame sets and kept whole: the culling darkroom starts every frame of a set kept and never reduces it to a single "winner"
- **Similarity groups** — finds visually similar photos across the library, regardless of when they were taken
- **Scenes** — groups a shoot into chronological "scenes" by capture-time gaps, so you cull in story order; tap to mark and confirm to reject
- **Auto-cull** — one button culls a whole scope (all groups, or bursts / similars / scenes only, optionally narrowed to an album or date window) with a dry-run preview, a keeper budget, and an optional Highlights album
- **Genre profiles** — sports / wedding / concert / wildlife presets bundle strictness, keeper budget, similarity threshold and face gates in a single pick
- **Edited-look preview** `[Edition]` — render a photo through a named darktable style inside the culling darkroom, so you cull on the developed look instead of the flat RAW preview
- **Subject close-ups** — no-face groups (wildlife, macro, product) compare by an auto-cropped subject strip with group-normalized sharpness badges
- **Junk sweep** — zero-shot detection of non-photo clutter (screenshots, documents, receipts, memes, slides) with a fast review queue: keep or reject each candidate, or reject all at once
- **Per-face culling badges** — the culling lightbox shows per-face eyes open/closed, expression, and detection-confidence badges, not just a single photo-level blink flag; optional MediaPipe blendshapes sharpen the eyes/smile reads
- **Blink detection** — flags closed-eye shots to hide or reject in one click
- **Duplicate detection** — identifies near-identical images via perceptual hashing

### Browse

- **Gallery modes** — mosaic (justified rows preserving aspect ratios) and grid (uniform cards with metadata overlay)
- **Filters** — date range, content tag, composition pattern, camera, lens, person, folder, quality level, star rating, and custom metric ranges
- **Semantic search** — type a natural-language query like "sunset on the beach" and find matching photos via embedding and text search
- **Timeline** — chronological browser with year/month navigation and infinite scroll
- **Map** — geotagged photos on an interactive map with marker clustering
- **Capsules** — themed slideshows: journeys with place names, golden collection, seasonal palettes, photos of a person, and more
- **Folders** — browse by directory structure with breadcrumb navigation and cover photos
- **Narrative moments** — zero-shot scene/activity labels (beach, celebration, concert, …) name your scenes, filter and sort the gallery, and feed capsule selection
- **Memories** — "On This Day": photos from the same date in previous years
- **Slideshow** — full-screen mode with themed transitions, auto-chaining between capsules, and keyboard controls

**Workflow tips:**
- The **`/timeline`** view drills down years → months → a day calendar — click a day to open the gallery filtered to that date. There's no sort here; for picking the best shots from a trip, use **`/capsules`** below instead, which runs a diversity pass over a date range you can save as an album.
- The **`/capsules`** view generates themed diaporamas (journeys, "Faces of", seasonal, golden) you can save as albums.
- The gallery hides blinks, non-lead bursts, and duplicates by default. When the **"N photos hidden by current filters"** banner appears, click "Show all" to expand the view.

### Organize

- **Face recognition** — automatic face detection, grouping into persons, and blink detection. Search, rename, merge, and organize person clusters from the management UI. **Merge suggestions** find similar-looking clusters that may be the same person.
- **Albums** — manual collections with drag-and-drop, or smart albums that auto-populate from saved filter combinations
- **Ratings & favorites** — star ratings (1–5), favorites, and reject flags. Cycle through ratings with a single click.
- **Tags** — AI-generated content tags with configurable vocabulary. Click any tag to filter the gallery.
- **Batch operations** — multi-select with Shift+click, Ctrl+click, or Ctrl+A (select all). Set ratings, toggle favorites, mark rejects, or add to albums in bulk — with a 7-second undo for every batch action.
- **Keyboard-first** — arrow keys navigate the gallery, Enter opens, Space selects; press `?` anywhere for the shortcut reference.

### Understand

- **Statistics** — dashboards for equipment usage, category breakdown, shooting timeline, and metric correlations
- **AI critique** — score breakdown showing each metric's contribution; VLM natural-language assessment `[GPU]` `[16gb/24gb]`
- **Weight tuning** — per-category weight editor with live score preview. A/B photo comparison learns from your choices and suggests optimized weights.
- **Scoring contexts** — control *which* category a photo is scored as, separately from the weight sliders that only tune the category once it's picked: reorder the global category priority, apply a named context (Action/Stage, Portrait Session, Wildlife, …) per album, or set a sticky per-photo category override that survives every recompute.
- **My Taste sort** — sort the gallery by the personal ranker's learned score, with a confidence badge showing learned coverage and held-out accuracy
- **Learning from labels** — culling decisions, star ratings, favorites, and rejections feed the weight optimizer (`--sync-label-comparisons`, `--mine-insights`)
- **Snapshots** — save, restore, and compare weight configurations
- **Histogram** — RGB/luminance histogram with clipping indicators, in the photo tooltip and detail view
- **AI captions** `[GPU]` `[16gb/24gb]` — text descriptions, editable `[Edition]` and translatable to 5 languages (generation and viewing are open)

### Share

- **Album sharing** — generate shareable links for any album, no login required for recipients. Revoke access at any time.
- **Client proofing** — a shared album can run in proofing mode: clients heart photos and leave comments with just the link (plus an optional PIN), fully isolated from your own ratings
- **Phone auto-upload** — point PhotoSync or any WebDAV app at the built-in `/dav` inbox; `--watch` scores new shots as they arrive
- **Photo frames & kiosks** — a token-guarded endpoint feeds your curated best shots to smart photo frames and Home Assistant dashboards
- **Portfolio export** `[Edition]` — render an album into a self-contained static HTML gallery (no CDN references, works offline) you can drop on any web host
- **Social crops** `[Edition]` — full-resolution exports framed on the detected subject for square, portrait and story aspect presets
- **Photo download** — download individual photos or selections from the gallery
- **Export** — export all scores to CSV or JSON for external analysis

### More

- **Dark & light mode** with 10 accent color themes; respects system preference
- **Responsive** — adapts from mobile to desktop, with a touch-friendly bulk-actions sheet on small screens
- **Installable PWA** — web app manifest + service worker: install to home screen, offline app shell, cached thumbnails
- **Virtualized gallery** — renders a handful of DOM nodes regardless of library size, so scrolling stays fast at 100k+ photos
- **Resumable scans** — interrupted scans resume (`--resume`), failed files are tracked and retryable (`--retry-failed`), progress streams to the web UI
- **7 UI languages** — the viewer ships in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, and Simplified Chinese (简体中文); documentation is available in all seven
- **Multi-user** — per-user directories, ratings, and role-based access
- **Plugins & webhooks** — custom actions triggered on scoring events
- **Scan from web UI** — trigger scans from the browser (superadmin role)

## What you need

Most of Facet runs on **any machine (CPU)** — scoring, face detection, culling, the gallery, search, albums and metadata export all work without a GPU. On **Apple Silicon**, Facet automatically uses PyTorch's Metal (`mps`) backend for Torch models, and the `auto` profile is sized from your total unified memory — a 32 GB Mac reaches the `16gb` profile, a 48 GB one the `24gb` profile; InsightFace remains on ONNX Runtime's CPU provider. An **NVIDIA GPU** (with the `16gb` or `24gb` profile) unlocks the strongest models: TOPIQ aesthetic scoring, SigLIP 2 embeddings, VLM tagging, AI captions and critique, and subject saliency. No local GPU? Point the VLM tagging/captions/critique at a remote **Ollama** or **OpenAI-compatible** server via `vlm_backend` in `scoring_config.json` — those features then work on the CPU `legacy`/`8gb` profiles too. In the viewer, editing actions (ratings, faces, culling) need the **edition password**, and triggering scans needs the **superadmin** role.

## Is Facet for you?

Facet scores, ranks, and culls a local photo library and serves a gallery to browse it. It runs on your own hardware and keeps photos off the cloud.

**A good fit if you:**

- have a large local library and want to find your best shots and cull bursts and near-duplicates;
- want quality, composition, and face scoring you can tune to your own taste (it learns from your A/B comparisons);
- prefer self-hosted and private — no cloud upload, no account, no subscription;
- already edit in Lightroom, darktable, digiKam or immich — Facet writes ratings, labels, keywords, captions and named-face regions to `.xmp` sidecars (originals untouched by default) and can optionally embed them in-file for JPEG/HEIC/TIFF/PNG/DNG (the gallery "Write metadata to file" action or `--export-sidecars --embed-originals`), and reads external edits back with `--import-sidecars`.

**Probably not for you if you want:**

- a turnkey, mobile, cloud-backed Google Photos replacement — though phone auto-upload into a watched inbox is built in over WebDAV (PhotoSync recipe in the docs);
- RAW editing or develop — Facet scores and organizes, it does not edit;
- a zero-setup desktop app — it needs Python, and the best models need a GPU.

**How it relates to other tools**

- Self-hosted libraries (Immich, PhotoPrism) focus on organizing, search, and backup. Facet adds quality scoring, ranking, and a culling workflow they don't, but it has no mobile app or cloud backup (phone auto-upload over WebDAV is built in, and ratings can sync to Immich).
- AI culling apps (Aftershoot, Narrative, FilterPixel) are polished commercial cullers, often with editing built in. Facet is free, local, broader (gallery, search, faces), and its scoring is tunable — but it is a single-developer project without their support or RAW editing.
- Editors and catalogs (Lightroom, darktable, digiKam) develop and manage photos. Facet complements them through the XMP metadata interop above rather than replacing them.

The aesthetic score is model-based and approximate; expect to tune the weights to match your taste.

## Quick Start

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ncoevoet/facet.git && cd facet
cp .env.example .env      # open .env and set PHOTOS_DIR to your photo folder
docker compose up -d      # then open http://localhost:5000
```

Have an NVIDIA card? Use the block for its size in
[Installation](docs/INSTALLATION.md#install-with-docker) — one line each for 8 GB, 16 GB
and 24 GB cards.

### Without Docker (Linux, macOS)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ncoevoet/facet.git && cd facet
bash install.sh                        # detects your hardware, installs everything
source venv/bin/activate
python facet.py /path/to/your/photos   # score photos
python viewer.py                       # gallery → http://localhost:5000
```

> **macOS:** ControlCenter's AirPlay Receiver binds port 5000 by default. If you see "Address already in use", run `python viewer.py --port 5001`.
