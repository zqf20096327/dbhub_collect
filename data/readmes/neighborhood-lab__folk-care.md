> **Software for the people who care.**

Open-source home healthcare management platform with state-specific Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) compliance for all 50 states.

## Why Folk Care?

Home healthcare agencies face a broken software market:
- **Expensive**: $500-2000/month for basic features
- **Inflexible**: Doesn't handle state-specific regulations (Texas HHAeXchange, Florida background screening, etc.)
- **Vendor lock-in**: Proprietary systems with no data ownership

**Folk Care** is different:
- ✅ **Free & Open Source** - MIT license, full code access
- ✅ **State-Specific Compliance** - Automatic EVV rules for TX, FL, and all 50 states
- ✅ **Full Data Ownership** - Self-host or use our managed service
- ✅ **Modern Technology** - TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL
- ✅ **Production Ready** - Built in 28 days with AI assistance, deployed and tested

Built by **[Neighborhood Lab](https://neighborhoodlab.substack.com/)** - community-owned software for the common good.

## Vision

A human-scale alternative to enterprise care management systems. Folk Care emphasizes:

- 🏡 **Human-scale workflows** - Not enterprise excess
- 🔒 **Local autonomy** - Runs offline and on-premises if needed
- 🔌 **Interoperability by design** - APIs, import/export, open schema
- 🛡️ **Privacy and consent first** - Least-privilege access across roles
- 📦 **Incremental adoption** - Start with one vertical, add others later

## Architecture

Folk Care is structured as a set of independently deployable **verticals** that share a common core:

- Unified domain model shared across verticals
- Event-driven data flows for visit lifecycle
- Fine-grained permissions and perspective-based UI
- Durable offline data capture with conflict resolution
- Extensible APIs that allow community-developed modules
- Encryption for sensitive health and payroll-related data
- Automated validation, audit trails, and revision history

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: TypeScript/Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexible data models
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo for efficient builds
- **Validation**: Zod for runtime type safety
- **Testing**: Vitest

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- npm 10+

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/neighborhood-lab/folkcare.git
cd folkcare

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials

# Run database migrations and seed with demo data
npm run db:reset:demo

# This creates 61 clients, 35 caregivers, 605 visits, and more Texas demo data
# Login with: admin@tx.folkcare.example / Demo123!

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```

**📖 See [DEV_WORKFLOW.md](./DEV_WORKFLOW.md) for detailed development workflow documentation.**

### Quick Start (TL;DR)

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run db:reset:demo
npm run dev
# Navigate to http://localhost:5173 and login with admin@tx.folkcare.example / Demo123!
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=folkcare
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_SSL=false

# Development Mock Authentication
MOCK_USER_PASSWORD=password123
```

### Development Login Credentials

The development environment includes three mock users for testing:

| Email                      | Password      | Role        |
|----------------------------|---------------|-------------|
| `admin@example.com`        | `password123` | ADMIN       |
| `coordinator@example.com`  | `password123` | COORDINATOR |
| `caregiver@example.com`    | `password123` | CAREGIVER   |

**Note:** These credentials are for development only. In production, proper authentication with hashed passwords and JWT tokens should be implemented.

### Demo Data & Showcase

Folk includes comprehensive seed scripts for generating realistic demo data:

#### Quick Start with Demo Data

```bash
# 1. Set up database schema and minimal data
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed

# 2. Generate comprehensive showcase data (900+ records)
npm run db:seed:showcase-comprehensive
```

#### Available Seed Scripts

| Command | Records | Purpose | Time |
|---------|---------|---------|------|
| `npm run db:seed` | ~10 | Org, branch, admin user (required first) | 5s |
| `npm run db:seed:demo` | ~20 | Small demo dataset for development | 30s |
| `npm run db:seed:showcase-comprehensive` | **900+** | **Full showcase with realistic data** | 2-5min |

#### What's Generated (Comprehensive Seed)

The `db:seed:showcase-comprehensive` script creates:

- **60 clients** - Distributed across TX, FL, OH states
  - Realistic demographics (ages 65-95)
  - State-specific phone numbers and addresses
  - Medicaid/Medicare coverage
  - Emergency contacts
  - Various diagnoses and mobility levels

- **35 caregivers** - Mix of CNAs, HHAs, and companions
  - Multiple certifications (CNA, CPR, Medication Aide, etc.)
  - Specializations (Alzheimer's, Diabetic Care, Wound Care, etc.)
  - Multiple languages
  - Varying hourly rates and employment types

- **600 visits** - Past, present, and future (-30 to +30 days)
  - Completed visits with full EVV records
  - GPS clock-in/out coordinates
  - Visit statuses: completed, scheduled, in-progress, no-show, cancelled
  - Visit notes for completed visits

- **50 care plans** - ~83% of clients have active care plans
  - Goals with progress tracking
  - Compliance status
  - Plan types: Personal Care, Skilled Nursing, Companion, Therapy

- **40 family members** - ~67% of clients have family portal access
  - Portal access levels
  - Contact preferences
  - Notification settings

- **30-50 invoices** - Generated from completed visits
  - Grouped by month per client
  - Line items with hourly breakdowns
  - Medicaid vs Private Pay
  - Various statuses: Draft, Sent, Paid, Overdue

#### Cleaning Up Demo Data

All demo data is tagged with `is_demo_data = true` for easy cleanup:

```sql
-- Clear all demo data
DELETE FROM visit_evv_records WHERE is_demo_data = true;
DELETE FROM visits WHERE is_demo_data = true;
DELETE FROM invoices WHERE is_demo_data = true;
DELETE FROM care_plans WHERE is_demo_data = true;
DELETE FROM family_members WHERE is_demo_data = true;
DELETE FROM caregivers WHERE is_demo_data = true;
DELETE FROM clients WHERE is_demo_data = true;
```

Or reset and reseed:

```bash
npm run db:nuke          # ⚠️ Drops all tables
npm run db:migrate       # Recreates schema
npm run db:seed          # Creates org/branch/admin
npm run db:seed:showcase-comprehensive  # Generates demo data
```

#### Customizing Demo Data

Edit `packages/core/scripts/seed-showcase-comprehensive.ts` to adjust:

```typescript
const SEED_CONFIG = {
  clients: 60,        // Adjust number of clients
  caregivers: 35,     // Adjust number of caregivers
  visits: 600,        // Adjust number of visits
  carePlans: 50,      // Adjust number of care plans
  familyMembers: 40,  // Adjust number of family members
};
```

#### Troubleshooting

**Error: "No organization found"**
- Run `npm run db:seed` first to create the required org, branch, and admin user

**Error: Database connection failed**
- Check your `.env` file has correct database credentials
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running: `pg_isready`
- Test connection: `psql -h localhost -U postgres -d folkcare`

**Seed script is slow**
- The script generates 900+ records with realistic data
- Expected time: 2-5 minutes depending on your database speed
- Uses transactions for data consistency

**Need different states?**
- Edit the `generateClient()` function to add/modify states
- Default states: TX (Texas), FL (Florida), OH (Ohio)

## Cloud Deployment

Folk supports deployment to **Vercel** with **Neon PostgreSQL** for production-ready, serverless hosting.

**💰 Hosting Costs:** Starting at **$0/month** (free tier) or **$20-30/month** for small agencies. See **[Hosting Costs Documentation](./docs/HOSTING_COSTS.md)** for detailed pricing, scaling paths, and cost optimization strategies.

### Prerequisites for Cloud Deployment

1. **Vercel Account** - Sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. **Neon PostgreSQL** - Create a database at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
3. **Vercel CLI** - Install globally: `npm install -g vercel`

### Neon PostgreSQL Setup

1. Create a new project at [console.neon.tech](https://console.neon.tech)
2. Create two databases:
   - `folkcare_staging` (for staging environment)
   - `folkcare_production` (for production environment)
3. Enable connection pooling for each database
4. Copy the connection strings (with pooling enabled)

### Vercel Project Setup

1. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Login to Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. Link your project:
   ```bash
   vercel link
   ```

4. Add environment variables to Vercel:
   ```bash
   # For production
   vercel env add DATABASE_URL production
   # Paste your Neon production connection string (with pooling)
   
   # For staging
   vercel env add DATABASE_URL preview
   # Paste your Neon staging connection string (with pooling)
   
   # Add other secrets
   vercel env add JWT_SECRET production
   vercel env add ENCRYPTION_KEY production
   ```

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Deploy to preview (automatic on PRs)
npm run deploy:preview

# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:production
```

### GitHub Actions Deployment

The project includes automated deployment workflows:

#### Preview Deployments
- Automatically deploy on every pull request
- Preview URL posted as PR comment
- Uses staging database

#### Staging Deployments
- Deploy to staging on `develop` branch pushes
- Runs database migrations automatically
- Health check validation

#### Production Deployments
- Deploy to production on `main` branch pushes
- Runs database migrations automatically
- Health check validation
- Optional demo data seeding

### Required GitHub Secrets

Add these secrets in your repository settings (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

```bash
# Vercel
VERCEL_TOKEN=<your-vercel-token>
VERCEL_ORG_ID=<your-vercel-org-id>
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=<your-vercel-project-id>

# Database
DATABASE_URL=<neon-production-connection-string>
STAGING_DATABASE_URL=<neon-staging-connection-string>

# Application
JWT_SECRET=<random-secret-string>
STAGING_JWT_SECRET=<random-secret-string>
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32-byte-random-string>
```

### Health Check Endpoint

After deployment, verify your application:

```bash
# Check production health
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/health

# Expected response
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "environment": "production",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "responseTime": 45,
  "database": {
    "status": "connected",
    "responseTime": 45
  },
  "memory": {
    "used": 128,
    "total": 256
  }
}
```

### Database Migrations on Vercel

Migrations run automatically during deployment via GitHub Actions. To run manually:

```bash
# Set DATABASE_URL environment variable
export DATABASE_URL="your-neon-connection-string"

# Run migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Seed demo data (optional)
npm run db:seed:demo
```

### Monitoring and Logging

- **Vercel Dashboard**: View deployment logs and metrics
- **Neon Console**: Monitor database performance and queries
- **Health Endpoint**: `/health` for uptime monitoring
- **Error Tracking**: Configure Sentry DSN in environment variables (optional)

### Rollback

To rollback a deployment:

```bash
# List recent deployments
vercel ls

# Promote a previous deployment to production
vercel promote <deployment-url> --scope <team-name>
```

### Best Practices

1. **Database Pooling**: Always use Neon's pooled connection string for serverless environments
2. **Environment Variables**: Never commit secrets to git - use Vercel environment variables
3. **Migrations**: Test migrations on staging before deploying to production
4. **Health Checks**: Monitor the `/health` endpoint for database connectivity
5. **Preview Deployments**: Review changes on preview URLs before merging to main
