A family hub: tasks, notes, calendar, money and a shared mailbox in one place. Built for a household, not a corporation: one Docker container, one SQLite file, no external services required. Run it yourself on a home machine or a cheap VPS, or let us run it for you at [neiliro.com](https://neiliro.com) — same code, same file per family.

The core is complete and battle-tested by daily family use: accounts and sign-in (password and Google, with optional two-factor codes), projects and tasks with a kanban board, notes with attachments and wiki-links, a calendar with recurring events, shared lists for the shopping run, a shared family mailbox that turns letters into tasks, search, a home screen you arrange yourself out of widgets, and a money section — accounts with balances, expenses, income, transfers, bank reconciliation, categories, budgets, recurring transactions, receipts. It installs to the home screen as an app and keeps working read-only when the Wi-Fi does not.

What the family writes is encrypted in the browser with a family key the server never holds: the content of notes, tasks, events, list items, money notes, attachments and letters is stored as ciphertext, while dates, amounts and links stay readable so budgets, recurrence and reconciliation keep running on the server. Whoever holds a copy of the database — the operator of a hosted family included — sees who, when and how much, not what was written. The exceptions are deliberate and listed in [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-client-side-encryption.md): a letter is seen once on arrival before it is sealed, a wishlist is public by design, member names stay readable.

## A quick look

## Why not Notion / Google / Nextcloud?

The most common question in the feedback, in its three variants — answered honestly.

**Why not Notion or Obsidian?** Those are builders: a blank canvas and
blocks, and the family system is yours to design, maintain — and teach
to a spouse who never asked for a database course. Neiliro is the
opposite trade: an opinionated finished product. Tasks, notes, calendar
and money work a particular way out of the box, with the decisions
already made. If you enjoy building your own system, a builder will
genuinely serve you better; this is for families who want the thing,
not the constructor kit.

**Why not Google Keep + Calendar?** For lists and dates it is honestly
fine. The reason this project exists is money: shared accounts, budgets
with limits, recurring payments and bank reconciliation are the core
here, and no combination of Keep, Calendar and a spreadsheet does that
as one coherent thing. There is also a quieter argument: the family
archive — finances, receipts, private notes — lives in a SQLite file on
your own machine, not in an advertising company's cloud.

**Why not Nextcloud?** Closest in spirit — self-hosted, your data. But
Nextcloud is a platform: an app store, plugins with separate authors and
separate bugs, and real administration overhead. Neiliro is one small
app: one container, one database file, updates that take a minute.
Privacy is structural, not a setting — "private" is enforced
server-side per owner, and there is deliberately no admin backdoor to
read someone else's notes (see [architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)).

## Quick start

At home, with Docker:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

The hub comes up on `http://localhost:8787` and is reachable from other devices on the network by the machine's address. An empty hub offers to create the first account right in the browser — that account becomes the administrator; family members join via single-use invitation links. Data lives **outside the project folder** (`~/.family-hub` or the mounted volume), so updating the code never touches it.

Tagged releases publish a prebuilt multi-arch image (amd64 + arm64, so Raspberry Pi works) to GitHub Container Registry — point `image:` in the compose file at it to skip building:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/neiliro/neiliro:latest   # or a pinned release: :2.0.1
```

For development:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend on `http://localhost:5173`, API on `http://localhost:8787`. Vite listens on all interfaces, so tablets and phones on the same network can open `http://<machine-ip>:5173`.

## Documentation

- **[Deploying to a VPS](docs/deploy-vps.md)** — from a blank Ubuntu
  machine to `https://hub.example.com`: server hardening, launch,
  backups, Google sign-in, a public demo, auto-deploy from GitHub.
- **[Running on a home server](docs/home-server.md)** — HTTPS on the
  local network, the `.local` name and Bonjour, updating, backups,
  moving to another machine.
- **[Features](docs/features.md)** — the walkthrough: accounts and
  invitations, tasks, notes, calendar, search, and the money section
  with its semantics (reconciliation, budgets, recurring payments).
- **[Family mail](docs/family-mail.md)** — connecting the shared
  household mailbox: a dedicated account or a corner of a personal
  Gmail behind a label.
- **[Architecture](docs/architecture.md)** — the technical decisions:
  SQLite and migrations, local wall-clock time, money as integers,
  logging, how the demo sandboxes work.
- **[ADR 0001 — client-side encryption](docs/adr/0001-client-side-encryption.md)** —
  why the words are encrypted and the structure is not, what the family
  key is, and the honest list of what stays visible.
- **[Checking the app you were served](docs/verify.md)** — the published
  hashes of every release bundle, how to compare them with what your
  browser loaded, and how to rebuild the list from the tag yourself.

## Hosted

The same image with `HOSTED_MODE=true` runs [neiliro.com](https://neiliro.com):
one subdomain and one SQLite file per family, nothing shared between
families. A family signs itself up from the landing page, gets 30 days
free without a card, then pays €4.99 a month or €44.99 a year; the
self-hosted version is free for good and ships from the same tag. The
control plane (Caddy with a wildcard certificate, backups, the operator
runbook) lives in a separate repository and is not needed to run the hub
at home.

## Demo mode

`DEMO_MODE=true` turns the hub into a public sandbox where every visitor
gets a private throwaway copy of a seeded sample family — one button to
enter, no password, self-cleaning. Details in
[architecture.md](docs/architecture.md); deployment next to a production
hub in [deploy-vps.md](docs/deploy-vps.md).

## Roadmap

The roadmap lives where you can see and influence it:

- **[Roadmap board](https://github.com/orgs/neiliro/projects/1)** —
  Now / Next / Later at a glance.
- **[Releases](https://github.com/neiliro/neiliro/releases)** —
  what landed and when.
- **[Issues](https://github.com/neiliro/neiliro/issues)** — vote
  with a 👍 on what you want most; that is genuinely how things get
  prioritized here.

Want to contribute? [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) covers running it
locally, the house conventions and the invariants worth knowing before
you touch the money or the privacy code. Start with a
[good first issue](https://github.com/neiliro/neiliro/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) —
they are written to be picked up cold.

Coming up next: CSV bank-statement import, and reading the family mailbox
from an ordinary mail app.
