# Elengrab

**Fast cross-platform application for downloading and watching video and audio with flexible format and quality options. Integrates with media processing utilities such as [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg). Supports downloading from more than 1,000 websites and platforms, including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, Twitch, Pinterest, Reddit, VK Video, Rutube, and more.**

Elengrab provides a simple and very fast web interface for downloading and watching media directly in the browser, with a YouTube-like viewing experience, thumbnails, video previews, and a dedicated interface optimized for mobile devices. Supports Grid View, short links for sharing, and flexible playback options. On mobile devices, videos can be shared directly from apps such as YouTube and Instagram to Elengrab, where they are automatically picked up and downloaded.

The project is fully written in **Go**, with a frontend built using plain **HTML** and **CSS**, **HTMX**, and vanilla **JavaScript** without external libraries. It can run as a single binary on Windows, Linux, and macOS, or in a lightweight Docker container for easy deployment. Elengrab also includes full **PWA** support, allowing it to be installed and used as a standalone application. Different operating modes allow you to enable authentication and use Elengrab as a full-featured web service accessible over the Internet. This makes it well suited for creating a fast-access home media service as well as a personal media service accessible from anywhere.

## Media Content

Elengrab is designed to work with video and audio content from a wide range of websites and platforms through [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

Users are responsible for ensuring that their use of Elengrab and downloaded content complies with applicable laws, copyright requirements, and the terms of service of the respective platforms.

---

## Requirements

### Minimum

* **CPU:** 1–2 cores
* **Memory:** ~512 MB RAM
* **Concurrent downloads:** 1 worker
* **Dependencies:** [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) must be installed
* **Optional:** [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno) is required when using cookie support

This configuration is suitable for low-resource servers. To limit concurrency, set:

```
ELENGRAB_DOWNLOAD_WORKERS=1
```

### Recommended

* **CPU:** 4 cores
* **Memory:** 4 GB RAM
* **Concurrent downloads:** 3 workers (default)
* **Dependencies:** [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) must be installed
* **Optional:** [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno) is required when using cookie support

By default, the Docker container is configured to use this setup.

### Notes

The main resource consumers are `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`, especially during video downloading, merging, and transcoding.

Resource usage increases with the number of concurrent workers. The number of concurrent workers can be adjusted using the following environment variable:

```
ELENGRAB_DOWNLOAD_WORKERS=3
```

---
