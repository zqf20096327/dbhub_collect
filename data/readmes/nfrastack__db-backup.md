# nfrastack/db-backup

Consistent, scheduled database backups for nine engines with a single, secret friendly binary.

db-backup is a cross platform tool that backs up, restores, verifies, and maintains databases across multiple engines using one unified configuration syntax. Whether you are calling it from your own scripts or using the built-in multi-job scheduler, db-backup fits servers, containers, and CI pipelines alike.

## Features

- Multi engine - MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Microsoft SQL Server, Redis, SQLite3, InfluxDB, CouchDB
- Backup strategies - full, incremental, differential, schema only
- Table selection - include/exclude filters, per table schema only
- Storage - filesystem, S3 compatible, WebDAV, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage
- Encryption at rest - AGE, GPG/OpenPGP, OpenSSL AES-256 recipients or passphrases
- Scheduling - cron, intervals, clock times, natural language, day filters, blackout windows
- Retention - keep last, time window, and per period tiers (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)
- Compression - zstd, gzip, bzip2, xz with configurable levels and parallel threading
- Restore - CLI, interactive guided mode, config driven profiles
- Integrity - checksums, JSON sidecar metadata per backup
- Maintenance  analyze, optimize, vacuum, reindex, compact, memory purge on succesful backup or independently.
- Hooks & observability - pre/post hooks, live progress, detailed logging via text or json

Most features work out of the box in the free Community edition. Some advanced features require a [Supporter license](https://nfrastack.com/db-backup/editions).

## Get Started

Run your first backup with the container:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e DB01_TYPE=mysql \
  -e DB01_HOST=db-internal \
  -e DB01_USER=backup \
  -e DB01_PASS=secret \
  -e DB01_NAME=testdb \
  -v ./backups:/backup \
  docker.io/nfrastack/db-backup:latest
```

Or grab a [precompiled binary](https://www.nfrastack.com/db-backup/install), build [from source](https://nfrastack.com/db-backup/install), or use the [NixOS module](https://nfrastack.com/db-backup/nixos) and use the configuration files to perform advanced functions.
