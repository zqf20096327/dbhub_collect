## What is NGB Platform

**NGB Platform** is an open-source platform for building **document-driven business applications** and **industry-specific vertical solutions** on **.NET** and **PostgreSQL**

NGB provides a production-oriented foundation for systems built around:

- catalogs and business documents;
- posting and accounting effects;
- operational and reference registers;
- metadata-driven forms and lists;
- auditability and explainability;
- reporting and analytical views;
- vertical solutions built on a shared platform core.

NGB is not a low-code toy and not a monolithic ERP bundle. It is a **platform for building serious line-of-business systems** with a clear architecture, strong domain conventions, and a practical path from framework to real vertical applications.

---

## Why NGB exists

Business software is usually forced into one of two extremes:

- **generic web frameworks**, which are flexible but leave the hardest business architecture problems unsolved;
- **large ERP products**, which are powerful but heavy, inflexible, and difficult to adapt cleanly.

NGB exists to offer a third path:

- a **modular platform** instead of one-off project scaffolding;
- a **business-application architecture** instead of generic MVC plumbing;
- a **document-driven business foundation** instead of ad-hoc CRUD screens and one-off workflow logic;
- **accounting capabilities** when a vertical needs financial posting and reporting;
- a **shared platform core + vertical solutions** model instead of duplicating infrastructure across products.

The goal is simple: help developers and product teams build production-grade business systems faster, with fewer architectural compromises and a stronger long-term foundation.

---

## Who NGB is for

NGB is designed for:

- **software engineers and architects** building serious business applications;
- **product teams** creating vertical SaaS or internal business platforms;
- **consultancies and implementation teams** building industry-specific solutions;
- **founders** who need a reusable platform for multiple business products;
- **teams that want source code ownership** instead of vendor lock-in.

NGB is especially relevant when your solution includes one or more of the following:

- business documents with lifecycle and posting;
- accounting logic or financial statements;
- operational balances or register-style state tracking;
- metadata-driven UI and dynamic forms;
- auditable history and explainable system behavior;
- multiple industry solutions sharing one platform base.

---

## What you can build with NGB

NGB is designed for building serious business software.

It is well suited for applications where business documents, workflows, accounting, reporting, auditability, and domain-specific rules are core architectural concerns rather than secondary features.

With NGB, teams can build:

- vertical business applications;
- finance and operations platforms;
- accounting-enabled SaaS products;
- internal enterprise systems;
- industry-specific ERP-style solutions;
- workflow-heavy back-office applications;
- custom business platforms with strong domain modeling;
- long-lived systems that require explainability, consistency, and extensibility.

The demo solutions included in this repository show a few possible applications of the platform, but they do not limit the range of systems that can be built with NGB.

## Architecture overview

NGB follows a **layered platform architecture** built around reusable platform hosts, shared contracts and metadata, a central execution core, specialized business engines, and PostgreSQL-based persistence.

At the top level, NGB provides dedicated platform hosts for API delivery, background processing, health and operability, and schema deployment. These hosts do not implement business behavior themselves. Instead, they compose and expose the platform through shared contracts, abstractions, and runtime orchestration.

At the center of the platform is **NGB.Runtime**. It acts as the execution core that coordinates catalogs, documents, posting, reporting, validation, and workflow behavior. Rather than scattering business logic across hosts, NGB concentrates orchestration in the runtime layer and delegates specialized responsibilities to dedicated platform engines.

Those engines include **NGB.Accounting**, **NGB.OperationalRegisters**, **NGB.ReferenceRegisters**, and the business audit log. Together they provide the core business mechanics of the platform: ledger semantics, register-based state handling, reference-state projection, and append-only auditability.

Persistence and database interaction are handled through **NGB.PostgreSql**, which serves as the platform’s infrastructure bridge for readers, writers, and migration support. Platform data is stored in **PostgreSQL**, while authentication is integrated with **Keycloak**.

---

## Performance testing

NGB includes a reusable Grafana k6 + TypeScript performance testing framework under [`performance-tests`](./performance-tests).

The framework validates platform-level behavior and vertical-specific workloads with realistic business scenarios such as metadata and menu loading, document reads, document lifecycle operations, posting, audit reads, accounting effects, document flow, report execution, capacity staircases, breakpoint discovery, and opt-in write-heavy pressure.

Initial vertical coverage is provided for Property Management, with Trade and Agency Billing structured as extensions. Destructive write-heavy profiles are opt-in and excluded from the normal `pm:all` chain.

See:

- [`performance-tests/README.md`](./performance-tests/README.md)
- [`performance-tests/ngb-performance-tests-framework/README.md`](./performance-tests/ngb-performance-tests-framework/README.md)

### 🔒 HTTPS certificates

The Docker Compose setup mounts ASP.NET certificates from `${HOME}/.aspnet/https`. On a new machine, generate development certificates first if needed:

```bash
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

### ⚠️ Windows note

Before starting the application in Docker on Windows, ensure that the `$HOME` environment variable is set in the current PowerShell session.

Check the current value:

```powershell
echo "$HOME"
```

If it is not set correctly, define it manually:

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('HOME', $env:USERPROFILE.Replace('\', '/'), 'User')
```

## Design principles

NGB is built around a few strong principles:

### 1. Platform first

Shared cross-cutting capabilities belong in the platform, not duplicated across solutions.

### 2. Vertical-ready architecture

Industry solutions should extend the platform cleanly without turning the platform into vertical-specific code.

### 3. Accounting-aware business design

Accounting, registers, balances, and reporting are not afterthoughts. They are core platform concerns.

### 4. Metadata-driven UI and behavior

The platform should describe forms, lists, actions, and interactions as reusable metadata wherever that makes sense.

### 5. Durable system of record

PostgreSQL is the authoritative source of business truth.

### 6. Auditability and explainability

Business systems should make it possible to understand what happened, why it happened, and what effects were produced.

### 7. Production-minded engineering

The goal is not a demo-first framework. The goal is a reusable foundation for real business software.
