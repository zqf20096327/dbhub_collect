## What is NGB Platform

**NGB Platform** is an open-source platform for building **document-driven business applications** and **industry-specific vertical solutions** on **.NET** and **PostgreSQL**

NGB provides a production-oriented foundation for systems built around:

- catalogs and business documents;
- posting and accounting effects;
- operational and reference registers;
- metadata-driven forms and lists;
- auditability and explainability;
- reporting and analytical views;
- vertical solutions built on a shared platform core.

NGB is not a low-code toy and not a monolithic ERP bundle. It is a **platform for building serious line-of-business systems** with a clear architecture, strong domain conventions, and a practical path from framework to real vertical applications.

---

## Why NGB exists

Business software is usually forced into one of two extremes:

- **generic web frameworks**, which are flexible but leave the hardest business architecture problems unsolved;
- **large ERP products**, which are powerful but heavy, inflexible, and difficult to adapt cleanly.

NGB exists to offer a third path:

- a **modular platform** instead of one-off project scaffolding;
- a **business-application architecture** instead of generic MVC plumbing;
- a **document-driven business foundation** instead of ad-hoc CRUD screens and one-off workflow logic;
- **accounting capabilities** when a vertical needs financial posting and reporting;
- a **shared platform core + vertical solutions** model instead of duplicating infrastructure across products.

The goal is simple: help developers and product teams build production-grade business systems faster, with fewer architectural compromises and a stronger long-term foundation.

---

## Who NGB is for

NGB is designed for:

- **software engineers and architects** building serious business applications;
- **product teams** creating vertical SaaS or internal business platforms;
- **consultancies and implementation teams** building industry-specific solutions;
- **founders** who need a reusable platform for multiple business products;
- **teams that want source code ownership** instead of vendor lock-in.

NGB is especially relevant when your solution includes one or more of the following:

- business documents with lifecycle and posting;
- accounting logic or financial statements;
- operational balances or register-style state tracking;
- metadata-driven UI and dynamic forms;
- auditable history and explainable system behavior;
- multiple industry solutions sharing one platform base.

---

## What you can build with NGB

NGB is designed for building serious business software.

It is well suited for applications where business documents, workflows, accounting, reporting, auditability, and domain-specific rules are core architectural concerns rather than secondary features.

With NGB, teams can build:

- vertical business applications;
- finance and operations platforms;
- accounting-enabled SaaS products;
- internal enterprise systems;
- industry-specific ERP-style solutions;
- workflow-heavy back-office applications;
- custom business platforms with strong domain modeling;
- long-lived systems that require explainability, consistency, and extensibility.

The demo solutions included in this repository show a few possible applications of the platform, but they do not limit the range of systems that can be built with NGB.

## Architecture overview

NGB follows a **layered platform architecture** built around reusable platform hosts, shared contracts and metadata, a central execution core, specialized business engines, and PostgreSQL-based persistence.

At the top level, vertical application hosts compose reusable API, background-processing, health,
and migration capabilities. Provider-neutral hosting behavior lives in dedicated hosting adapters;
PostgreSQL-specific web and Hangfire integration lives in provider adapters. These layers do not
implement business behavior themselves. They expose the platform through shared contracts,
abstractions, and runtime orchestration.

At the center of the platform is **NGB.Runtime**. It acts as the execution core that coordinates catalogs, documents, posting, reporting, validation, and workflow behavior. Rather than scattering business logic across hosts, NGB concentrates orchestration in the runtime layer and delegates specialized responsibilities to dedicated platform engines.

Those engines include **NGB.Accounting**, **NGB.OperationalRegisters**, **NGB.ReferenceRegisters**, and the business audit log. Together they provide the core business mechanics of the platform: ledger semantics, register-based state handling, reference-state projection, and append-only auditability.

Persistence and database interaction are handled through **NGB.PostgreSql**, which serves as the
platform’s infrastructure bridge for readers, writers, and migrations. **NGB.Hosting.AspNetCore**
and **NGB.Runtime.Hosting** own provider-neutral host integration, while
**NGB.PostgreSql.AspNetCore** and **NGB.BackgroundJobs.PostgreSql** own PostgreSQL-specific host
adapters. Platform data is stored in **PostgreSQL**, while authentication is integrated with
**Keycloak**.

## Technology stack

NGB is built with a practical, production-oriented stack:

- **Backend:** .NET 10
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Schema versioning:** Evolve
- **Authentication / SSO:** Keycloak
- **Background jobs:** Hangfire-based job infrastructure
- **Logging / observability:** Serilog + Seq-friendly structured logging setup
- **Frontend:** Vue 3 + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shared UI workspace
- **Containerized local environments:** Docker Compose

---

## Performance testing

NGB includes a reusable Grafana k6 + TypeScript performance testing framework under [`performance-tests`](./performance-tests).

The framework validates platform-level behavior and vertical-specific workloads with realistic business scenarios such as metadata and menu loading, document reads, document lifecycle operations, posting, audit reads, accounting effects, document flow, report execution, capacity staircases, breakpoint discovery, and opt-in write-heavy pressure.

Initial vertical coverage is provided for Property Management, with Trade and Agency Billing structured as extensions. Destructive write-heavy profiles are opt-in and excluded from the normal `pm:all` chain.

See:

- [`performance-tests/README.md`](./performance-tests/README.md)
- [`performance-tests/ngb-performance-tests-framework/README.md`](./performance-tests/ngb-performance-tests-framework/README.md)
- [Performance Testing docs](./docs/platform/performance-testing.md)

---

## Getting started

### 🔑 Demo access

The demo applications include a preconfigured administrator account for evaluation purposes.

**Default demo user**
- **Name:** Alex Carter
- **Role:** Admin
- **Email:** alex.carter@demo.ngbplatform.com
- **Password:** `DemoAdmin!2026`

This account is intended for demo and evaluation use only.

### Prerequisites

You should have the following installed:

- .NET 10 SDK for local backend builds
- Docker with Linux containers and Docker Compose v2
- Node.js 22.14+ and npm for local frontend development (the Dockerfiles use Node.js 22.17)
- Bash for the repository's shell scripts; Windows PowerShell alternatives are linked below

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngbplatform/NGB.git
cd NGB
```
### 🔒 HTTPS certificates

The Docker Compose setup mounts ASP.NET certificates from `${HOME}/.aspnet/https` and expects
`servercert.pfx`. Trust and export a development certificate; the export password must match
`ASPNET_CERT_PASS` in the selected `.env.*` file:

```bash
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
mkdir -p "$HOME/.aspnet/https"
dotnet dev-certs https --export-path "$HOME/.aspnet/https/servercert.pfx" --password "<ASPNET_CERT_PASS>"
```

### ⚠️ Windows note

Docker Compose reads the `HOME` environment variable. PowerShell's `$HOME` variable alone does not
set it for child processes. In the same PowerShell session used to run Compose:

```powershell
$env:HOME = $env:USERPROFILE.Replace('\', '/')
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$env:HOME/.aspnet/https" | Out-Null
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
dotnet dev-certs https --export-path "$env:HOME/.aspnet/https/servercert.pfx" --password "<ASPNET_CERT_PASS>"
```

For Compose launched by an IDE, also configure `HOME` in that run configuration or persist it as a
user environment variable and restart the IDE.

### Prepare local platform packages

CRM consumes NuGet and npm packages, while PM, Trade, and Agency Billing use platform source
projects/workspaces. Before building the complete solution or starting CRM against unpublished
changes, create the local NuGet feed. Before building the CRM web image, create its UI tarball too.
Generated packages are ignored by Git and are absent after a fresh clone.

On macOS/Linux, from the repository root:

```bash
bash packaging/nuget/pack-platform.sh
npm --prefix ui ci
npm --prefix ui run pack:platform-ui -- --local-candidate
```

The NuGet script packs all platform projects, refreshes `artifacts/nuget`, invalidates replaced
cache entries, and restores the solution. The UI command creates
`artifacts/npm/ngbplatform-ui-local.tgz` without changing the published CRM lockfile.

On Windows, follow the [PowerShell package preparation instructions](docs/start-here/run-locally.md#prepare-local-platform-packages).
They include a Linux-container UI packaging command for the current script's Windows launcher limitation.

### Run the Property Management demo locally

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.pm.yml --env-file .env.pm up --build
```

### Run the Trade demo locally

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.trade.yml --env-file .env.trade up --build
```

### Run the Agency Billing demo locally

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.ab.yml --env-file .env.ab up --build
```

### Run the CRM demo locally

Complete the package preparation above first. Repack after changing platform backend or UI code,
then rebuild the CRM images:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.crm.yml --env-file .env.crm up --build
```

### Build the .NET solution

Prepare the local NuGet packages above first when the required platform version is unpublished or
when validating local platform changes through CRM.

```bash
dotnet build NGB.sln
```

### Run backend tests

```bash
dotnet test NGB.sln
```

### Run frontend workspace tests

```bash
cd ui
npm install
npm run test:all
```

> Exact local environment details may evolve over time. The live demos are the fastest way to see the platform in action.

## Design principles

NGB is built around a few strong principles:

### 1. Platform first

Shared cross-cutting capabilities belong in the platform, not duplicated across solutions.

### 2. Vertical-ready architecture

Industry solutions should extend the platform cleanly without turning the platform into vertical-specific code.

### 3. Accounting-aware business design

Accounting, registers, balances, and reporting are not afterthoughts. They are core platform concerns.

### 4. Metadata-driven UI and behavior

The platform should describe forms, lists, actions, and interactions as reusable metadata wherever that makes sense.

### 5. Durable system of record

PostgreSQL is the authoritative source of business truth.

### 6. Auditability and explainability

Business systems should make it possible to understand what happened, why it happened, and what effects were produced.

### 7. Production-minded engineering

The goal is not a demo-first framework. The goal is a reusable foundation for real business software.
