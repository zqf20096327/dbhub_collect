`npm-safe-forDSH` is a supply-chain security gate for
[DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness). It lets an
agent inspect npm package metadata and published tarballs **before** an install,
then returns evidence, a risk level, and an explainable score inside the same
conversation.

> If this makes your agent workflow safer, please **Star the repository**. It
> helps other DSH users find an independent security tool.

## 30-second install

```bash
dsh plugin --profile tui add @npm-safe/dsh-tool-npm-safe --allow-build=better-sqlite3
dsh --profile tui
```

Restart a running profile after installation. Then ask:

```text
Deep-scan fast-glob before installing it. Explain every finding.
```

For a quick metadata-only check:

```text
Use check_package to check lodash.
```

The plugin is declared as a native DSH bundle, so the official `dsh plugin`
command installs the package and activates its `cordis.patch.yml` layer.
`--allow-build=better-sqlite3` grants build permission only to the SQLite
driver used for the local cache; pnpm continues to block install scripts from
other dependencies. Your selected DSH model provider must already be
configured; a DeepSeek API key is only required when DeepSeek is the selected
provider.

## What it catches

| Signal | Metadata scan | Deep scan |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Suspicious lifecycle scripts and install hooks | ✅ | ✅ |
| Typosquatting, abandoned packages, risky maintainers | ✅ | ✅ |
| Non-standard registries and remote binaries | ✅ | ✅ |
| Tarball integrity mismatch and unsafe archive paths | — | ✅ |
| Obfuscated code, embedded secrets, shell/network execution | — | ✅ |
| Native binaries, WebAssembly, oversized or truncated content | — | ✅ |

Metadata scans are fast and remain the default. Set `deep: true` to download
the same-origin published tarball, verify npm integrity metadata, and inspect
bounded source content entirely in memory.

```text
package: fast-glob@3.3.3
level: safe
score: 88/100
integrity: verified
files scanned: 91
findings: 1 low, 0 medium, 0 high, 0 critical
```

## Why use it in an agent

| Typical agent workflow | With npm-safe-forDSH |
|---|---|
| Installs first and audits later | Checks before the install decision |
| Trusts package names and download counts | Evaluates maintainers, scripts, provenance signals, and content |
| Returns a pass/fail with little context | Returns findings, evidence, severity, score, and recommendations |
| Repeats registry traffic | Uses a local SQLite cache and rate limiting |
| Checks one package manually | Supports batch checks, watchlists, refresh jobs, and CI gates |

## 14 agent tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `check_package` | Check one package, optionally with `deep: true` |
| `check_packages` | Rate-limited batch checking |
| `search_packages` | Search the npm registry |
| `watch_add` / `watch_remove` / `watch_list` | Manage a persistent watchlist |
| `rules_list` / `rule_enable` / `rule_disable` | Inspect and toggle rules |
| `rule_set_severity` | Override a rule severity |
| `settings_get` / `settings_set` | Read or update engine settings |
| `ci_scan` | Scan a project's dependencies as a security gate |
| `refresh_all` | Refresh the watchlist as a background DSH job |

## Security model

- Core detection is deterministic and local-first; no package source is sent
  to an external LLM by default.
- Deep scans reject cross-origin tarballs and enforce archive size, file count,
  decompression, path, and scanned-text limits.
- Findings are evidence, not a guarantee that a package is safe. Review high
  impact packages and pin versions in production.
- See the complete [scanner rules](packages/core/SCANNER_RULES.md) and
  [security policy](SECURITY.md).

## Use the engine directly

```bash
pnpm add @npm-safe/core-dsh
```

```ts
import { NpmSafeEngine } from "@npm-safe/core-dsh";

const engine = new NpmSafeEngine();
const report = await engine.checkPackage("lodash", { deep: true });
console.log(report.level, report.score, report.findings);
await engine.close();
```

## Develop from source

Requires Node.js 22.19+ and Corepack.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nisconder/npm-safe-forDSH.git
cd npm-safe-forDSH
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@11.7.0 --activate
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run test
```

Live registry smoke tests:

```bash
node scripts/smoke.mjs lodash
node scripts/smoke-facade.mjs
```

The workspace contains [`@npm-safe/core-dsh`](packages/core) and the
[`@npm-safe/dsh-tool-npm-safe`](packages/tool-npm-safe) bundle. DSH peer
packages are aligned to the `0.1.0-rc.6` family; upgrades must remain aligned
while DeepSeek Harness is in developer preview.
