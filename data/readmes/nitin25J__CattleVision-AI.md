#  CattleVision AI

## AI-Powered Indian Cattle Breed Identification System

CattleVision AI is a **computer-vision-based web application** that identifies Indian cattle breeds from images using a deep-learning classification model.

The system uses a **fine-tuned EfficientNet-B0 model with PyTorch** to classify cattle images into **18 selected Indian cattle breeds**, achieving **90% test accuracy** on the evaluated dataset.

The application provides a complete end-to-end pipeline, from image upload and preprocessing to AI inference and breed prediction through a web interface.

##  Problem Statement

Identifying cattle breeds manually can be challenging, particularly when different breeds share similar physical characteristics.

Traditional identification often depends on visual expertise and domain knowledge, which may not always be readily available to farmers, field workers, researchers, or other users.

CattleVision AI provides an accessible **AI-assisted image-based approach** for identifying supported Indian cattle breeds.

---

##  Solution

CattleVision AI allows users to upload an image of cattle through a web interface.

The image is sent to the backend API, where it is processed and passed through a trained **EfficientNet-B0** model. The model predicts the most likely breed and returns the result to the frontend.
