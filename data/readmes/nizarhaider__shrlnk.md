## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Domain Setup

1. Purchase a domain from a domain registrar (e.g., Namecheap, GoDaddy, Route53)
2. Set up DNS records:
```
Type  | Name                      | Value/Target
A     | yourdomain.com            | <Your EC2 IP>
A     | www.yourdomain.com        | <Your EC2 IP>
```
3. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours, typically 15-30 minutes)

### AWS EC2 Setup

1. Launch an EC2 instance with AWS Linux
2. Configure Security Groups:
- Allow HTTP (Port 80)
- Allow HTTPS (Port 443)
- Allow SSH (Port 22)
3. Install required packages:
```bash
sudo yum update

sudo yum install python3.12 python3-pip gunicorn nginx certbot

python3-certbot-nginx
```

### Gunicorn Setup

Create a Gunicorn systemd service file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service
```

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Gunicorn instance to serve shrlnk
After=network.target

[Service]
User=ubuntu
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/shrlnk
Environment="PATH=/path/to/venv/bin"
ExecStart=/path/to/venv/bin/gunicorn -w 4 -b 127.0.0.1:8000 app:app

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Enable and start the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable gunicorn
sudo systemctl start gonicorn
```

### Nginx Configuration

1. Create Nginx site configuration:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com  # Replace with your domain

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

2. Enable the site and restart Nginx:
```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
4. Make sure to add A name record to your domain DNS config that points to your ec2 public ip address.

3. Set up SSL with Let's Encrypt:
```bash
