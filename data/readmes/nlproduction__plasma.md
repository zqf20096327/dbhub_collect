# Plasma

### Prisma-style database access for PHP and WordPress.

Query your database with readable PHP arrays instead of assembling SQL strings. Use the same query shape in a WordPress plugin, a standalone PHP application, or a visual query-builder interface.

**WordPress without SQL boilerplate.** Plasma ships with the WordPress core schema, so ordinary ORM queries against posts, users, metadata, comments, taxonomy, and options do not need hand-written `esc_sql()`, `$wpdb->prepare()`, placeholder juggling, or table-prefix concatenation. Plasma validates schema fields and identifiers, prepares values through the active adapter, escapes LIKE patterns, casts typed fields, and follows declared relations for you.

**Built by the developers of [MapSVG](https://mapsvg.com). Released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).**

```php
$products = $db->product->findMany([
    'where' => [
        'active' => true,
        'OR' => [
            ['price' => ['lt' => 50]],
            ['name' => ['contains' => 'coffee']],
        ],
    ],
    'include' => [
        'category' => [
            'select' => ['id', 'name'],
        ],
    ],
    'orderBy' => ['name' => 'asc'],
    'take' => 20,
]);
```

## Why Plasma?

- **Forget WordPress SQL boilerplate.** For supported ORM queries, Plasma handles `$wpdb->prepare()`, LIKE escaping, identifier validation, and prefixes internally instead of spreading `esc_sql()`, `%s`, and string-built SQL throughout your plugin.
- **WordPress core schema included.** `post`, `user`, `postmeta`, `comment`, taxonomy, options, and their relations are available automatically with `WpdbAdapter`; primary keys and field types are already known.
- **Schema-aware by default.** Schema-backed models reject unknown fields in filters, projections, sorting, and writes before SQL reaches the database.
- **An API you can read.** `findMany`, `findFirst`, `findUnique`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, and `count`.
- **Filters that travel.** Nested `AND` / `OR` / `NOT` and scalar operators are JSON-serializable, which makes saved queries and visual query builders straightforward.
- **Relations without N+1.** `include` loads `hasMany`, `hasOne`, and `belongsTo` relations in batches, with nested `select` for projections.
- **Transactions built in.** Run atomic units of work with automatic commit/rollback; nested transactions use savepoints so inner failures can roll back without discarding outer work.
- **Custom models at runtime.** Register schema metadata from a PHP array or JSON for your own tables; UI/form metadata can remain a separate application concern.
- **PDO and WordPress adapters.** Use the existing `$wpdb` connection in WordPress or PDO for MySQL/MariaDB and SQLite.
- **MIT and framework-independent.** Runtime supports PHP 7.4+; development/test tooling uses PHP 8.2+.

## Install

Install from the public GitHub repository through Composer:

```bash
composer config repositories.plasma vcs https://github.com/nlproduction/plasma
composer require nlproduction/plasma:^0.2
```

The VCS repository entry is required until the package is listed on Packagist. End users of a packaged WordPress plugin do not need Composer: run it during your build and ship the production `vendor/` directory.

## Start with a table

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Plasma\Adapter\PdoAdapter;
use Plasma\Plasma;

$db = new Plasma(new PdoAdapter([
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=shop;charset=utf8mb4',
    'username' => getenv('DB_USER'),
    'password' => getenv('DB_PASSWORD'),
    'prefix' => 'app_',
]));

// Reads app_products. Existing physical tables stay exactly as they are.
$products = $db->table('products');
$product = $products->create(['data' => ['name' => 'Coffee', 'price' => 12]]);
$products->update(['where' => ['id' => $product['id']], 'data' => ['price' => 15]]);
$products->delete(['where' => ['id' => $product['id']]]);
```

Plasma does not create or migrate tables. Use your application's migration system.

## Transactions

Wrap a unit of work in `transaction()`. Plasma commits when the callback returns and rolls back automatically if the callback throws an `Exception`, `Error`, or other `Throwable`:

```php
$order = $db->transaction(function (Plasma $db) {
    $order = $db->order->create([
        'data' => [
            'customer_id' => 42,
            'status' => 'pending',
        ],
    ]);

    $db->inventory->update([
        'where' => ['product_id' => 7],
        'data' => ['reserved' => 1],
    ]);

    return $order;
});
```

If the inventory update fails, the order insert is rolled back too.

### Nested transactions

Nested `transaction()` calls use database savepoints. An inner transaction can fail and roll back its own work while the outer transaction continues:

```php
$db->transaction(function (Plasma $db) {
    $db->audit->create(['data' => ['message' => 'Checkout started']]);

    try {
        $db->transaction(function (Plasma $db) {
            $db->payment->create([
                'data' => ['order_id' => 1001, 'status' => 'authorizing'],
            ]);

            throw new RuntimeException('Payment provider rejected the charge');
        });
    } catch (RuntimeException $e) {
        // The payment savepoint was rolled back.
        // The outer transaction is still alive.
        $db->audit->create(['data' => ['message' => 'Payment failed']]);
    }
});
```

You can also control the transaction manually when needed:

```php
$db->beginTransaction();

try {
    $db->product->update([
        'where' => ['id' => 7],
        'data' => ['active' => false],
    ]);

    $db->commit();
} catch (Throwable $e) {
    $db->rollback();
    throw $e;
}
```

Both PDO and WordPress adapters support nested transaction depth with savepoints. Your database/table engine must support transactions; do not assume DDL statements such as `ALTER TABLE` are transactional. [Adapter transaction details →](docs/adapters/pdo-adapter.md#transactions)

## WordPress

WordPress core metadata is bundled and loaded automatically by `WpdbAdapter`:

```php
use Plasma\Plasma;
use Plasma\WordPress\WpdbAdapter;

$db = new Plasma(new WpdbAdapter());

$posts = $db->post->findMany([
    'where' => [
        'post_status' => 'publish',
        'post_type' => 'post',
    ],
    'include' => [
        'author' => [
            'select' => ['ID', 'display_name'],
        ],
    ],
    'orderBy' => ['post_date' => 'desc'],
    'take' => 10,
]);
```

No schema path or explicit `ID` primary-key configuration is needed for WordPress core tables. The bundled schema covers users/usermeta, posts/postmeta, comments/commentmeta, terms/taxonomy/relationships/meta, and options.

For plugin-owned tables, add a suffix and register your own models. WordPress core models still resolve against the site's normal `wp_` prefix while your plugin models use `wp_myplugin_`:

```php
$db = new Plasma(new WpdbAdapter('myplugin_'));
$db->registerSchema($myPluginSchema);

$products = $db->product->findMany(['where' => ['active' => true]]);
$posts = $db->post->findMany(['where' => ['post_status' => 'publish']]);
```

Plasma does not replace WordPress permissions, hooks, entity APIs, or cache invalidation. Prefer WordPress APIs for core-entity writes when those lifecycle semantics matter. [WordPress guide →](docs/adapters/wpdb-adapter.md)

## Model metadata — from PHP or JSON

```php
$db->registerSchema([
    'product' => [
        'table' => 'products',
        'primaryKey' => 'id',
        'fields' => [
            'id' => ['type' => 'int'],
            'name' => ['type' => 'string'],
            'active' => ['type' => 'boolean'],
            'settings' => ['type' => 'json'],
        ],
    ],
]);

$products = $db->product->findMany(['where' => ['active' => true]]);
```

Generate this array from your application's data-source settings, or pass files to `new Plasma($adapter, [$schemaFile])`. Keep form controls, labels, layouts, and other UI metadata outside the data schema. [Schema and relations →](docs/schema.md)

## From a visual query builder to PHP

[React Query Builder](https://react-querybuilder.js.org/docs/utils/export#prisma-orm) can export a Prisma-style `where` object:

```ts
const where = formatQuery(query, 'prisma');
// Send JSON.stringify({ where }) to your application's authenticated endpoint.
```

After authentication/authorization and selecting an allowed model, your PHP endpoint can pass the supported filter subset to Plasma. Schema-backed models validate field names before compiling SQL:

```php
$rows = $db->product->findMany([
    'where' => $validatedWhere,
    'take' => 50,
]);
```

Plasma is **Prisma-inspired, not a drop-in Prisma Client**. Relation filters, nested writes, aggregations, JSON-path filters, field-to-field comparisons, and Prisma migrations are not implemented. [Supported query contract →](docs/query-builder.md)

## Status and security

Early public release, with API changes still possible before 1.0. Query values are escaped by the selected adapter; PDO writes use bound parameters. Identifiers, operators, pagination, and filter complexity are checked. Database failures raise exceptions instead of looking like empty results.

Those checks are **not an authorization layer**. Never expose an unrestricted database client to browser-supplied table names or query objects. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the trust boundary and supported behavior.
