**It's YOUR data. Take it back. One command. All your Garmin data. Local SQLite + FIT files. Export to CSV, JSON, GPX, TCX. AI-ready via MCP.**



Garmin makes it nearly impossible for individuals to access their own health data programmatically. There is no public API. The official "developer program" is restricted to approved businesses only. And in March 2026, Garmin deployed aggressive Cloudflare protections that broke **every single community library** — [garth](https://github.com/matin/garth) (deprecated), [python-garminconnect](https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect) (broken auth), and all downstream tools like Home Assistant integrations.

You paid for the hardware. You generated the data with your body. You should be able to access it.

This project gets your data out of Garmin Connect and into a local SQLite database where **you** own it and **AI can analyze it** through an MCP server for Claude Code.

**50 tables, 10+ years of history, 45 MCP tools for AI analysis. Your data stays on your machine.**

## The Problem

- **No public API**: Garmin's [Connect Developer Program](https://developer.garmin.com/gc-developer-program/) requires a business application. Individual developers are denied.
- **garth is dead**: The most popular auth library was [deprecated on March 28, 2026](https://github.com/matin/garth/releases/tag/v0.8.0) after Garmin changed their SSO flow.
- **Bot detection**: Garmin deployed aggressive bot detection that blocks all known Python HTTP libraries. Every existing workaround stopped working.
- **python-garminconnect is broken**: Depends on garth for auth. [Issue #332](https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect/issues/332) has 40+ comments from affected users.
- **Connect+ paywall**: Garmin launched a [$7/month subscription](https://the5krunner.com/2026/03/24/garmin-connect-plus-strength-apps/) and is restricting third-party access to features that compete with it.

**Nobody should buy Garmin products until they open their API to the people who paid for the hardware.**

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
# macOS
brew install nrvim/tap/garmin-givemydata

# pip (Linux / Windows / macOS)
pip install garmin-givemydata

# or clone
git clone https://github.com/nrvim/garmin-givemydata.git
cd garmin-givemydata
bash setup.sh          # macOS / Linux
setup.bat              # Windows
```

### Fetch your data

```bash
garmin-givemydata                    # fetches all historical data + FIT files
```

First run prompts for credentials, launches a headless browser, and fetches your full history (~30 min for 10 years). After that, daily syncs take seconds.

### Connect AI

Add the MCP server to Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or any MCP client. The config depends on how you installed:

**Claude Code (one-liner)** — registers the server at user scope so it's available in every project:

```bash
# pip / brew install
claude mcp add -s user garmin -- garmin-mcp

# git clone
claude mcp add -s user garmin \
  -e GARMIN_DATA_DIR=/absolute/path/to/garmin-givemydata \
  -- /absolute/path/to/garmin-givemydata/venv/bin/python \
     /absolute/path/to/garmin-givemydata/run_mcp.py
```

Verify with `claude mcp list`. Skip the manual JSON below.

**Homebrew or pip install** — `garmin-mcp` is already in your PATH:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin": {
      "command": "garmin-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Git clone** — use absolute paths to the venv and set `GARMIN_DATA_DIR` so the MCP server finds your database:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/garmin-givemydata/venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/garmin-givemydata/run_mcp.py"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/garmin-givemydata",
      "env": {
        "GARMIN_DATA_DIR": "/absolute/path/to/garmin-givemydata"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** `GARMIN_DATA_DIR` tells the MCP server where `garmin.db` lives. Without it, the server falls back to `~/.garmin-givemydata/` which may not be where your data is if you cloned to a custom location.

Save this as:
- **Claude Code:** `.mcp.json` in your project root, or `~/.claude/settings.json` under `mcpServers` for global access
- **Claude Desktop:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows)

Restart your client and run `/mcp` to approve the server. Then ask:

```
"How was my sleep this week?"
"Am I overtraining? Check my HRV and recovery"
"Compare my fitness this month vs last month"
"Give me a full sports medicine health check"
```

<details>
<summary>Windows, OpenClaw, and other MCP clients</summary>

#### Windows (git clone)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\jane\\code\\garmin-givemydata\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe",
      "args": ["C:\\Users\\jane\\code\\garmin-givemydata\\run_mcp.py"],
      "cwd": "C:\\Users\\jane\\code\\garmin-givemydata",
      "env": {
        "GARMIN_DATA_DIR": "C:\\Users\\jane\\code\\garmin-givemydata"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Other MCP clients (OpenClaw, Cline, Cursor)

Any client supporting [MCP stdio transport](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/basic/transports/#stdio) can connect. For pip/brew: `garmin-mcp`. For git clone:

```bash
/path/to/garmin-givemydata/venv/bin/python /path/to/garmin-givemydata/run_mcp.py
```

**Important:** Paths must be **absolute** — relative paths will not work.

If PowerShell blocks the activate script: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
</details>

</details>

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Common issues and fixes</summary>

**"Login failed"**: Delete the browser profile and run again. For pip/brew: `rm -rf ~/.garmin-givemydata/browser_profile`. For git clone: `rm -rf browser_profile/`.

**Script crashed**: Don't close the Chrome window manually. The tool handles shutdown — killing Chrome mid-run corrupts the profile. Run again (stale locks are auto-cleaned).

**"Python not found"**: Make sure Python 3.10+ is on your PATH. macOS: `brew install python@3.12`. Ubuntu: `sudo apt install python3.12 python3.12-venv`.

**`ensurepip is not available` / venv creation fails**: Your system Python is missing the venv module. Install the matching package: `sudo apt install python3.X-venv` (replace `X` with your minor version — `python3 --version` to check). On Ubuntu with Python 3.14, that's `python3.14-venv`. The `setup.sh` script auto-detects Python but can't auto-install the venv package.

**403 or session errors**: Session expired (often from IP change — `cf_clearance` is IP-bound). Delete the browser profile and re-login.

**Chrome doesn't open (Linux/SSH)**: Install Xvfb: `sudo apt install xvfb`. The tool auto-spawns Xvfb at 1920x1080 when no display is available, or use `xvfb-run -a garmin-givemydata`.

**Session rot over SSH**: Run under `systemd-run --user --scope` or `tmux`/`screen` so SSH disconnect doesn't SIGHUP the process. The tool installs signal handlers but a detached session is more reliable.

**MCP server "failed to connect"**: Paths in `.mcp.json` must be **absolute**. Test: `<path>/venv/bin/python <path>/run_mcp.py`

**Empty data for some metrics**: Training readiness, HRV, body battery, endurance score, hill score, and race predictions require compatible devices (Fenix 7+, Forerunner 265+, Venu 3+, etc.).

**Windows: "execution of scripts is disabled"**: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

<summary>How to help</summary>

- **New endpoints**: Garmin has hundreds of internal APIs. Discover new ones via browser dev tools and add them to `endpoints.py`.
- **More MCP tools**: The server has 45 tools including CTL/ATL/TSB, recovery signatures, and period comparison. Ideas: injury risk prediction, sleep optimization, race readiness scoring, overtraining detection.
- **MCP client integrations**: Test with OpenClaw, Cline, Continue, Cursor, or other clients.
- **Other platforms**: ARM (Raspberry Pi), Docker, etc.
- **Data visualization**: Dashboards, charts, reports from SQLite.
- **Export formats**: Parquet, or other formats for pandas, R.
- **Other wearables**: The architecture (browser auth + SQLite + MCP) could work for COROS, Samsung, Amazfit/Zepp.
- **Testing**: Tests, CI, more platform support.

<summary>Your legal right to your data (GDPR, CCPA, EU Data Act)</summary>

### EU/EEA — GDPR

**Article 20 — Right to Data Portability** grants the right to receive personal data in a "structured, commonly used and machine-readable format." This covers raw sensor data (heart rate, sleep, steps, SpO2). Derived metrics (training readiness, fitness age) are covered under **Article 15 — Right of Access**.

### United States — CCPA

**Section 1798.100(d)** requires businesses to provide personal information in a "readily useable format that allows the consumer to transmit this information from one entity to another entity without hindrance."

### EU Data Act (Since September 2025)

**Article 3** explicitly requires IoT manufacturers to make data available "without undue delay, free of charge, and, where applicable, continuously and in real-time." A Garmin watch is an IoT device. The data it generates belongs to the user.

**If Garmin provided an open API, this tool would not need to exist.**
