## What is ɳSelf?

ɳSelf is a self-hosted backend platform that gives you the equivalent of a commercial Backend-as-a-Service on your own infrastructure. Run it locally, on a VPS, or on any cloud provider (Kubernetes: planned — see the [k8s plugin](https://nself.org/plugins)).

You get Postgres, Hasura GraphQL, nHost Auth, and Nginx as the always-on core. Add optional services like Redis, MinIO, and Search when you need them. Extend everything with free MIT plugins and paid plugins covering AI, messaging, media processing, billing, and more — run `nself plugin count` for current totals.

The nself CLI is a single Go binary. No runtime dependencies beyond Docker.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install (macOS)
brew install nself-org/nself/nself

# Install (Linux / WSL2)
curl -fsSL https://install.nself.org | bash

# Create a project and start the stack
mkdir my-backend && cd my-backend
nself init
nself build
nself start
```

Your backend is running:

- GraphQL API: `https://api.local.nself.org`
- Auth: `https://auth.local.nself.org`
- Storage: `https://storage.local.nself.org`
- Admin UI: `http://localhost:3021`

All `*.local.nself.org` domains resolve to `127.0.0.1`. Automatic SSL — no browser warnings.

---

## The Stack

ɳSelf organizes services into three tiers. This ordering matters everywhere: Core first, Optional second, Plugins last.

### Core Services (always on — 4 services)

These four services start with every `nself start` and cannot be disabled. They are the permanent foundation.

| Service | Role |
|---------|------|
| **PostgreSQL** | Primary database (pgvector, PostGIS, TimescaleDB) |
| **Hasura** | Instant GraphQL API with permissions, subscriptions, and metadata |
| **Auth** (nHost) | JWT-based authentication — 13 OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft, etc.) |
| **Nginx** | Reverse proxy and SSL terminator — the only external-facing process |

All internal services bind to `127.0.0.1`. Nginx is the only external-facing process.

### Optional Services (enable per project — 6 services)

These services are first-class and CLI-managed. Toggle them in `.env` and rebuild.

| Service | Toggle | Role |
|---------|--------|------|
| **Redis** | `REDIS_ENABLED=true` | Caching, sessions, queues |
| **MinIO** | `MINIO_ENABLED=true` | S3-compatible object storage |
| **Search** | `MEILISEARCH_ENABLED=true` | Full-text search (MeiliSearch) |
| **Email** | `MAIL_ENABLED=true` | Email service — 16+ providers (SendGrid, SES, Mailgun, Postfix, and more) |
| **Functions** | `FUNCTIONS_ENABLED=true` | Serverless runtime |
| **Admin** | `NSELF_ADMIN_ENABLED=true` | Local GUI companion at `localhost:3021` |

```bash
nself service list          # see all available services and their status
nself service enable redis  # enable a service
nself build && nself restart
```

### Plugins (drop-in expansions)

Plugins are the extension layer — install what you need, remove what you don't.

- **Free MIT plugins** — no license key required
- **Paid plugins** — require a membership key (starting at $0.99/mo)
- Run `nself plugin count` for current totals

```bash
nself plugin install monitoring    # free: Prometheus + Grafana + Loki
nself plugin install search        # free: MeiliSearch full-text search
nself plugin install cron          # free: scheduled job execution

nself license set nself_pro_xxxxx
nself plugin install ai            # paid: multi-provider LLM gateway
nself plugin install livekit       # paid: live video and audio
nself plugin install claw          # paid: AI assistant backend
```

See [Plugins](#plugins) for the full inventory.

## Installation

### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install nself-org/nself/nself
```

### Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.nself.org | bash
```

### Windows

WSL2 is required. Once WSL2 is set up, use the Linux installer above inside your WSL2 terminal.

The installer auto-detects existing installations, checks for Docker, downloads the binary to `~/.nself/bin`, and adds nself to your PATH.

### Docker

```bash
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v ~/.nself:/root/.nself nself/nself version
```

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nself-org/cli
cd cli
make build
make install  # copies nself to /usr/local/bin
```

Requires Go 1.22+ and GNU make.

### Secure install (recommended for CI and production)

The installer always fetches `checksums.txt` from the same GitHub release and verifies the SHA-256 of the downloaded tarball before extracting. Installation aborts loudly on any mismatch.

For the most paranoid setups, pin the expected SHA-256 in your shell or CI config:

```bash
# Obtain the expected checksum for a specific release:
curl -fsSL https://github.com/nself-org/cli/releases/download/v1.3.5/checksums.txt

# Install with a pinned version and pinned SHA-256:
NSELF_VERSION=v1.3.5 \
NSELF_INSTALL_PIN_SHA256=<sha256-from-checksums.txt> \
curl -fsSL https://install.nself.org | bash
```

This defends against a compromised release page: even if the tarball at the release URL is replaced, the pinned SHA will not match and the install fails.

### Update

```bash
nself update    # detects your install method and updates in place
```

---

## 5-Minute Tutorial

```bash
# 1. Install
# macOS:  brew install nself-org/nself/nself
# Linux:  curl -fsSL https://install.nself.org | bash

# 2. Create a project
mkdir my-backend && cd my-backend

# 3. Initialize with defaults (or use --wizard for interactive setup)
nself init

# 4. Generate Docker configs from your .env
nself build

# 5. Start the stack
nself start

# 6. Check everything is healthy
nself status
nself urls
```

Your core backend is running. Add optional services:

```bash
# Enable Redis and full-text search
nself service enable redis
nself service enable search
nself build && nself restart

# Install a free plugin
nself plugin install monitoring  # Prometheus + Grafana + Loki

# Set a pro license and install an AI plugin
nself license set nself_pro_xxxxxx
nself plugin install ai
nself build && nself restart
```

---

## Configuration

Config lives in `.env.dev` (team defaults), `.env.staging`, and `.env.prod`. `nself build` reads the active env file and generates `docker-compose.yml` and Nginx config.

Never hand-edit `docker-compose.yml` — it is generated and will be overwritten on the next build.

```bash
nself config show        # show current config
nself config set KEY VALUE
nself config validate    # validate before building
```

### Env file priority (low to high)

1. `.env.dev` — team defaults (checked in)
2. `.env.staging` — staging shared config (checked in)
3. `.env.prod` — production shared config (checked in)
4. `.env.secrets` — production secrets (not checked in)
5. `.env` — local overrides (not checked in, highest priority)

### Custom services (40+ templates)

Add your own services via `CS_N` slots:

```bash
CS_1=api:fastapi:3001     # Python FastAPI
CS_2=worker:bullmq-ts:3002  # TypeScript BullMQ
CS_3=grpc:grpc:3003       # gRPC service
```

Templates: JavaScript/TypeScript (19), Python (7), Go (4), Rust, Java, C#, Elixir, and more.

---

## Production Deployment

```bash
# Copy project to server
rsync -az --exclude .volumes/ ./ user@server:/opt/myapp/

# On the server
nself start --env prod
nself status
nself health check
```

Security hardening runs automatically on every deploy. No license required.

See [Self-hosting: what is and is not included](https://nself.org/docs/self-hosting/boundary) for
what nSelf provides vs. what you own as the operator (backups, monitoring, on-call, capacity).
