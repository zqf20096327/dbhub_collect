# Chatty

A messaging app (Zalo/Telegram-style: 1-1 and group chat, realtime delivery) built from scratch to learn how a production-grade chat system is put together.

Current release: **`v0.2.0-rc.1`** — feature-complete release candidate for private acceptance;
public launch still requires the external conditions in [Deployment](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

Current development focus: **everyday usability and interface polish**. The
[experience polish plan](docs/plans/experience-polish.md) lists 60 scoped tasks in 12 batches, with
acceptance criteria and dependencies. Public launch and large feature additions are deferred while
this work improves the existing messaging experience.

The local acceptance pass covers account-scoped drafts, retryable delivery, reply navigation,
live vault/bookmark updates, authorized media recovery, group permissions and versioned offline shell.
Current results, known gaps and the distinction between automated and physical-device checks live in
[one acceptance report](docs/plans/acceptance-2026-09-25.md); do not infer readiness from historical phase counts.

The XP ledger records **41 of 60 items accepted locally** (10 partial, 9 planned).
Physical-device acceptance and public deployment remain separate.

Chat and settings load on demand; offline caching still includes their chunks. Sidebar startup
reads cache and fetches fresh data concurrently, without allowing late cache to overwrite the server.
This is targeted optimization, not a claim of measured end-to-end performance at production scale.
The repeatable local workload is `npx playwright test --config playwright.performance.config.ts`;
it rebuilds both apps and resets only `chatty_e2e`, like other E2E runs. Do not run it concurrently
with other E2E suites. Results and limitations are recorded in the acceptance report.

The interface follows the owner's [chatty.net](https://chatty.net/) reference: deep navy,
bright yellow, faint violet gradients, restrained typography and rounded surfaces.
Entry screens prioritize the real form and conversations, with layouts that fit the viewport.
The logo eyes subtly follow the pointer, blink and wink on hover; reduced motion keeps them still.
The chat welcome has an expandable activity status. “Let’s talk” in the sidebar opens people search; validation
and compact conversation/settings layouts follow the [design review](docs/design/review-2026-09-09.md).
Every login reload plays a 3.8-second welcome: a descending curtain, the symbol and six letters
falling separately, then a curious left/right glance, eye contact and wink before dissolving into the ready form.
The intro keeps both eyes on the same animation timeline, including when opened in a background tab.
Skip intro/Escape ends it immediately. Switching between login and registration does not restart
it; reduced motion skips it, and account-recovery links go straight to their forms.
Authentication, chat and settings share coordinated light/dark themes and responsive phone layouts.
See [visual direction](docs/design/visual-direction.md). Fontshare fonts download once when starting
the web dev server or building, then stay self-hosted with no third-party browser requests.

## Stack

- **Server**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Prisma (PostgreSQL), Socket.io, Zod
- **Web**: React 18, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, react-router
- **Shared**: a `packages/shared-types` workspace so server and web agree on API/event shapes at compile time

## Getting started

Requires **Node 22 or newer** (jsdom 30, used by the web tests, declares `>=22.22.2`). On Node 20 the
web suite does not fail a test — it fails to start, with an error from deep inside undici that looks
nothing like a version problem.

```bash
npm ci
# First setup only: copy .env.example to apps/server/.env (do not overwrite an existing file).
# PowerShell: Copy-Item .env.example apps/server/.env
# macOS/Linux: cp .env.example apps/server/.env
docker compose up -d postgres mailpit
npx prisma generate --schema apps/server/prisma/schema.prisma
npm run db:migrate --workspace apps/server
```

Open the repository folder in your editor (VS Code: **File → Open Folder → chatty**),
and open terminals in that folder, where this README and the root `package.json` live.
Start Docker Desktop before the setup commands. Keep an existing `apps/server/.env`;
never replace it just to restart the app. Install/generate/migrate are setup or update
steps, not commands to repeat every time you open a terminal.

Before starting Postgres, check `docker compose ps` and `docker compose port postgres 5432`.
The host-run API needs PostgreSQL reachable at the address in `DATABASE_URL` (the example
uses `localhost:5432`). A running container with no published host port is not enough.
Do not start another Postgres against the same `.data/postgres` directory or delete that
directory to resolve a port conflict; inspect the existing container/Compose configuration first.

For everyday development, run these in two terminals at the repository root:

First ensure the local services are running: `docker compose up -d postgres mailpit`.

```bash
npm run dev:server      # terminal 1: API + WebSocket on http://localhost:4000
npm run dev:web         # terminal 2: open http://localhost:5173
```

Use **http://localhost:5173** for normal local work. Vite refuses to start if 5173 is occupied;
it does not silently choose another port. Stop the previous Chatty dev process with Ctrl+C in
its terminal, then restart. Do not change ports or stop an unrelated application's process to
work around a conflict.

| Mode | Web URL | API URL | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `npm run dev:web` + `npm run dev:server` | `http://localhost:5173` | `http://localhost:4000` | Daily development with live updates |
| Docker production stack | `http://localhost:8080` | `http://localhost:4000` | Test the built production topology; see [deployment](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) |
| `npm run test:e2e` | `http://localhost:5273` | `http://localhost:4100` | Automated tests with a separate database |

The development API uses `PORT=4000`, `CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173` and
`PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:4000` in `apps/server/.env`. The web client defaults to that API;
remove an old `VITE_API_URL` override if it points elsewhere. Do not run the development API
and Docker production gateway together: both bind port 4000. The Docker production stack also
has its own database volume. Seeing the same interface at two ports does not mean it is the
same running build or the same data.

Redis is optional in development and the server starts without it. Set `REDIS_URL` (and
`docker compose up -d redis`) only to exercise the multi-instance path — see
[docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) phase 5 item 12.

Mail is **not** optional: `MAIL_TRANSPORT` has no default and the server will not boot without it.
`.env.example` points at Mailpit, which is the recommended way to work —

```bash
docker compose up -d mailpit     # SMTP on :1025, web inbox on http://localhost:8025
```

— so a password reset link arrives as an email you open, rather than a line you grep for. Setting
`MAIL_TRANSPORT=console` instead logs the message and is refused outright when `NODE_ENV=production`.

Then seed some accounts to sign in with:

```bash
npm run db:seed --workspace apps/server
```

That creates `minh@test.com`, `an@test.com` and `binh@test.com` (password `SuperSecret123` for all),
one direct conversation and one group. It **wipes the database first** and refuses to run against
anything that is not localhost.

For a UI/realtime stress dataset against the running Docker stack, use:

```bash
npm run seed:demo
```

This goes through the real HTTP API without wiping data. It creates five reusable accounts, a direct
thread and a managed group with hundreds of alternating messages, image/gallery thumbnails, voice,
files, reply/forward/mention/link, pin and saved-message examples. Demo files contain no instructional
caption, matching the standalone file-send flow. Fixed message keys make reruns
converge rather than duplicate the dataset. The credentials are printed after the script verifies the
message counts and every attachment kind. To exercise group administration directly, sign in as
`admin.demo@chatty.test` with password `ChattyDemo123`; that account is an admin in
`Chatty long-run lab`.

## Checks

```bash
npm run verify          # fast: cached static checks + tests related to changed files
npm run verify:full     # every server/web test; release and high-risk gate
npm run version:check   # SemVer is identical in every workspace and the lockfile
```

Or individually:

```bash
npm run typecheck       # all workspaces
npm run lint
npm run format:check    # prettier; skips docs and .prisma, see .prettierignore
npm run test            # server (Vitest + Postgres) and web (Vitest + Testing Library)
npm run test:changed    # only tests statically affected by uncommitted files
npm run audit:rules     # greps apps/web/src against the conventions — a report
npm run format          # rewrites, rather than just reporting
```

The server test setup creates its disposable `chatty_test` database automatically on the local
Postgres instance. A fresh clone therefore needs no database command between `db:up` and either gate.

`verify` keeps whole-project type safety but reuses TypeScript/ESLint/Prettier caches and lets Vitest
follow the changed import graph. Schema, migration, package, config and global-test-setup changes
automatically run the complete affected suite. CI always runs all tests: the PostgreSQL suite is
split over two isolated shards while web/static checks and image builds run alongside it. See
[ADR 0019](docs/adr/0019-two-speed-verification.md).

End-to-end tests are separate, because they need both servers and a browser:

```bash
npm run e2e:install     # once — downloads chromium
npm run test:e2e        # starts the API and web on :4100/:5273 against chatty_e2e
```

`verify` runs the audit with `--gate`, so a hit fails the command. On its own `audit:rules` stays a
report and always exits 0 — a heuristic that blocks work is a heuristic people learn to skip.

## Status

Working end to end: register, sign in, find people by `@handle`, start a direct chat or a group,
send messages that arrive in real time over WebSocket, scroll up to load older history, upload an
avatar, see unread badges, read receipts, typing indicators and who is online, manage a group —
invite someone under its chosen policy, share day-to-day moderation with admins, rename it, remove a
member, leave it, with every one of those announced in the chat log, hand it to somebody else — edit your own profile, change your password, or reset a forgotten
one, move the account to a new email address, turn read receipts off, delete the account entirely,
send an image with or without a caption, rewrite or retract a recent message, inspect its edit
history, remove any message from your own view, search inside the open conversation for a message
you half remember, and block somebody so neither of you can reach the other in a direct
conversation. Last-seen timestamps follow the privacy choice in account settings, which open as a dialog over the
chat rather than replacing it.

Restrict/Unrestrict lives in each direct conversation's sidebar menu, alongside its other actions;
the account settings list remains available. Choosing, pasting or dropping an ordinary file sends
that file immediately as a standalone message and keeps the text/reply draft for the next send.
Images still use the preview-and-send flow. A failed file upload keeps its file with Retry/Remove.

Text runs now use soft 18px ends and 5px joins, while photos/files use their own 12px
corners. Hover does not add a background tile behind an idle conversation row, emoji or attachment
trigger, and reaction emoji no longer enlarge. While reading more than 120px above the latest messages,
a quiet 32px down-arrow control sits above the composer, inside a 44px touch target. It fades into view
and smoothly expands for actual typing or new arrivals. Returning within 80px hides it, avoiding flicker
at the boundary. A jump follows its destination as new content arrives and stops when the reader
deliberately scrolls. Search history uses the same control, with loading feedback and retry on failure.
Reduced motion skips the transitions; keyboard activation keeps focus in the thread.
See [the roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md), phases 47 and 50.

Typing appears beneath the last message as a quiet three-dot bubble. Direct chats show just the
bubble; groups add the typing names. Each dot rises 2px in a staggered 1.4-second rhythm. The header
uses quiet sentence-case text; sidebar and Jump labels end in animated dots, without a second ellipsis. Reading history keeps the bubble offscreen and the activity
available on Jump; historical search never places live typing under an old message. One/two typists
are named, larger groups are counted, and your own typing is excluded. Sending, clearing the input,
offline presence and disconnect retract typing; idle and missing-stop timers provide a fallback.
Reduced motion keeps the dots still. Typing is never stored or counted as a new message.

Unsent text drafts are saved on this browser per account and conversation, and restored when reopening a conversation.
Reply drafts resolve their original message even outside the loaded history. A failed lookup keeps the draft
and offers Retry or Remove reply; sending waits until that choice is resolved. Upload feedback distinguishes
image preparation, transmitted bytes and server confirmation. Offline text/image rows retain their retry/discard path.
Signing out or deleting the account clears its drafts and invalidates pending writes. Legacy drafts without an
account owner are discarded. If storage is unavailable, the composer explains that reloading may lose the draft.
Switching conversations keeps their drafts separate; leaving or hiding the page flushes the latest text before
the normal save delay. Drafts are not synchronized between devices, and selected files are not saved
as composer drafts.

The composer supports multiple lines, grows up to 160px and then scrolls internally. Enter sends;
Shift+Enter inserts a newline. Composition and held Enter do not submit, and Enter completes a visible
group mention suggestion first. Handles typed in direct chats remain ordinary text. Failed text/image sends
stay in their retryable thread row without overwriting new words in the composer. If the outbox cannot be
saved on this device, a warning stays visible until the affected messages are sent or discarded. Retry
cannot dispatch twice at once; an in-flight send cannot be discarded as though the server had canceled it.
File, voice and sticker retries reuse the same send identity within the current session. A failed sticker
stays available in its tray. Editing keeps the text and shows the error when saving fails.
Delete, hide, reaction and pin actions lock while pending and show failures beside the message.
Reaction toggles are never retried automatically; check the resulting state before trying again.
When the app reconnects, durable text/image outbox entries from threads that are no longer open replay in
bounded order for the signed-in account. The visible thread and background replay share a delivery claim;
the server-side client ID remains the authority against duplicate cross-tab sends.

Changing a password reconnects the existing chat socket with the replacement session, keeping the open
thread live. Conversation search shows its keyboard focus border in both light and dark themes.

Group-message edits rebuild mentions from current participant handles and rebuild links in the same
transaction as the text/history update. Direct-message handles remain plain text. Edits emit only
`message:updated`, so adding a mention while editing does not replay new-message popup/sound alerts.

Group mentions complete at the caret without deleting the text after it. Arrow keys select a suggestion,
Enter inserts it, and Escape dismisses the list; email addresses and URL segments do not trigger it.

Forwarding searches conversations on the server, including archived destinations, with paged results and
participant handles to distinguish matching names. Failed forwards retain their send identity for retry.
Success names the destination and focuses Done. Source membership, hiding and retraction are checked again
under transaction locks after media preparation; rejected sends discard their prepared files. File drops are accepted
only inside the composer, and are ignored while a modal covers it. Pasting remains scoped to the textarea.
Bookmarked messages is a separate sidebar list of marked originals across conversations. Bookmark message
adds an original; Remove bookmark leaves it intact. Results show their source and open the original thread.
The Saved messages shortcut continues to open personal notes. Bookmarks refresh on observed retraction,
hiding or loss of membership and do not provide offline media downloads. A confirmed removal supersedes
concurrent refreshes so a stale response cannot restore the removed bookmark.

Search all messages in the sidebar searches across conversations, including archived threads. Opening
a result fetches its conversation before jumping to the original message, even outside loaded sidebar pages.
Search pages ignore stale responses and retract deleted results. Long-message previews center on the first
match and highlight matching text without changing its original accents. Back to search results restores the query,
loaded pages and scroll position while the reader remains signed in.

Read markers follow visible messages in the active tab, rather than every message loaded into memory.
Historical search windows do not advance the marker across an unloaded gap; returning to latest resumes it.
Popup and sound alerts resolve missing conversation metadata before applying mute and restriction. Group
mentions may override mute; restriction suppresses direct-chat alerts. Unknown or changing permissions
suppress a pending alert. Cached file/image placeholders explain that reconnecting is required and cannot
be downloaded as though they were the original media.
Desktop notifications are coordinated between tabs of the same account when browser capabilities allow it.
Clicking one focuses Chatty and resolves the conversation before opening it, including an archived thread.
Notification settings can hide the sender and message text, and app-owned notifications close on sign-out.

Reply quotes jump to their original when it remains available. A deleted parent is an informative tombstone;
if an older parent disappears between rendering and navigation, the current thread stays on screen with a
short explanation. In-conversation search supports ArrowUp/ArrowDown, Enter and Escape as well as its controls.

Mute deadlines update the sidebar, details menu and unread tab title without reloading, including after
returning to a suspended tab. Conversation actions block duplicate requests and retain errors when their
menu closes; retrying is deliberate and a successful response clears the error.

The sidebar shows `Draft: <text>` immediately while composing, including the selected conversation.
A reply without text shows `Draft: Reply`; whitespace alone does not create an indicator. Drafts take
priority over typing and the last-message preview, but unread/mention badges remain visible. The old
message timestamp and author prefix are hidden while showing a draft; drafting does not reorder chats.
Row actions appear on hover, keyboard focus or touch, and do not stay visible merely because a
row was clicked. Menus close on a second trigger click, Escape, outside clicks or focus leaving
the menu and trigger.
Conversation rows use two aligned lines: name and right-aligned time above, preview and unread badge
below. The actions button has its own space on the lower right, so hover never hides the unread badge
or shifts the text. Timestamps no longer sit inside the message preview.
Clearing or sending returns the row to typing/the last message. Files and stickers preserve unrelated
text drafts. Sidebar previews flatten whitespace without changing the saved text and refresh after
reload or browser storage changes; this does not synchronize an already open composer's caret or text.

Plain wrapped text bubbles fit their visible lines and recalculate when the thread resizes. Long links
wrap in full, and message padding, speaker gaps and system notices keep the thread compact.

Voice messages use a compact 256×60px player with a 32px play control and a waveform that can
be scrubbed by pointer or keyboard. The duration changes to remaining time after playback starts;
the 1×/1.5×/2× speed control appears while playing.
Only one player runs at a time; loading and playback failures are visible with a retry action.
The 44px recording bar shows actual microphone levels and lets you listen, seek, discard or
send the preview. Failed uploads retain that recording in the current session.
Starting a recording pauses voice playback, and sidebar previews identify voice messages correctly.

Deleting leaves a marked-out placeholder rather than a hole: the text is emptied and the image and its
file are removed, but the row stays so that other people's read markers and the paging cursor still
have something to point at. See [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) phase 8.

An author may edit or delete for everyone for eight hours after sending. The actions disappear when
that window closes; deleting only from your own view remains available without a time limit and also
removes the message from your sidebar preview, search results and unread count.

A group has admins and members, and every admin has equal standing — any admin can rename it, remove
or promote/demote anyone else (another admin included), and choose whether everyone or only admins may
invite. Anyone can leave; a non-empty group always keeps at least one admin, promoting the
longest-standing remaining member if the last one leaves. See
[ADR 0021](docs/adr/0021-flatten-group-roles-to-admin-member.md).

Deleting your account removes the account, its avatar file and every session it had open — but not
its messages. Those stay in their conversations with the author taken off them, rendered as "Deleted
account", for the same reason a deleted message leaves a tombstone: other people's read markers and
the paging cursor still point at those rows. Read receipts can be turned off, and the setting is
symmetric — hide yours and you stop seeing everyone else's, with nothing revealed retroactively when
you turn them back on. See [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) phase 13.

Verified by complete server tests against real PostgreSQL, web component/unit tests and Playwright
specs driving a real browser against a real server — plus typecheck, lint, the conventions audit and
production image builds. Normal CI keeps independent gates parallel; release tags additionally gate
artifact publication on browser E2E.

**[docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) is the current source of truth for what is done and what is
next.** Phase 42 now has durable local snapshots/idempotent offline sends, stronger group trust and
an explicit E2EE protocol/readiness decision; implementation remains behind the audited browser-MLS
gate in ADR 0020. Future ideas still enter through [docs/PRODUCT-DIRECTION.md](docs/PRODUCT-DIRECTION.md)'s
rubric. Phase 7 makes group and password-reset transitions safe under
concurrent requests: one conversation lock orders membership-sensitive writes, PostgreSQL enforces
the admin/message invariants, and fault-injection tests prove partial writes do not escape. Phase 8
adds editing and deleting your own messages, on the same lock, with the deletion kept as a tombstone
so that read markers and paging cursors still have a row to point at. Phase 9 makes outbound mail
durable: it is queued in the same transaction as the thing that promised it, and a worker retries
with backoff, claiming rows in a way that is safe to run on every instance — see
[ADR 0011](docs/adr/0011-transactional-outbox-for-mail.md). Phase 10 gave it a real SMTP transport,
so a reset link now leaves the process and lands in an inbox; the configuration has no silent
fallback, and five ways of getting it wrong stop the server booting rather than degrading to a log
file. Phase 11 makes a misconfigured production refuse to start at all and proves the two-instance
path for the first time; phase 12 adds full-text search. Phase 13 is what an account needs before
real people have one — changing its email address, handing a group on, hiding read receipts, and
deleting the account — and it is where `Message.authorId` stopped cascading, so somebody can leave
without taking half of everyone else's conversations with them. Phase 14 closed the four Known gaps
that were defects rather than missing features: unread now starts when you joined a group, a second
test run refuses rather than corrupting the first, the web app has a Content-Security-Policy, and
attachment files left by a failed upload are swept. Phase 16 gives the app one declared look instead
of the framework's defaults — ink on ivory paper, one signal colour, everything a machine produced set
in mono, self-hosted fonts so the Content-Security-Policy stays as strict as phase 14 left it — and
moves account settings into a dialog over the chat, so changing your display name no longer costs you
the conversation you were reading. `/profile` still deep-links to it and Back still closes it. Phase 17
is the geometry inside that look: a run of messages from one person is now one shape with one tail
rather than five bubbles each claiming their own, every timestamp moved off its own line into the
gutter beside the bubble, and the type changed to Geist and Geist Mono — one superfamily, and the
first pair in this app to ship a Vietnamese subset, so a name with diacritics no longer falls out of
the font mid-word. It also adds the two things a message could not do: **reactions** (reworked in phase 29 — see below)
and **replies** (a self-relation, so an edited
original re-quotes itself, a deleted one quotes as a tombstone, and an image reply keeps a small
thumbnail). Message bursts now break after a real pause rather than sticking together for hours, and
the mobile layout is a deliberate conversation-list → thread → back flow instead of a squeezed
two-column desktop shell.

Phases 18-21 are about the difference between working and being trusted. Phase 18 fixes three ways
the screen quietly stopped telling the truth: a dropped socket now resyncs the sidebar and the thread
when it comes back instead of leaving both silently stale, an expired session says so and returns you
to the login form instead of failing every request separately, and a thread that could not load shows
the reason and a retry rather than rendering as an empty conversation. Phase 19 closes the
perceived-quality gap — a text message appears the instant you press Enter and is marked "Not sent"
with a retry if it does not arrive, the unread count is in the tab title, browser notifications are
available per-browser, and removing somebody from a group or leaving one now asks first. Phase 20
makes search work the way Vietnamese is actually typed: `hen gap` finds `hẹn gặp`. Phase 21 makes
signing out mean something — the session is now a revocable row rather than a seven-day JWT nothing
could take back, access tokens last fifteen minutes, and a refresh rotates so a stolen one works at
most once. Phase 22 lets a message carry up to ten images — a gallery in the bubble, a viewer that
walks the set with the arrow keys — and gives the composer an emoji picker, searchable in English and
in unaccented Vietnamese. A message that is nothing but one to three emoji is drawn large with no
bubble at all. Phase 23 keeps that gallery as a compact stacked album, with its caption kept out of the
thread and stated in the viewer, and adds **stickers**: a personal tray of saved images,
one tap from every conversation, copied into the message when sent so clearing the tray never blanks a
picture out of somebody else's chat.

Phases 24–28 complete the everyday messaging surface: arbitrary files are served as safe downloads,
voice is normalized to AAC/MP4 with a shared waveform, and each conversation has a paged vault for
media, files, voice and links — opened as a list of categories with their counts, each drilling into
one list at a time, with a tab row to switch between the other categories without leaving the one
that's open, under sticky month headings (phase 35). Archive, pin and mute are per participant and sync only
to that person's devices; the sidebar patches socket events in place. Drafts survive navigation on
the local device, and the thread adds unread navigation, drag/paste, links, forwarding, mentions,
message pins, reply jumps, keyboard shortcuts, sidebar typing and group seen-by avatars.

Phase 29 is about the distance between correct and familiar. **Reactions are any emoji rather than a
closed set of five** — the closed set had been defended twice on the grounds that an ink mark keeps
colour off the page, and the app had never actually implemented that argument: the chips rendered
colour emoji while only the picker stayed in ink, so one reaction had three appearances and none of
them predicted the others. A hover bar offers the familiar six with `+` for the rest, a double-click
leaves ❤️, the chips straddle the bubble's bottom edge the way Messenger and Instagram draw them, and
one person gets one reaction per message — picking a second replaces the first, which the primary key
now enforces. What made the set closed is preserved where it belongs: the request boundary accepts a
single fully-qualified RGI emoji and nothing else, so `❤` and `❤️` cannot both reach the column and
split one reaction into two chips. **Who reacted is a panel** rather than a `title` attribute that no
touch screen could ever reach. **There is a Light / Dark / System setting**, resolved before the first
paint by a `<head>` script that is a file rather than an inline one, because the Content-Security-Policy
sets `script-src 'self'` and is worth more than a theme. Pictures now send optimistically — decoded
first, so the bubble reserves exactly the box the stored image will occupy — and the thread stops
accumulating history it is not showing, which is item 76 answered by bounding the array rather than by
windowing it.

Phases 30-34 are the safety and scale pass. **Blocking** is enforced where it can actually be
enforced: not at conversation creation, which stops nothing for two people who already have a thread,
but inside the locked transaction that writes a direct message — and at every other write the
recipient would see, plus user search, in both directions. A PostgreSQL advisory lock keyed on the
pair of people orders a block against a send, which a row lock cannot do for a row that does not
exist yet. Realtime follows the same policy: live sockets leave the direct room, presence is
withdrawn unless a shared group still makes it visible, and read receipts stop being shared while
leaving the reader able to clear their own badge. Groups are deliberately untouched, the same line
WhatsApp, Messenger and Telegram draw, and the confirmation dialog says so before the decision rather
than leaving it to be discovered in a group later. Blocking is reachable from the conversation row's
menu and from account settings, which is also where the paged list of blocked people lives, and a
block made on one device now reaches the same account's other sessions without a reload. Phase 33
closed the last unbounded query — the conversation list is a keyset page, which the five-pin cap made
expressible without raw SQL.

Phases 36-37 are the picture, looked at closely. A captioned photograph is one object in the thread
rather than a photograph followed by a bubble, it states its own time in a chip on itself, and it fits
the phone it is on instead of running past the row it is in. The viewer it opens into is no longer a
panel: no card, no rules, no outlined buttons — the picture on the scrim, its caption as centred type
*above* it rather than a wash across the top of it, the set centred underneath, the close button in
one compact dock below the image beside forward and save. Saving fetches the bytes rather than trusting
`<a download>`, which is silently ignored across origins and would have navigated away from the
conversation instead. That same compact dock holds what
phase 36 was missing: zoom and rotate, with every zoom anchored at the point the reader is looking at
(a wheel tick, a trackpad pinch, a double-click) rather than at the picture's centre, and dragging to
pan once zoomed in, clamped to the picture rather than to the screen. A quarter-turn re-fits the whole
uncropped image to the viewport, so rotating a landscape never destroys its form.

Phase 39 makes network use follow what is actually visible. A picked photo is reduced to the server's
1600px ceiling and encoded in the browser when that produces fewer bytes, while the server keeps its
authoritative security re-encode. The thread downloads 480px derivatives and reserves the full image
for the viewer/save path; large JSON responses are compressed. [ADR 0016](docs/adr/0016-bandwidth-first-message-delivery.md)
maps those choices to Messenger's published snapshot/delta and separate-media architecture, and states
the evidence required before adding object storage, durable event cursors, queues or binary encoding.

Largest known gaps:

- **No real deployment yet.** The $0/month topology is implemented: one existing machine or Oracle
  Always Free runs Postgres, Redis, uploads, two APIs and an internal Caddy gateway; the optional
  Cloudflare Tunnel compose file provides the public edge. Launch is blocked on buying the one
  planned purchase (a domain), creating free Cloudflare/Resend accounts and choosing a backup
  destination. Exact conditions are in [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).
- **Blocking does not become a group-wide ban.** Manager-only invite policy limits who can introduce
  somebody, but if a blocked person already shares a group with you, both of you still see that
  group's messages. See [ADR 0018](docs/adr/0018-group-admins-and-invite-policy.md).
- **A system line does not follow a later rename** — "An added Binh" keeps the names people had when
  it happened, by design. See [ADR 0009](docs/adr/0009-system-messages.md).
- **Mail sends, but no production account is signed up for.** Phase 10 added a real SMTP transport
  and development runs against Mailpit; a deployment still needs a provider, a verified sending
  domain and SPF/DKIM/DMARC records, without which mail is accepted and then filed as spam. Delivery
  is at-least-once — `Message-ID` makes a retry recognisable, nothing more — and bounces are
  invisible, because the outbox records that the server *accepted* the message rather than that it
  arrived. Changing an account's email address (phase 13) runs on the same machinery and inherits the
  same limits.
- **An attachment URL works for anyone holding it, until it expires.** Signed and scoped to one attachment
  with a one-hour life, but bearer proof for that hour — see
  [ADR 0007](docs/adr/0007-signed-attachment-urls.md). Files left behind by a send that failed midway
  are swept every six hours as of phase 14; avatar files are not swept yet.
- **TLS is configured but not exercised on a real hostname.** Caddy now balances the two API
  instances and the tunnel scaffold provides TLS/public ingress without opening host ports. A domain
  and tunnel token are still needed to prove it end to end. Object storage is deliberately deferred:
  the shared volume is the correct $0 boundary while every API instance lives on one host.
- **The CSP is verified locally against the test API, not a deployed host.** Built-web acceptance exercises image and voice preview/send/reload against the isolated API.
  The public nginx/TLS topology still needs deployment acceptance.
- **The message list is not virtualised.** Messages accumulate only through explicit paging, so
  reaching a DOM large enough to matter takes deliberate work — but the ceiling is real, and the two
  cheap fixes both risk the scroll-position handling that already works. See phase 19, item 76.
- Playwright covers one browser, and `test:e2e` is not part of `verify` — it needs two servers and a
  browser download.

## Built-web acceptance

`npm run test:e2e:built` builds the web client, serves it locally with the exact CSP read from the nginx
template, and tests image/voice previews and delivery against the isolated test API/database. It uses
the same ports as ordinary E2E, so run them sequentially. This verifies browser policy and API interaction;
it does not replace a deployment check of nginx/TLS on the real host.

Conversation details dock in a separate right panel on screens at least 1280px wide.
Desktop panels have subtle frames and gutters. Conversation details have a fixed 320px width,
without a resize handle. Only the left sidebar can be resized from 260–400px (default 320px):
drag its divider or use arrow keys, Home/End, and Enter to reset. Its width is remembered locally.
People search and the message-search button share one sidebar row; Saved and Bookmarks are
compact adjacent shortcuts, distinguishing personal notes from messages marked in other chats.
On smaller screens they replace the thread until closed, preserving the composer draft.
The panel stays open while chatting on desktop; use the header toggle, Close, or Escape to close it.

Only conversation details use the 240ms enter/exit motion system. Reduced motion skips movement
and the close delay. Images and settings open and close immediately.
Both direct and group details open on an overview, mirroring Messenger's layout: mute/search quick
actions, Chat info (pinned messages), Customize chat (rename, group photo, a shared message color,
and per-member nicknames — all shared with everyone in the conversation, not private to whoever set
them), then Media/files/links, Members, Group options and Privacy & support as collapsible
sections — content, then people, then settings, then the rare, sensitive controls, rather than
interleaving settings between content. Renaming and the group photo are admin-gated; the rest of
Customize chat is open to any participant — cosmetic, not moderation. See
[ADR 0022](docs/adr/0022-conversation-customize-and-shared-nicknames.md). Rename, the group photo
message color and nicknames each open their own modal rather than an inline field-plus-Save; nicknames edit in
place, replacing the real name rather than opening a second input beside it. Adding people to a
group is search-then-multi-select-then-confirm in its own modal, matching how starting a new
conversation already works, rather than adding on first click. A member row's actions menu is
portalled above the list rather than pushed inline, so opening it never shifts the rows below.
Invite permissions (Group options, admin-gated) use a toggle switch, not a dropdown — there are
only two states. Message color opens a preview picker with eight coordinated bubble colors
and Default; it does not change the conversation background. Previewing or cancelling changes
nothing for other participants; Apply saves the shared color and syncs it live. Light/dark mode
remains each person's own preference. The header and 40px pinned-message bar softly blur messages
as they scroll behind. The pin bar keeps author and preview on one line. Clicking it jumps to the latest
pin; its expand button opens the full list, also reachable from conversation details.

Pinned messages open in a separate dialog without resizing the thread. Photo/file/voice previews
include their attachment identity; captions remain secondary. Pins can be removed from the list; their status appears in the bar rather than an inline
marker. Message jumps scroll only the history viewport and
wait for it to become visible after closing mobile details.
