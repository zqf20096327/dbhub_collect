## What is Nuvix?

Most apps need the same backend building blocks: auth, a database, file storage, and messaging. The usual answer is four different vendors, four dashboards, and four billing pages before you write a single line of product code.

**Nuvix replaces all of that.**

- One unified backend
- Single permission model
- Fully self-hostable
- Security-first by design
- Built for AI-powered products

Stop managing multiple services. Start building products.

## Core Features

### Authentication
Multi-tenant auth with user accounts, sessions, teams, and role-based access. Security isn't a config option—it's the default.

**Includes:** OAuth/Social login, MFA, session management, team roles, permissions.

### Database
PostgreSQL under the hood. Three schema modes so you pick the right fit for each use case:

| Mode | Best For | What You Get |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Document** | Prototyping, MVPs | NoSQL-style flexibility, no SQL needed |
| **Managed** | Production apps | Auto-generated CRUD + Row-Level Security policies |
| **Unmanaged** | Custom logic | Raw SQL, full control, no guardrails |

Mix and match across the same project. All three share one unified API.

### Storage
Permission-aware file system with S3-compatible drivers or local storage. The same permission rules that govern your database govern your files.

**Includes:** Local & S3-compatible storage, permission inheritance, signed URLs, CDN-ready.

### Messaging
Email, SMS, and push notifications through a single API. No need to wire up SendGrid, Twilio, and Firebase separately.

**Includes:** Email templates, SMS delivery, push notifications, delivery tracking, scheduling.

### AI-Ready
Purpose-built for AI products. Secure data layers, granular permissions, session management, and file handling for ML pipelines. Store embeddings, manage context, enforce access rules on every request.

## Getting Started

### Quickest Start: CLI

Get up and running in seconds with the Nuvix CLI.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuvix-dev/cli/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then run:

```bash
nuvix local init
nuvix local up
```

Open **`http://localhost:3000`** and start building.

> **Requirements:** [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Alternative: Docker Compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nuvix-dev/docker.git nuvix
cd nuvix
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

[Full self-hosting instructions](https://docs.nuvix.in/self-hosting)

### Local Development

```bash
bun install
bun run dev     # Start dev server with auto-reload
bun run test    # Run full test suite
bun run lint    # Format & lint with Biome
```

---

## Web SDK Installation

Use the Nuvix client SDK in your web projects:

### npm

```bash
npm install @nuvix/client
```

### bun

```bash
bun add @nuvix/client
```

### Quick Usage

```typescript
import { Client } from '@nuvix/client';

const nx = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://api.nuvix.in/v1')

// Authentication
const session = await nx.account.createAnonymousSession();

// Database queries
const todos = await nx.db.from('todos').select('*');
```

## Security Model

Security isn't an afterthought. Every request in Nuvix passes through the same permission pipeline.

- **Managed Schemas** - Auto-generate Row-Level Security policies. You don't write them by hand.
- **Project Isolation** - Tenant data is separated at the database level.
- **Self-Hosted** - Your data never leaves your infrastructure.
- **Unified Pipeline** - Same permission model for database, storage, and messaging.

> Security in Nuvix is always on. You don't enable it—it's the default.

- [ ] Realtime subscriptions (WebSocket support)
- [ ] Edge functions (Deploy functions at the edge)
- [ ] Python SDK
- [ ] Vector / embeddings support (AI-optimized)
- [ ] Multi-region self-hosting guide
