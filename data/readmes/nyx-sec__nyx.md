## Scan locally, browse locally

Nyx runs cross-language taint analysis on your repository, then verifies Medium or higher confidence findings by running small sandboxed harnesses against the real code. Results are served to a React UI bound to `127.0.0.1`. You get severity, static evidence, dynamic verdicts, and a step-by-step **flow visualiser** that walks the dataflow from source → sanitizer → sink. Triage decisions persist to `.nyx/triage.json`, which commits alongside your code so the team shares one triage state.

```bash
cargo install nyx-scanner
nyx scan           # runs the analyzer, caches findings in .nyx/
nyx serve          # opens http://localhost:9700 in your browser
```

Everything stays on your machine: loopback-only bind, host-header enforcement, CSRF on every mutation, no remote telemetry, no login.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/screenshots/overview.png" alt="Overview dashboard for a small JS app: Health Score C 78 with the five-component breakdown (Severity pressure, Confidence quality, Trend, Triage coverage, Regression resistance), 3 findings detected, OWASP A03 and A02 buckets, confidence distribution and issue category bars, top affected files" width="900"/></p>

## What's in the UI

| Page | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Overview** | Dashboard: finding counts by severity, top offenders, engine profile summary |
| **Findings** | Browsable list with severity badges, triage status, rule filter, language filter |
| **Finding detail** | Flow-path visualiser with numbered steps (source → sanitizer → sink), dynamic verdicts, code snippets, evidence, cross-file markers, triage dropdown |
| **Triage** | Bulk update states (open, investigating, fixed, false_positive, accepted_risk, suppressed), audit trail, import/export JSON |
| **Explorer** | File tree with per-file symbol list and finding overlay |
| **Scans** | Run history, metrics, diff two scans to see what changed |
| **Rules** | Built-in and custom rules per language; add rules from the UI |
| **Config** | Live config editor; reload without restart |


`nyx serve` flags: `--port <N>` (default `9700`), `--host <addr>` (loopback only: `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, or `::1`), `--no-browser`. See `[server]` in `nyx.conf` for persistent settings, and the [Browser UI guide](https://nyxscan.dev/docs/serve.html) for the page-by-page UI tour and security model.

---

## CLI for CI

The same engine runs headless for CI pipelines. SARIF output uploads directly to GitHub Code Scanning.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/screenshots/cli-scan.gif" alt="nyx scan console output: HIGH taint findings across a JS and Python file with source → sink arrows" width="820"/></p>

```bash
# Fail the job on medium or higher, emit SARIF
nyx scan --format sarif --fail-on MEDIUM > results.sarif

# Ad-hoc JSON, no index
nyx scan ./server --format json --index off

# AST patterns only (fastest; skips CFG + taint)
nyx scan --mode ast

# Engine-depth shortcut: fast | balanced (default) | deep
# `deep` adds symex + demand-driven backwards taint for higher precision at ~2-3× cost
nyx scan --engine-profile deep
```

Forward cross-file taint runs in every profile. Symex and the demand-driven backwards walk are opt-in. Turn them on either via `--engine-profile deep`, or individually (`--symex`, `--backwards-analysis`). See the [CLI reference](https://nyxscan.dev/docs/cli.html#engine-depth-profile) for the full toggle matrix.

### GitHub Action

```yaml
- uses: nyx-sec/nyx@v0.8.0
  with:
    format: sarif
    fail-on: MEDIUM
- uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  with:
    sarif_file: nyx-results.sarif
```

Inputs: `path`, `version`, `format` (`sarif`|`json`|`console`), `fail-on`, `args`, `token`. Outputs: `finding-count`, `sarif-file`, `exit-code`, `nyx-version`. Linux and macOS runners (x86_64, ARM64).

---

## Install

**Cargo (recommended):**
```bash
cargo install nyx-scanner
```

**Pre-built binaries:** Grab the archive for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/nyx-sec/nyx/releases), verify against `SHA256SUMS` (and the detached `SHA256SUMS.asc` GPG signature, when present), unzip, and drop `nyx` on your `PATH`.

```bash
# Optional: verify the checksum file's GPG signature (when SHA256SUMS.asc is published)
gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc SHA256SUMS
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
unzip nyx-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.zip && chmod +x nyx && sudo mv nyx /usr/local/bin/
```

**From source:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nyx-sec/nyx.git
cd nyx && cargo build --release
```

Requires stable Rust 1.88+. The frontend is compiled and embedded in the binary at build time, so there is no separate install step for `nyx serve`.

## Languages

All 10 languages parse via tree-sitter and run through the full pipeline, but rule depth and engine coverage are uneven. Benchmark F1 on the synthetic corpus at [`tests/benchmark/ground_truth.json`](tests/benchmark/ground_truth.json) is 100% across all ten languages at the last measured baseline (see [`tests/benchmark/RESULTS.md`](tests/benchmark/RESULTS.md)), so F1 alone no longer separates the tiers. Tiering reflects rule depth, gated-sink coverage, and structural idioms the synthetic corpus does not fully stress:

| Tier | Languages | F1 | Use as a CI gate? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stable** | Python, JavaScript, TypeScript | 100% | Yes |
| **Beta** | Java, PHP, Ruby, Rust, Go | 100% | Yes, with light FP triage |
| **Preview** | C, C++ | 100% on synthetic corpus | No. STL container flow, builder chains, and inline class member functions are tracked, but deep pointer aliasing and function pointers are not. Pair with clang-tidy or Clang Static Analyzer |

All real-CVE fixtures fire and the corpus carries zero open FPs at the recorded baseline (P=R=F1=1.000). Per-dimension detail and known blind spots live on the [Language maturity page](https://nyxscan.dev/docs/language-maturity.html).

### Validated against real CVEs

The corpus also holds a small set of vulnerable/patched pairs extracted from published advisories, so the benchmark floor is defended by regression protection on demonstrably real bugs rather than just synthetic analogues. Nyx fires on the vulnerable file and emits zero findings on the patched file for each pair.

### Real-world findings

- **Nextcloud server**, [PR #59979](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/59979), merged. The runtime decoder for this column already restricted `allowed_classes`, but the repair routine called `unserialize()` without it, so magic methods on referenced classes could still run. Fix matches the runtime path.
-->

---

## How it works

Two passes over the filesystem, with an optional SQLite index to skip unchanged files:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Repo["Repository files"] --> Pass1["Pass 1 per file<br/>tree-sitter, CFG, SSA"]
    Pass1 --> Summaries["Function summaries<br/>sources, sinks, sanitizers, points-to"]
    Summaries --> Index["SQLite index<br/>optional incremental cache"]
    Index --> Pass2["Pass 2 cross-file<br/>global summaries, k=1 inline, SCC fixpoint"]
    Pass2 --> Rank["Rank and dedupe<br/>severity, evidence, exploitability"]
    Rank --> Verify["Dynamic verification<br/>sandboxed harnesses, verdicts"]
    Verify --> Output["Console, JSON, SARIF<br/>and browser UI"]
```

1. **Pass 1**: parse each file via tree-sitter, build an intra-procedural CFG (petgraph), lower to pruned SSA (Cytron phi insertion over dominance frontiers), and export per-function summaries (source/sanitizer/sink caps, taint transforms, points-to, callees).
2. **Summary merge**: union all per-file summaries into a `GlobalSummaries` map.
3. **Pass 2**: re-analyze each file with cross-file context under bounded context sensitivity (k=1 inlining for intra-file callees, SCC fixpoint capped at 64 iterations, and summary fallback for callees above the inline body-size cap). A forward dataflow worklist propagates taint through the SSA lattice with guaranteed convergence. Call-graph SCCs iterate to fixed-point (within the cap) so mutually recursive functions get accurate summaries.
4. **Rank, dedupe, verify, emit**: findings are scored by severity × evidence strength × source-kind exploitability. Medium or higher confidence findings are dynamically verified by default, then results are emitted to console, JSON, SARIF, and the browser UI.

Detector families: taint (cross-file source→sink, with cap-specific rule classes for SQLi, XSS, command/code exec, deserialization, SSRF, path traversal, format string, crypto, LDAP injection, XPath injection, HTTP header / response splitting, open redirect, server-side template injection, XXE, prototype pollution, data exfiltration, and the auth fold-in), CFG structural (auth gaps, unguarded sinks, resource leaks), state model (use-after-close, double-close, must-leak, unauthed-access), AST patterns (tree-sitter structural match). Full detector docs: [Detectors](https://nyxscan.dev/docs/detectors.html).

---

## Verify findings dynamically

Static analysis says a sink is reachable. Dynamic verification tries to prove it. With `--verify` (on by default), Nyx builds a small harness around each Medium-or-higher finding, runs it in a sandbox against a curated payload corpus, and stamps a verdict onto the finding.

```bash
nyx scan --verify          # build + run a harness per finding (default)
nyx scan --no-verify       # static analysis only, for fast local loops
```

A finding is **Confirmed** only when an attacker-controlled payload fires the sink *and* a paired benign control stays clean. That differential rule, plus behavioral oracles (a template that renders `49`, a deserializer that resolves a gadget class, a redirect that leaves the origin), keeps the verifier from confirming on an echoed string. Sinks behind a recognized guard demote to `ConfirmedWithKnownGuard`; sinks reached without a completed exploit chain land as `PartiallyConfirmed`.

Coverage spans 18 verifiable capability classes and 120+ registered adapters across all ten languages (Flask, Django, Express, NestJS, Spring, Rails, Laravel, Gin, Axum, and more), with per-language build pools and copy-on-write workdirs to keep the per-finding cost low. Confirmed findings write a hermetic repro bundle with a `reproduce.sh`. Runs are deterministic: every payload is seeded from the spec hash.

```bash
# CI: fail the build if a new Confirmed finding appears vs. a baseline
nyx scan --baseline .nyx/baseline.json --gate no-new-confirmed
```

Backends: Docker (preferred, network-blocked by default) or an in-process runner with `--harden {standard,strict}`. Full matrix, oracle list, and limitations: [Dynamic verification](https://nyxscan.dev/docs/dynamic.html).

## Configuration

Config merges `nyx.conf` (defaults) and `nyx.local` (your overrides) from the platform config directory (`~/.config/nyx/` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/nyx/` on macOS, `%APPDATA%\nyx\config\` on Windows).

```toml
[scanner]
mode         = "full"        # full | ast | cfg | taint
min_severity = "Medium"

[server]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 9700
open_browser = true

# Project-specific sanitizer
[[analysis.languages.javascript.rules]]
matchers = ["escapeHtml"]
kind     = "sanitizer"
cap      = "html_escape"
```

Or add rules interactively: `nyx config add-rule --lang javascript --matcher escapeHtml --kind sanitizer --cap html_escape`. Caps: `env_var`, `html_escape`, `shell_escape`, `url_encode`, `json_parse`, `file_io`, `fmt_string`, `sql_query`, `deserialize`, `ssrf`, `data_exfil`, `code_exec`, `crypto`, `unauthorized_id`, `ldap_injection`, `xpath_injection`, `header_injection`, `open_redirect`, `ssti`, `xxe`, `prototype_pollution`, `all`. Full schema: [Configuration](https://nyxscan.dev/docs/configuration.html). Run `nyx rules list` to browse the registry from the terminal.

---

## Status

Under active development. APIs, detector behavior, and configuration options may change between releases. Rule-level F1 on the synthetic corpus is the CI regression floor; per-language detail lives in [`tests/benchmark/RESULTS.md`](tests/benchmark/RESULTS.md).

Taint analysis is interprocedural. Persisted per-function SSA summaries carry per-return-path transforms and parameter-granularity points-to, and call-graph SCCs (including SCCs that span files) iterate to a joint fixed-point. The default `balanced` profile also runs k=1 context-sensitive inlining for intra-file callees. Symex (with cross-file and interprocedural frames) and the demand-driven backwards walk are opt-in. Enable them individually with `--symex` and `--backwards-analysis`, or together with `--engine-profile deep`.

Limitations:
- Interprocedural precision is bounded rather than unlimited. Context-sensitive inlining is k=1 with a callee body-size cap, and SCC fixed-point has an iteration cap. When the engine hits a bound it falls back to summaries and records an `engine_note` on the finding.
- Cross-language calls (FFI, subprocess, WASM) are not traversed. Each language is analysed independently.
- Several language features are not modeled: macros, most dynamic dispatch, aliased imports, reflection.
- C/C++ are preview tier. STL container flow, builder chains, and inline class member functions are tracked now; deep pointer aliasing and function pointers are not. A clean report should not be read as a clean audit. Pair with a clang-based tool before using as a hard CI gate.
- Results may contain false positives or false negatives; manual review is expected.
