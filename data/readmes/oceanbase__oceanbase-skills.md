# OceanBase Skills

A collection of **AI Agent Skills** for OceanBase products — designed for use with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and any other agent that supports the **Agent Skills Specification**.

Each skill is a self-contained directory with a `SKILL.md` file (plus optional `references/`) that gives AI agents the domain knowledge needed to help you operate OceanBase products correctly and safely.

## Quick Start

### Install via skills.sh (recommended)

```bash
# Install the oceanbase-deploy bundle (includes every child skill and reference)
npx skills add oceanbase/oceanbase-skills --skill oceanbase-deploy

# Install the seekdb standalone skill (install / build from source)
npx skills add oceanbase/oceanbase-skills --skill seekdb

# Or install all skills from this repo
npx skills add oceanbase/oceanbase-skills
```

### Manual install — clone and copy

Clone the repository, then copy the skill directories into your agent's skills
folder. Cloning gives you a verifiable, version-pinned copy of the skill files
instead of fetching agent instructions over the network at runtime.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oceanbase/oceanbase-skills.git
cd oceanbase-skills

# oceanbase-deploy (copy the complete routed bundle)
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cp -R skills/oceanbase-deploy .claude/skills/

# SeekDB standalone skill bundle (install + build + docs + cli + importing + querying)
cp -R skills/seekdb .claude/skills/
```

Cursor and Windsurf use the same layout under `.cursor/skills/` and
`.windsurf/skills/` respectively.

`oceanbase-deploy` is a routed bundle, not a standalone `SKILL.md`. Its root entrypoint, shared `references/`, and child skill directories must remain together. If any required child or reference is missing, agents must fail closed and provide only non-executable orientation.

### Browse the skills on GitHub

Inspect or clone the complete skill bundle in the repository:

```
https://github.com/oceanbase/oceanbase-skills/tree/master/skills/oceanbase-deploy
```

---

## Agent Integration

### Claude Code / Cursor / Windsurf (via skills.sh)

```bash
npx skills add oceanbase/oceanbase-skills --skill oceanbase-deploy
```

`npx skills add` automatically detects your IDE (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) and installs to the right directory.

### Claude Code (manual)

Use the clone-and-copy steps in [Manual install](#manual-install--clone-and-copy) above. Copy the complete `skills/oceanbase-deploy/` directory into `.claude/skills/`; do not place only its root `SKILL.md`.

### Other Agents

Use an integration that preserves and resolves the complete `oceanbase-deploy/` directory tree. A platform that accepts only one pasted rules file cannot safely execute this routed bundle; the root file alone is suitable only for non-executable orientation.

## Example Prompts

After loading the skills, ask your agent for concrete tasks. Below are examples grouped by skill.

### Cluster Management

```text
Deploy a local OceanBase community edition — just get it running quickly
```

```text
Use config.yaml to deploy an OceanBase community edition cluster named test-cluster
```

```text
Help me deploy OCP
```

```text
Start test-cluster directly and check its status after startup
```

```text
How do I add Prometheus and Grafana monitoring to ob-test
```

### Tenant Management

```text
Create a tenant named mysql on test-cluster
```

```text
Configure the backup path for the mysql tenant on test-cluster and run a backup
```

### SeekDB (standalone install / build)

```text
Install SeekDB on my Mac
```

```text
Deploy a SeekDB instance with Docker
```

```text
Build the Linux rpm package of SeekDB from source
```

### SeekDB (docs / cli / import / query)

```text
What does the hybrid search SQL syntax look like in seekdb?
```

```text
Use seekdb-cli to list all tables and run the column profile for the orders table
```

```text
Import this Excel file into seekdb and vectorize the Description column
```

```text
Search "deployment best practices" in the my_docs collection and export the top 20 results to results.xlsx
```

### Testing & Benchmark

```text
Run a sysbench test against the mysql tenant on test-cluster
```

```text
Give me the full TPC-H command and parameters
```

### Tips

- Want the agent to execute directly? Say **"go ahead and run it"**.
- Want a plan first? Say **"don't run anything yet, just give me the commands and steps"**.
- For destructive operations, say **"I confirm high-risk operations are allowed"** or **"don't run destructive commands yet"**.

Each skill follows the **Agent Skills Specification**:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SKILL.md` | Main skill content with YAML frontmatter — consumed by AI agents |
| `references/*.md` | Supplemental documentation, loaded on demand to save context |

---

## Release Quality

- [v2.0.3 release-candidate evidence](./docs/release-evidence/v2.0.3.md)
- [Maintainer release process](./docs/RELEASING.md)

The evidence document lists both tested and explicitly unverified scenarios. Do not infer whole-product runtime coverage from a package version or a Skill description.

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. To add a new skill:

1. Create `skills/<your-skill-name>/`.
2. Write `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `compatibility`, `metadata`) and clear, agent-friendly instructions.
3. Add `references/` for detailed supplemental content (loaded on demand, not always in context).
4. Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines; move details to `references/`.
5. Test your skill by loading it into Claude Code and running representative prompts.

Please keep skill content factual, concise, and safe — especially for destructive or irreversible operations.
