Index once, find anything. seekx brings **SOTA** hybrid search to your local documents — just your files and a single command, reducing token costs by 90%.

```
seekx add ~/notes
seekx search "how do agents use tool calling"
```

That's it. Your notes are indexed, and you're searching.

If you find seekx useful, please consider giving it a ⭐ on [GitHub](https://github.com/oceanbase/seekx) — it really helps!

## Why seekx?

You have hundreds of Markdown files, notes, docs — scattered across folders. Spotlight finds filenames. Grep finds exact strings. Neither understands what you're *looking for*.

seekx does.

| What you get | How |
|---|---|
| **Find by meaning, not just keywords** | Hybrid search fuses BM25 keyword matching with vector semantic search via RRF — you get results whether you remember the exact words or not. |
| **Up and running in 2 minutes** | No GPU, no model downloads, no Docker. Point it at any OpenAI-compatible API and go. |
| **Always in sync** | Edit a file, search it instantly. The index updates as you work — no manual rebuilds. |
| **Works with Chinese, Japanese, Korean** | Jieba-based tokenization built in. CJK full-text search just works. |

## Features

- **Hybrid search** — BM25 + vector + Reciprocal Rank Fusion, out of the box
- **Cross-encoder reranking** — optional rerank API for higher-precision results
- **Query expansion** — automatic query rewriting via LLM for better recall
- **HyDE** — Hypothetical Document Embeddings for improved semantic retrieval
- **Content-aware chunking** — Markdown heading-based splitting; plain-text paragraph splitting
- **Incremental indexing** — SHA-1 content hashing skips unchanged files; only re-embeds what changed
- **CJK tokenization** — Jieba-based segmentation for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text
- **MCP server** — expose your knowledge base to AI agents via [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
- **OpenClaw plugin** — drop-in memory backend that replaces `memory-core` with seekx's hybrid pipeline
- **JSON output** — every command supports `--json` for scripting and piping

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) ≥ 1.1.0
- An OpenAI-compatible embedding API (SiliconFlow, Jina, Ollama, OpenAI, etc.)

### Install

**From npm (recommended)** — install the CLI globally; npm pulls [`seekx-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/seekx-core) automatically.

```bash
npm install -g seekx
# or: bun add -g seekx
```

You still need [Bun](https://bun.sh) on your `PATH` at runtime — the published CLI runs via Bun, not Node.

**From source** — for development or unreleased commits:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oceanbase/seekx.git
cd seekx
bun install
bun link --cwd packages/cli   # makes 'seekx' available globally
```

### Set up

```bash
seekx onboard    # interactive — configure API, check environment
```

`onboard` walks you through API key setup, embedding model selection, and macOS SQLite configuration for vector search.

### Index & search

```bash
# Add directories to the index
seekx add ~/notes
seekx add ~/Documents/obsidian --name obsidian

# Hybrid search (BM25 + vector + RRF)
seekx search "vector database embedding"

# Search with automatic query expansion
seekx query "how does RRF fusion work"

# Pure semantic search
seekx vsearch "semantic similarity"
```

### Keep the index fresh

```bash
seekx watch          # watches all indexed collections
```

## How search works

```

1. **Query expansion** (optional): an LLM rewrites the query into multiple variants for better recall.
2. The original query and all expanded variants are run against **BM25** and **vector** indexes in parallel. Original results carry 2× weight in fusion; expanded results carry 1×.
3. **HyDE** (optional): a hypothetical answer is generated and embedded as an additional vector search pass.
4. All result lists are merged via **Reciprocal Rank Fusion** (RRF).
5. **Reranking** (optional): a cross-encoder re-scores the fused candidates with position-aware blending.

## CLI reference

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.seekx/config.yml`

```yaml
# Provider defaults (shared across services)
provider:
  base_url: https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1
  api_key: sk-...

# Embedding — required for vector search
embed:
  model: BAAI/bge-m3

# Cross-encoder reranking — optional
rerank:
  model: BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3

# Query expansion — optional
expand:
  model: Qwen/Qwen3-8B

# Search defaults
search:
  default_limit: 10
  rerank: true
  min_score: 0.3

# File watcher
watch:
  debounce_ms: 500
  ignore:
    - node_modules
    - .git
```

Each service (`embed`, `rerank`, `expand`) can override `base_url`, `api_key`, and `model` independently if you use different providers.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `SEEKX_API_KEY` | API key (overrides config) |
| `SEEKX_BASE_URL` | Base URL (overrides config) |
| `SEEKX_DB_PATH` | SQLite database path (default: `~/.seekx/index.sqlite`) |
| `SEEKX_CONFIG_PATH` | Config file path (default: `~/.seekx/config.yml`) |
| `SEEKX_SQLITE_PATH` | Path to `libsqlite3.dylib` (macOS, for extension loading) |

### macOS: vector search setup

The system SQLite on macOS disables extension loading. For vector search (`sqlite-vec`):

```bash
brew install sqlite
```

seekx auto-detects standard Homebrew paths (Apple Silicon and Intel). If auto-detection fails:

```bash
export SEEKX_SQLITE_PATH="$(brew --prefix sqlite)/lib/libsqlite3.dylib"
```

`seekx onboard` will check this and guide you.

## MCP server

Expose your indexed knowledge base to AI agents (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)
via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io):

```bash
seekx mcp    # starts an MCP server over stdio
```

The server exposes four tools: `search`, `get`, `list`, `status`.

## OpenClaw integration

[`seekx-openclaw`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/seekx-openclaw) is a drop-in plugin that replaces [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai)'s built-in `memory-core` backend with seekx's full hybrid search pipeline. Once installed, every `memory_search` and `memory_get` call is transparently routed through BM25 + vector + rerank — no changes to your agent or prompts are needed.

```bash
openclaw plugins install seekx-openclaw
```

Configure the plugin in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "slots":   { "memory": "seekx" },
    "entries": { "seekx": { "enabled": true } }
  }
}
```

**What you get beyond the built-in backend:**

- Hybrid BM25 + vector search with cross-encoder reranking
- CJK-aware full-text search via Jieba
- Proactive auto-recall: injects relevant memory into prompts before the agent even searches
- `Source: path#line` citation footers on search results (QMD-compatible)
- Search timeout protection (default 8 s)
- Graceful degradation — BM25-only works with no API key

The plugin inherits API credentials from `~/.seekx/config.yml` when that file exists, so no duplication is needed if you already use the seekx CLI. See the [plugin README](packages/openclaw-plugin/README.md) for provider configuration, extra directories, and troubleshooting.
