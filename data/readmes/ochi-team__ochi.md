```sh
VERSION=v0.5.3 &&
curl -Ls "https://github.com/ochi-team/ochi/releases/download/${VERSION}/Ochi-${VERSION}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz" | tar -xz
```

#### Build from source

- install [zig](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/#managers) 0.16.0
- compile with `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe -Drelease=true`

## Documentation

https://ochi.dev/docs/guides/installation/

## Roadmap

- [x] store persists the data, working simple API queries
- [x] Grafana datasource available
- [x] home made query language
- [x] installation scripts
- [x] Ochi starts emitting logs to itself, [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) Ochi
- [x] Home made UI
- [ ] Disk snapshots and recovery
- [ ] Replication to a secondary mount
- [ ] aarch64 release target
- [ ] full support of Loki ingestion protocol (snappy, zstd, protobuf encoding, etc.)
- [ ] docker-compose with configured datasource to grafana
- [ ] OTEL collector API support
- [ ] configuration support
- [ ] windows devevlopment support
- [ ] cost analysis
- [ ] GDPR compliance

## Goals
- support aarch64 and x86_64 as Tier 1
- support Windows and POSIX systems for development
- support only Linux for production workloads (community is free to do whatever)
- better core over features

## Non goals
- support every OS
- "feature completeness"

## Contributing

Ochi is being actively developed by a small team of engineers (team of 1).

Open an issue before submitting a PR. 
Although bug fixes are exceptions, but they must be provided with a test to demonstrate a bug.

Optimization improvements are welcome, but must be accompanied by a benchmark.

Before submitting a PR, make sure the tests pass:
```bash
zig build test
```

For all questions, major changes, suggestions, notes, feel free to reach out to the team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/AsCKpCNp5c).

## AI Policy

1. We don't shame the lack of knowledge, it's better to accept not knowing, than spreading disinformation.
2. Using LLMs you put your trust profile on a line, we don't encourage it, but you may.
3. Complete slop will be rejected with a very short comment and a permanent ban.
4. We can invest our time helping you learn. Don't fully rely on LLMs to implement a solution.

We encourage to use AI in order to:
1. generate a test that is able to crash the system

## Code style
- a good inner function comment describes why, not what
- a good outer function comment (doc string) describes what
- explicit is better than implicit
- therefore default options are not the best
- tests must either cover data or effects, not both
- to produce effect it must take a data to produce a pre determined effect
- pure functions are welcome
