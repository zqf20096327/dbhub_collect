## About

**GKMPS School ERP** is the backend for a school management system: a single ASP.NET Core 9
application built in **n-tier** layers, with **data security**, **reliability** and
**accessibility** as the guiding priorities. It covers everything a school runs on day to
day — admissions, staff, attendance, academics, examinations, fees, communication, library
and transport — plus notifications tying it all together. This is the **backend only**; the
[Angular frontend](https://github.com/ojas2005/GKMPS-Frntend) talks to it over `/api/*`.

It runs comfortably on ~200 MB of RAM, which keeps hosting free or close to it for a school
of this size (~1,300 accounts, a few hundred daily users).

## Tiers

| Project | Tier | Contains |
|---|---|---|
| `src/SchoolERP.Api` | Presentation | Controllers, JWT auth, CORS, rate limiting, Swagger, health checks, startup (migrations + owner seed) |
| `src/SchoolERP.Business` | Business | Services and their interfaces, DTOs, token issuing, QuestPDF documents, notification event handlers, in-process event bus |
| `src/SchoolERP.DataAccess` | Data access | Entities, one EF Core `DbContext` + migrations per module, repositories, file storage for generated PDFs |
| `src/SchoolERP.Common` | Cross-cutting | `ApiResponse`, `RoleNames`, `CallerClaims`, `BaseEntity`/`AuditLog`, event contracts, exception handling, logging, security headers, hosting helpers |

References only point downward: **Api → Business → DataAccess → Common**.

## Modules

Every tier is organised by the same 12 school modules. Each module keeps its **own
database** (`identity`, `student`, `fee`, ...) on one TiDB/MySQL server.

| Module | Owns | Raises |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | Accounts, JWT + refresh rotation, role hierarchy, lockout | `UserRegisteredEvent` |
| Student | Admissions, class moves, parent logins, transfer certificates | `StudentEnrolledEvent`, `CertificateGeneratedEvent` |
| Staff | Staff profiles, salaries and payouts, leave, staff attendance | — |
| Attendance | Daily attendance, atomic present/absent/late counters | — |
| Academic | Subjects, timetables and the timetable generator, homework | — |
| Examination | Exams, marks, rankings, QuestPDF report cards | — |
| Fee | Fee structures, dues, atomic payments, receipts, waivers | `FeePaidEvent` |
| Communication | Announcements, parent ↔ teacher messages | — |
| Library | Books, issue/return, fines | — |
| Transport | Routes, vehicles, student-route mapping | — |
| Notification | Handles every event above: records it and sends email when SMTP is configured | handles all |
| Reporting | Enrollment and fee-collection reports, PDF export | — |

Modules call each other's **business services** in-process (for example Reporting uses the
Student and Fee services), never each other's tables.

## Tech stack

- **Framework** — ASP.NET Core 9, EF Core 9 (Pomelo MySQL provider)
- **Data** — TiDB Cloud (MySQL-compatible; one database per module), in-memory caching
- **Events** — in-process event bus with a background dispatcher (no message broker needed)
- **Auth** — PBKDF2 password hashing, 15-min JWTs, rotated refresh tokens (hashed at rest),
  account lockout, role hierarchy for account management
- **Sessions** — every sign-in is a stored session that stays open while the user is active
  and ends after `Session:IdleTimeoutMinutes` (30) of inactivity, with a one-minute warning
  in the browser. Sign-out, a password change or an admin deactivating the account ends it
  at once, not when the access token runs out. Hard cap: 7 days, then sign in again
- **Files** — QuestPDF receipts, report cards and certificates, stored in their own `files`
  database and shared via signed 15-minute links served by the API
  (`FileStorage__Provider=AzureBlob` switches to Azure Blob Storage + SAS links instead)
- **Ops** — Serilog (console + optional Seq), health checks, per-user rate limiting,
  Swagger (off in production unless enabled), Docker, Caddy (automatic TLS), GitHub Actions CI

## Getting started

Requires the .NET 10 SDK and Docker.

```bash
# configure environment
cp .env.example .env
#   JWT_SIGNING_KEY: openssl rand -hex 32
#   Database: TIDB_* for TiDB Cloud, or uncomment the local block
#             (COMPOSE_PROFILES=local-db,local-storage, TIDB_HOST=tidb, TIDB_SSL_MODE=None, ...)

# build & run the app, Caddy, and (with the local profiles) a TiDB container (+ Azurite, only
# needed with FILE_STORAGE_PROVIDER=AzureBlob)
docker compose up --build
```

The app applies every module's database migrations on startup, retrying while the database
comes up, so no manual ordering is needed.

Then open **http://localhost:5100**. Swagger is off outside Development; set
`Swagger__Enabled=true` to turn it on at `/swagger`. On first boot the app seeds a
`SuperAdmin` owner account (`ownerishim` by default, override via `Owner:Username`) — if
`Owner:Password` / `OWNER_PASSWORD` isn't set, a random password is generated and printed
once in the logs (`docker compose logs app | grep generated`); log in with it and change it
from **My account**. There's no public sign-up — the owner creates further accounts.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `docker compose up --build` | Build and start the app, Caddy and the enabled local services |
| `docker compose up -d` | Same, detached |
| `docker compose logs -f app` | Tail the app's logs |
| `docker compose down` | Stop everything |
| `dotnet build SchoolERP.sln` | Compile without Docker |
| `dotnet test SchoolERP.sln` | Run the unit tests (`Tests/`) |
| `dotnet ef migrations add <Name> -p src/SchoolERP.DataAccess -s src/SchoolERP.Api -c <Module>DbContext -o <Module>/Migrations` | Add an EF Core migration for one module |

## Deploying

- The whole backend is one container image (`Dockerfile` at the repo root) listening on
  port 8080. It needs `ConnectionStrings__SchoolDb` (the TiDB server, without a database
  name), `Jwt__SigningKey` and `Cors__AllowedOrigins__0`
  (the frontend origin); see `docker-compose.yml` for the full list.
- With Docker Compose on a server: `docker compose --env-file .env.production up -d --build`
  with its own secrets, **without** the local profiles. Set `DOMAIN` so Caddy obtains a real
  certificate, and `FRONTEND_URL` to the frontend's origin.
- Set `OWNER_PASSWORD` for the first boot (or read the generated one from the logs) and
  change it after signing in. Optionally configure `SMTP_*` so emails are actually sent.
- Rate limits are per signed-in user (or client IP when anonymous). The app trusts
  `X-Forwarded-For` from the proxy in front of it, so don't expose port 8080 directly.

### Current production (Azure)

Set up to run at no cost: every piece is on a free tier or inside a free monthly allowance.

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| Backend | Azure Container Apps `gkmps-api` (resource group `gkmps-prod`, Korea Central; 0.25 vCPU / 0.5 GB; scales to zero when idle, so usage stays inside the monthly free grant — the first request after a quiet spell takes ~20 s while it starts, and the login page waits it out) |
| Image registry | GitHub Container Registry, `ghcr.io/ojas2005/schoolerp-app` (free for a public repo) — CI publishes one image per pushed commit, tagged with its SHA |
| Frontend | Azure Static Web Apps `gkmps-portal` (Free, East Asia) |
| Database | TiDB Cloud Starter (AWS Tokyo), free tier |
| Files | The `files` database on the same TiDB server |
| Logs | Log Analytics workspace capped at 0.1 GB/day with 30-day retention, which stays inside the free 5 GB a month (this express environment won't provision app updates without a workspace) |

Secrets (database, JWT key, owner seed password) are Container Apps secrets, not image or repo
contents. To deploy a commit, push it, wait for the **Backend CI** run to publish its image, then:

```bash
az containerapp update -g gkmps-prod -n gkmps-api --image ghcr.io/ojas2005/schoolerp-app:<commit-sha>
```
