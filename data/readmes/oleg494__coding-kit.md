# coding-kit

**Reusable workflows and cross-session memory for coding agents.**

Give your agent a shared development method, searchable project knowledge,
and tools to evaluate its behavior. The kit combines 37 skills, plain-text
instructions, and a Python standard-library memory engine. It is not an
agent runtime, a sandbox, or a guarantee of better answers.

## What you can use it for

- **Carry decisions across sessions.** Save findings in your private memory
  store and search them from a fresh agent session instead of reconstructing
  project history from chat.
- **Give coding work a repeatable method.** Skills cover planning,
  reproducing bugs, implementation, review, and verification. YAGNI means
  avoiding functionality and abstractions the task does not need.
- **Evaluate behavior rather than trust promises.** Run policy scenarios,
  skill-routing checks, and small coding tasks with deterministic verifiers.
  These answer different questions; none alone proves overall coding quality.

Developed and tested with **Claude Code and Oh My Pi (OMP)**. Other agents
that read instruction files and `SKILL.md` skills can be configured manually;
this project does not claim to have tested their behavior. Instructions are
in English; the kit asks the agent to answer in your language.

## Get started

Installation has two separate steps: **create the memory store**, then
**connect your agent**. The first step does not install agent instructions.

### 1. Create your memory store

Requirements: Git and **Python 3.12**. CI runs on Windows and Ubuntu with
Python 3.12; other Python versions are untested. Runtime scripts use the
standard library. Only contributors running the test suite need `pytest`.

Run these commands in PowerShell or Bash:

```text
git clone https://github.com/oleg494/coding-kit.git coding-kit
cd coding-kit
python scripts/install.py
```

The installer creates your user-level `~/.memory/` directory, including
fixtures and indexes, and links its engine to this clone. Keep the clone in
place. Re-running the installer is supported. Look for `search smoke: OK`.
It does not configure your agent's rules or skills.

<details>
<summary>Use a different memory location</summary>

Set `MEMORY_ROOT` before installation and in sessions that use the kit.

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:MEMORY_ROOT = "$HOME/coding-memory"
python scripts/install.py
```

Bash:

```bash
export MEMORY_ROOT="$HOME/coding-memory"
python scripts/install.py
```

Examples below call the engine from the clone, so they do not depend on
shell expansion of `~` in script arguments.

</details>

### 2. Connect your agent

Merge a pointer to this clone's [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and
[OPS.md](OPS.md) into your agent's rules file. Use an absolute path to the
clone so the files remain reachable from other projects. Preserve your
existing instructions; do not replace them wholesale.

Copy or link the contents of [skills/](skills/) into the agent's skill
directory, preserving unrelated skills. These are user-level changes and
can affect every project opened with that agent.

| Agent | Rules file | Skills |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| Oh My Pi (OMP) | `~/.omp/agent/AGENTS.md` | Auto-discovers `~/.claude/skills/` |
| Antigravity | `~/AGENTS.md` | `~/.agents/skills/` |
| ZCode | `~/.zcode/AGENTS.md` | `~/.zcode/skills/` |
| Hermes | `SOUL.md` | Point `config.yaml` → `skills.external_dirs` at the clone's `skills/` |

The OMP paths above match the kit's [deployment targets](scripts/tools/deploy.py).
See the [Antigravity](adapters/antigravity.md) and [ZCode](adapters/zcode.md)
guides for their environment-specific setup.

### 3. Verify the connection

From the clone, enter the tools directory, save a note, and retrieve it:

```text
cd memory/db-tools
python findings.py add "first-note" --text "hello" --project coding-kit
python findings.py search "first-note" --project coding-kit
cd ../..
```

Then start a **fresh agent session** and ask:

> Search my coding-kit memory for "first-note" using the memory tools.
> Show the command you ran and the stored finding.

The agent should invoke `findings.py search` or `search_all.py` against your
memory store and retrieve the note, not merely repeat this example. If it
does not, check that the rules and skill paths are loaded by your agent.

`python scripts/doctor.py` checks repository and memory consistency.
A green result is **not** proof that an agent loaded or followed the kit.

## Daily use

Run the memory tools from the clone, or use their absolute paths elsewhere:

```text
python memory/db-tools/search_all.py "deployment decision"
python memory/db-tools/search_all.py "deployment decision" --project coding-kit
python memory/db-tools/search_all.py "deployment decision" --importance high
python memory/db-tools/findings.py projects
```

Ask the agent to save a decision when it is worth carrying into another
session. Memory writes need authorization; a read-only review should not
silently modify your knowledge base.

Your knowledge lives in `~/.memory/` (or `MEMORY_ROOT`), **outside the kit
repository**. The clone contains methodology and tooling, not your personal
project history. Do not commit your memory store or assume it is a sandbox
for untrusted data. See the [security policy](SECURITY.md).

<details>
<summary>Back up and verify recovery</summary>

The store is the one asset this repository cannot rebuild (`db/*.db` are
gitignored by design). Back it up, then prove the snapshot is usable:

```text
python scripts/tools/backup_memory.py
python scripts/tools/backup_memory.py --list
python scripts/tools/backup_memory.py --restore-drill <backup directory>
```

Backups land in `<memory root>/backups/<timestamp>/`. A snapshot whose
database was skipped is tagged `DEGRADED` and refused as a restore point.
`--restore-drill` restores into a temporary root, runs `PRAGMA
integrity_check` on every restored database, verifies the findings store and
searches a token taken from the restored rows; it prints JSON and exits 0
only when that verification passes. `--restore <dir>` performs a live restore
(pre-restore snapshot first; asks unless `--yes`).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Organize findings by project and importance</summary>

Projects are discovered from the memory root's `db/*.db` files and optional
`projects.json`. Project slugs use `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}`.
Use `portable` for reusable cross-project knowledge and `unknown` for
unclassified notes.

Importance levels:

- `high`: critical boundaries, invariants, and durable release contracts.
- `normal`: actionable findings, runbooks, and feature setups.
- `low`: temporary checkpoints and scratch notes.
- `unreviewed`: findings not yet qualitatively reviewed.

Use `findings.py edit --help` to update a finding using its returned ID;
IDs are not guaranteed to start at 1. For batch classification,
`findings.py classify mapping.json --dry-run` validates a mapping before
mutation. Classification is transactional and preserves user-curated records
unless `--force` is supplied. See [findings.py](memory/db-tools/findings.py).

</details>

## Evidence and limitations

**The kit is not a demonstrated universal coding-quality improvement.**
It adds instructions and can add work. Whether that helps depends on the
model, task, and integration.

A historical external [DeepSWE](https://deepswe.datacurve.ai/) A/B run
compared the same agent with and without the kit using `deepseek-v4-pro`,
pier + mini-swe-agent in Docker, and a 10-task seed-0 subset:

| Observation | Reported result |
|---|---|
| Solved tasks in the reported nine-task comparison | **6/9 in both arms** |
| Steps across five mutually solved tasks | **+21% with the kit** |
| Prompt tokens across those five tasks | **+41%**: 99.5M vs 70.4M |
| Task-level differences | One kit win and one kit loss |

This was a small historical sample using a 36-skill manifest, not a benchmark
of the current release. Raw artifacts are retained outside this repository;
the repo does not ship a reproduction script for these numbers. The results
are descriptive, not a causal explanation or a general reliability claim.
Prompt-token counts are not a measured monetary bill.

The [4.5.1 release notes](https://github.com/oleg494/coding-kit/releases/tag/v4.5.1)
separately document policy-calibration observations and their limits. They
are stated-next-action evidence, not an end-to-end coding-quality win rate.

### Run the kit's checks

```text
python -m pip install pytest
python scripts/doctor.py
python -m pytest tests -q
python scripts/tools/check_file_sizes.py --ci
```

CI runs the [kit gates](.github/workflows/test.yml) on Windows and Ubuntu.
Structural validation can run without a model or paid API calls:

```text
python eval/runner.py --inline-skills
python eval/task_runner.py --dry-run
python eval/trigger_eval.py --queries eval/trigger_queries.json
```

These commands validate evaluation inputs; they do **not** measure a live
model's behavior.

<details>
<summary>Evaluation tools and what they measure</summary>

| Tool | Purpose and boundary |
|---|---|
| [Trap-suite](eval/runner.py) | 31 adversarial policy scenarios. The judge defaults to the executor; use a distinct judge to reduce self-judging bias. Policy adherence is not task superiority. |
| [Task smoke](eval/task_runner.py) | Six coding tasks, including two impossible canaries, with deterministic `verify.py` oracles. A smoke check, not a statistical benchmark. |
| [Trigger evals](eval/trigger_eval.py) | Skill activation routing: 92 co-located queries across 13 skills with `--queries auto`; an 80-query central corpus provides fallback coverage. |
| [Results store](eval/results_io.py) and [trend](eval/trend.py) | Structured results, explicit live/dry-run modes, failure categories, and comparisons of recorded runs. |
| [Telemetry](eval/telemetry.py) | Measures duration. Optional usage totals are user-reported, not independently measured token cost. |
| [Ablation](eval/ablate.py) | Compares prompts with and without an inlined skill. Ambient skills remain uncontrolled; results are descriptive, not causal. |
| [Rigor A/B](eval/rigor/) | Policy experiments with isolation probes and an acceptance gate that can reject a candidate. |

Live evaluations require an executor and may incur provider charges.
Prompt evaluations require `docker:<image> <argv...>`; bare host commands
are refused. The image must contain the executor. Only explicitly declared
read-only mounts are visible alongside a disposable writable task directory;
host credentials are not inherited. Network is off by default. `@net` enables
unrestricted bridge networking, not endpoint allowlisting: live-model CK-03
acceptance remains open until credential and network restrictions are verified.

</details>

## Autonomous work (opt-in)

Requests such as “do useful work” or “keep going without asking” activate
[autonomous-work](skills/autonomous-work/SKILL.md): evidence-backed work
selection, verified progress, and immediate stop/revocation. Ordinary
bounded requests do not become autonomous missions. Outward, destructive,
spending, and memory-writing actions still need authorization.

An optional foreground Python [supervisor](scripts/tools/autonomous.py)
supports continuation across process boundaries:

```text
python scripts/tools/autonomous.py --help
```

It accepts an executor and independent verifier, records resumable state,
and reports completion only after verification succeeds. A `STOP` file
prevents further spawning and interrupts a live child. Read the
[supervisor contract](docs/research/2026-09-08-autonomous-mode.md) before
configuring commands; a workspace is not a security sandbox.

### Carry unfinished work into a fresh session

Capture a task brief with `scripts/tools/handoff.py`. The brief is JSON with
`goal`, `acceptance`, `constraints`, `pending`, and `observations`. Each
observation has a `claim` and a nonempty `paths` list of workspace-relative
regular files that support it. List only files you intend to fingerprint.

```text
python scripts/tools/handoff.py capture --workspace /path/to/repo --brief brief.json --output handoff.json
python scripts/tools/handoff.py resume --workspace /path/to/repo --handoff handoff.json
```

Capture stores hashes, not file contents, and refuses to overwrite an existing
handoff. Resume is read-only: it returns the complete task context and marks
observations stale when their supporting files changed, disappeared, or became
unsafe to read. Exit codes: `0` unchanged, `1` drift, `2` invalid input. Use
`--json` on resume for structured output. Unchanged bytes are not proof that a
claim is true, that tests passed, or that an action is authorized.

Give the fresh agent the resume output and the workspace, not the previous chat.
It must inspect stale evidence and preserve current user edits before continuing.
For automatic worker launches, add `--handoff /path/to/handoff.json` to the
supervisor invocation. The supervisor refreshes this context before each worker;
the configured independent verifier remains the completion gate. Neither tool
executes commands embedded in a handoff, snapshots the whole repository, or
replaces the host's permission and sandbox controls.
