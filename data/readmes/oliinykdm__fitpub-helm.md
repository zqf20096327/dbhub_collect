## What CI checks

- `ct lint` on every change
- Render tests against default values, `examples/production-values.yaml`, and `examples/networkpolicy-smoke-values.yaml`
- Kubernetes API validation in kind with `kubectl apply --dry-run=server`
- **Kind runtime test** (the *Kind Runtime Test* badge): on every PR, every push to `main`, and once a week. Spins up kind + PostGIS, runs `helm install --wait`, waits for the pod to go Ready, and checks the authenticated actuator readiness endpoint. A second job does the same under restricted NetworkPolicy egress.
- Releases publish to GitHub Pages and the GHCR OCI registry, GPG-signed with a cosign signature, plus a GitHub Release per version

The chart is linted, rendered, and booted against a real PostGIS database in CI. That is not a substitute for production load, but it catches most regressions before release.

## Features

- Runs as the non-root FitPub user (`1001`), restricted Pod Security Standard compliant out of the box
- `readOnlyRootFilesystem` on by default, with `/tmp` and `/app/logs` backed by emptyDir
- PersistentVolumeClaim for uploads at `/app/uploads`
- Optional Secret mount for Markdown legal/about pages at `/app/pages`
- ConfigMap/Secret split for plain and secret environment variables
- Probes hit the authenticated actuator health groups (`/actuator/health/readiness` and `/actuator/health/liveness`) via an exec wget that reads the actuator password from the pod env, see [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md)
- CPU/memory limits, a PodDisruptionBudget, and a preStop drain hook on by default
- Optional Ingress, HPA, NetworkPolicy and ServiceMonitor
- Extension points for extra env, envFrom, volumes, mounts, init containers and sidecars
- Brings its own app, but not its database - you supply PostgreSQL with PostGIS

## Quick start (local)

Just want to see it run on kind/minikube/Docker Desktop without standing up a
database first? From the repo root:

```bash
scripts/local-quickstart.sh
```

It deploys a disposable PostGIS, installs the chart, waits for it to become healthy,
and prints how to reach it. The manual steps and a troubleshooting table are in
[docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md).

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.26+
- Helm 3.8+
- External PostgreSQL with PostGIS enabled. A plain PostgreSQL database is not enough.

## Installation

The chart ships two ways. Pick one.

**OCI registry (recommended).** No `helm repo add`, just point at the package:

```bash
helm install fitpub oci://ghcr.io/oliinykdm/charts/fitpub --version 0.5.1 -f production-values.yaml
```

The OCI artifact carries the GPG provenance, so you can verify it on pull:

```bash
helm pull oci://ghcr.io/oliinykdm/charts/fitpub --version 0.5.1 --verify \
  --keyring <(curl -fsSL https://oliinykdm.github.io/fitpub-helm/pgp-public-key.asc | gpg --dearmor)
```

**Classic HTTP repo (GitHub Pages).** Still published for tooling that expects it:

```bash
helm repo add fitpub https://oliinykdm.github.io/fitpub-helm
helm repo update
helm install fitpub fitpub/fitpub -f production-values.yaml
```

Either way, copy [examples/production-values.yaml](examples/production-values.yaml) and adapt it first.

Or install straight from a checkout while hacking on the chart:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oliinykdm/fitpub-helm.git
cd fitpub-helm
helm install fitpub ./charts/fitpub -f examples/production-values.yaml
```

The repository install still expects an external PostGIS database and a pre-created
Secret when using `examples/production-values.yaml`. For a working local instance
without manual wiring, use `scripts/local-quickstart.sh` instead.

## Configuration

Non-secret settings go into `config` and are rendered into a ConfigMap. Secrets go into `applicationSecret.data` or, preferably for production, into an existing Kubernetes Secret referenced by `applicationSecret.existingSecret`.

Minimum production values (use an external Secret - do not commit real credentials to Git):

```yaml
productionChecks:
  enabled: true

config:
  FITPUB_DATABASE_URL: "jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/fitpub"
  FITPUB_DOMAIN: "your-domain.com"
  # Must not end with a slash.
  FITPUB_BASE_URL: "https://your-domain.com"
  FITPUB_PUSH_ENABLED: "false"
  # When enabling mail, set FITPUB_MAIL_HOST together with port/auth/starttls - see production-values.yaml.
  FITPUB_MAIL_HOST: "smtp.example.com"
  FITPUB_MAIL_PORT: "587"
  FITPUB_MAIL_SMTP_AUTH: "true"
  FITPUB_MAIL_STARTTLS_ENABLE: "true"
  FITPUB_MAIL_STARTTLS_REQUIRED: "true"

applicationSecret:
  existingSecret: fitpub-secret
```

Create the Secret before install (inline `applicationSecret.data` is for controlled testing only - see [examples/chart-managed-secret-values.yaml](examples/chart-managed-secret-values.yaml)):

```bash
kubectl create secret generic fitpub-secret -n fitpub \
  --from-literal=FITPUB_DATABASE_USERNAME=fitpub \
  --from-literal=FITPUB_DATABASE_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
  --from-literal=FITPUB_JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 64)" \
  --from-literal=FITPUB_EMAIL_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 64)" \
  --from-literal=FITPUB_ACTUATOR_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -base64 48)" \
  --from-literal=FITPUB_MAIL_USERNAME="smtp-user" \
  --from-literal=FITPUB_MAIL_PASSWORD="smtp-password"
```

`FITPUB_ACTUATOR_PASSWORD` is required on FitPub 1.2.0: actuator endpoints are behind basic auth and the prod profile has no default password, so the pod will not start without it.

The mail user/password are only there because the example sets `FITPUB_MAIL_SMTP_AUTH: "true"`.

`productionChecks.enabled=true` fails the render early when a required public setting, a chart-managed secret, or part of the push-notification config is missing, instead of surfacing later as a CrashLoopBackOff.

`config` only carries the keys the chart sets a value for. FitPub reads many more (Hikari pool, ActivityPub inbox tuning, mail, `FITPUB_OSM_TILES_ENABLED`, `FITPUB_WEATHER_ENABLED`, log rotation) and applies its own defaults. Set any of those by adding the key to `config` or via `extraEnv`; the full list lives in the FitPub source's `application-prod.yml`.

See [values.yaml](charts/fitpub/values.yaml) and [examples/production-values.yaml](examples/production-values.yaml) for available options.

Additional examples:

- [examples/production-values.yaml](examples/production-values.yaml): production-style values with an externally managed Secret
- [examples/chart-managed-secret-values.yaml](examples/chart-managed-secret-values.yaml): controlled testing values where Helm creates the Secret
- [examples/development-values.yaml](examples/development-values.yaml): development-style values for throwaway clusters
- [examples/runtime-smoke-values.yaml](examples/runtime-smoke-values.yaml): CI-only values used by the runtime smoke test
- [examples/networkpolicy-smoke-values.yaml](examples/networkpolicy-smoke-values.yaml): CI-only values for restricted NetworkPolicy egress

## Extending The Pod

The chart exposes common extension points without editing templates:

```yaml
extraEnv:
  - name: JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS
    value: "-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=70"

extraEnvFrom: []
extraInitContainers: []
sidecars: []
volumes: []
volumeMounts: []
nodeSelector: {}
tolerations: []
affinity: {}
topologySpreadConstraints: []
```

Use these for platform integrations such as sidecar agents, projected Secrets, custom CA bundles or cluster scheduling rules.

## Ingress

Enable Ingress when exposing FitPub publicly:

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: traefik
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
  hosts:
    - host: fitpub.example.com
      paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: Prefix
  tls:
    - secretName: fitpub-tls
      hosts:
        - fitpub.example.com
```

Set `className` to the ingress controller used by your cluster. The example uses Traefik as a common self-hosted default.

FitPub's production profile enables `server.forward-headers-strategy: framework` and reads `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` from your ingress or reverse proxy. Configure the controller to pass those headers on HTTPS termination so generated URLs, redirects and ActivityPub endpoints use the correct public scheme.

## Markdown Pages

FitPub can read Markdown pages from `/app/pages`. To provide Kubernetes-native legal pages, create a Secret from files and mount it:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic fitpub-pages \
  --from-file=terms.md \
  --from-file=imprint.md \
  --from-file=about.md
```

```yaml
pages:
  existingSecret: fitpub-pages
```

Secret updates do not automatically restart the pod. Restart the Deployment if the application does not pick up changed files.

## Persistence

By default, the chart creates a `PersistentVolumeClaim` for user uploads at `/app/uploads`.

You can customize storage size and class:

```yaml
persistence:
  enabled: true
  storageClass: ""
  size: 10Gi
```

You can also reuse an existing claim:

```yaml
persistence:
  enabled: true
  existingClaim: fitpub-uploads
```

Back up the uploads PVC and the external PostGIS database regularly. It's important!

## Application Logs

In the `prod` profile FitPub writes rotated file logs to `/app/logs/`. The chart
mounts that path as an emptyDir, so the read-only root filesystem is preserved and
logs survive container restarts - but not pod rescheduling, since emptyDir is tied
to the pod lifecycle.

For anything you want to keep, lean on your cluster log collector (stdout carries
the same lines) or ship `/app/logs` with a sidecar. To grow or shrink the buffer:

```yaml
ephemeralVolumes:
  logs:
    sizeLimit: 512Mi
```

## Replicas And Scaling

Default is `replicaCount: 1` with a `Recreate` strategy. Not because the app falls
over with more pods - the background schedulers claim work with row locks and the
cleanups are idempotent, so they are safe to run concurrently. The real blocker is
the uploads volume: `ReadWriteOnce` can only mount on one pod at a time.

To scale out, give uploads a `ReadWriteMany` storage class and then enable
`autoscaling`. The chart refuses `replicaCount > 1` on RWO storage, so the
misconfiguration fails at install time rather than at runtime.

## Memory And JVM

The image runs Java 25 with `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75` against the cgroup memory
**limit**. The chart pins request and limit to the same value so the scheduler
reserves enough for heap plus native overhead, and adds a CPU limit to keep GC and
Flyway bursts from stealing a whole core:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 250m
    memory: 3072Mi
  limits:
    cpu: 1500m
    memory: 3072Mi
```

OOMKilled pods or sluggish Flyway on tiny nodes? Raise `resources.limits.memory`
or hand the JVM a smaller slice:

```yaml
extraEnv:
  - name: JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS
    value: "-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=60"
```

## NetworkPolicy

Off by default. FitPub needs egress to PostgreSQL, SMTP and a long tail of
federated/external HTTP hosts, so a half-configured policy mostly just breaks
things. Turn it on once you are ready to list those dependencies.

Two things worth knowing before you enable it:

- It assumes a conntrack-stateful engine (Calico, Cilium, etc.). A non-stateful
  one can drop reply traffic such as DNS answers.
- Some enforcers restrict DNS even under an allow-all egress rule. kindnet (recent
  builds) drops UDP 53 to the cluster DNS this way, which surfaces as
  `UnknownHostException` on the database host. If DNS breaks, allow it explicitly -
  to kube-system on UDP/TCP 53 - and confirm egress works on your CNI first.

Keep `networkPolicy.ingress.enabled=true` unless you add
`networkPolicy.ingress.extraRules`. Turning ingress off with no rules locks
everyone out, FitPub included.

Example shape for restricted egress:

```yaml
networkPolicy:
  enabled: true
  egress:
    allowAll: false
    extraRules:
      - to:
          - namespaceSelector:
              matchLabels:
                kubernetes.io/metadata.name: database
        ports:
          - protocol: TCP
            port: 5432
      - to:
          - namespaceSelector:
              matchLabels:
                kubernetes.io/metadata.name: kube-system
            podSelector:
              matchLabels:
                k8s-app: kube-dns
        ports:
          - protocol: UDP
            port: 53
          - protocol: TCP
            port: 53
      # ClusterIP DNS (some CNIs match policy before DNAT) - UDP and TCP 53.
      - to:
          - ipBlock:
              cidr: 10.96.0.0/12
        ports:
          - protocol: UDP
            port: 53
          - protocol: TCP
            port: 53
      # SMTP to your mail relay (restrict `to:` in production).
      - ports:
          - protocol: TCP
            port: 587
      # HTTPS for federation.
      - ports:
          - protocol: TCP
            port: 443
```

Adjust this to your actual PostgreSQL, DNS, SMTP, HTTPS federation and peer egress model.

## Graceful Shutdown

Kubernetes sends `SIGTERM` and yanks the pod from endpoints at the same moment, which
can leave a few in-flight requests hitting a dying pod. The chart already ships a
5-second `preStop` sleep to cover that window. Bump it if your ingress drains slowly:

```yaml
lifecycleHooks:
  preStop:
    exec:
      command: ["sh", "-c", "sleep 10"]
```

Scheduling knobs (`priorityClassName`, `nodeSelector`, `tolerations`, `affinity`, `topologySpreadConstraints`) pass straight through - see `values.yaml`.

## Debugging

Enable `diagnosticMode` to run the container as `sleep infinity` so you can exec in without startup or probe failures blocking access:

```bash
helm upgrade fitpub fitpub/fitpub \
  --reuse-values \
  --set diagnosticMode.enabled=true

kubectl exec -it deployment/fitpub -n fitpub -- sh
```

Disable it again when done:

```bash
helm upgrade fitpub fitpub/fitpub \
  --reuse-values \
  --set diagnosticMode.enabled=false
```

## Global Labels And Annotations

Add labels and annotations to every resource created by this chart:

```yaml
commonLabels:
  environment: production
  team: platform

commonAnnotations:
  reloader.stakater.com/auto: "true"
```

## Monitoring

Running Prometheus Operator? There is a `ServiceMonitor`. FitPub **1.2.0** ships
`micrometer-registry-prometheus` and serves the exposition format at
`/actuator/prometheus`, so scraping works - but every actuator endpoint is behind
HTTP basic auth, so you must supply credentials. Create a Secret in the
ServiceMonitor namespace and reference it via `serviceMonitor.basicAuth`:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic fitpub-actuator-auth \
  --from-literal=username=actuator \
  --from-literal=password="$FITPUB_ACTUATOR_PASSWORD"
```

```yaml
serviceMonitor:
  enabled: true
  labels:
    release: kube-prometheus-stack
  basicAuth:
    username:
      name: fitpub-actuator-auth
      key: username
    password:
      name: fitpub-actuator-auth
      key: password
```

Without `basicAuth`, scrapes return HTTP 401 and the target stays empty. More in
[docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md).

## Security Notes

The chart drops all Linux capabilities, disables privilege escalation, runs as
UID/GID `1001`, and mounts the root filesystem read-only. FitPub still needs to
write uploads, logs and temp files, so those paths get their own mounts: the
uploads PVC, plus emptyDir for `/tmp` and `/app/logs`. Everything else is locked.

### Pod Security Standards (`restricted`)

It passes `restricted` as shipped, no extra knobs required. The `volume-permissions`
init container is the one thing that would break it - it runs as root to chown the
uploads volume - so it is **off by default**. `fsGroup` handles ownership without it.

Only turn it back on for storage that ignores `fsGroup` (some NFS or hostPath setups):

```yaml
initContainers:
  volumePermissions:
    enabled: true
```

## Upgrade

Use the same adapted values file you installed with (commonly copied from
[examples/production-values.yaml](examples/production-values.yaml)):

```bash
helm upgrade fitpub fitpub/fitpub -f production-values.yaml
```

When changing ConfigMap or chart-managed Secret values, the Deployment rolls automatically because checksum annotations are included on the pod template.

Read [docs/upgrade-notes.md](docs/upgrade-notes.md) before upgrading across chart minor versions.

## Design Notes

This chart intentionally uses an external PostGIS database, a `Deployment` with a dedicated uploads PVC and a single-replica default. See [docs/design.md](docs/design.md) for the reasoning and current CI guarantees.

## GitOps

Flux and Argo CD examples are available in [docs/gitops.md](docs/gitops.md). Production GitOps setups should manage secrets through SOPS, External Secrets Operator, Sealed Secrets or a similar workflow.

## Troubleshooting

See [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md) for common Kubernetes deployment problems: PostGIS issues, missing secrets, failing health probes, PVC permissions and federation URL mistakes.

## Production Checklist

A condensed version of the sections above:

- PostgreSQL **with PostGIS**, not plain PostgreSQL
- `productionChecks.enabled=true` so bad values fail at install rather than at runtime
- Strong `FITPUB_DATABASE_PASSWORD`, `FITPUB_JWT_SECRET`, `FITPUB_EMAIL_SECRET`, `FITPUB_ACTUATOR_PASSWORD` (generate with `openssl rand -base64 48`)
- `FITPUB_ACTUATOR_PASSWORD` is **required** on FitPub 1.2.0 - the pod CrashLoops without it
- Using `applicationSecret.existingSecret`? Confirm it has every required key before install - the chart cannot inspect its contents
- `FITPUB_BASE_URL` public, canonical, no trailing slash
- FitPub behind HTTPS
- Back up PostgreSQL and `/app/uploads` (the parts you cannot regenerate)
- Ship `/app/logs` somewhere if you want history - emptyDir does not survive rescheduling
- `FITPUB_PUSH_ENABLED=false` unless VAPID keys and `FITPUB_VAPID_SUBJECT` are set
- Scraping metrics? Set `serviceMonitor.basicAuth` against the actuator credentials - `/actuator/prometheus` is behind basic auth on 1.2.0
- Want more than one replica? Switch uploads to `ReadWriteMany` first

This chart grew out of the Kubernetes manifests discussion in [FitPub issue #301](https://codeberg.org/fitpub/fitpub/issues/301).
