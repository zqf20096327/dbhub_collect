# Burrow

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Burrow is archived and no longer maintained.** It was a fun ride, but I've decided to build my projects on Elixir and Python instead. The code stays available under its existing license, but there will be no further development, releases, or support. Thanks to everyone who followed along.

A web framework for Go developers who want something like Django, Rails, or Flask — but with the deployment simplicity of a single static binary.

Most Go web development follows the "API backend + SPA frontend" pattern. Burrow takes a different approach: server-rendered HTML with templates, modular apps with their own routes and middleware, and a document database that just works. Deploy with embedded SQLite as a single binary, or connect to PostgreSQL for scale — same code, same API.

Built on [Chi](https://go-chi.io/), [Den](https://github.com/oliverandrich/den) (ODM with SQLite and PostgreSQL backends), and Go's standard `html/template`. Ideal for self-hosted applications, internal tools, or any project where "download, start, use" is the goal.

> [!TIP]
> **Why *Burrow*?** A burrow is a network of interconnected chambers — each with its own purpose, yet part of a larger whole. That's exactly how the framework works: pluggable apps are the rooms, and your gophers live in them.

> [!NOTE]
> Burrow is designed for server-rendered web applications, not API-only services. If you're building a JSON API with a separate frontend, a lighter router like Chi on its own is probably a better fit.

## Features

- **App-based architecture** — build your application from composable, self-contained apps
- **SQLite or PostgreSQL** — embedded SQLite (pure Go, no CGO) for single-binary deploys, or PostgreSQL for scale — switch with one flag
- **Automatic schema** — document types declared in code, tables and indexes created on startup
- **Standard templates** — Go's `html/template` with a global template set, per-app FuncMaps, and automatic layout wrapping
- **Tailwind v4 by default** — `contrib/admin`, `contrib/auth`, and `contrib/jobs` ship Tailwind v4 templates out of the box, and the bundled [`burrow tailwind`](docs/guide/tailwind.md) sub-command auto-discovers every contrib's template directory so utility scanning Just Works. Prefer a different stack? Bring your own CSS and override the contrib templates via `html/template`'s last-define-wins — Burrow's core itself ships no CSS.
- **Layout system** — app layout via server, admin layout via admin package
- **CLI configuration** — flags, environment variables, and TOML config via [urfave/cli](https://github.com/urfave/cli)
- **CSRF protection** — automatic token generation and validation
- **Flash messages** — session-based flash message system
- **htmx-first interactivity** — `contrib/htmx` ships the vendored JS plus response helpers (`OpenDialog`, `SmartRedirect`, etc.) so SSR pages get partial swaps and modals without a JS framework. Dark mode follows `prefers-color-scheme`.
- **Contrib apps** — auth (WebAuthn/passkeys), sessions, i18n, admin, CSRF, flash messages, jobs, uploads, rate limiting, healthcheck, static files, API docs (Scalar)

## Quick Start

The fastest path is the bundled `burrow` CLI, which scaffolds a project with the contrib stack, Tailwind v4, live reload, CI, and goreleaser config already wired:

```bash
go install github.com/oliverandrich/burrow/cmd/burrow@latest
burrow new myapp --module github.com/you/myapp
cd myapp && mise run setup && mise run dev
```

Without `mise`, the scaffold prints a `go mod tidy && go run ./cmd/myapp` fallback.

Or build from scratch:

```bash
mkdir myapp && cd myapp
go mod init myapp
go get github.com/oliverandrich/burrow@latest
```

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "os"

    "github.com/oliverandrich/burrow"
    "github.com/go-chi/chi/v5"
    "github.com/urfave/cli/v3"
)

// homeApp is a minimal app with a single route.
type homeApp struct{}

func (a *homeApp) Name() string { return "home" }
func (a *homeApp) Routes(r chi.Router) {
    r.Method("GET", "/", burrow.Handle(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) error {
        return burrow.Text(w, http.StatusOK, "Hello from Burrow!")
    }))
}

func main() {
    srv := burrow.NewServer(
        &homeApp{},
    )

    cmd := &cli.Command{
        Name:   "myapp",
        Flags:  srv.Flags(nil),
        Action: srv.Run,
    }

    if err := cmd.Run(context.Background(), os.Args); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
```

```bash
go mod tidy
go run .
```

See [`example/hello/`](example/hello/) for a minimal hello world app, or [`example/notes/`](example/notes/) for a complete example with auth, admin, i18n, and more.

## Architecture

```
contrib/        Reusable apps
  admin/        Admin panel coordinator (top-nav layout, dashboard cards, route mounting)
  apidocs/      Vendored Scalar OpenAPI documentation UI
  auth/         WebAuthn passkeys, recovery codes, email verification
  authmail/     Pluggable email renderer + SMTP implementation
  csrf/         CSRF protection
  healthcheck/  Liveness and readiness probes
  htmx/         htmx static asset + request/response helpers
  i18n/         Locale detection and translations
  jobs/         Den-backed background job queue (SQLite + Postgres)
  messages/     Flash messages
  ratelimit/    Per-client rate limiting
  session/      Cookie-based sessions
  staticfiles/  Static file serving with content-hashed URLs
  uploads/      File upload storage and serving
example/        Example applications (hello world, notes app)
```

### The App Interface

Every app implements `burrow.App`:

```go
type App interface {
    Name() string
}
```

Apps can optionally implement additional interfaces:

| Interface | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `HasDocuments` | Register Den document types |
| `HasRoutes` | Register HTTP routes |
| `HasMiddleware` | Contribute middleware |
| `HasNavItems` | Contribute navigation items |
| `HasTemplates` | Contribute `.html` template files |
| `HasFuncMap` | Contribute static template functions |
| `HasRequestFuncMap` | Contribute request-scoped template functions |
| `Configurable` | Define CLI flags and read configuration |
| `HasCLICommands` | Contribute CLI subcommands |
| `Seedable` | Seed the database with initial data |
| `HasAdmin` | Contribute admin panel routes and nav items |
| `HasStaticFiles` | Contribute embedded static file assets |
| `HasTranslations` | Contribute translation files |
| `HasDependencies` | Declare required apps |
| `HasJobs` | Register background job handlers |
| `PostConfigurable` | Second-pass configuration after all apps are configured |
| `HasShutdown` | Clean up on graceful shutdown |

### Layouts

Layouts are template name strings. The app layout wraps user-facing pages:

```go
srv.SetLayout("myapp/layout")
```

The admin layout is owned by the admin package:

```go
admin.New(admin.WithLayout("custom/admin-layout"))
```

`RenderTemplate` renders page content, then wraps it in the layout template with `.Content` set to the rendered fragment. Layout templates access dynamic data via template functions:

```html
{{ range navLinks }}...{{ end }}  {{/* filtered nav with active state */}}
{{ if currentUser }}...{{ end }}  {{/* authenticated user */}}
{{ csrfToken }}                   {{/* CSRF token for forms */}}
```

### Configuration

Configuration is resolved in order: CLI flags > environment variables > TOML file.

Core flags include `--host`, `--port`, `--database-dsn`, `--log-level`, `--log-format`, `--tls-mode`, and more. Apps can contribute their own flags via the `Configurable` interface.

### Document Registration

Apps declare their document types by implementing `HasDocuments`:

```go
func (a *App) Documents() []document.Document {
    return []document.Document{&Poll{}, &Choice{}}
}
```

Tables and indexes are created automatically on startup via Den's `Register()`. No SQL migration files needed.

## Development

Burrow uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) for tool-version pinning and task running. After cloning:

```bash
mise install              # Install pinned Go + dev tools
mise run setup            # Verify the environment + install pre-commit git hooks
```

Common tasks:

```bash
mise run test             # Run all tests
mise run lint             # Run golangci-lint
mise run fmt              # Format code
mise run coverage         # Generate coverage report
mise run tidy             # Tidy module dependencies
mise run example-hello    # Run the hello world example
mise run example-notes    # Run the notes example application
mise tasks                # List every available task
```
