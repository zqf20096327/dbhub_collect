## What It Is

Openbill Core implements financial accounting directly in PostgreSQL.

- Ledger operations are plain SQL (`INSERT`/`SELECT`)
- Validation and correctness are enforced via constraints, functions, and triggers
- No mandatory API layer in the core
- Battle-tested in production for 10+ years, with tens of billions of dollars processed through this accounting core
- Financial architecture: categories model a chart of accounts (including hierarchical taxonomy at domain level), and policies enforce strict transfer routes between categories/accounts

## Core Concepts

1. **Ledger in PostgreSQL**: transfers are written and validated in SQL.
2. **Invariants in the database**: correctness rules live with data.
3. **Minimal infrastructure**: fewer moving parts and failure points.

## Dependencies

Only one dependency:

- PostgreSQL 13+

Nothing else is required for the core: no separate API service, SDK, or extra runtime.

### Why not the `money` type?

PostgreSQL has a built-in `money` type, but Openbill uses `numeric(36,18)` instead because `money` is locale-dependent (`lc_monetary`), has no currency field, and loses precision on division. `numeric` is locale-safe, supports arbitrary precision, and is the standard choice for ledger systems.

## Advantages

- Language-agnostic integration for any stack with SQL access.
- Deterministic behavior: checks run at the same consistency boundary as writes.
- Transparent traceability through ledger tables.
- Applications connect directly to PostgreSQL where the core is implemented, without a separate API layer, which reduces integration overhead and support costs.

## Invariants

All rules are enforced at the PostgreSQL level (constraints, triggers, GRANT). No client application can bypass them.

1. **System balance is always zero.** The sum of all funds across all accounts, including held amounts, is always zero. Money cannot appear from nowhere or disappear.
2. **Transfers are single-currency only.** The transfer currency must match the currency of both the source and destination accounts.
3. **Transfers are only between different accounts.** You cannot transfer funds from an account to itself.
4. **Transfer amount is always positive.** The direction of fund movement is determined by the source/destination pair, not by the sign of the amount.
5. **Account type restricts balance sign.** A "positive" account cannot go negative; a "negative" account cannot go positive.
6. **A locked account cannot be a transfer source.** If an account is locked, debiting from it is impossible.
7. **Every operation is idempotent.** A duplicate transfer or hold with the same idempotency key is rejected.
8. **Every transfer must match a policy.** If no policy permits the given transfer direction, the operation is rejected.
9. **Reversals must match the original exactly.** A reverse transaction must have the same amount, currency, and account pair (in the opposite direction) as the original.
10. **You cannot hold more than the account balance.** Likewise, you cannot release more than what is held.
11. **Account balance changes only through operations.** Direct balance modification is impossible — it is recalculated only as a result of transfers or holds.
12. **An account cannot be deleted while referenced by operations.** As long as related transfers or holds exist, account deletion is forbidden.

Practical integrity guarantees:

- Openbill is multi-currency: balances and invariants are tracked per `currency`.
- To get an account balance, read `openbill_accounts.balance`; no transfer replay is needed.
- The sum of balances across all accounts (per currency) is always `0`.
- This makes money creation from nowhere impossible and prevents unnoticed balance injections.

## Quick Start (Project Users)

Initialize the test database:

```shell
./tests/create.sh
```

Minimal scenario:

```sql
-- 1) Create two accounts
INSERT INTO openbill_accounts (id, category_id, details) VALUES (1, -1, 'Bob');
INSERT INTO openbill_accounts (id, category_id, details) VALUES (2, -1, 'Nikolas');

-- 2) Check balances before transfer
SELECT details, balance, currency FROM openbill_accounts;
-- details | balance | currency
-- --------+--------------+----------------
-- Bob     |         0.00 | USD
-- Nikolas |         0.00 | USD

-- 3) Register a transfer
INSERT INTO openbill_transfers (from_account_id, to_account_id, amount, currency, idempotency_key, details)
VALUES (2, 1, 500, 'USD', 'payment:demo:1', 'Demo payment');
-- Automatic processing: process_account_transfer debits 500 USD from Nikolas and credits 500 USD to Bob (double-entry).

-- 4) Check balances after transfer
SELECT details, balance, currency FROM openbill_accounts;
-- details | balance | currency
-- --------+--------------+----------------
-- Bob     |       500.00 | USD
-- Nikolas |      -500.00 | USD

-- 5) Verify integrity (sum of all balances is zero)
SELECT SUM(balance) FROM openbill_accounts;
-- sum
-- ------
--  0.00
-- Integrity check: 0.00 confirms money cannot appear or disappear.
```

## Benchmark

Test setup: PostgreSQL 17.4, `16 clients`, `4 threads`, warmup `5s`, measure `15s`.
Benchmark server: Linux 6.8, Intel Core i7-2600K (8 vCPU), 31 GiB RAM.

| Scenario | Meaning | TPS |
|---|---|---:|
| Mass transactions | Random transfers across a pool of 200 accounts (closest to high-volume traffic) | 2074 |
| Balance hold/unhold flow | Complex flow: `transfer -> hold -> transfer -> unhold -> transfer` | 68 |
| Contention stress | Transfers only between two hot accounts under high concurrency | 339 |

Invariant check after benchmark:
`sum(balance) + sum(hold_amount) = 0.000000000000000000`
