`slacrawl` mirrors Slack workspace data into local SQLite for full-text search, terminal browsing, reporting, and read-only SQL. It is for people who want a queryable Slack archive that stays under their control.

## Install

Homebrew is the shortest path on macOS or Linux:

```sh
brew install openclaw/tap/slacrawl
```

The tap can trail the newest release. [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/openclaw/slacrawl/releases/latest) provides signed and notarized macOS archives, Linux archives, and Debian/RPM packages for AMD64 and ARM64.

To build the latest source, install Go 1.27.0 or newer, then run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/openclaw/slacrawl.git
cd slacrawl
make build
./bin/slacrawl --help
```

The repository also includes a [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) for container builds.

## Quick start

Set `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, or `SLACK_USER_TOKEN` for user-only API sync, to a token that can read the workspace. Then replace the example workspace and channel IDs:

```sh
slacrawl init --workspace T01234567
slacrawl doctor
slacrawl sync --source bot --channels C01234567
slacrawl search "incident"
slacrawl tui
```

`init` writes `~/.slacrawl/config.toml`; database-backed commands use `~/.slacrawl/slacrawl.db` by default. A configured bot takes precedence; failed bot authentication never falls back to the user token. Without a bot, the user owns discovery, profiles and history. Slacrawl uses the user token for historical replies and optional DMs. Live Socket Mode tailing still requires both bot and app tokens.

Already have a Slack export? Import its ZIP or extracted directory instead of syncing from the API:

```sh
slacrawl import ~/Downloads/slack-export.zip --workspace T01234567
```

Set `[sync].include_dms = false` in the selected config to exclude DM and group-DM
conversations from workspace JSON export imports. Unqualified types or ambiguous
conversation ownership stop the import. Omitted/true retain DM inclusion.
Dry-run checks the export without initializing or repairing the archive.
See [Slack export admission](docs/configuration.md#slack-export-admission) for
supported formats, file-change detection, and privacy limits.

## Choose an ingestion source

Every source feeds the same SQLite archive and search index.

| Source | Command | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Slack API | `slacrawl sync --source bot` | Token-backed channel history, users, threads, and incremental refreshes |
| Slack Desktop | `slacrawl sync --source wiretap` | Read-only recovery from local macOS or Linux desktop caches |
| MCP connector | `slacrawl sync --source mcp --workspace T01234567` | Connector-backed history without a direct Slack API integration |
| External provider | `slacrawl sync --source provider:archive --workspace T01234567` | A trusted local JSONL adapter for another archive |
| Slack export | `slacrawl import <path> --workspace T01234567` | ZIP or directory exports |

Treat one config and database as one visibility boundary. Keep personal and company archives in separate configs, database paths, and share remotes. See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) for tokens, multiple workspaces, MCP, external providers, media caching, and source precedence; see [Desktop mode](docs/desktop-mode.md) for local-cache coverage and limitations.

Ordinary API sync also revisits retained thread roots, keeping unfinished replies
work across restarts and token changes. Explicit `--since` and Tail repair leave
that backlog alone. See [Retained API threads](docs/configuration.md#retained-api-threads)
for scope and partial-coverage behavior.

External provider v1 sync rejects `[sync].include_dms = false` before reading its
checkpoint or launching the adapter. Use API sync or a supported Slack workspace
JSON export when excluding DMs. Omitted/true retain provider intake behavior.

Ordinary MCP sync also preserves unfinished replies across history overwrites
and restarts. Explicit `--since`, including `--full --since`, reads only threads
whose roots are returned in history, including roots identified by archived
children, and leaves older pending work alone. See
[Retained MCP threads](docs/configuration.md#retained-mcp-threads) for missing
thread tools, cancellation and partial-coverage behavior.

Native MCP history/replies responses that report more pages or Slack history/message limits
retain valid fetched writes but stop with an error before advancing successful
sync state. See [native response coverage](docs/configuration.md#native-response-coverage).

Desktop recovery includes unsent drafts by default. Set
`[slack.desktop].include_drafts = false` to exclude future draft ingestion;
drafts already archived remain unchanged. Set `[sync].include_dms = false` to
also exclude future desktop DM intake; unclassified cache records are omitted
and reported. See [Desktop admission limits](docs/desktop-mode.md#excluding-direct-messages).

## Explore the archive

Search uses SQLite FTS5 with a substring fallback. The same archive is available through the TUI, structured commands, and read-only SQL:

```sh
slacrawl report
slacrawl messages --limit 20
slacrawl sql 'select channel_id, count(*) from messages group by channel_id;'
slacrawl --json status
```

Use `--format text`, `--format json`, or `--format log` on commands that support structured output. Color turns off when stdout is not a TTY; `--no-color` and `NO_COLOR=1` force plain output.

## Keep it current

Run an incremental API refresh after the first sync:

```sh
slacrawl sync --source bot
```

Use `--latest-only` to update only channels that already have local history, `tail` for Socket Mode events, or `watch` for recurring desktop-cache refreshes. Ordinary incremental sync preserves retention cutoffs; `--full`, an older explicit `--since`, desktop ingestion, or imports can deliberately restore older records.

API sync retains valid fetched pages but reports an error when Slack still signals more results without a continuation cursor, or reports a history/message limit. The attempted interval stays pending instead of advancing successful coverage. See [API history completeness](docs/configuration.md#api-history-completeness).

## Share an archive

One machine can publish compressed, git-backed snapshots while other machines subscribe and query locally without Slack credentials. Routine updates merge safely and preserve destination-only rows; exact replacement requires `update --restore`.

See [Git archive sharing](docs/git-archive-sharing.md) for publisher and subscriber setup, snapshot tags, media behavior, and restore semantics.

## Retention

`purge` previews its effect unless `--force` is supplied:

```sh
slacrawl purge --older-than 90d
slacrawl purge --older-than 90d --force --vacuum
```

Threads are retained or removed as a unit based on the parent timestamp. See [Retention purge](docs/retention.md) for workspace scoping, message-event compaction, cached media, and git-backed archive behavior.

## Commands

| Area | Commands |
| --- | --- |

| Ingest and refresh | `sync`, `import`, `tail`, `watch`, `files` |
| Browse and query | `search`, `tui`, `messages`, `mentions`, `users`, `channels`, `sql` |
| Reports | `report`, `digest`, `analytics` |

The [command reference](docs/commands.md) describes every command, output modes, shell completion, and common workflows. `slacrawl <command> --help` is the authoritative flag reference.

## Development

```sh
make build
make test
make check
```

`make check` runs the local CI gates, including formatting, vet, vulnerability and dead-code checks, tests, CLI smoke tests, and a release snapshot. Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) before changing behavior and [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) for the implementation contract.
