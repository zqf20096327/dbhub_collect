## Database Schema (High Level)

### Complete Database Diagram

View the complete, interactive database schema diagram here:

**[AlumX Database Diagram - Interactive View](https://dbdiagram.io/d/database-diagram-695381be39fa3db27bcae256)**

The diagram includes:
- **9 main entities**: User, Chat, Message, GroupChat, Participant, GroupMessage, JobPost, JobPostComment, JobPostLike, Resume
- **12 user profile collection tables**: skills, education, tech_stack, languages, frameworks, communication_skills, certifications, projects, soft_skills, hobbies, experience, internships
- **All relationships** properly mapped with foreign keys and cardinality (1:1, 1:N, N:M)
- **Indexes and constraints** as defined in the codebase

### Database Tables Overview

The AlumX backend uses the following main entity groups:

1. **User Management** - Core user profiles with role-based access (Student, Alumni, Professor)
2. **Chat System** - One-on-one messaging between users
3. **Group Chat** - Multi-user group conversations with participants
4. **Job Posts** - Alumni experience sharing with engagement features (likes, comments)
5. **Resume System** - AI-assisted resume management for users

All tables follow proper normalization principles and include appropriate indexes for optimal query performance.

## 🛠️ Project Setup
This project uses **Spring Boot + PostgreSQL** and reads configuration from **environment variables** to keep secrets out of the codebase.

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opencodeiiita/alum-x-backend.git
cd alum-x-backend
```

---

### 2️⃣ Set up PostgreSQL locally

Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your system.

#### Create database and user

Login to PostgreSQL as `postgres`:

```bash
psql -U postgres
```

Then run:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE alumx;
CREATE USER alumx WITH PASSWORD 'alumx123';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE alumx TO alumx;
```

Exit PostgreSQL:

```sql
\q
```

---

### 3️⃣ Configure environment variables

The .env file you will need, will be provided to you by the mentor

> ⚠️ **Do not commit `.env`** — it is ignored via `.gitignore`.
---

### 4️⃣ IntelliJ Configuration

Spring Boot does **not** automatically load `.env` files in IntelliJ.

#### Steps:

1. Go to **Run → Edit Configurations**
2. Select your Spring Boot run configuration
3. Under **Environment variables**, click **Load from file**
4. Select the `.env` file
5. Apply and close

---

### 5️⃣ Build and run the backend

```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
