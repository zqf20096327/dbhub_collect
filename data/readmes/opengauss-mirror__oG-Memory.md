### ContextEngine: Context Lifecycle Engine <br> for CLI Agents

Across every phase of the Agent loop, manage what goes **in**, what **stays**, what gets **evicted**, and what can be **recalled**.
Seven context types. Three-level cache hierarchy. One virtual filesystem.
Cut token cost. Preserve signal density. Survive session boundaries.

## The Problem: Token Budget is the Bottleneck

Every CLI Agent runs on a **fixed token budget**. The context window is both the most expensive and the most scarce resource.

| Symptom | Root Cause | Missing Lifecycle Stage |
| -------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| Agent forgets earlier conversation | Context window fills up, old content is evicted with no persistence | ④ **afterTurn** — no extraction + persist mechanism |
| Same mistakes repeated across sessions | No mechanism to carry lessons from one session to the next | ⑥ **session_end** — no archival + ② **bootstrap** — no cold-start injection |
| A query that should cost $0.05 costs $0.50 | Flat retrieval loads entire documents when an abstract would suffice | ② **assemble** — no L0/L1/L2 hierarchical retrieval |
| Multi-agent coordination failures | Agents cannot see each other's working context | ④ **afterTurn** — no cross-session sharing + multi-tenant isolation |
| Context bloat in long sessions | No systematic compression — the Agent drowns in its own history | ⑤ **compact** — no signal scoring + summary chain |

This isn't a model problem. It's an **infrastructure problem**.

ContextEngine provides the missing infrastructure: a full-stack context lifecycle management system that intercepts the Agent loop at six defined stages, treating the context window as a **managed resource** — not an unbounded buffer.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Insight: Context Has a Lifecycle

Current RAG systems treat retrieval as a single operation — embed a query, search a vector store, return results. This misses the fundamental reality: **context in an Agent system has a complete lifecycle**, just like data in a database.

```
  Born          Structured       Stored           Indexed          Recalled        Compressed       Archived
  (extracted    (categorized     (written         (embedded +      (vector         (summarized,     (session end,
   from          by type,        atomically       upserted         search,         deduplicated,    archived,
   conversation) routed by       with ordering    to L0/L1/L2      hierarchical    compressed)      checkpointed)
                  policy)         guarantees)      IndexRecords)    expansion)
```

Each phase has different constraints. Extraction must be incremental (don't reprocess old messages). Storage must be atomic (incomplete writes are detectable). Indexing must be asynchronous (don't block the Agent's response). Retrieval must be budget-aware (load only what fits). Compression must preserve signal (protect important context).

A system that handles only one or two of these phases — say, just retrieval — leaves the rest to chance. ContextEngine covers the full lifecycle.

### The Six Interception Points

The Agent loop isn't a black box. It has well-defined execution phases. Each phase presents a different opportunity to read, write, or transform context.

  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The key design choice: **intercept at the loop boundary, not inside model inference.** Stages ①–⑥ are all outside the LLM call. This means zero latency impact on model inference itself — all context operations happen before or after, never during.

### Not All Context Is Equal

Seven types of context, each with fundamentally different lifecycle behavior. This isn't arbitrary categorization — it's driven by the semantics of the information itself.

| Type | Why this lifecycle? | Write Policy |
| ---- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| **Profile** | User state changes — "I live in London" may become "I moved to Tokyo" | **Merge** — new overwrites old on conflict |
| **Preference** | Preferences accumulate per topic but each topic has one current view | **Aggregate by slug** — merge within topic |
| **Entity** | Entities accumulate facts, but "Project Alpha" is still "Project Alpha" | **Aggregate by slug** — merge within entity |
| **Event** | History is immutable — "completed migration on March 15" never changes | **Append only** — never overwrite |
| **Case** | Problem-solving traces are historical records | **Append only** — never overwrite |
| **Pattern** | Patterns emerge from repeated observations and evolve over time | **Aggregate by slug** — refine over time |
| **Skill** | Tool expertise grows cumulatively — more experience = better knowledge | **Cumulative append** — knowledge accumulates |

Four distinct write policies, each justified by the information's lifecycle semantics. A single "store everything the same way" approach would either lose mutable state (if append-only) or corrupt immutable history (if overwriting).

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Why YAML-driven schemas?

**The problem:** Hardcoding extraction schemas in Python means every new context type requires code changes, testing, and deployment.

**The solution:** YAML schemas declare what to extract and how to categorize it. The SchemaRegistry, PolicyRouter, and URIResolver all consume these schemas at runtime. Adding a new type — say "Decision" or "Handoff" — means adding a YAML file, not modifying the extraction pipeline.

**What breaks without it:** Every new context type becomes a code change that touches extraction, commit routing, and URI resolution — three packages that must be co-released. In practice, teams just skip adding new types, and everything gets shoved into generic "notes."

### Why the Outbox pattern for async indexing?

**The problem:** Embedding + upserting to a vector index takes 100–500ms. If synchronous, every `afterTurn` blocks for that duration, adding latency to the Agent's response.

**The solution:** The Outbox pattern decouples writing (fast, ~50ms) from indexing (slow, async). Each write deposits an OutboxEvent on disk. A background worker consumes events with at-least-once delivery guarantees and a DLQ for permanent failures. The write path returns immediately; the index catches up within seconds.

**What breaks without it:** The Agent's perceived response time balloons by 2–10x. Worse, if the vector index is temporarily down, writes fail and context is lost — the system becomes fragile to infrastructure transients.

### Why L0/L1/L2 three-level retrieval?

**The problem:** Longer content doesn't mean better vector similarity — in fact, the opposite. An embedding of a 5000-token document must represent *every* concept it contains, diluting the signal for any single topic. When you query "what does Alice do?", an L2 content chunk packed with details about Go, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and migration strategies produces a diffuse embedding where "backend engineer" is just one signal among dozens. A focused L0 abstract ("Alice is a backend engineer") produces a concentrated embedding that matches the query directly.

**The solution:** Each context node is indexed at three granularities. L0 abstracts (~100 tokens) produce focused embeddings — they're accurate topic signposts. L1 overviews (~500 tokens) are mid-grain. L2 full content (~5000 tokens) has the detail but diffuse embeddings. The retrieval engine does a single vector search across all levels, then uses L0/L1 hits as **directory entry points** for recursive tree expansion: when an L0 abstract matches, the searcher expands into its children to discover L2 content that flat search would miss. Score propagation (`final = α·child + (1-α)·parent`) boosts borderline L2 hits under strongly-matching parents.

```
  ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐
  │  L0 Abstract │    │  L1 Overview │    │  L2 Content   │
  │  ~100 tokens │    │  ~500 tokens │    │  ~5000 tokens │
  │  Focused     │    │  Balanced    │    │  Comprehensive│
  │  embedding   │    │  signal      │    │  but diffuse  │
  │  → signpost  │    │  → decision  │    │  → full detail│
  └──────┬───────┘    └──────┬───────┘    └──────┬────────┘
         │                   │                    │
         ▼                   ▼                    ▼
    .abstract.md        .overview.md          content.md
```

**Recall benefit**: Flat vector search on L2 content alone misses relevant chunks whose embeddings got diluted by surrounding detail. The L0/L1 signposts guide the searcher to the right neighborhood, then tree expansion discovers the full content underneath — including chunks whose raw vector score was below threshold but whose parent topic was a strong match.

### Why a filesystem abstraction?

**The problem:** Context operations — create, read, update, link, delete — need to be composable, atomic, and multi-tenant-safe. Building each as a bespoke API means reimplementing concurrency, permissions, and consistency for every operation.

**The solution:** ContextFS maps every context operation to a file operation on `ctx://` URIs. The file metaphor is universally understood — `open`, `read`, `write`, `link`, `unlink`, `gc` map directly to context operations. Multi-tenant isolation is enforced at the filesystem level (via `account_id + owner_space` in every path), making it impossible to bypass even by buggy callers.

**What breaks without it:** Tenant isolation becomes "each caller must remember to check permissions." Atomic writes become "each caller must implement the 4-step write protocol correctly." Every new feature re-solves the same infrastructure problems.

| Filesystem Concept | Context Equivalent | Benefit |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------- |
| `open(path)` | Load context by URI | Uniform access to any context type |
| `read(fd, offset, len)` | Read L0 / L1 / L2 at chosen depth | Pay only for the tokens you need |
| `write(fd, data)` | Persist new context | Atomic writes with ordering guarantees |
| `link(src, dst)` | Create relation edge | Graph traversal without a separate API |
| `unlink(path)` | Delete / archive context | GC for stale context |
| `gc()` | Repair Job | Self-healing persistence layer |
| Permissions (chmod) | Tenant isolation | Enforced at filesystem level, not by callers |

### Why optimistic locking for concurrent writes?

**The problem:** Profile nodes are written by every session a user has. Two sessions can extract conflicting profile updates simultaneously.

**The solution:** Optimistic locking — read the current `.meta.json` version, write only if unchanged. This handles the common case (no contention) with zero infrastructure overhead. On the rare case of concurrent writes, the second writer retries with fresh state.

**What breaks without it:** Distributed locks require a coordination service (etcd/ZooKeeper) — adding infrastructure complexity for a problem that occurs rarely. Without any locking, last-writer-wins silently loses the first writer's updates.

### Why the ReAct loop for extraction?

**The problem:** Extraction quality depends on knowing what already exists. If the system already knows "Alice is a backend engineer," extracting that again wastes LLM tokens and creates duplicate entries that must be deduplicated later.

**The solution:** The LLM is given tool access — `read(uri)`, `list(uri)`, `get_relations(uri)`, plus `extract_*` actions — and runs in a loop. Each iteration: it *reads* existing memory nodes (Reason), decides what's genuinely new, then calls the appropriate `extract_*` tool (Act). If unsure, it reads more nodes and loops. This is true ReAct: interleaved reasoning and tool use, not single-shot extraction.

```
  Iteration 1:  read(profile_uri) → "Alice, backend engineer, London"
                 → Nothing new to extract. Skip.

  Iteration 2:  read(entities/go) → "Go expert, prefers error handling pattern X"
                 → New: "Alice now also uses Rust for side projects"
                 → extract_entity(slug="rust", ...)
```

**What breaks without it:** Every turn re-extracts the same facts. Over 100 turns, "Alice is a backend engineer" gets extracted 100 times, creating 100 Profile merge operations — each one burning LLM tokens on content that was already stored. Extraction cost grows linearly with conversation length instead of with information density.

The write path is designed so that the synchronous portion (extraction through atomic write) completes in ~50ms. The expensive operations — embedding and vector upsert — happen asynchronously via the Outbox, never blocking the Agent's response.

```

One vector search, not three sequential passes. L0/L1 hits serve as directory entry points for tree expansion — discovering relevant L2 content that flat search would miss due to embedding dilution in long documents.

**Namespace isolation:** Queries are scoped by intent type. MEMORY queries search both `users/{user}/memories/` and `agents/{agent}/memories/`. SKILL queries search only `agents/{agent}/skills/`. The `owner_space` filter is set by the QueryPlanner based on `context_type` and `visible_owner_spaces`, enforced at the vector index level — callers cannot override it.

## The Agent Context Lifecycle

The six stages form a pipeline where each stage's output feeds the next. The design principle: **never block model inference**. All context operations happen at loop boundaries — before the LLM thinks or after it acts, never during.

| Stage | When | What happens | Key invariant |
| ----- | ---- | ------------ | ------------- |
| ① message_received | Before inference | Classify intent, prefetch candidates from L0 | Never block; fail silently if timeout |
| ② bootstrap + ingest + assemble | Before prompt build | Cold-start profile injection, budget-aware L0→L1→L2 loading, dedup, skill injection | Never exceed token budget |
| ③ before_tool_call + tool_result_persist | Around tool execution | Inject known failure patterns, compress oversized results, extract immediate facts | Tool params informed by history |
| ④ afterTurn | After Agent responds | Incremental extraction of delta, policy-routed writes, relation building, async index | Only extract what's new |
| ⑤ before_compaction + compact | When context fills | Score signal, protect critical nodes, compress redundancy | Never lose Profile or active task |
| ⑥ session_end + dispose | Session closes | Archive completed tasks, snapshot state for next session, audit integrity | Next session picks up seamlessly |

The lifecycle is circular: Stage ⑥'s task snapshot becomes Stage ②'s Handoff injection. Context born in Stage ④ gets recalled in Stage ①. What persists across sessions is what makes the system *learn*, not just *remember*.

## Data Flow: End-to-End Walkthrough

```
  Session 1 — Write Path: "I'm Alice, a backend engineer based in London"
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    User Message → Stage ④ afterTurn
        → Incremental Extraction (name, role, location)
        → CandidateMemory(category="profile")
        → PolicyRouter → ProfilePolicy (merge)
        → ContextWriter (atomic 4-step: content → relations → abstract+overview → meta.json ✱)
        → OutboxEvent → async IndexRecordBuilder (L0 + L1 + L2 embed + upsert)

  Session 2 — Read Path: "What does Alice do for a living?"
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    User Message → Stage ① message_received
        → Intent Classifier → "fact recall"
        → Async Prefetch → embed query → L0 search → seed hit (profile matches)
        → Stage ② assemble → Budget Planner → L0 hit → L2 load
        → Inject "Alice is a backend engineer"
        → Agent responds correctly
```

Write costs ~50ms (synchronous) + ~100ms (async indexing). Read costs ~50ms. The cost is paid *once* at write time, amortized over *many* reads.

## How It Differs

ContextEngine is not "vector RAG with extra steps." The fundamental differences are in lifecycle coverage, write policies, and retrieval granularity.

| Dimension | ContextEngine | Standard Vector RAG | Mem0 |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------- | ---- |
| **Lifecycle coverage** | 6 stages: extract → store → index → recall → compress → archive | 1 stage: retrieve | 2 stages: write + retrieve |
| **Write policies** | 4 policies (merge, aggregate, append, cumulative) matched to information semantics | Single: upsert | Single: upsert with memory_id |
| **Retrieval granularity** | L0/L1 as directory signposts → recursive tree expansion → L2 content discovery, score propagation | Flat top-k similarity search | Flat top-k with graph expansion |
| **Context types** | 7 types with distinct lifecycle behavior per type | 1 type: "document chunk" | 1 type: "memory" with scope labels |
| **Multi-tenant isolation** | Enforced at filesystem level (account_id + owner_space in every path), impossible to bypass | Application-level filtering (depends on caller) | Application-level filtering |
| **Concurrent writes** | Optimistic locking with version check | Last-writer-wins (or external lock) | Last-writer-wins |
| **Atomicity** | 4-step ordered write with detectable incomplete state | Best-effort | Best-effort |
| **Compression** | Signal scoring + protected nodes + summary chain (Phase 2) | None | None |

The core distinction: ContextEngine treats context as a **managed lifecycle**, not a store-and-retrieve problem. Write policies are not configuration — they're architectural decisions derived from information semantics. Retrieval is not a single operation — it's a three-stage decision process with budget awareness. And the system is designed to run continuously across sessions, not just serve queries.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **PostgreSQL 14+** with [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension (for PostgreSQL mode)
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://gitcode.com/opengauss/oG-Memory.git
cd oG-Memory
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Option A: AGFS mode (default)</strong></summary>

```bash
pip install -e .

# Interactive setup wizard (guides AGFS + LLM + Embedding + Vector DB config)
ogmem onboard

# One-command start (AGFS + ContextEngine)
ogmem start local
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Non-interactive mode (CI / automation)</strong></summary>

```bash
ogmem onboard --non-interactive --mode local \
  --provider openai --api-key sk-xxx \
  --embedding-model text-embedding-ada-002 --vector-db chroma
```

</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Option B: PostgreSQL mode (direct SQL storage)</strong></summary>

**1. Install & configure PostgreSQL**

```bash
# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
sudo apt-get install postgresql-16-pgvector   # adjust version to match your PG

# macOS
brew install postgresql@16
brew install pgvector

# Start PostgreSQL
sudo service postgresql start   # Ubuntu
brew services start postgresql  # macOS

# Create database & enable pgvector
sudo -u postgres createdb ogmemory
sudo -u postgres psql -d ogmemory -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;"
```

**2. Install ContextEngine with SQL extras**

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,sql]"
```

**3. Configure connection**

```bash
cp config/ogmem.reference.yaml config/ogmem.yaml
# Edit storage.connection_string to point at your PostgreSQL instance
```

</details>

### Use It

**AGFS mode:**

```bash
ogmem start local    # Start AGFS + ContextEngine, ports 1833 + 8090
```

**PostgreSQL mode:**

```bash
cp config/ogmem.reference.yaml config/ogmem.yaml
# Edit ogmem.yaml: set storage.connection_string to your PostgreSQL DSN
python server/app.py
```

# Ingest a conversation turn
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/api/v1/after_turn \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":"user-1","sessionId":"session-1",
       "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"I am Alice, a backend engineer"},
                   {"role":"assistant","content":"Nice to meet you!"}]}'

---

## OpenClaw Integration

```bash
cd openclaw_context_engine_plugin && openclaw plugins install -l .
```

```
OpenClaw Agent → (hook) → og_memory_write (TS) → write_memory.py (Python) → ContextFS → PostgreSQL
```

| Tool | Stage | Operation |
| ---- | ----- | --------- |
| `og_memory_write` | ④ Turn End | Extract + persist new context |
| `og_memory_search` | ① Message | Prefetch relevant context |
| `og_memory_read` | ② Reasoning Prep | Load full context by URI |

Automatic behaviors (no Agent code changes): new message triggers prefetch, turn end triggers extraction, context fill triggers compression, session close triggers archival.

---

## Implementation Status

**Phase 0 + 1 (production quality):** Core models, ContextFS/PostgreSQL adapter (SQLContextFS), extraction pipeline (YAML SchemaRegistry + ReAct loop), write chain (4 merge policies + OutboxStore), hierarchical retrieval (L0/L1/L2) with **BM25 hybrid search** (vector + keyword fusion, alpha-weighted), async indexing, providers (OpenAI/Volcengine LLM, 4 embedders, InMemory/ChromaDB/pgvector), HTTP REST API with auth/RBAC, session management, **L0 structured summary generation** with dual-template extraction. 100+ test files (contract + unit + integration + e2e).

### Benchmark Results (LoCoMo10)

| Run | Accuracy | Key Changes |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| Run76 | **88.2%** (1358/1540) | L0 structured summary + BM25 hybrid retrieval + extraction prompt optimization |
| Run69 | 88.2% | L0 summary injection + prompt optimization (+6.6% over run68) |
| Run68 | 81.6% | session_time fix (baseline) |

Evaluated on [LoCoMo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10790) long-context conversational memory benchmark (10 sessions, 4 categories, 1540 questions).

**Lifecycle stages covered:** ① message_received, ② bootstrap + ingest + assemble, ④ afterTurn

**Phase 2 (planned):** Tool context injection, result compression, compression pipeline, session restore, graph retrieval, AI_Functions. **Phase 3 (planned):** Graph clustering, adaptive planning, observability.

**Lifecycle stages to cover:** ③ before_tool_call + tool_result_persist, ⑤ compression, ⑥ session_end + dispose
