## ✨ Why OpenStarterKit?

Most SaaS boilerplates either cost a few hundred dollars or ship as a barebones demo. **OpenStarterKit is different:**

- 💳 **Payments included in the free tier**: full Stripe Checkout, Customer Portal and webhooks, not paywalled behind a Pro plan.
- 🔓 **It is plain Next.js**: no compiler, no config DSL, no proprietary CLI. The App Router, Server Actions and Prisma behave exactly as their own docs say, with plain PostgreSQL underneath: host it anywhere, own your data.
- 🧩 **A complete SaaS, not a starter demo**: auth with two-factor and session management, billing, an admin panel with real MRR metrics, transactional emails and a polished landing page.
- 📖 **MIT licensed**: use it for anything, commercial included. No license keys, no unlock fees.
- 🌍 **Ships in more than one language**: every user-facing string lives in a message file, with routing, fallback and a language switch already wired. No translation service and no account required, and it is in the free kit instead of a paid add-on.
- 🕹️ **A publishable demo, built in**: one env var turns a deployment into a safe public demo of *your* product, with one-click explore accounts and writes disabled. Normally that is something you build yourself.

## 🧰 Tech stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org) with the App Router and Turbopack, on [React 19](https://react.dev) with Server Components rendering on the server by default. No compiler layer and no config DSL on top, so routing and Server Actions behave exactly as their own docs say.
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) in strict mode, across the app, the tests and the environment schema.
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com) with dark mode wired through CSS variables, so changing the theme is one file instead of a sweep through components.
- **UI**: [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com) primitives under a design system written for this kit (Button, Card, Badge, Input, Table and the rest). Radix handles the accessible behavior, you own the look, and both live in your codebase with no component library to upgrade around.
- **Icons**: [Lucide](https://lucide.dev), an open source set shipped as React components, so an icon is something you import and not an asset you manage.
- **Notifications**: [Sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski) for toasts, wired to every success and failure the interface reports back, Server Actions included.
- **Auth**: [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com) with Google and GitHub OAuth, magic link, email and password, and two-factor authentication you host yourself. Sessions live in your own database, so there is no auth vendor and no per-user pricing as you grow.
- **Database**: [Prisma 7](https://www.prisma.io) on [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org). Plain Postgres underneath keeps your data portable, and [Neon](https://neon.tech) has a free managed tier if you would rather not run one yourself.
- **Payments**: [Stripe](https://stripe.com) with Checkout, the Customer Portal and signature-verified webhooks, in the free kit instead of behind a Pro plan.
- **Emails**: [Resend](https://resend.com) for welcome, subscription, magic link and password reset messages, with the templates in your repository rather than in a dashboard you do not own.
- **Internationalization**: [next-intl](https://next-intl.dev) with plain JSON message files, plus routing, fallback and a language switch already wired.
- **Validation**: [Zod](https://zod.dev) on forms, Server Actions and the environment schema, with the same definitions shared by client and server.
- **Content**: the blog and docs are Markdown files with frontmatter, rendered through [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) with GitHub Flavored Markdown, so publishing a post means adding a file to the repository.
- **Analytics**: [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics), mounted in the root layout and active on Vercel deployments. Delete the component if you would rather collect nothing.
- **Tests**: [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) on the pure logic, the health endpoint and the Stripe webhook, and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) end to end on signup and checkout.
- **CI**: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) running lint, tests, build and `npm audit` on every push, so a broken or vulnerable commit fails before it reaches you.

## ⚡ Quick start

> 📚 Prefer step-by-step guides? The full documentation lives in [docs/](./docs/README.md) and is rendered at [openstarterkit.dev/docs](https://openstarterkit.dev/docs): getting started, configuration, authentication, deployment.

**You need:** Node 24 or newer, git, and a PostgreSQL database ([Neon](https://neon.tech) has a free tier).

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openstarterkit/nextjs-saas-starter-kit.git
cd nextjs-saas-starter-kit
npm install
```

### 2. Start it

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). There is no database yet, so the page lists the steps left and marks the one you are on. It appears in development only, until the database is ready.

### 3. Create a database, then fill `.env.local`

Create a PostgreSQL database and copy the connection string it gives you. On Neon that is the pooled one, and it ends with `?sslmode=require`: change that to `?sslmode=verify-full`, the stricter mode, or Node prints an SSL warning at every start.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local      # Command Prompt on Windows: copy .env.example .env.local
```

Two values are enough for the first run:

```bash title=".env.local"
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."   # the connection string from your database
AUTH_SECRET="..."                 # any random value; generate one with the command below
```

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64url'))"
```

Paste what it prints between the quotes of `AUTH_SECRET`.

Leave `DIRECT_URL` as it is: the kit does not read it, and it ships in the example only because some hosts set it for you.

Everything else (sign-in providers, Stripe, email) can wait: each feature turns on when its variables are set, and stays quietly off when they are not. Every variable is listed with its comment in [.env.example](.env.example) and explained in [Configuration](./docs/configuration.md).

### 4. Create the tables

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy   # applies the committed migrations
npx prisma db seed          # six example plans, one inactive (edit prisma/seed.ts later)
```

Both read `.env.local`, the same file the app reads.

### 5. Sign in

Restart `npm run dev` and open the site again. Click **Sign in**: in development the login page has a **Dev Login (Admin)** button, which needs no OAuth app and lands you in the dashboard as an admin. 🎉

**Next:** sign-in providers, Stripe and email each have their setup in [Configuration](./docs/configuration.md), and the same five steps with more detail are in [Getting started](./docs/getting-started.md).

### 6. Make it yours

Your brand lives in **two files**. Swap them and the whole app follows:

```
src/config/site.ts        # name, tagline, description, contact email, links
src/components/logo.tsx   # logo mark + wordmark
```

Then rewrite the landing copy and the `/privacy` + `/terms` placeholders, and it's your product. Details in [Make it yours](#-make-it-yours).

---

## ☁️ Deploy

Click the **Deploy with Vercel** button at the top, or:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

Set all environment variables in the Vercel dashboard. For Stripe webhooks in production, create a new endpoint in the Stripe dashboard pointing to `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`. Builds do not run migrations: apply them to the production database yourself, with `npm run check:deploy` before and after (see [Deployment](./docs/deployment.md)).

### Make yourself Admin

After signing in for the first time, run:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

Find your user in the `User` table and set `role` to `ADMIN`. You'll then see the Admin Panel shortcut in your dashboard.

---

## 🎨 Make it yours

The kit ships **brand-neutral**: a placeholder name and a black + grayscale theme, a blank canvas you make yours. Everything (metadata, navbar, footer, emails, legal pages, Open Graph images) reads from a single source, so you can rebrand two ways:

- **From config**: `src/config/site.ts` (name, tagline, description, links), `src/components/logo.tsx` (the logo mark), and the color tokens in `src/app/globals.css`.
- **From env**: set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BRAND_*` variables (name, tagline, logo accent, colors) and the app rebrands with no code changes. The gradient, glow and Open Graph images follow your accent automatically. See [Configuration](./docs/configuration.md#branding--theming).

Change those, replace the landing copy, and the kit is fully yours. The only intentional exception is the optional ["Built with" badge](#%EF%B8%8F-attribution--the-badge), which credits the kit itself. The **code is MIT**: use it for anything, no strings attached.

---

## 🕹️ Demo mode

Want a public demo of your product (like [the kit's own demo](https://demo.openstarterkit.dev)) without collecting anyone's personal data? Deploy a second instance of this repo against an **isolated database** and set:

```bash
DEMO_MODE="true"          # on the demo deployment
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_URL=""   # on the marketing deployment → points "Sign in"/"Demo" at the demo
```

With `DEMO_MODE` on, the OAuth buttons are disabled and the login page offers **one-click shared accounts** instead: *Explore as User* and *Explore as Admin* (so visitors can see the admin panel too). Fill the demo database with believable fake users, subscriptions and projects:

```bash
npm run db:seed:demo   # ⚠️ wipes users/projects and recreates fixtures; re-run to reset
```

No real emails, no real payments (use Stripe test keys), nothing to GDPR-worry about.

## 🧪 Tests

```bash
npm test              # run once
npm run test:watch    # re-run on change
npm run test:coverage # with a coverage report
```

Vitest, on the pure logic in `src/lib`: the rate limiter and its shared store, the password policy, the backup code alphabet, the account linking rule that decides when a provider may attach itself, the billing rules behind free trials, discounts and the Stripe Tax check, the session rules behind role changes and revocation, the Markdown parsers behind the blog, docs and changelog, the environment schema, the builders behind structured data and page metadata, and the boundary every page reads the session through. Plus the two routes worth guarding: the health endpoint, and the Stripe webhook, tested with **real signatures** generated by Stripe's own SDK, so a forged or replayed request is proven never to reach the database writes behind it.

### End-to-end

```bash
npx playwright install chromium   # once, about 115 MB
npm run test:e2e
```

Playwright on the flows that cost something when they break:

- **Signing up and signing in**: account created, session issued, dashboard reached, duplicate email refused.
- **Starting a checkout**: billing page reachable, anonymous requests bounced, handoff to Stripe returns a real Stripe URL.
- **The whole two-factor chain**: enable it, sign out, sign back in with a code, then with a backup code. The test computes the TOTP itself, so it runs with nobody in front of it.
- **Accessibility**: axe-core against WCAG 2.1 AA on the public pages, an error state and the signed-in pages, each measured at its full height so contrast below the first screen is judged too, failing on serious and critical findings.

Deliberately not part of `npm test` or CI: these need a database and a browser binary, and a clone should not have to install either to run the unit suite. Chromium only, because three engines mean three downloads and three times the flakes.

Nothing here sends email or takes a payment. The test server runs with the Resend key blanked, so registering signs the user straight in instead of mailing a magic link, and the checkout test stops at the handoff rather than driving Stripe's hosted page. Accounts created by the run are deleted afterwards.

Coverage of `src/lib`, excluding the thin wrappers around Prisma, Stripe and Resend:

| | |
|---|---|
| Lines | **78%** |
| Statements | **76%** |
| Functions | **81%** |
| Branches | **70%** |

Run `npm run test:coverage` to check those numbers yourself: they are printed by the command, not published to a badge service.

**Why no coverage badge?** Because it would travel with the kit and cost you something. A badge points at one specific repository, so every clone would show *our* coverage as if it were yours. Publishing it needs a third-party account, a token in your CI, and an uploader that runs where your secrets live. None of that belongs in a starter you are about to make your own: the command above reports the real figure for your code, and nothing leaves your machine.

**Want one anyway?** Perfectly reasonable, and common on open source projects. Point Codecov, Coveralls or whichever tool you prefer at *your* repository, then add its upload step to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` after `npm test`. Both services are free for public repositories. The workflow is yours to edit, and leaving it out of the kit is what makes adding it a decision rather than a leftover.

**Need coverage enforced rather than reported?** Thresholds that fail a build, history over time, and a report someone can hand to a compliance review are an organisation's problem, not a solo maker's. That is the kind of requirement the paid **Pro** tier is aimed at. Everything above stays in the free kit.

**What is fully covered:** the changelog parser, the environment schema, the password policy, the auth boundary, and the builders behind structured data and page metadata. **What is not:** the functions that read the database or the filesystem (`getEntitlement`, `getAllPosts`). Those need integration tests against a real client, and a unit test that mocks Prisma or Stripe only proves the mock works. Where a mocked test still earns its place is the decision taken around a call rather than the call itself: `recordUsage` is covered for the guards that drop an event in a keyless install and for the payload it builds, not for what Stripe does with it.

Your environment is validated at boot (`src/instrumentation.ts`): a configuration that is half done, such as a Stripe key with no webhook secret, stops the server with an explanatory message instead of failing at the first payment.

### Release smoke

```bash
npm run smoke -- https://your-app.com
npm run smoke -- https://your-app.com --expect-version 2.3.3
```

Checks a running deployment from the outside: `/api/health` (including whether the database has every migration the build ships), home, blog index, feed, a real post, the SEO surfaces, and two routing guards (an unknown path is a 404, `/dashboard` redirects to sign in). With `--expect-version` it also compares the version the site reports with the one you are releasing, which is how you catch a deploy that succeeded while still serving the previous build.

Every request is a GET, so it is safe to run against production. The flows that write something (contact form, waitlist) send real email and stay on the manual checklist. Demo deployments are detected from `/api/health` and checked the other way around: the smoke verifies they are *not* indexable.

### Dependency updates

Dependabot is configured in `.github/dependabot.yml` and runs **weekly**, on Monday.

Patch and minor bumps are **grouped by area** (Next, React, Prisma, UI, everything else) so they arrive as a handful of pull requests instead of a dozen. Major bumps come one at a time, because those are the ones worth reading. Majors of `next`, `react` and `react-dom` are excluded on purpose: those are release work, planned on the roadmap, not maintenance to merge on a Monday morning.

GitHub Actions versions are checked monthly.

CI runs lint, unit tests, the build and `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` on every push and pull request to `main`. The audit step is a gate, not a report: a high advisory in a runtime dependency stops the pipeline.

---

## 🧠 Tech decisions

**Why Prisma 7?** New WASM engine requires a driver adapter; we use `@prisma/adapter-pg`. See `src/lib/prisma.ts`.

**Why Stripe lazy proxy?** `new Stripe("")` throws at module load time. The proxy defers instantiation to first request. See `src/lib/stripe.ts`.

**Why Better Auth?** Auth.js is now part of Better Auth, and its own README points new projects at it. Sessions are rows in your database, so revoking one is deleting it, and the plugin system covers what a starter needs without a vendor.

**Why Tailwind v4?** Native CSS variables, no config file needed, `@custom-variant` for dark mode.

---

## 🏷️ Attribution & the badge

OpenStarterKit ships with a small **"Built with OpenStarterKit"** badge in the app footer. It's on by default: it costs you nothing and helps other makers find the kit.

**Want to remove it?** You're completely free to. Just set:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_REMOVE_BRANDING="true"
```

No license to buy, no fee, no unlock: the badge simply disappears.

If the kit saved you a weekend, the nicest way to say thanks is a coffee.
Totally optional: ☕ [buy us a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/openstarterkit).

## 🗺️ Roadmap & changelog

OpenStarterKit ships continuously and stays free: pull `main` for updates. A paid **Pro** tier (teams & scale) is coming later.

- 📍 [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md): what's next
- 📝 [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md): what shipped

Every release is tagged, so **Watch → Custom → Releases** on the repository tells you when one lands without subscribing to every commit and issue.

## 🌍 Languages

**From v1.6 every user facing string lives in a message file, not inside a component**, with one exception on purpose: the placeholder privacy, terms and cookies pages, which you replace with text of your own before launch and which should not be assembled from a file that quietly falls back to another language. Everything else means filling one JSON file instead of hunting through a hundred components, and needing two languages at once means the routing, the fallback and the language switch are already there rather than a refactor you pay for later.

Built on [next-intl](https://next-intl.dev), with **no translation service and no account required**: the files are plain JSON in the standard layout, so running them through Crowdin or anything else is your call. Your Markdown docs translate too, one file at a time: see [docs/i18n.md](./docs/i18n.md).

**On openstarterkit.dev the language switch is real**: every page of the documentation is there in Italian, and each translation records a checksum of the English file it was written from, so `npm run check:translations` says which ones went stale instead of leaving you to compare by hand, in your repository exactly as in ours. The blog stays English on purpose. Anything without a translation, page or message key, falls back to English with a line saying so rather than a gap, which is the behaviour you inherit and can see working on us instead of reading a description of it.

## 🔒 Security

Found a vulnerability **in the kit**? Please don't open a public issue: report it privately through [our security policy](https://github.com/openstarterkit/nextjs-saas-starter-kit/security/policy).

Once this is your app, write your own policy: add a `SECURITY.md` to your repository, or one in a `.github` repository if you keep several projects under an organisation.

**On dependencies**, the kit is kept clear of every advisory that has a fix, and Dependabot opens the updates weekly. What can still show up in `npm audit` are advisories inside Next.js's own dependency tree: those clear when Next ships a release, not when you run `npm audit fix`, and the "fix" npm suggests for them is a downgrade to an ancient major that you do not want. Run `npm audit` and read what it points at before assuming your clone is exposed.

## 🎨 Content & assets

The demo blog posts, the docs and the placeholder marketing copy that ship with this kit were produced with the help of AI tools. They are placeholders: replace them with your own before you launch.

The blog covers in `content/blog/covers/` are hand written SVG. They carry two color placeholders that the kit fills in with your brand, so you can keep the artwork and change the palette without redrawing anything. See [docs/blog.md](./docs/blog.md) for how they work, and for one thing worth knowing before you swap them for generated images.

The logo mark is a [lucide](https://lucide.dev) icon (ISC licence) rendered as code next to your product name, so there is no image file to swap. Your app ships the `Hexagon` as a placeholder: change it in `src/components/logo.tsx`, and change `src/app/icon.tsx` in the same pass, because the favicon is generated as the miniature of that same mark.
