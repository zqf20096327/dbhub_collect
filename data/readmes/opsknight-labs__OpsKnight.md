> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> ### 🚀 Major Milestone: OpsKnight 2.0 is Coming Soon!
>
> **Target Release Window: Late this month / First week of next month**
>
> Over **260+ PRs** have been merged since our last release (`v1.4.0`). While we initially planned a minor `v1.5`, the massive improvements across the board—a completely redesigned modern UI, rock-solid availability, scalable architecture, and deep engine upgrades—mean our next milestone will be **OpsKnight 2.0**!
>
> 💡 **Planning a new deployment?** If you are evaluating or planning to install OpsKnight, **we strongly recommend waiting for the 2.0 release** (or following the active opsknight-test package) to take advantage of the new infrastructure and streamlined configuration:
>
> - 🌐 **Cloud-Native & Kubernetes-Ready**: Highly available, horizontally scalable architecture engineered for automatic scaling in Kubernetes and distributed container environments.
> - ✨ **Modern UI & Intuitive Configuration**: Completely revamped user interface and configuration flows that make setting up services, channels, and team workflows simple and effortless.
> - ⏱️ **Per-Service SLA Management**: First-class SLA policies per service—define schedule, acknowledge, and resolve SLA targets with real-time breach tracking and business hours.
> - 💬 **Interactive Microsoft Teams ChatOps**: Full two-way incident triage directly from Teams channels—acknowledge, assign, snooze, set priority, and resolve incidents in real time.
> - 👥 **Next-Gen Team, Schedule & Escalation Engine**: Re-engineered schedule management, multi-tier escalation policies, and flexible team routing designed for complex on-call rotations.
> - 📢 **Upgraded Status Pages & Settings**: Redesigned public/private status pages, customizable incident banners, and unified administration controls.
> - 🔐 **Enterprise Security & Mature OIDC**: Upgraded OpenID Connect (OIDC) integration, redesigned login experience, strict RBAC authorization, and hardened session security.
> - 📊 **Actionable Reliability Metrics**: Rich operational analytics, SLA compliance reports, MTTR/MTTA breakdowns, and actionable service health dashboards.
>
> ⭐ **Star and watch this repository to be notified the moment OpsKnight 2.0 is officially released!**

---

> ### 📦 Current Stable Release: v1.4.0
>
> **Paging reliability** — delayed escalations remain delayed, orphaned work is
> recovered safely, and notification routes avoid duplicate delivery.
>
> **Operational confidence** — the administrator Health Center consolidates
> supported runtime checks, while the release contract validates installation,
> upgrades, recovery, incident delivery, deployment rendering, and stable
> AMD64/ARM64 images.

## ⚡ Why OpsKnight?

**Own the incident loop, the operational evidence, and the data.**

OpsKnight is an open-source, self-hosted alternative to per-seat on-call SaaS (including PagerDuty and Opsgenie). It is not affiliated with those companies. Designed for teams that want incident data on their own machines.

Whether you are an SRE team at a startup or a platform team at a larger organization, OpsKnight connects detect → route → respond → communicate → learn on infrastructure you control. Reliability and transparent operational evidence—not raw feature count—are the product contract.

| Feature           | OpsKnight                    | Typical per-seat SaaS |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| **Hosting**       | Self-hosted                  | Vendor cloud          |
| **Software fee**  | $0 (Apache-2.0)              | Per-user plans        |
| **Users**         | No seat meter in the product | Per-seat pricing      |
| **Status pages**  | One page per install         | Often a separate SKU  |
| **Voice paging**  | Not included                 | Often included        |
| **Incident data** | Your Postgres / VPC          | Vendor cloud          |

</div>

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git
- `openssl` (ships with macOS and most Linux distributions)

### Run the full stack

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/opsknight-labs/OpsKnight.git
cd OpsKnight

# 2. Create your environment file
cp env.example .env

# 3. Generate the two secrets OpsKnight requires
printf 'NEXTAUTH_SECRET=%s\n' "$(openssl rand -base64 32)" >> .env
printf 'ENCRYPTION_KEY=%s\n'  "$(openssl rand -hex 32)"    >> .env

# 4. Start OpsKnight and PostgreSQL
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

The main-branch Compose file defaults to the patched `ghcr.io/opsknight-labs/opsknight:1.4.0-hotfix` image. You do not need to switch branches or manually configure `latest`.

Open **http://localhost:3000**. The database schema is created on first boot, so
there is no migration step to run yourself.

`ENCRYPTION_KEY` encrypts integration credentials at rest — **keep it safe and
back it up.** Losing it means re-entering every integration secret.

> **Before exposing this to a network**, change the default PostgreSQL password in
> `.env` and set `NEXTAUTH_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your real hostname.

### Bring your own database

To run the published image against your own PostgreSQL, rather than the bundled one:

```bash
docker run -d --name opsknight -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@your-db-host:5432/opsknight" \
  -e NEXTAUTH_URL="https://opsknight.example.com" \
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://opsknight.example.com" \
  -e NEXTAUTH_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
  -e ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  ghcr.io/opsknight-labs/opsknight:1.4.0-hotfix
```

PostgreSQL 14+ is required. See the
[deployment guides](docs/v1.5/deployment/README.md) for TLS, connection pooling
and scaling.

## 🐳 Container Images

Images are published to the GitHub Container Registry and are **public — no
authentication needed to pull**.

| Image                                   | Channel                        | Tags                                          |
| :-------------------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| `ghcr.io/opsknight-labs/opsknight`      | Stable releases                | `1.4.0-hotfix`, `1.4.0`, `1.4`, `1`, `latest` |
| `ghcr.io/opsknight-labs/opsknight-test` | Pre-release, built from `main` | `latest`, `sha-<commit>`                      |

```bash
# Pin the patched v1.4 runtime — recommended for affected v1.4 deployments
docker pull ghcr.io/opsknight-labs/opsknight:1.4.0-hotfix

# Do not use `latest` for affected v1.4 deployments; the original 1.4.0 image is immutable.
```

Pinning an exact version is strongly preferred in production: `latest` moves
whenever a release ships, so a container restart can change versions underneath you.

## 🏗️ Architecture

OpsKnight runs as a single Next.js application (UI + API routes + server actions) with an internal DB-backed scheduler and a Postgres-backed job queue.

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/v1.4/assets/images/opsknight-architecture.svg" alt="OpsKnight architecture diagram" width="100%">
  <sub><em>High-level architecture: clients → app (Next.js) → PostgreSQL (Prisma) → outbound channels.</em></sub>
</div>

## 📚 Documentation

Everything you need to configure and extend OpsKnight.

- **[Hosted Documentation](https://opsknight.com/docs)** (Recommended)
- **In-Repo Guides (v1.5)**:
  - [⚡ Getting Started](docs/v1.5/getting-started/README.md)
  - [🧩 Core Concepts](docs/v1.5/core-concepts/README.md)
  - [🔌 Integrations](docs/v1.5/integrations/README.md)
  - [🛡️ Security](docs/v1.5/security/README.md)
  - [📡 API Reference](docs/v1.5/api/README.md)
  - [🔧 Administration](docs/v1.5/administration/README.md)
  - [📈 Prometheus Metrics](docs/v1.5/deployment/prometheus.md)

---

## 🔒 Security

OpsKnight handles on-call rotations, integration credentials and incident data, so
security is treated as a first-class concern:

- Integration secrets are **encrypted at rest** with envelope encryption, keyed by `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- Inbound webhooks and Slack requests are **signature-verified and rejected when they cannot be verified** — there is no fail-open path
- Every push is scanned by CodeQL, Trivy, TruffleHog, Checkov and OWASP ZAP in CI
- RBAC governs incident, service and schedule access

Found a vulnerability? Please **do not** open a public issue — see
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for private disclosure.

Hardening guidance: [Security documentation](docs/v1.4/security/README.md)
