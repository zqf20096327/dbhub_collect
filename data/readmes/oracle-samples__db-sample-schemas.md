# Oracle Database Sample Schemas

## Introduction

The [Oracle Database Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/index.html) and other resources use these sample schemas to demonstrate the capabilities of [Oracle Database](https://www.oracle.com/database/) and the SQL and PL/SQL languages. You can download and install these schemas in your database environments to learn about Oracle Database functionality or try the examples in the documentation. The sample schemas are based on a fictitious sample company that sells goods through various channels. The company operates worldwide to fill orders for products. It has several divisions, each of which is represented by a sample database schema.

**These schemas are provided for free.**

### About the Sample Schemas

The sample database schemas provide a common platform for examples in each release of Oracle Database.

The following schemas are included:

- `HR`: Human Resources - useful for introducing basic topics.
- `CO`: Customer Orders - a modern schema useful for demos of e-commerce transactions. It allows the storage of semi-structured data using JSON.
- `SH`: Sales History - designed to allow for demos with large amounts of data.

The following schemas are no longer updated, but are still available:

- `OC`: Online Catalog (**archived**) - a collection of object-relational database objects built inside the `OE` schema.
- `OE`: Order Entry (**archived**) - useful for dealing with matters of intermediate complexity. Many data types are available in this schema, including nonscalar data types.
- `PM`: Product Media (**archived**) - dedicated to print media data types.

#### Archived schemas

Archived schemas are provided for reference for examples in the documentation but are no longer actively maintained.

### Design Principles for Sample Schemas

The sample database schemas were created with the following design principles in mind:

- **Simplicity and ease of use**. The `HR` schema is intentionally simple. It provides a graduated path from simple to intermediate levels of database use.

- **Relevance for typical users**. The schemas bring to the foreground the functionality that customers typically use. Only the most commonly used database objects are built automatically in the schemas. The entire set of schemas provides a foundation upon which you can expand to illustrate additional functionality.

- **Extensibility**. The sample schemas provide a logical and physical foundation for adding objects to demonstrate functionality beyond the fundamental scope.

- **Relevance**. The sample schemas are designed to be applicable to e-business and other significant industry trends.

### User Benefits of Sample Schemas

Benefits provided by the sample schemas include the following:

- **Continuity of context**. When encountering the same set of tables everywhere, users, students, and developers can spend less time becoming familiar with the schema and more time understanding or explaining the technical concepts.

- **Usability**. Customers can use these schemas to run examples that are shown in Oracle Database documentation and training materials. This first-hand access to examples facilitates both conceptual understanding and application development.

- **Quality**. Through central maintenance and testing of the sample schemas and the examples that run against the schemas, the quality of Oracle Database documentation and training materials is enhanced.

## Installation

1. Go to the [latest (or appropriate) release of the sample schemas](https://github.com/oracle-samples/db-sample-schemas/releases) and download the `Source code (zip)` file.
2. Extract the downloaded .zip file.
3. Inside the sample schemas main directory, navigate to the sample schema directory that you want to install and run the `<schema_name>_install.sql` script. (**For more information about installing a schema, see the `README.md` file in the schema directory.**)
4. Review the installation verification at the end of the installation or in the generated installation log file.

### Example

To install the `HR` schema, complete the following steps:

1. `cd` into the `human_resources` folder.
2. Connect to the target database with a privileged user.
3. Run the `hr_install.sql` script and provide inputs for the prompts.

```shell
cd human_resources
sql <system>@<connect_string>
@hr_install.sql
```

## Uninstalling the Sample Schemas

1. Navigate to the sample schema folder that you want to uninstall and run the `<schema_name>_uninstall.sql` script. (**For more information about uninstalling a schema, see the `README.md` file in the schema directory.**)
2. Check the output for any errors during the uninstallation process.
