# GORM Driver for Oracle

The GORM Driver for Oracle provides support for Oracle Database, enabling full compatibility with GORM's ORM capabilities. It is built on top of the [Go Driver for Oracle (Godror)](https://github.com/godror/godror) and supports key features such as auto migrations, associations, transactions, and advanced querying.

### Prerequisite: Install Instant Client

To use ODPI-C with Godror, you’ll need to install the Oracle Instant Client on your system. Follow the steps on [this page](https://odpi-c.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/installation.html) to complete the installation.

After that, you can connect to the database using the `dataSourceName`, which specifies connection parameters (such as username and password) using a logfmt-encoded parameter list.

The way you specify the Instant Client directory differs by platform:

- macOS and Windows: You can set the `libDir` parameter in the dataSourceName.
- Linux: The libraries must be in the system library search path before your Go process starts, preferably configured with "ldconfig". The libDir parameter does not work on Linux.

#### Example (macOS/Windows)

``` go
dataSourceName := `user="scott" password="tiger" 
                   connectString="dbhost:1521/orclpdb1"
                   libDir="/Path/to/your/instantclient_23_26"`
```

#### Example (Linux)

``` go
dataSourceName := `user="scott" password="tiger" 
                   connectString="dbhost:1521/orclpdb1"`
```

## Getting Started

```go main.go
package main

import (
  "github.com/oracle-samples/gorm-oracle/oracle"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
)

func main() {
  dataSourceName := `user="scott" password="tiger"
                     connectString="dbhost:1521/orclpdb1"`
  db, err := gorm.Open(oracle.Open(dataSourceName), &gorm.Config{})
}
```

### OnUpdate Foreign Key Constraint

Since Oracle doesn’t support `ON UPDATE` in foreign keys, the driver simulates it using **triggers**.

When a field has a constraint tagged with `OnUpdate`, the driver:

1. Skips generating the unsupported `ON UPDATE` clause in the foreign key definition.
2. Creates a trigger on the parent table that automatically cascades updates to the child table(s) whenever the referenced column is changed.

The `OnUpdate` tag accepts the following values (case-insensitive): `CASCADE`, `SET NULL`, and `SET DEFAULT`.

Take the following struct for an example:

```go
type Profile struct {
  ID    uint
  Name  string
  Refer uint
}

type Member struct {
  ID        uint
  Name      string
  ProfileID uint
  Profile   Profile `gorm:"Constraint:OnUpdate:CASCADE"`
}
```

Trigger SQL created by the driver when migrating:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER "fk_trigger_profiles_id_members_profile_id"
AFTER UPDATE OF "id" ON "profiles"
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  UPDATE "members"
  SET "profile_id" = :NEW."id"
  WHERE "profile_id" = :OLD."id";
END;
```

### JSON Columns

Use either JSON type—both fully support `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` … `RETURNING`:

- `gorm.io/datatypes.JSON` — convenient for logging/printing; returned as text then rewrapped.
- `encoding/json.RawMessage` — raw `[]byte` fast-path; ideal for large payloads or minimal decoding.

#### Notes:
- On multi-row `RETURNING`, we use PL/SQL bulk blocks and map results back into your structs.
- `datatypes.JSON` comes back as text; `json.RawMessage` comes back as bytes.
  
Take the following struct as an example:

```go
type Record struct {
  ID         uint            `gorm:"primaryKey;autoIncrement;column:record_id"`
  Name       string          `gorm:"column:name"`
  // Text-oriented JSON
  Properties datatypes.JSON  `gorm:"column:properties"`
  // Raw bytes JSON
  Payload    json.RawMessage `gorm:"column:payload"`
}
```
