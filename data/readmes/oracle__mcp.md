# Oracle MCP Server Repository

Repository containing reference implementations of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for managing and interacting with Oracle products. Each MCP server under `src/` may be written in a different programming language, demonstrating MCP’s language-agnostic approach.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables standardized, language-agnostic machine-to-machine workflows across data, models, and cloud resources. MCP servers implement specific tool suites, exposing them to MCP-compatible clients.

## Project Scope

- **Proof-of-concept/Reference implementations:**  
  This repository is not intended for production use; servers are provided as reference and for exploration, prototyping, and learning.

- **Polyglot architecture:**  
  Each `src/<server-name>/` directory represents a distinct MCP server, and these may use Python, Node.js, Java, or other languages.

## Prerequisites

- Supported OS: Linux, macOS, or Windows (varies by server; check server README)
- Git (for cloning this repository)
- Internet access (for downloading dependencies)
- *Cloud access*: Some servers require Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) credentials and configuration ([OCI docs](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm))

**Note:**  
Each MCP server has its own specific requirements (e.g., language runtime version, libraries).  
Always see the respective `src/<server>/README.md` for detailed setup instructions.

## Quick Start

Follow these instructions to get started as quickly as possible. Once finished, look [here](#local-development) to set up your local development environment if you wish to [contribute](#contributing) changes.

1. Install `uv` from [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
2. Install python with `uv python install 3.13`
3. If you are using OCI servers, configure your [OCI authentication](#authentication)
4. Choose a server below and add it to your [MCP client configuration](#client-configuration)

### Choose an OCI server

For most OCI users, start with [`oci-cloud-mcp-server`](src/oci-cloud-mcp-server/README.md). It uses the official OCI Python SDK directly, without OCI CLI subprocess calls, and is the recommended general-purpose entry point for OCI workflows.

Use [`oci-api-mcp-server`](src/oci-api-mcp-server/README.md) instead when you specifically want an MCP server backed by the OCI CLI. It exposes tools for discovering and running OCI CLI commands.

Choose one of the other purpose-built servers when you already know the Oracle product or OCI domain you want to work with. These servers target specific service and product workflows rather than providing a general OCI entry point. Browse the [`src/`](src/) directories and read the relevant `src/<server>/README.md` before configuring one.

### Recommended: OCI Cloud MCP Server

Run the server over stdio:

```sh
uvx oracle.oci-cloud-mcp-server@latest
```

Then add this minimal configuration to your MCP client. Replace `<profile_name>` with the OCI CLI profile configured during [authentication](#authentication).

For macOS/Linux:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oracle-oci-cloud-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "oracle.oci-cloud-mcp-server@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "OCI_CONFIG_PROFILE": "<profile_name>",
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Alternative: OCI API MCP Server

Use this CLI-backed option when you specifically need OCI CLI commands:

```sh
uvx oracle.oci-api-mcp-server@latest
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oracle-oci-api-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "oracle.oci-api-mcp-server@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "OCI_CONFIG_PROFILE": "<profile_name>",
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To connect to an OCI MCP server running in HTTP streaming mode:
Assuming you started the server by running:
```bash
ORACLE_MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1 ORACLE_MCP_PORT=8888 ORACLE_MCP_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8888 OCI_REGION=us-phoenix-1 IDCS_DOMAIN=<idcs_domain> IDCS_CLIENT_ID=<client_id> IDCS_CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret> IDCS_AUDIENCE=<audience> uvx oracle.oci-cloud-mcp-server
```
Register `${ORACLE_MCP_BASE_URL}/auth/callback` as a redirect URI in the OCI IAM confidential application for the server.
then place the following in your MCP client configuration:
:warning: NOTE: the `type` attribute differs across MCP clients; some use `http` as the
transport value while others (like Cline) expect `streamableHttp`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oracle-oci-cloud-mcp-server": {
      "type": "streamableHttp",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8888/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

`oracle.oci-api-mcp-server` is `stdio`-only. For OCI HTTP servers, `IDCS_REQUIRED_SCOPES` is optional; if unset, the default is `openid profile email oci_mcp.<server_name>.invoke`, where `<server_name>` is the package name without `oracle.oci-` and `-mcp-server`, with `-` replaced by `_`. For example, `oracle.oci-cloud-mcp-server` defaults to `openid profile email oci_mcp.cloud.invoke`.

## Running with podman

Some MCP servers in this repository support running via podman.

### Installing podman
Use the following instructions to install and run podman

https://podman.io/docs/installation

### Building the Container Image

You can build the container image using the following command. The command shows building the container image for the oci-api-mcp-server.

```sh
SUBDIRS=src/oci-api-mcp-server make containerize
```
The above command builds the container image tagged as `oracle.oci-api-mcp-server:latest`.

### MCP Client Configuration

For examples of configuring MCP clients to run the server using podman, see the client-specific sections below. Configurations typically involve using `podman run` as the command, with appropriate flags and volume mounts for credentials if needed (e.g., mounting `~/.oci` for OCI servers running over `stdio` transport).

Alternatively, if you want to use HTTP transport using the podman container, then start an OCI HTTP-capable MCP server using the following command and configure your client as mentioned in Quickstart section above.
```bash
podman run -e ORACLE_MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0 -e ORACLE_MCP_PORT=8888 -e ORACLE_MCP_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8888 -e OCI_REGION=us-phoenix-1 -e IDCS_DOMAIN=<idcs_domain> -e IDCS_CLIENT_ID=<client_id> -e IDCS_CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret> -e IDCS_AUDIENCE=<audience> -p 127.0.0.1:8888:8888 oracle.oci-cloud-mcp-server:latest
```
For local development, keep `-p 127.0.0.1:8888:8888`. Changing it to `-p 8888:8888` exposes the server beyond localhost.

## Authentication

For OCI MCP servers running over stdio transport:

1. Install the [OCI CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm)
2. Configure your OCI CLI profile
```bash
oci session authenticate --region=<region> --tenancy-name=<tenancy_name>
```
where:
`<region>` is the region you would like to authenticate in (e.g. `us-phoenix-1`)
`<tenancy_name>` is the name of your OCI tenancy

Some MCP servers may not work with token-based authentication alone. See more about API key-based authentication [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/clitoken.htm).

All stdio actions are performed with the permissions of the configured OCI CLI profile. We advise least-privilege IAM setup, secure credential management, safe network practices, secure logging, and warn against exposing secrets.

Remember to refresh the session once it expires with:
```bash
oci session authenticate --profile-name <profile_name> --region <region> --auth security_token
```

`<profile_name>` is the profile that you set up in the steps above. You can view a list of your profiles by running `cat ~/.oci/config` on macOS/Linux if you forget which profile you have set up.

For OCI MCP servers running over HTTP transport, use an OCI IAM confidential application and set `IDCS_DOMAIN`, `IDCS_CLIENT_ID`, `IDCS_CLIENT_SECRET`, `IDCS_AUDIENCE`, `ORACLE_MCP_BASE_URL`, `ORACLE_MCP_HOST`, `ORACLE_MCP_PORT`, and `OCI_REGION`. Register `${ORACLE_MCP_BASE_URL}/auth/callback` as a redirect URI in that application. HTTP requests run as the authenticated OCI IAM user and do not use the local OCI CLI profile for request authentication. `IDCS_REQUIRED_SCOPES` is optional; if unset, the server defaults to `openid profile email oci_mcp.<server_name>.invoke`. Create and grant that custom scope in your confidential application, or override it with `IDCS_REQUIRED_SCOPES`.

For server authors, the shared library keeps credential resolution and HTTP
token exchange consistent while each server retains its listener, service
client lifecycle, and derived user agent. See the [shared authentication
module](src/common/README.md#authentication-module) for the full configuration
matrix and the [HTTP IDCS authentication section](src/common/README.md#http-idcs-authentication)
for the provider and per-request token-exchange API. HTTP-derived OCI clients
must be treated as caller-specific and must not be reused across callers.

## Client configuration

Each MCP server exposes endpoints that your client can connect to. To enable this connection, just add the relevant server to your MCP client’s configuration file. You can find the list of servers under the `src` folder.

Refer to the sections below for client-specific configuration instructions.

### Cline

<details>
<summary>Setup</summary>

Before continuing, make sure you have already followed the steps above in the [Quick start](#quick-start) section.

1. If using Visual Studio Code, install the [Cline VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev) (or equivalent extension for your preferred IDE). 
2. Once installed, click the extension to open it.
3. Click the **MCP Servers** button near the top of the the extension's panel.
4. Select the **Installed** tab.
5. Click **Configure MCP Servers** to open the `cline_mcp_settings.json` file.
6. In the `cline_mcp_settings.json` file, add your desired MCP servers in the `mcpServers` object. Below is an example for for the generic OCI API MCP server. Make sure to save the file after editing. `<profile_name>` is the profile that you set up during the [authentication](#authentication) steps.

For macOS/Linux:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oracle-oci-api-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "oracle.oci-api-mcp-server@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "OCI_CONFIG_PROFILE": "<profile_name>",
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, to run using podman (example for oracle.oci-api-mcp-server):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oracle-oci-api-mcp-server": {
      "autoApprove": [],
      "disabled": false,
      "timeout": 60,
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "podman",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-v", "/path/to/your/.oci:/app/.oci", "oracle.oci-api-mcp-server:latest"],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "INFO"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `"/path/to/your/.oci"` with the actual path to your OCI configuration directory.

⚠️ **NOTE**: Ensure that the _key_file_ field in /path/to/your/.oci/config uses the ~ character so that the path resolves both inside and outside the container; for example: `key_file=~/.oci/oci_api_key.pem`.

For servers not requiring OCI credentials, omit the `-v` volume mount.

For Windows - **TODO**

7. Once installed, you should see a list of your **MCP Servers** under the **Installed** tab. They will have a green toggle that shows that they are enabled.
8. Click **Done** when finished.

### Cursor

<details>
<summary>Setup</summary>

Before continuing, make sure you have already followed the steps above in the [Quick start](#quick-start) section.

1. You can place MCP configurations in two locations, depending on your use case:

**Project Configuration**: For tools specific to a project, create a `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your project directory. This allows you to define MCP servers that are only available within that specific project.

**Global Configuration**: For tools that you want to use across all projects, create a `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file in your home directory. This makes MCP servers available in all your Cursor workspaces.

**`.cursor/mcp.json`**

For macOS/Linux:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oracle-oci-api-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "oracle.oci-api-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "OCI_CONFIG_PROFILE": "<profile_name>",
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, to run using podman (example for oracle-oci-api-mcp-server):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oracle-oci-api-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "podman",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-v", "/path/to/your/.oci:/app/.oci", "oracle.oci-api-mcp-server:latest"],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "INFO"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `"/path/to/your/.oci"` with the actual path to your OCI configuration directory.

For servers not requiring OCI credentials, omit the `-v` volume mount.

`<profile_name>` is the profile that you set up during the [authentication](#authentication) steps.

For Windows - **TODO**

2. In your **Cursor Settings**, check your **Installed Servers** under the **MCP** tab to ensure that your `.cursor/mcp.json` was properly configured.

</details>

### MCPHost

<details>
<summary>Setup</summary>

Before continuing, make sure you have already followed the steps above in the [Quick start](#quick-start) section.

1. Download [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download)
2. Start the Ollama server

For macOS: If installed via the official installer, `ollama start`. If installed via homebrew, `brew services start ollama`

For Windows: If installed via the official installer, the server is typically configured to start automatically in the background and on system boot. 

For Linux: `sudo systemctl start ollama`

3. Verify the ollama server has started with `curl http://localhost:11434`. A successful response will typically be "Ollama is running".
4. Fetch the large language model, where `<model>` is the name of your desired model (e.g. `llama3.2`), with `ollama pull <model>`. For more options, check Ollama's list of [models that support tool calling](https://ollama.com/search?c=tools).
5. Install `go` from [here](https://go.dev/doc/install)
6. Install `mcphost` with `go install github.com/mark3labs/mcphost@latest`
7. Add go's bin to your PATH with `export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin`
8. Create an mcphost configuration file (e.g. `~/.mcphost.json`). Check [here](https://github.com/mark3labs/mcphost?tab=readme-ov-file#mcp-servers) for more info.
9. Add your desired server to the `mcpServers` object. Below is an example for for the compute OCI MCP server. Make sure to save the file after editing.

For macOS/Linux:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oracle-oci-api-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "oracle.oci-api-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "OCI_CONFIG_PROFILE": "<profile_name>",
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, to run using podman (example for oracle-oci-api-mcp-server):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oracle-oci-api-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "podman",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-v", "/path/to/your/.oci:/app/.oci", "oracle.oci-api-mcp-server:latest"],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "INFO"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `"/path/to/your/.oci"` with the actual path to your OCI configuration directory.

For servers not requiring OCI credentials, omit the `-v` volume mount.

`<profile_name>` is the profile that you set up during the [authentication](#authentication) steps.

For Windows - **TODO**

10. Start `mcphost` with `OCI_CONFIG_PROFILE=<profile> mcphost -m ollama:<model> --config <config-path>`
    1.  `<model>` is the model you chose above
    2.  `<profile>` is the name of the OCI CLI profile that you set up above
    3.  `<config-path>` is the path to the mcphost configuration json file that you made above

</details>

## Local development

This section will help you set up your environment to prepare it for local development if you wish to [contribute](#contributing) changes.

1. Set up python virtual environment and install dev requirements
    ```sh
    uv venv --python 3.13 --seed
    source .venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

2.  Locally build and install servers within the virtual environment
    ```sh
    make build
    make install
    ```
**Note**: If you want to run commands in a single server project, you can add the `project` variable to only run commands for that specific project
For example: `make project=oci-compute-mcp-server build` will only build the compute mcp server

3. Add desired servers to your MCP client configuration, but run them using the locally installed server package instead

Below is an example MCP client configuration for a typical python server using the local server package

*(For Node.js/Java/other servers, follow respective instructions in that server’s README)*

For macOS/Linux:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oracle-oci-api-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "oracle.oci-api-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "VIRTUAL_ENV": "<path to your cloned repo>/mcp/.venv",
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

where `<path to your cloned repo>` is the absolute path to wherever you cloned this repo that will help point to the venv created above (e.g. `/Users/myuser/dev/mcp/.venv`)

### JavaScript MCP servers

Most servers in this repository are Python packages managed with `uv`. JavaScript servers are first-class MCP servers too, but they use `npm` and are intentionally excluded from the Python package loop.

The OCI JavaScript MCP server lives in `src/oci-javascript-mcp-server`:

```sh
cd src/oci-javascript-mcp-server
npm install
npm test
npm run check
```

From the repository root, you can run the JavaScript package targets with:

```sh
make javascript-sync
make javascript-test
make javascript-check
make javascript-ci
```

## Directory Structure

## Testing

### Testing with a Local Development MCP Server

You can modify the settings of your MCP client to run your local server. Open your client json settings file and
update it as needed. For instance:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oracle-oci-api-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "oracle.oci-api-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "VIRTUAL_ENV": "<path to your cloned repo>/oci-mcp/.venv",
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

where `<absolute path to your server code>` is the absolute path to the server code, for instance
`/Users/myuser/dev/oci-mcp/src/oci-identity-mcp-server/oracle/oci_identity_mcp_server`.

To build and test servers running in HTTP transport mode:
```bash
make build
make install
```

then start the server:
```bash
VIRTUAL_ENV=$(pwd)/.venv ORACLE_MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1 ORACLE_MCP_PORT=8888 uv run oracle.oci-api-mcp-server
```

### Inspector

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)
provides [Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) which is a developer tool for testing and
debugging MCP servers. More information on Inspector can be found in
the [documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector).

The Inspector runs directly through npx without requiring installation. For instance, to inspect your locally developed
server, you can run:

```sh
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector \
  uv \
  --directory <absolute path to your server code> \
  run \
  server.py
```

Inspector will run your server on localhost (for instance: http://127.0.0.1:6274) which should automatically open the
tool for debugging and development.

### Running tests

```bash
make lint
make test
make javascript-test
make javascript-check
```

To run both the Python and JavaScript checks from the repository root:

```bash
make ci
```

### Running tasks with moon

The standard Python server projects and the JavaScript MCP server can also be
orchestrated with [moon](https://moonrepo.dev/). Tool versions are pinned in
`.prototools`; after installing [proto](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/proto/install),
install the pinned tools and run tasks from the repository root:

```bash
proto install
moon run oci-compute-mcp-server:test
moon run oci-javascript-mcp-server:ci
moon run :lint
moon run :build
```

Moon uses each project's language-specific package definition: `pyproject.toml`
and `uv.lock` for Python, and `package.json` and `package-lock.json` for
JavaScript. The JavaScript tasks are inferred from the existing npm scripts.
Other projects excluded from the repository-level Make targets are not part of
this Moon rollout and continue to use the validation commands in their own
README.

## Publishing

### Publish & verify test packages

Publish packages to PyPI test registry:
```bash
UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN=$(cat /path/to/testpypi/token-file) make test-publish
```

Verify installation:
```bash
uv run --index=https://test.pypi.org/simple <mcp server package>
```
example:
```bash
uv run --index=https://test.pypi.org/simple oracle.oci-api-mcp-server
```

### Publish packages

>[!IMPORTANT]
> NOTE: The `UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN` differs for Test PyPI and PyPI.

```bash
UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN=$(cat /path/to/pypi/token-file) make publish
```

JavaScript packages are published separately through npm. Before publishing
`src/oci-javascript-mcp-server`, run `npm run ci` from that package directory;
the repository-level `make publish` target publishes only the Python packages.
