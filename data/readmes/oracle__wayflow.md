# WayFlow

WayFlow is a powerful, intuitive Python library for building sophisticated AI-powered assistants. It includes a standard library of plan steps to streamline the creation of AI-powered assistants, supports re-usability and is ideal for rapid development.


## Get started


To get started, set up your Python environment (Python 3.10 or newer required), and then install the WayFlow Core package.

### venv

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install wayflowcore
```

### uv

You can also use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for faster install times:

```bash
pip install uv
uv pip install wayflowcore
```

## Hello world example

Initialize a Large Language Model (LLM) of your choice:

| OCI Gen AI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Open AI                                                                                                         | Ollama                                                                                                          |

| <pre>from wayflowcore.models import OCIGenAIModel<br><br>llm = OCIGenAIModel(<br>   model_id="provider.model-id",<br>   service_endpoint="https://url-to-service-endpoint.com",<br>   compartment_id="compartment-id",<br>   auth_type="API_KEY",<br>)</pre> | <pre>from wayflowcore.models import OpenAIModel<br><br>llm = OpenAIModel(<br>   model_id="model-id",<br>)</pre> | <pre>from wayflowcore.models import OllamaModel<br><br>llm = OllamaModel(<br>   model_id="model-id",<br>)</pre> |


> See the list of supported LLMs in the [WayFlow documentation](https://oracle.github.io/wayflow/development/core/howtoguides/llm_from_different_providers.html).


Then, create an agent using a [WayFlow Agent](https://oracle.github.io/wayflow/development/core/api/agent.html#wayflowcore.agent.Agent):

```python
from wayflowcore.agent import Agent

assistant = Agent(llm=llm)

conversation = assistant.start_conversation()
conversation.append_user_message("I need help regarding my sql query")
conversation.execute()

# get the assistant's response to your query
assistant_answer = conversation.get_last_message()
assistant_answer.content
# I'd be happy to help with your SQL query...
```

For more information on how to build flexible Agents, structured Flows and multi-agent patterns, read the [WayFlow Tutorials](https://oracle.github.io/wayflow/development/core/tutorials/index.html)


## Why WayFlow?

* **Flexibility** : WayFlow supports multiple approaches to building AI Assistants, including Agents and Flows.
* **Interoperability** : WayFlow works with LLMs from many different vendors and supports an open approach to integration.
* **Reusability** : WayFlow enables you to build reusable and composable components for rapid development of AI assistants.
* **Extensibility** : WayFlow has powerful abstractions to handle all types of LLM applications and provides a standard library of steps.
* **Openness** : WayFlow is an open-source project, welcoming contributions from diverse teams looking to take AI agents to the next step.

## Positioning in the Agentic Ecosystem


WayFlow is the reference runtime implementation for [Open Agent Spec][website-agentspec].
