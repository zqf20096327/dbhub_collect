**Graft** is an open-source transactional storage engine designed for efficient data synchronization at the edge. It supports lazy, partial replication with strong consistency, ensuring applications replicate only the data they need.

**Core Benefits:**

- **Lazy Replication**: Clients sync data on demand, saving network and compute.
- **Partial Replication**: Minimize bandwidth by syncing only required data.
- **Edge Optimization**: Lightweight client designed for edge, mobile, and embedded environments.
- **Strong Consistency**: Serializable Snapshot Isolation ensures correct, consistent data views.
- **Transactional Object Storage**: Graft turns object storage into a transactional system—supporting consistent updates to subsets of data at page granularity, without imposing any data format or schema.
- **Instant Read Replicas**: Decoupled metadata and data allow replicas to spin up immediately—no replay, no waiting for full recovery.

**Use Cases:**

- Offline-first and mobile applications
- Cross-platform synchronization
- Stateless replicas for serverless or embedded environments
- Diverse data replication scenarios
- Storage and replication for databases

## Using Graft

Graft should be considered **Alpha** quality software. Thus, please contact @carlsverre before using it in production. The easiest way to contact @carlsverre is via Discord on the [orbitinghail server][discord].

### SQLite extension

The easiest way to use Graft is via the Graft SQLite extension. [Please see the documentation][sqlite-docs] for instructions on how to download and use it with SQLite.

[sqlite-docs]: https://graft.rs/docs/sqlite/

### Rust Crate

Graft can be embedded in your Rust application directly, although for now that is left as an exercise for the reader. You can find the Rust docs here: https://docs.rs/graft

### Other languages?

You can use the Graft SQLite extension from any language that has a native SQLite library. Please [see the documentation for details][sqlite-docs].

If you'd like to access the Graft low-level Volume API from a language other than Rust, please [file an issue]!
