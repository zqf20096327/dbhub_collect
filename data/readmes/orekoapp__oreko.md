## Why Oreko

**Invoicing tools are expensive, and your data is trapped.** Most platforms use your client data and payment history as leverage to keep you locked in. It shouldn't work that way.

**A fresh approach to quoting and invoicing.** Oreko gives you a visual block-based builder for creating professional quotes that convert to invoices with zero data re-entry — inspired by modern tools like Notion and Linear.

**Open-source and community-driven.** Self-host for free with full control over your data, or use the managed cloud version. AGPL v3 licensed.

## Quick Start

### Using Docker for Services

The base `docker-compose.yml` runs supporting services (PostgreSQL, Mailpit) while you run Next.js locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/orekoapp/oreko.git
cd oreko
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local   # Next.js loads .env.local from apps/web/
docker-compose up -d                            # Start Postgres and Mailpit
pnpm install
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`

### Manual Installation (No Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/orekoapp/oreko.git
cd oreko
pnpm install
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local   # Next.js loads .env.local from apps/web/
# Ensure PostgreSQL is running and DATABASE_URL is set in apps/web/.env.local
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm dev
```

See the [full setup guide](https://oreko.app/docs) for detailed instructions.
