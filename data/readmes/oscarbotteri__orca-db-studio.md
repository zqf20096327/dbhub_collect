## What is it?

DB Studio is an [Orca](https://github.com/stablyai/orca) plugin for looking at a database from the place you already work.

If you run several agents in parallel, each in its own worktree, you probably keep TablePlus, DBeaver or `psql` open next to Orca just to check what an agent left in a table. DB Studio replaces that window switch: connect, see the tables, click one, edit the query, run it.

It works the same on **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL/MariaDB** and **SQLite**.

## Why another database client?

- **It lives in Orca.** No second window, and no copying connection strings around.
- **It understands worktrees.** Each Orca workspace can point at its own database. If a workspace's `.env` (or `.env.local`) defines `DATABASE_URL`, DB Studio offers that database, grouped by workspace. Nothing to configure, and the URL is never copied: it is read from the `.env` every time you use it.
- **One model for three engines.** Same panel, same editor, same grid. Engine differences stay inside the drivers.
- **Safe by default.** Passwords live only in Orca's secrets store, never in logs or plain storage. Results are always cut off at a ceiling, so a careless query cannot flood the tab or Orca's memory.

## How it works

1. Open the **DB Studio** panel in Orca's sidebar.
2. Pick a connection: one you saved (a server or a SQLite file), or a worktree connection read from a `.env`.
3. Expand it into databases, schemas, tables and views.
4. Click a table. A query document opens with `SELECT * FROM <table> LIMIT 100` and runs it.
5. Edit the SQL, run the statement under the cursor (or the selection) with <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>, and read the result in the grid below.

Every tab is a plain `.sql` file whose first line names its connection:

```sql
-- db-studio: connection=<ref>
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending' LIMIT 100;
```

Keep a query by moving the file out of `.db-studio/` (a folder Git ignores on its own). Any `.sql` file in your repo opens in the same editor, with a "Choose connection" control when it has no connection line.

## Features

**Connections**

- PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB and SQLite, from a form or a pasted connection string (`postgres://`, `mysql://`).
- Test, edit and delete saved connections.
- SQLite files saved as connections from the same form, picked from those found in your workspaces or pasted by path.
- Tag a saved connection with an environment (local, dev, staging, prod). Its query documents show a colored band and a badge in the toolbar, and the panel row names it. Worktree connections cannot be tagged.
- Worktree connections read from each workspace's `.env` / `.env.local`.

**Explorer**

- One tree for every engine: connection → database → schema → tables and views.
- Clear errors when a connection fails.

**Query editor**

- SQL editor with dialect-aware highlighting ([CodeMirror 6](docs/adr/0001-sql-editor-codemirror.md)).
- Autocomplete for tables, columns and keywords from the live schema.
- Run the statement under the cursor or the selection.
- Cancel a running query. It stops in the database, not only in the UI.
- Configurable timeout (30 s by default, 110 s at most).

**Results**

- Grid with a visible notice when the row limit (100 by default) or the result ceiling (5000 rows or about 900 KB) cuts a result.
- Long text shortened, binary shown as `<blob 1.2 KB>`, large integers and decimals kept exact.
- Open any cell's full value (up to 1 MiB) in a side panel, with JSON formatted.
- Affected row count for statements without rows.

## Under the hood

A database client is only useful if you can trust it with a large table or a slow query. These are the guarantees DB Studio is built around, and where each one is checked.

- **Rows are streamed, never loaded whole.** Every driver reads through a cursor and stops at the row limit or the result ceiling. `SELECT * FROM events` on a table with millions of rows reads 101 rows, not millions. ([Query results](docs/system-architecture.md#query-results))
- **Cancel reaches the database.** PostgreSQL gets `pg_cancel_backend`, MySQL/MariaDB get `KILL QUERY`, and a SQLite query's thread is stopped. The connection keeps working afterwards. ([Driver interface](docs/system-architecture.md#driver-interface))
- **A slow SQLite query never freezes Orca.** `node:sqlite` is synchronous, so each SQLite session runs in its own thread. ([ADR 0004](docs/adr/0004-sqlite-thread-loaded-by-node.md))
- **Values arrive exactly as stored.** Large integers and decimals travel as strings, so `9007199254740993` does not become `9007199254740992`.
- **Tested against real engines.** The same driver contract runs in CI against PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB containers and SQLite files. ([`test/drivers/`](test/drivers/))
- **Ready for Orca's plugin directory.** The drivers are pure JavaScript with no native modules, every file stays under 1 MiB, and CI fails if `vendor/` differs from a fresh build of the committed source in `build/`.

## Roadmap

A few of the things planned after the [MVP](https://github.com/oscarbotteri/orca-db-studio/milestone/1). Each version links to its GitHub milestone; requirement IDs refer to [`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md).

| Version                                                              | Highlights                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[v1](https://github.com/oscarbotteri/orca-db-studio/milestone/2)** | MCP server so agents can query read-only (`A1`, `A2`) · copy results as CSV, JSON, Markdown or `INSERT` (`G4`) · schema page with DDL (`S1`)                                                                                      |

## Getting started

You need Orca 1.4.248 or newer.

```bash
orca plugin install oscarbotteri/orca-db-studio
```

DB Studio runs its own code in a trusted worker, so Orca lists what it would be granted and asks you to approve it by re-running the command with the fingerprint it prints (`--approve <fingerprint>`). It asks for:

- **`secrets:own`**: to keep your saved passwords in Orca's encrypted secrets store.
- **`storage:own`** and **`settings:own`**: to keep your saved connections and settings.
- **`workspace:read`** and **`workspace:write`**: to find SQLite files and `.env` files in your workspaces, and to create query documents in `.db-studio/`.

Then open the **DB Studio** panel in Orca's sidebar.

### Settings

| Setting                 | Default        | What it does                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Connection variable     | `DATABASE_URL` | Variable read from each worktree's `.env` to offer its connection                               |
| Query timeout (seconds) | `30`           | The server ends a statement after this long (1 to 110)                                          |
| Row limit               | `100`          | Rows shown for a query without its own `LIMIT` (results never exceed 5000 rows or about 900 KB) |

### Run from source

To hack on DB Studio you need Node 24+ and the `orca` CLI.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oscarbotteri/orca-db-studio.git
cd orca-db-studio
npm ci && npm run types
orca plugin dev watch .   # loads the plugin into Orca and reloads on save
```

### Useful commands

| Command                         | What it does                                                                            |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run verify`                | Typecheck, `orca plugin validate`, lint and format check                                |
| `orca plugin test .`            | Unit and component tests                                                                |
| `orca plugin check .`           | Render checks for the panel and the editor                                              |
| `npm run test:drivers`          | Integration tests on real engines with Testcontainers (needs Docker)                    |
| `npm run test:drivers:coverage` | Driver tests with coverage of `src/drivers/`; HTML report in `coverage/` (needs Docker) |
| `npm run build`                 | Bundle the pure-JS drivers and CodeMirror into `vendor/`                                |
| `npm run qa:up`                 | Start the manual QA environment (see [`test/qa`](test/qa/README.md))                    |

`src/drivers/sqlite/thread.ts` always reads 0% in the coverage report: it runs in a `worker_threads` worker, which the main-process V8 coverage does not see, although the SQLite tests do exercise it. Read the SQLite total with that in mind.

## Project layout

```
src/
  drivers/   one driver per engine behind a single interface
  worker/    connections, query engine and documents; the only code that talks to a database
  panel/     side panel: connections and explorer
  editor/    query document editor: SQL editor and result grid
build/       esbuild scripts that produce vendor/
vendor/      bundled pure-JS drivers, committed with their source
docs/        PRD, architecture and decision records (ADRs)
```

Every database call goes through the worker; UI code never touches a driver directly. Read [`docs/system-architecture.md`](docs/system-architecture.md) for the details and [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) for why the non-obvious choices were made.
