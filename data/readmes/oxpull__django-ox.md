# Django tasks in your database

Stop running Redis to send an email. django-ox runs Django's Tasks framework in your existing database, where a dead worker doesn't mean lost tasks. Run a worker process, not a separate broker.

Supports Django 5.2 LTS through the `django-tasks` backport, and Django 6.0 / 6.1 through core `django.tasks`. Requires Python 3.12+.

## Install

```
pip install django-ox

# on Django 5.2 LTS
pip install "django-ox[backport]"
```

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    "django_ox",
]

TASKS = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "django_ox.backend.OxBackend",
    }
}
```

```
python manage.py migrate django_ox
python manage.py ox_worker
```

On Django 6.0+, use `from django.tasks import task`. On Django 5.2 LTS, use `from django_tasks import task`.

**[Follow the step-by-step guide](https://oxpull.com/django-ox/background-tasks/)** to build a working queue.

## Keep the work when a worker dies

Workers claim tasks with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` on PostgreSQL and MySQL 8+, or an atomic compare-and-set UPDATE on SQLite. A reaper returns unfinished tasks to the queue when their worker dies, subject to their stored attempt budgets. Failed tasks retry with exponential backoff by default, with every attempt's traceback kept.

On Django 6.1 or Django 5.2 with django-tasks 0.12+, each task can declare its own `max_attempts`, `backoff` callback and `timeout`. The budget counts claims including the first; backend settings supply the defaults. See [Per-task policy](https://oxpull.com/django-ox/configuration/#per-task-policy).

Execution is at-least-once: make tasks safe to repeat.

Enqueue inside `transaction.atomic()` on the database holding `OxTask`, and the task commits or rolls back with your application data. No `transaction.on_commit()` needed.

Inspect attempts and retry or discard tasks in Django admin. Open **Queue overview** from the task change list to compare queues. Edit recurring schedules in admin or declare them in settings; workers dispatch them without a scheduler process.

For fleet alerting, `ox_health` turns queue thresholds into an exit code. For local loop-liveness probes, pair `ox_worker --heartbeat-file PATH` with `ox_health --heartbeat-file PATH`, using the same process count. Both health modes support `--format json`. Monitor through `django_ox.stats` or `/ox/metrics`, and clear finished rows with `ox_prune`. Use `--database` on `ox_worker`, `ox_prune` and the database mode of `ox_health` to select the database alias.

In the [published benchmarks](https://oxpull.com/django-ox/benchmarks/), 2,000 of 2,000 tasks finished after 20 worker kills per trial, queue drain was up to 20% faster than django-tasks-db, and enqueueing 10,000 tasks took 0.71 s.

CI covers Python 3.12 to 3.14, Django 5.2 to 6.1, PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite. Open source under the BSD 3-Clause licence.

Documentation: <https://oxpull.com/django-ox/>

## One fewer service to run

A broker-based task queue adds a second datastore to your deployment. Redis or
RabbitMQ has to be provisioned, monitored, secured and upgraded, and it has to
be running before a single task executes. For an application that already
depends on a database, that is a full operational surface added for one feature.

django-ox uses the database you already run. A deployment is your application,
a worker process, and one migration. Backups already cover the queue, because
the queue is a table.

## Transactional enqueue

`enqueue()` is a single INSERT on the database that holds `OxTask`, your
default one unless a router sends it elsewhere. Open `transaction.atomic()`
on that database and the task becomes visible to workers only when the
transaction commits, and disappears on rollback. Rows you write to that
database in the same block go with it. There is no window where business data
exists without its task, or a task without its data, and no
`transaction.on_commit()` boilerplate. Execution is at-least-once: workers
claim tasks with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` on databases that support
it (PostgreSQL, MySQL 8+) and an atomic compare-and-set UPDATE elsewhere
(including SQLite), and a reaper returns tasks whose worker died to the queue.
Failed tasks retry with exponential backoff up to a configurable attempt
limit, keeping the full traceback of every attempt.

## Measured

[The benchmarks page](https://oxpull.com/django-ox/benchmarks/) compares
django-ox with `django-tasks-db`, another database backend for the Tasks
framework, on one machine with both arms on Django core `django.tasks` and
PostgreSQL 16: backlog drain at two queue depths with matched worker
processes, enqueue latency, bulk enqueue, worker death under repeated SIGKILL
with restarts, and exception retry. Every figure there is a median over five
interleaved runs with its range, computed from the raw JSON files committed
beside the page, and every run is reported.

## How it compares

The four backends a Django team is most likely to shortlist. Every cell about
another project comes from that project's own documentation or issue tracker,
each carrying a link and the date it was read on the
[Choosing a task backend](https://oxpull.com/django-ox/choosing/) page.

| | django-ox | django-tasks-db | Celery | huey |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `django.tasks` backend | **Yes**, native | **Yes**, native | **No** | **Yes**, in `huey.contrib.djhuey` |
| Broker to run | **None.** The queue is a table in the database you already run | **None.** Django ORM | RabbitMQ, Redis or SQS | Redis, SQLite, PostgreSQL, file or memory |
| Transactional enqueue | **Yes.** Enqueue is one INSERT on your default database; a task written inside `atomic()` commits or rolls back with the rows beside it | Not claimed | **No.** Django's own docs name this as the case for `on_commit()` | Not claimed |
| Worker killed mid-task | **Retried.** The lease expires and the task goes back on the queue | **Stuck.** The task stays `PROCESSING`, never retried and never failed. Open since 2024-06-11 | **Lost** when the child process is killed, even with `acks_late` | **Lost.** "will not be retried automatically" |
| Retries and backoff | **Exponential by default**, keeping every attempt's traceback. Per-task budget and backoff on Django 6.1 or Django 5.2 with django-tasks 0.12+ | **None** | Yes | Yes |
| Recurring schedules | **Cron or a fixed interval, and no scheduler process.** Editable in the Django admin, limited to the tasks your code exposes | **None** | `celery beat`, a separate process you must run exactly one of | Yes |

The full version has six more backends, a footnote and a date on every cell,
and a [section on when django-ox is the wrong choice](https://oxpull.com/django-ox/choosing/#when-not-to-use-django-ox).

## Configuration

Every option has a default; add one when you have a reason to.

```python
TASKS = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "django_ox.backend.OxBackend",
        "QUEUES": ["default", "emails"],  # [] allows any queue name
        "OPTIONS": {
            "MAX_ATTEMPTS": 3,  # claims per task before FAILED
            "LOCK_TIMEOUT": 300,  # seconds a worker may stop renewing its lease
            "BACKOFF_INITIAL": 5,  # first retry delay, seconds; doubles per attempt
            "BACKOFF_MAX": 600,  # retry delay ceiling, seconds
        },
    }
}
```

## Quickstart

```python
from django.tasks import task  # Django 6.0+
# On Django 5.2 the Tasks framework comes from the backport:
# from django_tasks import task


@task
def send_welcome_email(user_id): ...


result = send_welcome_email.enqueue(user_id=42)
result.refresh()  # later: status, return_value, errors
```

Run a worker:

```
python manage.py ox_worker
```

## Worker CLI

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--backend` | `default` | Backend alias from the `TASKS` setting. |
| `--queues` | all configured queues | Comma-separated queue names to process. |
| `--concurrency` | `1` | Tasks executed concurrently (thread pool). With Django's PostgreSQL pool, check [pool sizing](https://oxpull.com/django-ox/production/#database-connections-and-postgresql-pooling). |
| `--processes` | `1` | Worker processes under one supervisor. Each is a full worker with its own connections, reaper and `--concurrency` thread pool; budget database connections per process. A process that dies is restarted. POSIX only. |
| `--interval` | `1.0` | Polling interval in seconds when idle. |
| `--lock-timeout` | backend `LOCK_TIMEOUT` | Seconds a RUNNING task's lock may go unrefreshed before the task is reclaimed. |
| `--database` | the alias `OxTask` writes to | Database alias to run against. Every `--processes` child is given the same one. It is not checked against the router. |
| `--heartbeat-file PATH` | off | Update a local file at the head of every poll and drain pass. Above one process, write `PATH.supervisor` and `PATH.i` for each slot, not `PATH`. Requires an existing, writable directory private to the container. See [heartbeat liveness](https://oxpull.com/django-ox/monitoring/#local-heartbeat-files). |
| `--batch` | off | Exit once an error-free poll pass finds nothing to claim and began with none of its own tasks in flight. Schedule-scoped failures do not hold a batch open. For cron and job runners. Single process only. |
| `--max-tasks N` | none | Exit after claiming N task attempts, failed attempts and retries included. Single process only. |

On SIGTERM or SIGINT the worker requests a stop to claiming, drains
in-flight tasks after its current poll pass returns, then exits. A second
signal forces an immediate exit. A wedged database call can prevent the
drain from starting and require a second signal or SIGKILL. With
`--processes` above 1, send the signal to the supervisor; it forwards once
and restarts a worker that dies.

## Pruning

Finished task rows stay in the table until pruned. Run `ox_prune` on your
own schedule (cron, systemd timer):

```
python manage.py ox_prune --older-than 7d
```

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--queue` | all queues | Delete only this queue's task rows, so queues with different retention needs can be pruned separately. |
| `--older-than` | `7d` | Minimum time since the task finished. Accepts `7d`, `24h`, `90m`, `45s`, or a plain number of seconds. |
| `--include-failed` | off | Also delete FAILED and LOST rows. By default they are kept: they hold the per-attempt tracebacks and can be retried. |
| `--batch-size` | `1000` | Rows per DELETE statement, so pruning a large table never takes a long lock or builds a giant IN clause. |
| `--dry-run` | off | Report how many rows would be deleted without deleting any. |
| `--format` | `text` | `json` prints one object on stdout instead of the two report lines: `queue`, `cutoff`, `statuses`, `task_rows`, `tick_rows` and `dry_run`. `queue` is `null` when no `--queue` is given, `cutoff` is ISO 8601, and `statuses` is a list. On a database error during deletion, the object is printed too, with counts of rows already deleted in committed batches, before the same non-zero exit. |
| `--database` | the alias `OxTask` writes to | Database alias to prune. The rows it reads and the rows it deletes are on that one alias. |

Only SUCCESSFUL and DISCARDED rows (and, with `--include-failed`, FAILED and
LOST rows) past the cutoff are deleted. READY, WAITING and RUNNING rows are
never touched, whatever their age. Old rows from the recurring-schedule tick
log are cleared with the same
cutoff, always keeping each schedule's most recent tick, and `--queue` does
not narrow that.

## Health and monitoring

`django_ox.stats` exposes queue metrics as plain functions, each a single
ORM query: per-queue status counts, backlog depth and age, throughput,
and failure rate. The database mode of `ox_health` turns thresholds on
those numbers into an exit code for fleet alerting:

```
python manage.py ox_health --max-backlog 1000 --max-age 600
```

For local controlling-loop liveness, enable `ox_worker --heartbeat-file PATH`
and run `ox_health --heartbeat-file PATH` with the same `--processes N`.
This mode checks file metadata without querying the database.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--queue` | all queues | Restrict the database checks to one queue. |
| `--format` | `text` | `json` prints one object on stdout instead of the `OK:` line, on success and failure. Database mode includes `ok`, `queue`, `backlog`, `oldest_age_seconds`, `last_claim_age_seconds` and `problems`. `queue` is `null` when no queue is selected; figures are `null` when there is nothing to measure or the check cannot run. File mode includes `ok`, `heartbeat_file`, `processes`, `max_heartbeat_age_seconds`, `files` and `problems`. See the [JSON reference](https://oxpull.com/django-ox/monitoring/#file-mode-json). |
| `--max-backlog` | off | Fail when more than this many READY tasks are eligible to run. |
| `--max-age` | off | Fail when a READY task has been eligible to run for longer than this. Accepts `7d`, `24h`, `90m`, `45s`, or a plain number of seconds. |
| `--worker-timeout` | off | Fail when no worker has claimed a task within this long, or no claim was ever recorded. Accepts `7d`, `24h`, `90m`, `45s`, or a plain number of seconds. Measures fleet claim activity, not one worker's liveness. |
| `--database` | the alias `OxTask` writes to | Database alias to check. The figures come from that alias, so the check reports the queue your workers are running. |
| `--heartbeat-file PATH` | off | Check the worker's local heartbeat files instead of the database. Cannot be combined with database or queue health options. |
| `--max-heartbeat-age SECONDS` | `60` | Maximum file age, inclusive. Accepts duration suffixes or seconds, including fractions; must be finite and positive. Requires `--heartbeat-file`. |
| `--processes N` | `1` | Expected worker process count. At 1, check `PATH`; above 1, require `PATH.supervisor` and every slot file from `PATH.0` through `PATH.(N-1)` to pass. Requires `--heartbeat-file`. |

A passing file probe means the expected controlling loops have advanced
recently, not that tasks are progressing. A hung database can make every
file stale and trigger fleet-wide liveness restarts. Use an existing,
writable directory private to the container, allow for startup and slot
replacement, and keep project Django startup database-free. See the
[probe guidance](https://oxpull.com/django-ox/monitoring/#health-checks-ox_health)
before enabling automatic restarts.

Mounting `path("ox/", include("django_ox.urls"))` exposes `GET /ox/metrics`,
the same numbers as Prometheus gauges; the view has no authentication of its
own.

When `django.contrib.admin` is installed, django-ox registers a filterable
task list and a read-only detail page with every attempt's traceback. The
list provides **Retry selected tasks** and **Discard selected tasks**
actions. The same operations are `django_ox.actions.retry(result_id)` and
`django_ox.actions.discard(result_id)`. A retry is one more attempt on a
FAILED or LOST task; a discard closes a READY, WAITING, FAILED or LOST task
without running it. Neither touches a running task.

Open **Queue overview** from the task change list to compare retained status
counts, eligible READY tasks, the oldest eligible task's age, five-minute
throughput and failure rate, and time since the last claim. READY includes
deferred tasks; Eligible ready excludes them. Status totals are retained
rows, not lifetime counts.

Each visit scans retained task rows, so cost grows with retention. The page
does not refresh automatically. It uses the database alias selected by
`router.db_for_write(OxTask)`. To show rows processed by
`ox_worker --database other`, that router selection must also resolve to
`other`.

Worker lifecycle events (claim, start, success, retry, failure, reclaim,
shutdown) log to the `django_ox` logger with stable extra keys (task id,
queue, attempt, duration), ready for JSON log handlers.

## Recurring tasks

Schedules are declared in settings, next to the backend they enqueue
through, so they deploy with your code. There is no separate scheduler
process to keep alive:

```python
TASKS = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "django_ox.backend.OxBackend",
        "QUEUES": ["default", "emails"],
        "OPTIONS": {
            "SCHEDULES": {
                "nightly-report": {
                    "task": "reports.tasks.build_report",
                    "cron": "0 3 * * *",
                    "kwargs": {"full": True},
                },
                "warm-cache": {
                    "task": "core.tasks.warm_cache",
                    "cron": "*/15 * * * *",
                },
            },
        },
    }
}
```

Each tick enqueues a normal task instance, which workers claim and execute
through the ordinary queue: retries, backoff, priorities and the result
store all apply unchanged. Every running worker doubles as the scheduler,
and a unique constraint on (schedule name, tick time) enqueues each due tick
once however many workers are polling. Execution stays at-least-once.

| Key | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `task` | yes | Dotted path to a `@task` callable, e.g. `"reports.tasks.build_report"`. |
| `cron` | one of | Five-field cron expression. |
| `every` | one of | A fixed interval, as a `timedelta` or seconds, counted from a fixed instant rather than from the last run. |
| `phase` | no | Shifts an `every` sequence. |
| `args`, `kwargs` | no | JSON-serializable arguments passed to each enqueue. The database must also accept the values; serialization alone does not establish that. |
| `queue_name` | no | Queue override; defaults to the task's own queue. |
| `priority` | no | Priority override (-100 to 100). |

Cron expressions use the classic five-field syntax: `*`, lists (`1,15`),
ranges (`mon-fri`), steps (`*/15`), month and weekday names, 0 or 7 for
Sunday, and the `@hourly`, `@daily`, `@weekly`, `@monthly` and `@yearly`
shortcuts. When both day-of-month and day-of-week are restricted, a day
matches if either field does, as in vixie cron. Times are wall-clock in
your `TIME_ZONE`.

A task path that does not import or an expression that can never fire fails
at worker startup and in `manage.py check`. These checks do not establish
database acceptance: a value such as `float("inf")` passes them but is
rejected at enqueue by PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite. A schedule-scoped
failure is logged as `schedule_dispatch_error`. After rollback, the worker
continues to later schedules if the same database connection remains usable.

Missed ticks: if every worker was down when a tick passed, the latest
missed tick fires once on recovery and older ones are skipped, so a
nightly job still runs after an unlucky deploy window but a backlog never
stampedes. A newly deployed schedule waits for its next tick rather than
firing for a time before it existed.

Schedules can also live in the database and be edited in the Django admin
without a deploy, for the cases where whoever needs to pause a job cannot
ship one. A row names a task the code has exposed rather than an import
path, so admin access does not become permission to run anything. See
[Schedules in the database](https://oxpull.com/django-ox/stored-schedules/).

## Behavior details

- `run_after` (deferred tasks), `priority` (-100 to 100, higher runs first),
  `get_result()` and the async variants are all supported; the backend
  declares `supports_defer`, `supports_priority`, `supports_get_result` and
  `supports_async_task` accordingly.
- Retry state is visible in the database: attempts, per-attempt tracebacks,
  and the next scheduled run (`run_after`).
- Because execution is at-least-once, tasks should be idempotent. A task is
  retried both when it raises and when its worker dies mid-run. The lease
  number stops two workers writing the same row; it does not stop two threads
  running the same task body, which is a property of every at-least-once
  queue. [What the lease guarantees, precisely](https://oxpull.com/django-ox/production/#what-the-lease-guarantees-precisely).
- Concurrency uses a thread pool. That fits I/O-bound tasks (email, HTTP,
  ORM); for CPU-bound work, run `--processes N --concurrency 1`, which is N
  worker processes under one supervisor.

## Scope

The core is finite on purpose: a durable queue, a worker, recurring
schedules, monitoring, and nothing else to operate. Interrupting one chosen
running task on demand is outside the current scope. Attempt deadlines can
be set with `TASK_TIMEOUT`, per queue with `TASK_TIMEOUTS`, or per task
with `timeout` on Django 6.1 or Django 5.2 with django-tasks 0.12+.
See [Task timeouts](https://oxpull.com/django-ox/production/#task-timeouts)
for enforcement and its limits.

django-ox keeps all its own tables on one database, the one your router
sends `OxTask` to. `django_ox.E008` reports a router that splits them. Under
a router that sends reads to a replica, django-ox reads its own rows on the
alias it writes them to. The admin has no way out of that: every page reads
the primary, and no setting changes it. `ox_worker`, `ox_prune` and the
database mode of `ox_health` take `--database` to name the alias django-ox
works on. It defaults to the alias `OxTask` writes to, `default` unless you
wrote a router. The flag is not checked against the router: a worker pointed
at another alias works there and nothing warns, so leave it unset unless you
mean it. See
[Read replicas](https://oxpull.com/django-ox/configuration/#read-replicas).

Batches, unique tasks, rate limiting and workflows are in
[Oxpull Pro](https://oxpull.com/django-ox/pro/), a paid add-on; <https://oxpull.com/> has the details. Metrics stay in this
package: `django_ox.stats` and `ox_health` are free and stay free.
