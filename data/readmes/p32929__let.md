## What is LET?

**LET** stands for **Life Events Tracker** - an app designed to help you:

- Track daily habits (exercise, meditation, reading, water intake)
- Monitor health & fitness (sleep hours, workouts, meals)
- Follow goals & milestones
- Log mood & wellbeing
- Record important life events

## What This Project IS

- A React Native project built with Expo
- A cross-platform app (iOS, Android, Web)
- A habit tracker and life event logger
- An open-source project you can contribute to
- A showcase of what vibe-coding can achieve
- Built entirely by talking to an AI (yes, really)

## What This Project IS NOT

- A unicorn (sorry, no magical horns here)
- A replacement for your therapist
- A time machine (can't track events that haven't happened yet... or can we?)
- A social network (your data stays on your device)
- Something that will make you coffee (working on it)
- Written by a human (see acknowledgments below)

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use this for commercial purposes?**
A: Check the license. But why would you? It's a habit tracker, not a gold mine.

**Q: Why is it called LET?**
A: Life Events Tracker. Also, "let" as in "let yourself be better." Deep, right?

**Q: Does it sync to the cloud?**
A: Nope. Your data, your device, your privacy. Old school.

**Q: I found a bug!**
A: Create an issue. Or fix it and submit a PR. Or blame the AI.

## Troubleshooting

Before asking me anything:

1. **Ask a good LLM first** - They're smarter than both of us combined
2. **Read the docs** - Expo, React Native, they have great documentation
3. **Search existing issues** - Someone might have had the same problem
4. **If all else fails** - Pray to God, then start reading the code. Good luck, you'll need it.

### The Vibe-Coding Confession

I have to be honest with you. I **vibe-coded** this entire project.

What does that mean? It means:

- I didn't write a single line of code manually
- I just talked to Claude (the AI, not some French guy)
- I mostly drank tea and approved changes
- The AI did all the heavy lifting
- If there are bugs, blame the AI (just kidding, blame me for not prompting better)

This is what the future looks like, folks. I described what I wanted, and an AI built it. We're living in the future, and it's both amazing and slightly terrifying.

## Why I Built This

I built this project because I was working on something bigger and needed to evaluate a framework that could handle iOS, Android, and Web simultaneously - with proper UI consistency and fast load times across all platforms.

So I started with something simple enough to test the framework's capabilities without getting lost in complex business logic.

**The honest truth?** React Native isn't perfect yet. NativeWind and the shadcn-like component library (React Native Reusables) have their fair share of issues. I spent a lot of time debugging, running the app on all platforms, and fixing platform-specific quirks.

I did consider switching to Flutter or Tauri Mobile, but:
- Flutter Web takes forever to load (not ideal for web-first experiences)
- Tauri Mobile is still too new and experimental

So I stuck with React Native + Expo, debugged issues platform by platform, and eventually ended up with a usable app that works everywhere. Sometimes the best choice is the one you can actually ship.

### Special Thanks

- **Claude (Anthropic)** - For writing all this code while I watched
- **The Expo Team** - For making React Native actually usable
- **You** - For reading this far (seriously, why are you still here?)
