A local-first SNOMED CT toolchain that's 10-100x faster than IHTSDO Snowstorm. One binary - from raw RF2 release to NDJSON, then SQL, Parquet, Markdown, TUI, GUI, graphs and MCP/LLM tool use. All on your machine, no network calls, REST APIs, or external servers required.

This is very much a work in progress, but it's ready to use and I would very much like feedback on how it performs for you.

    AR --> SEM["sct semantic · vector search"]
    PQ --> DUCK["DuckDB / pandas / Polars"]
    MD --> RAG["RAG / LLM file reading"]
```

Plus `sct diff` (compare two NDJSON releases), `sct info` (inspect any artefact),
and `sct gui` / `sct tui` for visual, point-and-click exploration.

The canonical NDJSON artefact at the centre is stable, versionable, and greppable. The main file contains concepts; `--refsets all` adds provenance-declared payload-refset and history companion streams so non-concept RF2 rows remain lossless. All other outputs are derived from this NDJSON bundle and can be regenerated at any time.

---

## Why is this needed?

`sct` joins the relatively incomprehensible RF2 files into a canonical concept NDJSON stream, with companion NDJSON only when payload or history refsets are requested. For the UK Monolith Edition the concept file is over 1 GB but it was still possible to load into VSCode to get a feel for the data structure, which is something that is impossible with the original RF2 files. This also means you can use standard tools like `jq` or `ripgrep` to query the data without needing a custom server or API.

SNOMED CT is distributed as RF2 - a set of tab-separated files that require joining across multiple tables to get anything useful. The entire healthcare industry relies on remote terminology servers for this, with the overhead of network calls and REST APIs. `sct` performs the join once creating an NDJSON artefact, and produces standard files you can query locally with `sqlite3`, `duckdb`, `jq`, `ripgrep`, or an LLM. No server, no API key, no network.

## Speed comparison

| Operation | `sct` + SQLite | Snowstorm Lite | `sct` speedup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Import - Clinical Edition | 22s | 209s | ~10x faster |
| Import - Full UK Monolith | ~57s | Failed (OOM)* | ∞ |
| Single concept lookup (SCTID) | 6ms | 491ms | ~80x faster |
| Free-text search (10 results) | 2ms | 202ms | ~100x faster |

> * Snowstorm Lite running in Docker with 24Gb of Java heap allocation ran out of memory on the full UK Monolith, which has 837,930 concepts. `sct` handled it in under a minute.

These comparison numbers predate the current 837,930-concept release and haven't been re-run against a live Snowstorm Lite instance since - treat them as indicative rather than current. For up-to-date `sct`-only timings, see [docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md). Feel free to run the benchmarks yourself (including a fresh Snowstorm Lite comparison) and share your results, perhaps as an Issue.

## Installation

Prebuilt binaries are published for Linux (x86_64, aarch64), macOS (Apple Silicon, Intel), and Windows (x86_64) on every release, with SHA-256 checksums you can verify against the `SHA256SUMS` file on the [Releases page](https://github.com/pacharanero/sct/releases).

### Shell one-liners

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pacharanero/sct/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pacharanero/sct/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Both installers auto-detect your OS and architecture, download the matching binary, verify its SHA-256 checksum against the published `SHA256SUMS`, and install to `~/.local/bin` (macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\sct\bin` (Windows). Override the destination with `SCT_INSTALL_DIR`, or pin a specific version with `SCT_VERSION=v0.3.9`.

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```bash
brew tap pacharanero/tap
brew install sct
```

### Arch Linux ([AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sct-rs-bin))

```bash
yay -S sct-rs-bin
```

### Scoop (Windows)

```powershell
scoop bucket add pacharanero https://github.com/pacharanero/scoop
scoop install sct
```

### Cargo

If you already have a Rust toolchain (via [rustup](https://rustup.rs), stable 1.88+):

```bash
# Compile from crates.io
cargo install sct-rs
```

Or, if you have the [`cargo-binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) plugin installed (it is not bundled with `cargo` itself), grab a prebuilt binary instead of compiling from source:

```bash
# One-time: install the binstall plugin (or follow the one-liner installers in its README)
cargo install cargo-binstall

# Then install sct without compilation
cargo binstall sct-rs
```

### Nix

With [Nix](https://nixos.org) and flakes enabled, run `sct` straight from the repository without installing it, add it to your profile, or drop into a dev shell:

```bash
# Run without installing anything
nix run github:pacharanero/sct -- lookup 22298006

# Install into your profile
nix profile install github:pacharanero/sct

# Dev shell with the Rust toolchain, for hacking on sct
nix develop github:pacharanero/sct
```

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pacharanero/sct
cd sct
cargo install --path .                   # default build: core commands + sct serve + sct tui
cargo install --path . --features gui    # add the browser UI (sct gui)
cargo install --path . --features dmwb   # add the NHS DMWB .mdb reader (sct dmwb)
cargo install --path . --features full   # everything: serve + tui + gui + dmwb + diagram SVG
```

| Feature | Default? | What it adds | Extra dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|
| `serve` | yes | FHIR R4 terminology server (`sct serve`) | `axum`, `tokio` |
| `tui` | yes | Interactive terminal UI - powers both `sct tui` and the live `sct sayt` view | `ratatui`, `crossterm` |
| `gui` | opt-in | Browser-based graph UI (`sct gui`) | `axum`, `tokio`, `open` |
| `dmwb` | opt-in | Read NHS Data Migration Workbench `.mdb` files (`sct dmwb`) | `jetdb` |
| `diagram-svg` | opt-in | Built-in SVG output for `sct diagram` | `layout-rs` |
| `full` | opt-in | Everything: `serve` + `tui` + `gui` + `dmwb` + `diagram-svg` | all of the above |

Every other subcommand (RF2 conversion, SQLite/Parquet/Markdown/Arrow, search, ECL, maps, codelists, MCP, diff, info…) is always compiled in. Only a `--no-default-features` build - such as the headless Docker server image - drops `serve` and `tui`.

### Manual download

Grab the appropriate archive from the [Releases page](https://github.com/pacharanero/sct/releases), verify its SHA-256 against `SHA256SUMS`, extract, and drop `sct` somewhere on your `PATH`.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Download a distribution of SNOMED CT
#    UK:            https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/ → Monolith Edition, RF2: Snapshot
#                   (free under NHS England national licence - access is immediate)
#                   NB: You need to Subscribe to a release before you can see the Download option 🤯
#    International: https://mlds.ihtsdotools.org/ (allow up to a week for approval)

# 2. Convert RF2 → NDJSON (~52s for 837,930 concepts)
#    Pass the .zip directly - no manual extraction needed
sct ndjson --rf2 SnomedCT_MonolithRF2_PRODUCTION_20260311T120000Z.zip
# ✓  837,930 concepts written → snomedct-monolithrf2-production-20260311t120000z.ndjson

# 3. Load into SQLite with FTS5
#    The release name carries through - every build command names its output
#    after its input, and prints the name it chose
sct sqlite --ndjson snomedct-monolithrf2-production-20260311t120000z.ndjson
# ✓  Output: snomedct-monolithrf2-production-20260311t120000z.db

# 4. Query with standard tools - no custom binary needed
sqlite3 snomedct-monolithrf2-production-20260311t120000z.db \
  "SELECT id, preferred_term FROM concepts_fts WHERE concepts_fts MATCH 'heart attack' LIMIT 5"

# 5. Start the MCP server for Claude Desktop
#    No --db needed: sct discovers the database you just built
sct mcp
```

UK users can automate steps 1–3 with a single command once the [TRUD API integration](docs/commands/trud.md) is set up. Store your TRUD API key once, then download and build in one go:

```bash
sct trud auth < my-trud-key.txt              # one-time: verifies and saves the key
sct trud download --edition uk_monolith --pipeline
```

Or, on a fresh VPS with Docker installed, run the FHIR terminology server from
this checkout - `sct` plus a [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) reverse proxy for
automatic HTTPS:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env   # set TRUD_API_KEY, and DOMAIN for real HTTPS
docker compose up -d --build
```

The first boot downloads the configured TRUD edition, builds `snomed.db` into a
persistent Docker volume, and serves FHIR at `https://$DOMAIN/fhir` (or
`http://localhost/fhir` if `DOMAIN` is left unset). See
[Get Your Own Terminology Server](docs/deploy/index.md) for the full
walkthrough, including optional basic auth and a no-clone route using the
published Docker Hub image.

## Feedback

Please try it out and let me know how it performs for you, especially if you have a use case that isn't well supported by the current subcommands. Open an [Issue](https://github.com/pacharanero/sct/issues) for anything you want to report, from bugs to feature requests to general feedback.

## Development

A [devcontainer](https://containers.dev/) configuration is included in `.devcontainer/`. Open the project in VS Code and select "Reopen in Container" to get a ready-to-go environment with Rust, `sqlite3`, `duckdb`, `jq`, and `ripgrep` pre-installed. Also included is `python3` and Ollama, for working with the embeddings and semantic search features.

Store SNOMED data files (zips, NDJSON, databases) in the `data-volume/` directory inside the container - it's backed by a Docker volume for faster I/O than the default bind mount.
