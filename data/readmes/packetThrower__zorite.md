Zorite is a daily-journal note app for the desktop, organized like Logseq but
edited like an ordinary document rather than an outliner. Notes are Markdown in
a local SQLite database. Pages link to each other with `[[wiki-links]]`, and
the app also handles PDFs (viewing, annotating, form filling), images,
whiteboards, and LaTeX math. There is no cloud and no account; everything stays
on your machine. Written in Rust with [gpui](https://www.gpui.rs/) (Zed's UI
framework) and
[gpui-component](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component).

Developed in close collaboration with Claude (Anthropic).

📝 [**Changelog**](CHANGELOG.md) · 🗺️ [**Roadmap**](TODO.md)

## Features

### Writing

- The journal is a feed of days, newest first. Everything is plain text, and
  clicking anywhere places the caret. Markdown renders as you type; the markers
  reappear when the caret is on them.
- CommonMark and GFM, plus a few extras: tables are edited cell by cell, GitHub
  alerts work (including Obsidian's foldable `> [!NOTE]-` form), headings can be
  collapsed, code blocks are syntax-highlighted, and Mermaid diagrams render in
  the current theme's colors.
- A `/` menu inserts Markdown constructs, the current date or time, a table via
  a size picker, a property row, and your own templates (see below).
- `[[` completes page names, `#` completes tags, and `{{` completes template
  placeholders. Brackets auto-pair, and an optional auto-linker turns existing
  page titles into links as you type.
- Inline `$…$` and display `$$…$$` LaTeX render as typeset math. Clicking into
  a formula opens a structural editor in the style of MathQuill: fractions,
  roots, matrices, delimiters, and accents (`\hat`, `\bar`, `\vec`, …) are
  live slots you arrow through; type `\` for an autocomplete of commands, or
  select part of a formula with the mouse and wrap it. Formulas can be copied
  as LaTeX or exported as PNG/SVG.
- **Right-to-left text.** Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and mixed-direction notes
  lay out correctly in both the editor and the reading view — paragraphs,
  headings, lists and tasks, tables (columns mirror), quotes, alerts,
  properties, links, and inline math — with the caret, selection, and clicks
  following the visual order.
- Lines can be reordered by dragging the six-dot grip in the gutter, and
  Copy puts formatted rich text on the clipboard alongside the Markdown, so a
  paste into a mail client or document keeps headings, bold, and lists.

· [Math](https://packetthrower.github.io/zorite/usage/math/)*

### Linking and organization

- Wiki links create pages on first use. Every page lists its backlinks, plus
  unlinked mentions that can be converted with a click. `Projects::Tasks`
  titles form a namespace tree, and renaming a namespace renames its children.
- Any line can be given a ` ^id` anchor and linked with `[[Note#^id]]`, or
  type `((` and pick any block from a searchable list, Logseq-style; headings
  can be linked directly. `![[Note]]` embeds another note (or one of its
  sections or blocks) and updates live when the source changes. A page's
  `alias::` names complete in `[[` too. Both the reading view and the editor
  render all of this.
- `key:: value` lines render as a properties panel with per-key icons; tags and
  links in values are clickable. Panels are edited in place, and a Properties
  page indexes every key and value across the database.
- For navigation there's an all-pages list, a graph view, a calendar marking
  days with entries, favorites, and tabs that can be torn off into separate
  windows (and restored on relaunch). Right-click any page — in the sidebar,
  a tab, a link, search results — for the same page menu.

· [All pages & the graph](https://packetthrower.github.io/zorite/usage/navigate/)*

### Files, PDFs, and whiteboards

- Images can be pasted or dropped in (HEIC and AVIF included) and resized by
  dragging a corner. An image in the middle of a sentence displays as a
  thumbnail. Duplicate files are stored once, and unused files can be swept.
- The PDF viewer virtualizes pages, so long documents open and scroll without
  loading everything. It has a table of contents, text search, password
  support, fit-width / fit-page zoom, drag-to-highlight annotations (text
  or a drawn area) that link back to notes, and AcroForm form filling —
  checkboxes, text fields, dropdowns, Tab between fields — with saved files
  that render correctly in other viewers. A file that can't be opened says
  why instead of loading forever, and offers to open it in the system viewer.
- `⌘P` exports the current note as a styled PDF, including tables, images,
  math, and diagrams. No browser involved. (One quirk: the export writes
  glyphs directly, so font ligatures render in the app but not in the PDF.)
- Whiteboards are infinite pan-and-zoom canvases with shapes, arrows, freehand
  drawing, images, text, templates, and cards that link back to pages —
  plus mindmap and flowchart connectors that stay attached when you move
  things.

· [Whiteboards](https://packetthrower.github.io/zorite/usage/whiteboards/)*

### Search

- Full-text search runs on a trigram index and updates on every keystroke,
  staying fast into the tens of thousands of pages (numbers below). Results are
  grouped by type — pages, PDFs, images, whiteboards — with filter chips.
  `⌘F` finds within the open page or across the journal feed, while you edit.

*Details: [Search](https://packetthrower.github.io/zorite/usage/search/)*

### Privacy, customization, and languages

- More than one set of notes? **Notebooks** are self-contained data folders
  (a work set, a personal set, a folder in Dropbox) switched from a chip at
  the bottom of the sidebar or Settings → Notebooks; switching relaunches
  into the picked one.
- Notes live in one local SQLite file, with images and PDFs beside it. The
  whole database can be encrypted (SQLCipher, AES-256), with an unlock screen,
  optional keychain storage of the password, and an idle auto-lock.
- Importers exist for Obsidian (vault, links, properties, callouts, canvas
  boards) and Logseq (graph, whiteboards, PDF highlights); imports don't touch
  the source. And the way out is just as open: File → Export Notebook as
  Markdown writes the whole notebook as plain markdown + assets (whiteboards
  as JSON Canvas), readable by any other app.
- The app speaks **English and 简体中文** (Settings → General → Language);
  the Chinese localization is community-contributed. Translations are plain
  YAML files, so adding a language is a pull request, not a rebuild.
- Appearance: built-in and JSON-file themes, light/dark/auto (Auto follows the
  OS), any installed or imported font, an adjustable text size, an optional
  line-number gutter, a sidebar that docks left or right, and custom mouse
  cursor themes (any XCursor pack) — all without forking the UI toolkit.
- A command palette (`⌘⇧P`) runs any menu command, current-page action,
  navigation (today, a date, All pages, Graph), or quick setting (WYSIWYG,
  theme, line numbers, sidebar) by name, showing its shortcut. Every keyboard shortcut is listed under Settings → Shortcuts,
  grouped by where it applies (app, editing, whiteboard, PDF). The app checks for updates
  on launch (pre-releases opt-in) and links to the release notes.
- Hardened by a security audit: links open only `http`, `https`, and `mailto`;
  imports and exports can't read or write outside their folders; the database
  and data folder are created private to your user.

## Templates

Create a page named `Templates` and define snippets with `!name` headers — every
line under a `!name` (until the next `!name`) is that template's body:

```text
!meeting
## Meeting {{date}}
- Attendees:
- Notes: {{cursor}}

!standup
- Yesterday:
- Today:
- Blockers:
```

Then type `/meeting` in any day or page to insert it. Placeholders expand on
insert: `{{date}}`, `{{time}}`, `{{title}}` (the current page/day), and
`{{cursor}}` (where the caret lands). Built-in Markdown commands live in
[`zorite-markdown`](crates/zorite-markdown/README.md) as `SNIPPETS`.

## Themes

Zorite ships several built-in themes (Zorite, Nord, Solarized, Dracula, Tokyo
Night, Foundry, Cyberpunk, CRT, E-Ink), each with a light and dark variant
(Cyberpunk and CRT are dark-only). Open **Settings** (the ⚙ in the title bar) to
pick a theme and choose **Light / Dark / Auto** (Auto follows your system
appearance). A quick light/dark toggle also lives in the title bar.

Settings → Appearance also picks the app **font** (any installed family, or
import a `.ttf`/`.otf`) and the note **text size**; a custom theme can name its
own font and override every palette token — see the
[themes docs](https://packetthrower.github.io/zorite/customize/themes/).

Drop a `.json` file in your themes folder (Settings → **Reveal themes folder**)
and click **Reload**. Any color you omit falls back to the base palette, so a
theme can be just a few colors:

```json
{
  "id": "midnight",
  "name": "Midnight",
  "dark": {
    "bg_window": "#0d1117",
    "bg_sidebar": "#161b22",
    "bg_content": "#0d1117",
    "fg": "#e6edf3",
    "accent": "#ff7b72",
    "tag": "#d2a8ff",
    "code": "#79c0ff"
  },
  "light": { "accent": "#0969da" }
}
```

Tokens (each `#RRGGBB`): `bg_window`, `bg_sidebar`, `bg_content`, `fg` (text),
`accent`, `tag`, `code`. Provide a `dark` and/or `light` block. Add
`"dark_only": true` for an always-dark theme.

## Install

Every release attaches `.dmg`, `.exe`/`.msi`, `.deb`, `.AppImage`, `.rpm`, and
`.pkg.tar.zst` artifacts plus `SHA256SUMS` on the
[Releases](https://github.com/packetThrower/zorite/releases) page. On macOS and
Windows, the package managers track the latest stable tag and get you past the
first-launch Gatekeeper / SmartScreen warnings.

```sh
# macOS — Homebrew (6.0.0+ requires trusting the tap before installing)
brew tap packetThrower/tap
brew trust packetThrower/tap
brew install --cask zorite                          # stable
brew install --cask zorite@alpha                    # pre-release

# Windows — winget (Microsoft's package manager, preinstalled)
winget install packetThrower.Zorite                 # or: winget install zorite

# Windows — Scoop
scoop bucket add packetThrower https://github.com/packetThrower/scoop-bucket
scoop install zorite                                # stable
scoop install zorite-prerelease                     # pre-release
```

```sh
# NixOS / Nix (Linux) — builds from source via the repo flake
nix run github:packetThrower/zorite
```

winget carries **stable only**; for pre-release builds on Windows use Scoop or
the [Releases](https://github.com/packetThrower/zorite/releases) page directly.
Linux users grab the matching `.deb` / `.rpm` / `.AppImage` / `.pkg.tar.zst`
from Releases (`pacman -U` for the Arch package). The AppImage carries update
information and ships a `.zsync`, so AppImageUpdate, AppImageLauncher, and
friends can delta-update it (from 0.11.0 onward).

To install by hand, download from Releases and drag `Zorite.app` to
`/Applications` on macOS, or run the installer on Windows. The macOS builds are
ad-hoc signed, so the first launch needs a right-click → **Open** (or
`xattr -cr Zorite.app`); the Windows installer is unsigned, so SmartScreen needs
**More info → Run anyway**. Notarized macOS and signed Windows builds are planned
— see [TODO.md](TODO.md).

## Building from source

The repo is a Rust workspace: the app plus six reusable crates.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:packetThrower/zorite.git
cd zorite
cargo run                       # debug build + launch
cargo build --release           # optimized binary at target/release/zorite
cargo test --workspace          # run the tests
```

The first `cargo build` compiles gpui's full dependency graph and takes a few
minutes; incremental builds are fast. Toolchain: a recent stable Rust (via
[rustup](https://rustup.rs/)). Platform libraries:

- **macOS**: Xcode command-line tools (`xcode-select --install`).
- **Debian / Ubuntu**: `sudo apt install libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libwayland-dev libx11-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libxcb-xkb-dev libxcb-cursor-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxcb-render0-dev libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype-dev pkg-config`
- **Windows**: nothing extra; the gpui DirectX backend ships with Windows 10+.

Your data lives at:

| OS      | Path                                                   |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| macOS   | `~/Library/Application Support/zorite/zorite.db`       |
| Linux   | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/zorite/` (or `~/.local/share/zorite/`) |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\zorite\`                                     |

`ZORITE_DATA` overrides the whole data directory (and `ZORITE_DB` just the
database file), so you can run against a throwaway data set without touching your
real notes.

## Performance

The numbers below come from
synthetic databases built by [`scripts/gen_perf_db.py`](scripts/gen_perf_db.py)
— a 3-level `Area::Topic::Note` namespace tree with `[[wiki-links]]`, inline
images, and a couple weeks of journal days. `ZORITE_DB` points the app at a
throwaway database, so your real notes are never touched:

```sh
python3 scripts/gen_perf_db.py 10000 /tmp/zorite-perf.db
ZORITE_DB=/tmp/zorite-perf.db cargo run
```

**Hot-path query timings** (SQLite, best of several runs on a development Mac):

| Operation                                | 1,000    | 10,000   | 50,000   |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Load the page list (`list_pages`)        | 0.3 ms   | 4.4 ms   | 26 ms    |
| Search per keystroke (FTS5 trigram)      | 0.07 ms  | 0.11 ms  | 0.09 ms  |
| Backlinks for a page (indexed)           | 0.005 ms | 0.005 ms | 0.005 ms |
| Seed the recent list (first launch only) | 0.1 ms   | 2.3 ms   | 12 ms    |

`list_pages` loads only `id`/`title`, not page content, which keeps it fast and
memory flat. Search is a trigram FTS5 index, so it stays around 0.1 ms whether
the database holds a thousand pages or fifty thousand. Memory (resident set
size):

| Metric                       | Empty DB | 10,000 pages | 50,000 pages |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| RAM (RSS)                    | ~86 MB   | ~135 MB      | ~138 MB      |
| Database file (incl. index)  | 60 KB    | 48 MB        | 229 MB       |

RAM barely moves from 10k to 50k pages: the page list holds only `id`/`title`
(about 2 MB at 50k), not the note bodies, which load one page at a time as you
open them. The database file grows mostly with the FTS trigram index. At 50,000
pages, launch, navigation, search, and scrolling remain fast, and the sidebar's
cost is independent of the total (it's capped to recently-viewed pages).
