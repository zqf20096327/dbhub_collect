### The full-stack .NET web framework — for a team of one or fifty.

**[Site ↗](https://rask.sh/)** · **[Docs ↗](https://rask.sh/docs/)**

</div>

UI, data, auth, background work, realtime and deploy — **all in C#, in one codebase**, on standard
ASP.NET Core and EF Core. [Rask.Data](docs/data.md) and source-generated [CQRS](docs/cqrs.md) with a
cached [query layer](docs/query.md); accounts, [jobs](docs/jobs.md), [email](docs/mail.md), an
[outbox](docs/outbox.md), [cache](docs/cache.md) and [file storage](docs/file-storage.md) on your own
database; [realtime subscriptions](docs/subscriptions.md), [multi-tenancy](docs/multi-tenancy.md) and
[full-text search](docs/full-text-search.md); the
[`/_rask` operator console](docs/dashboard.md); and `rask new` → `rask db` → `rask deploy` from the
[CLI](docs/cli.md). SQLite is the production default; PostgreSQL and SQL Server are a package away.
Small teams ship like big ones, and one developer can still ship the whole thing alone.

The UI is C# too. Components are plain C# classes that return a tree of HTML from `Render()`: state is a
field, and an event handler is a delegate.

```csharp
[Route("/counter")]
public sealed partial class Counter : Component
{
    private int _count;

    protected override Component? Render() =>
        Button.OnClick(() => _count++)[$"Current count: {_count}"];
}
```

## Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://rask.sh/rask.sh | sh
```

On Windows, in PowerShell: `irm https://rask.sh/rask.ps1 | iex`.

**Prerequisites: none.** The installer adds whatever is missing — the .NET SDK, the `wasm-tools`
workload, Node — all under `$HOME`, no `sudo`. Already have the SDK and want only the tool?
`dotnet tool install -g Rask.Cli`. See [installation](docs/installation.md).

Adding Rask to a project you already have is one package — the host, with every battery:

```bash
dotnet add package Rask.Server   # an ASP.NET app: live pages, database, auth, jobs, mail, …
dotnet add package Rask.Wasm     # a browser app on .NET WebAssembly
```

## Four front ends, one back end

Rask is a superset, not a rival: your React, Vue, Svelte, Angular or Lit components,
[a real Blazor component](docs/blazor-components.md), a TypeScript SPA or a Nuxt or Next.js app all run
on it — and it builds on ASP.NET Core and EF Core rather than replacing them. Pick one per project — all
four sit on the same C# back end. Islands also compose *inside* a Rask component tree, so those two mix
freely.

### Rask components

C# components, server-rendered, with every state change streaming to the browser as a minimal diff
over a WebSocket. Pick `--template wasm-hosted` and the pages run in the browser instead: a WebAssembly app in the
project's `Client/` folder, served by the same server that answers its API — no second project to
maintain, and message records in `Shared/` compile into both halves.

```bash
rask new Shop
```

### Islands

A `.tsx`, `.vue`, `.svelte` or Lit file as an *ordinary* Rask component. Derive from
`ReactComponent`, `PreactComponent`, `SolidComponent`, `VueComponent`, `SvelteComponent`,
`AngularComponent` or `LitComponent`, drop the front-end file beside
it, and place it anywhere the chain goes — a leaf inside a card, or a whole route. Props are declared
in C#, callbacks re-enter C# over the channel every handler already uses, and the live diff leaves the
subtree alone because its own renderer owns it. This is the one pillar `Rask` does not bring on its
own: add `Rask.External`, and Node, because your React does.

A component from npm needs no front-end file at all: name the package export in `Module`, and its chain
steps are generated from the package's own TypeScript into a committed `ColorPicker.props.json`. An
island takes children of its own runtime, so a React island can hold another.

```csharp
public sealed partial class Chart : ReactComponent
{
    public required IReadOnlyList<Point> Series { get; set; }
}

public sealed partial class ColorPicker : ReactComponent
{
    protected override string Module => "react-colorful";
    protected override string Export => "HexColorPicker";   // .Color(…), .OnChange(…)
}
```

→ [Islands](docs/islands.md)

### SPA

A TypeScript single-page app on an ASP.NET host — React, Preact, Vue, Angular, Solid, Svelte or Lit.
The client's TypeScript is generated from your C# message records on every build, so
`await rask.dispatch(getOrder({ id }))` is typed and renaming a C# property breaks the build rather
than the wire.

```bash
rask new Shop --template react
```

→ [TypeScript front ends](docs/spa.md)

### Meta framework

Nuxt, Next.js, SvelteKit, TanStack Start, SolidStart or Analog owning the *whole* front end — its own
routing, its own rendering, its own Node server — with Rask as the backend behind it. The two ship as
**one container on one port**: Rask fronts every request, supervises Node as a child process and
forwards to it over loopback, so ASP.NET auth, rate limiting, logging and health stay in front of the
framework and the session has one owner. The client was imported from the framework's *own* creator —
`nuxi`, `create-next-app`, `sv`, `@tanstack/cli` — and is committed, so `rask new` writes it with no
network and no Node, plus a node-server build and a dev proxy.
`scripts/refresh-templates.sh` is how a newer upstream gets in. Add `Rask.Meta.Hosting`, and Node at
runtime, because the framework needs it.

```bash
rask new Shop --template nuxt
```

→ [Meta framework front ends](docs/meta.md)

## Ship it

```bash
rask dev                                                  # run it — the first migration is already applied
rask db add AddProducts && rask db update                 # after you change the model
rask deploy --host root@box --domain shop.example.com     # bare box → Docker + auto-HTTPS, zero-downtime
```

Run `rask` with no arguments for a wizard.

## Batteries included

Auth, jobs, mail, cache, events and file storage are on by default, and every one of them keeps its
records in the app's own SQLite database (an upload's bytes go to disk or a bucket) — no broker, no
Redis, no second service to run. A fresh app can register somebody, sign them in, confirm their address
and reset their password with no auth code written.

- **[Auth](docs/authentication.md)** — accounts out of the box: register, sign in, sign out, route
  guards, and the first account to register is the administrator.
- **[Background jobs](docs/jobs.md)** — enqueued, delayed and recurring work on your database,
  at-least-once with exponential backoff.
- **[Email](docs/mail.md)** — transactional mail queued in the same database and delivered over SMTP
  off the request thread; bodies are Rask components.
- **[Outbox](docs/outbox.md)** — domain events committed in the same transaction as your data and
  relayed at-least-once, with no message broker.
- **[Cache](docs/cache.md)** — the standard `IDistributedCache` plus `Cache.Remember(key, load).For(10.Minutes)`
  and `Cache.Forget(key)`.
- **[Data](docs/data.md)** · **[CQRS](docs/cqrs.md)** — audit stamps, opt-in soft delete, optimistic
  concurrency and domain events on EF Core, and a source-generated, reflection-free mediator.
- **[Production SQLite](docs/sqlite.md)** — WAL and busy-timeout pragmas, continuous Litestream backup,
  scheduled snapshots.
- **[Logging](docs/logging.md)** — the `ILogger` pipeline kept in a SQLite file of its own, with
  retention by age and row count.
- **[Operator console](docs/dashboard.md)** — `/_rask`: queue depth, dead letters and the errors behind
  them, cache contents and a log tail, behind an authorization policy.
- **[PWA](docs/pwa.md)** · **[Web Push](docs/webpush.md)** — installable, offline apps, and push sent
  from your backend on your own VAPID keys.
- **[File storage](docs/file-storage.md)** — uploads on disk, in S3-compatible storage or in Azure
  Blob, with a row per file on your database and public or expiring links.
- **[Deploy](docs/deployment.md)** — `rask deploy` takes a bare VPS to a live HTTPS site with
  zero-downtime swaps.

They build on the standard .NET pieces — EF Core, hosted services, `ILogger`, `IDistributedCache`,
ASP.NET Core authentication — so adding one is a package reference, not a new stack to learn or a new
box to operate.

*Rask* is the Norwegian/Danish/Swedish word for **fast**.

## Status

Rask is pre-1.0; APIs may change between minor versions. Every package ships for **.NET 10 and .NET 11** (`net10.0` / `net11.0` for
ASP.NET hosts, `net10.0-browser` / `net11.0-browser` for WASM); .NET 10 is the LTS release and the
default `rask new` scaffolds, and `--framework net11.0` opts a new app into .NET 11. Production use at your own discretion — issues and PRs welcome.
