A self-hosted alternative to NexLev / vidIQ / ViewStats: find niches, viral
videos from small channels, trending categories and keywords over arbitrary
periods (24h, 48h, 7/30/90 days), plus full channel tracking and analytics.
Runs on the free YouTube Data API v3 and a local PostgreSQL — no
subscription, no paid LLM key: semantic classification like "faceless / on
topic" is done by the model calling these tools, not the server.

![niche-finder dashboard: overview — channels, videos, outlier channels, trending categories and keywords](assets/dashboard.jpg)

The project has three parts that together make up the "product":

- **`backend/`** — Python: an MCP server (63 tools for Claude), an HTTP API
  for the dashboard, and a background worker that logs view/subscriber
  history on a schedule (without this, "growth rate over 24 hours" doesn't
  exist — the YouTube API only ever returns "right now").
- **`frontend/`** — the same functionality, but visual: a dashboard built on
  plain ES modules (no npm, no build step) that calls the backend's HTTP API.
- **`extension/`** — a Chrome extension (Manifest V3) that puts the same
  metrics on top of YouTube itself, the way vidIQ and NexLev do: outlier
  score, view velocity and tags on a watch page, growth and best publishing
  times on a channel page, multiplier badges on thumbnails in any list. It
  talks only to `127.0.0.1` — nothing leaves the machine.

Both parts and the Postgres store come up together with one command (see
below) — the dashboard and Claude Desktop end up looking at the same
database.

## Features

- Find viral videos and outlier channels by niche over an arbitrary period
  (24h / 48h / 7 / 30 / 90 days)
- Trending categories and keywords, best time to publish, title patterns
- Track specific channels: view/subscriber growth rate, snapshot history
- Repackaging: title and thumbnail swaps after publishing, before/after
  side by side and views per hour around the swap (thumbnails are
  fingerprinted from the image itself — the API URL never changes)
- The exact same calculation in Claude Desktop (via MCP) and on the web
  dashboard — one shared codebase, not two implementations
- Niche clusters (k-means over channel embeddings) and a niche map;
  semantic similarity of channels and videos via pgvector
- Idea checker, title scoring and title suggestions, SEO review of a
  draft's title/description/tags, drafts linked to published videos
- "Why viral" explanations for outlier videos and comment insights per
  video or niche
- Transcripts: a queue, manual paste, hybrid (keyword + semantic) search
- Alerts (new outliers, view acceleration, title changes, a channel
  breaking its silence, a tracked channel or an alerted outlier video that
  disappeared from YouTube), delivered to Telegram or a webhook one by one
  or as one morning digest; a swipe file for saved videos and channels
- Export a niche's videos to TSV/CSV
- Only the free YouTube Data API v3 and local PostgreSQL — no paid
  subscriptions and no LLM key required. An LLM (via OpenRouter or a local
  Ollama) is opt-in and off by default — see [Privacy](#privacy)

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    CD["Claude Desktop"] -->|MCP| MCP["MCP server\nbackend/server.py"]
    FE["Browser / frontend"] -->|HTTP| API["HTTP API\nbackend/api.py"]
    EXT["Chrome extension\non youtube.com"] -->|"HTTP (localhost)"| API
    YT["YouTube Data API v3"] <-->|"on schedule"| W["Background worker\nbackend/worker.py"]
    MCP --> PG[("PostgreSQL")]
    API --> PG
    W --> PG
```

The MCP server, HTTP API, and worker are three different entry points into
the same code: all three call the same use cases from `backend/application/`,
so the result in Claude Desktop and on the dashboard is literally the same
calculation — not two separate implementations. A detailed breakdown of the
backend's layers (as of September 5, 2026 — DDD: domain → infrastructure →
application → interfaces) is in
[backend/README.md](backend/README.md#structure).

## Quick start

With Docker (recommended — brings up Postgres, the worker, and the dashboard
together):

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # fill in YOUTUBE_API_KEY (not required to build)
docker compose build
make up                       # or: docker compose up -d web worker
make doctor                   # check the key, network, and database
open http://localhost:8080    # dashboard
```

Without Docker (needs your own reachable Postgres):

```bash
make local-install            # venv + backend dependencies, once
make dev                      # HTTP dashboard on http://localhost:8080
make local-run                # or: MCP server on the host, for Claude Desktop
```

Running on the host (`make dev` / `make local-run`) uses the same database,
but at a different address: the Postgres container is published on
`127.0.0.1:5433`, while the code defaults to `localhost:5432`, so without a
hint the process fails with `psycopg2.OperationalError: Connection refused`.
Add this line to `.env`:

```bash
NICHE_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://niches:niches@localhost:5433/niches
```

(`NICHE_DATABASE_URL` takes precedence over `POSTGRES_*` and stays
host-only: compose loads `.env` into the containers but blanks this one, and
`scripts/mcp-docker.sh` and `scripts/diag.sh` strip it explicitly). Do
**not** replace it with `POSTGRES_PORT=5433` -- compose hands that same
variable to the containers as the in-network port, which would break
`web`/`worker`/`mcp`.

`make dev` listens on the same `:8080` as the `web` container. You can't run
both at once: the host uvicorn grabs the port and the container's port
mapping silently drops (`docker ps` shows `8080/tcp` with no mapping). Either
run `docker compose stop web` before `make dev`, or edit the code inside the
container -- `./backend` is mounted in, and `docker compose restart web`
picks up changes without a rebuild.

`make help` prints every available command with a one-line description.

## Contributing

Bug reports, bug fixes, and documentation PRs are welcome — for anything
bigger (a new MCP tool, API endpoint, or dashboard screen), please open an
issue first to agree on the shape. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to set up a dev environment and
run the test suite.

## Privacy

Self-hosted, no telemetry, no account: everything stays in your own Postgres,
and by default the app contacts exactly two external hosts —
`www.googleapis.com` for the YouTube Data API and `www.youtube.com` for
channel RSS feeds. Comments read by `video_comments` are never stored. An
optional LLM step via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) (`LLM_PROVIDER`,
off by default) adds a third, `openrouter.ai`, only when you turn it on —
left unset, `OPENROUTER_MODEL` picks and rotates through OpenRouter's free
models on its own; set it to pin one specific model (free or paid) instead.
`LLM_PROVIDER=ollama` (stage 11) skips OpenRouter entirely and points that
same LLM step at a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) install instead — no
external host, no API key, everything stays on your machine. See
[PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for the full picture, including what the first run
downloads and how to delete everything.
