Edit frontmatter in place, save several views of the same notes, and keep every record in the vault you already use.

## Highlights

- **Eight database views:** see the same notes as a table, board, gallery, list, chart, calendar, timeline, or form.
- **Forms for local capture:** build a form view with required fields and a cover, or open the same quick-capture form from another view or the command palette. Unsubmitted drafts are kept during the current session.
- **Database starters:** begin with one of six built-in setups, each with properties and views; optionally add sample notes.
- **Local Markdown storage:** each database is an ordinary Markdown file with `db_view: true`; records, properties, and relations also stay inside your vault.
- **Direct property editing:** edit text, numbers, currency, dates, options, statuses, checkboxes, and file names without opening every note; one dialog confirms the display name, property key, and type for new properties.
- **Spreadsheet-style workflows:** use keyboard navigation, range selection, copy/paste, fill, paste-to-create, bulk editing, and single-step undo.
- **Flexible organization:** combine search, filters, sorting, groups, subgroups, manual order, quick facet chips, and result limits.
- **Source-aware creation:** select records by folder, tag, property, link, or expression, then preserve source/group defaults and apply templates when creating notes.
- **Visual presentation:** use database/record icons, database/card covers, inline Markdown, option colors, number styles, and conditional formatting.
- **Summaries and charts:** aggregate the current result, show several summaries in groups, and inspect the notes behind a chart value.
- **Formulas, Relations, and Rollups:** calculate properties safely, connect notes with Obsidian wikilinks, and derive count, sum, average, or list values.
- **Native Obsidian links:** use `file.*` metadata and the core Page preview plugin for record titles, Relations, and internal links inside text.
- **Date planning:** drag and resize date or time ranges in month/week/day calendars and day/week/month/quarter timelines.
- **Embedding and portability:** place database views in notes (read-only by default, with optional editing), resize the embedded block, copy or export data, and convert Obsidian `.base` files.
- **Local and private:** no cloud data copy and no external transmission of vault content, metadata, formulas, or settings.

## Eight views, one vault

A database never duplicates your notes — the eight views are just different lenses over the same Markdown, and each view keeps its own filters, sorting, grouping, visible properties, title property, and layout.

| Table | Board |
| --- | --- |
| ![Table view](assets/screenshots/en-1.2.7-overview.png) | ![Board view](assets/screenshots/status-board.png) |
| Edit dense records, paste ranges, fill cells, group, sort, and navigate by keyboard. | Move cards through stages, use subgroups, covers, colored options, and drag-and-drop. |

| Gallery | List |
| --- | --- |
| ![Gallery view](assets/screenshots/gallery-view.png) | ![List view](assets/screenshots/list-view.png) |
| Browse visual libraries with covers, properties, groups, and summaries. | Scan compact inventories, tasks, directories, and research notes. |

| Chart | Timeline |
| --- | --- |
| ![Chart view](assets/screenshots/chart-view.png) | ![Timeline view](assets/screenshots/timeline-view.png) |
| Turn the current filtered result into charts, summaries, drilldowns, and PNG exports. | Plan across day, week, month, or quarter scales; drag and resize date ranges. |

| Form |
| --- |
| ![Form view with half-page cover and required fields](assets/screenshots/en-1.3.0-form-view.png) |
| Capture a new note with field-aware controls, source-rule defaults, required fields, and a banner, half-page, or wallpaper cover. |

| Calendar month | Calendar week |
| --- | --- |
| ![Calendar month view](assets/screenshots/calendar-view-month.png) | ![Calendar week view](assets/screenshots/calendar-view-week.png) |
| Arrange all-day and multi-day records in a monthly overview. | Work with all-day and timed records on a detailed weekly grid. |

## New in 1.3.1

- **Reorder from the context menu on desktop:** right-click any record in table, board, gallery, list, or timeline views to move it up, down, to a specific position, or enter a pick-target mode that places it before or after any other record. Cross-group moves are supported.
- **Custom database templates:** save a configured database as a starter template (optionally including up to 20 sample records from the current view) and reuse it when creating new databases in the same vault. Templates live under `Note Database Templates/` and can be deleted from their preview.
- **Fuller update notes on upgrade:** when you upgrade across several versions, the changelog dialog now lists every version released in between.
## Start from a template, or capture on the go

Six built-in starters preset the properties, views, icons, and covers, with optional sample notes; save any configured database as your own template. For quick capture, open the dialog from any view or the command palette and submit without leaving where you are.

| Quick-capture dialog | Database starters |
| --- | --- |
| ![Quick capture dialog](assets/screenshots/en-1.3.0-quick-form.png) | ![Built-in database starter picker](assets/screenshots/en-1.3.0-starters.png) |
| Open a form without leaving the current view. A failed submission keeps the entered values. | Start with a workflow, its properties and views, and optional sample notes; then customize everything in your vault. |

## Native Obsidian link previews

Internal links reuse the core Page preview plugin and honor your modifier-key settings.

| Page preview opened from a record link |
| --- |
| ![Obsidian Page Preview opened from a record link](assets/screenshots/en-1.2.7-page-preview.png) |

Enable Obsidian's core **Page preview** plugin first. Preview works on record titles, Relation properties, clickable `file.*` metadata, text properties in Link display mode, and internal links or `[[wikilinks]]` in inline-Markdown text/computed-text properties. Table, Board, Gallery, List, Calendar, Timeline, the record detail panel, database-file views, and embedded views share the same behavior.


## Edit many notes without opening them

Field-aware editors cover text, numbers, currency, dates, checkboxes, selects, multi-selects, statuses, and file names. Table workflows include range selection, copy/paste, fill, overflow row creation, safe file renaming, and single-step undo.

| Typed bulk editing | Inline Markdown and number displays |
| --- | --- |
| ![Editing one property across several records](assets/screenshots/en-bulk-edit.png) | ![Inline Markdown and number display styles](assets/screenshots/markdown-number.png) |
| Preview the affected records, confirm risky writes, and roll back a failed transaction. | Render text as links or inline Markdown; show numbers as ratings, bars, or rings without changing stored values. |

| One new-property dialog |
| --- |
| ![New property dialog](assets/screenshots/en-1.2.7-new-property-dialog.png) |
| Confirm the display name, frontmatter key, and property type from every creation entry point. |

## Organize, highlight, and summarize

| Conditional formatting | Group summaries |
| --- | --- |
| ![Conditional formatting rules](assets/screenshots/en-conditional-format.png) | ![Board groups with summaries](assets/screenshots/en-board-groups-summaries.png) |
| Highlight a matching property or the whole record with view-specific rules. | Add and reorder count, sum, average, min/max, and other summaries in grouped views. |

| Quick filter and sort chips |
| --- |
| ![Active filter and sort facet chips](assets/screenshots/en-1.2.7-facet-controls.png) |
| See active rules as compact chips. Edit one rule in place or remove it directly. |

Active filter and sort chips use the same rules as the full toolbar panels, and records can also be dragged into a manual order. Source rules can combine folders, tags, properties, links, and expressions with `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.

## Calculate and connect

| Formulas | Relations and Rollups |
| --- | --- |
| ![Formula editor](assets/screenshots/en-formula-editor.png) | ![Linked notes and their Rollup result](assets/screenshots/en-relation-rollup.png) |
| Build computed properties with field references, date/text/number functions, live previews, and optional frontmatter sync. | Keep relationships as ordinary Obsidian wikilinks and calculate count, sum, average, or list values from linked notes. |

The formula editor distinguishes display names from frontmatter keys, previews substituted values, and recovers with `IFERROR`; relations are stored as plain wikilinks, target changes are one undoable step, and a table cell configures its Rollup on double-click. No `eval`, hidden relation database, or cloud copy is used.

## Make records easier to scan

| Database and record icons | Covers and visual cards |
| --- | --- |
| ![Database and record icons](assets/screenshots/en-database-icons.png) | ![Database, board, and gallery cover settings](assets/screenshots/en-dataset-covers-setting.png) ![](assets/screenshots/en-board-covers-setting.png) |
| Use Unicode Emoji or Lucide icons, with database defaults and per-view record-icon fields. | Add a draggable database cover and choose independent cover settings for board and gallery views. |

| Record covers on boards |
| --- |
| ![Board cards with record covers](assets/screenshots/en-1.2.7-board-covers.png) |
| Choose a cover property, crop mode, and ratio independently for every board view. |

Option-based group titles keep their colors across table, board, gallery, and list views. Search highlights file names and visible values, including localized dates.

## Plan dates and inspect results

| Search across Calendar and Timeline | Chart drilldown and summaries |
| --- | --- |
| ![Calendar and timeline search results](assets/screenshots/en-calendar-timeline-search-results.png) | ![Chart drilldown](assets/screenshots/en-chart-drilldown.png) |
| Search the fields visible on event cards, then drag or resize date and datetime records. | Click a chart value to inspect its records before applying a filter. |

Calendar supports month, week, and day. Timeline supports day, week, month, and quarter.

## Use database views anywhere

| Embedded view | Headerless embed |
| --- | --- |
| ![A database view embedded in a note](assets/screenshots/en-embed-view.png) | ![A compact headerless embedded view](assets/screenshots/en-embed-headerless.png) |
| Paste a generated `note-database` block into any note. | Hide the database header when the surrounding note already provides context. |

| Editable embed | Adjustable embed height |
| --- | --- |
| ![Editing a selected range in an embedded database](assets/screenshots/en-1.3.0-editable-embed.png) | ![Embedded database height grip](assets/screenshots/en-1.3.0-embed-height.png) |
| Embeds stay read-only by default. Enable editing in plugin settings to change records directly inside a note. | Drag the lower edge of an embedded database to give the view more or less room. |

Embedded databases are read-only by default. Disable **Read-only embedded databases** in plugin settings to allow editing in notes; form embeds can submit records only in this mode. Drag the lower edge to resize an embed. View switching, filters, sorting, grouping, computed values, and copy/export tools remain available in read-only mode. If a database explicitly enables automatic formula-result storage, that database-level background task still runs while the database is shown in an embedded view.

## Markdown remains the source of truth

| What | Stored as |
| --- | --- |
| Database | A normal Markdown file with `db_view: true` |
| Records and property values | Markdown notes and their frontmatter |
| Relations | Obsidian wikilinks in frontmatter |
| Record templates | Markdown, Obsidian Templates, or Templater files |
| Views | Saved configuration in the database file |

Create records from source rules, groups, subgroups, row insertion, or a form. Apply record templates at creation. Export CSV + Markdown ZIP, copy CSV/Markdown tables, or convert an Obsidian `.base` file.

## Start in three steps

1. Install and enable Note Database, then open the dashboard from the ribbon or command palette.
2. Create a blank database or choose a built-in or saved starter, then set its folder or source rules.
3. Add properties and views. Edits write back to the original Markdown files.

![Note Database commands in the command palette](assets/screenshots/en-command-list.png)

To reuse a database setup in the same vault, open its title menu and choose **Save as starter template…**. Give it a name, description, and icon; optionally include up to 20 records from the current view. Saved templates appear under **My templates** when creating a database and are stored in `Note Database Templates/` as `.starter.json` files. Delete a template from its preview to move it to Trash without affecting existing databases.

Templates keep properties, formulas, views, and display settings. New databases receive fresh IDs and record folders; source rules, manual record order, and relation targets are reset. Images and new-record templates keep their vault references, and missing files are shown in the preview. Sample notes are copied; relation and computed values are excluded.

## Installation

1. Open **Settings → Community plugins**.
2. Search for **Note Database**.
3. Install and enable it.

For manual installation, download `main.js`, `styles.css`, and `manifest.json` from the [latest release](https://github.com/pangy9/obsidian-note-database/releases/latest) and copy them to `.obsidian/plugins/note-database/`.

## Privacy

Note Database runs locally in Obsidian. It does not send vault content, metadata, formulas, or settings to an external service. Read the full [privacy policy](PRIVACY.md).
