## 🥊 Mergen vs. The Rest

Why settle for bloated, expensive tools when you can have perfection?

| Feature | **Mergen** | Electron Apps (TablePlus, DBeaver) | Legacy Tools (Workbench) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RAM Usage** | **~25 MB** (Native) | ~400 MB+ (Chromium) | Varies, often heavy |
| **Startup Time** | **Instant** (< 0.5s) | Sluggish (3s+) | Measured in ages |
| **App Size** | **Tiny** (~15 MB) | Huge (150 MB+) | Bloated |
| **Cost** | **Free & Open Source** | Expensive Subscriptions | Free / Expensive |
| **Privacy** | **100% Local** | Cloud Sync / Telemetry | Varies |
| **UI/UX** | **State of the Art** | Utilitarian / Clunky | Dated, Complex |

**The Truth About Electron:**
Most modern database tools are built on Electron, effectively bundling a whole web browser with every app. This eats your RAM, drains your battery, and slows down your workflow. 

**Mergen is different.** By using Wails, we leverage the native webview already present on your OS. The result? An app that looks better, runs faster, and respects your hardware. Don't pay for bloat. Choose Mergen.
