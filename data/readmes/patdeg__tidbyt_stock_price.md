# Tidbyt Stock Price Display with Alpaca Market API

This project displays stock prices on a Tidbyt device using data from the [Alpaca Market API](https://alpaca.markets/). It retrieves historical stock data over 7 days and displays the latest trade price, along with percentage changes, graphically on a Tidbyt device.

## Introduction

[Tidbyt](https://tidbyt.com/) is a smart display that allows you to run custom apps, showing information ranging from weather updates to stock prices. This project uses [Pixlet](https://github.com/tidbyt/pixlet), a command-line tool for developing Tidbyt apps, to display stock price information retrieved from the Alpaca Market API.

## Features
- Displays the latest stock price and percentage change.
- Shows a graph of historical stock data over 7 days.
- Color-coded indicators for price movements (green for positive, red for negative).
- Configurable stock symbol.
- Caching mechanism to reduce redundant API calls.

## Prerequisites
- A Tidbyt device.
- A personal server (e.g., a cloud server or always-on home server) to handle regular image updates.
- [Pixlet CLI](https://github.com/tidbyt/pixlet) installed (version 0.14.0 or later recommended).
- An Alpaca API account (sign up [here](https://alpaca.markets/)) and API keys (`ALPACA_KEY` and `ALPACA_SECRET`).

## Setup and Configuration

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/patdeg/tidbyt-stock-price.git
cd tidbyt-stock-price
```

### Install Pixlet
Follow the installation instructions for Pixlet [here](https://github.com/tidbyt/pixlet#installation).

### Alpaca API Keys
1. Sign up for an account at [Alpaca Markets](https://alpaca.markets/).
2. Generate your API keys (`ALPACA_KEY` and `ALPACA_SECRET`).

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store your Alpaca API credentials:

```bash
ALPACA_KEY=your-alpaca-api-key
ALPACA_SECRET=your-alpaca-api-secret
```

**Important**: Ensure your `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits of sensitive information.

### Set Up a Personal Server and Cron Job
To ensure the stock price is updated on your Tidbyt every 5 minutes, you'll need a server (e.g., a cloud or home server) to periodically push the updated image.

1. **Create a Cron Job**  
   On your server, set up a cron job to refresh (push) the image every 5 minutes. You can do this by adding the following line to your crontab:

   ```bash
   */5 * * * * cd ~/tidbyt_stock_price/refresh.sh > /dev/null 2>> ~/tidbyt_stock_price/cron_error.log
   ```

   This cron job will:
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Run `refresh.sh` to render the image and update the Tidbyt device.
   - Discard standard output and log only errors in `cron_error.log`.

2. **Verify the Cron Job**  
   Ensure the cron job is running by checking the logs or verifying that the Tidbyt image is updating every 5 minutes.

## Usage

### Rendering the App
To render the app with default settings:

```bash
make render
```

To specify a different stock symbol:

```bash
make render SYMBOL=MSFT
```

### Pushing to Tidbyt
```bash
make push
```

This command will push the rendered app to all registered Tidbyt devices.

### Serving Locally
To serve the app locally for development and preview:

```bash
make serve
```

You can specify custom settings:

```bash
make serve SYMBOL=GOOGL
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to view the app.

## Makefile Commands

- **Render the App**:
  ```bash
  make render
  ```

- **Push to Tidbyt**:
  ```bash
  make push
  ```

- **Serve Locally**:
  ```bash
  make serve
  ```

- **List Devices**:
  ```bash
  make list
  ```

## Customization
You can customize the stock symbol by setting the `SYMBOL` variable when running `make` commands.

```bash
make render SYMBOL=TSLA
```

## Troubleshooting
- **Missing Alpaca API Keys**: Ensure `ALPACA_KEY` and `ALPACA_SECRET` are set in your `.env` file.
- **No Data Available**: Check if the stock symbol is correct and if the Alpaca API is operational.
- **Display Issues**: Make sure your Tidbyt device is connected to the internet and functioning properly.

## Dependencies
- **Pixlet**: Tested with version 0.14.0.
- **Python**: Required for running the `Makefile` commands (if any scripts are used).
