PAXM carries decisions, conventions, and working context into later Codex,
Claude Code, OpenCode, Pi, Cursor, TRAE, Kimi Code, ZCode, Kiro, Cline, and MCP
sessions. Start locally with SQLite and no account, API key, embeddings, or
extra memory-layer model calls. Change memory providers later without rewiring
every agent.

## What changes after installation

In one session, record a decision:

```bash
paxm remember --profile ltm --text \
  "Production deploys run through GitHub Actions; never deploy from a laptop"
```

In a later session, Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, Pi, or an MCP client can
recover it:

```bash
paxm recall --query "how do we deploy production?"
```

With passive integration enabled, paxm recalls relevant context before the
agent responds and durably captures completed turns afterward. Provider delays
or failures do not block the coding session.

The practical result:

- **New sessions resume with project context** instead of making you restate
  architecture decisions, conventions, and operational constraints.
- **One memory path works across agents.** A decision captured from Codex can
  be recalled from Claude Code, OpenCode, Pi, or any MCP client.
- **Your storage stays your choice.** Start with local SQLite, connect Zep,
  Mem0, MemOS, or OpenViking, or bring a private provider through JSON-RPC.
- **You retain control.** Credentials, hook trust, routing, data location,
  disable, uninstall, and rollback remain user-owned.

## Quick start

Choose the agent you already use. The Codex plugin is the shortest path to a
complete active-and-passive memory loop.

### Codex plugin

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add pax-beehive/paxm --ref paxm-memory-v0.1.4
codex plugin add paxm-memory@pax-agent-nexus
curl -fsSL https://github.com/pax-beehive/paxm/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
paxm setup --integration codex-plugin
```

Start a new Codex task and trust the Pax Agent neXus hooks when `/hooks` asks.
The explicit installer downloads the latest published paxm binary. The plugin
registers active-memory skills and owns the passive Codex hooks after setup;
it never installs a binary, writes credentials, or bypasses hook trust on its
own.

Verify the first successful loop before relying on passive memory:

```bash
paxm config doctor
paxm remember --profile stm --text "PAXM_FIRST_RECALL_OK"
paxm recall --query "PAXM_FIRST_RECALL_OK"
paxm history --days 1
```

Set `PAXM_VERSION` before installation for a reproducible version or rollback.
Provider credentials remain user-managed. Team Memory can derive a scoped
agent credential from a paxl device connection; paxm never writes that secret
to `config.yaml`.

### Claude Code plugin

Install the paxm CLI, then install the Claude Code plugin:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/pax-beehive/paxm/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
claude plugin marketplace add pax-beehive/paxm
claude plugin install paxm-claude@pax-memory
paxm setup --integration claude-plugin
```

The Claude plugin includes active-memory skills, the paxm MCP server, and five
lifecycle hooks: `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PostToolUse`,
`PostToolUseFailure`, and `Stop`.

Session bootstrap injects the configured user, agent, and session identity
together with the current local time and time zone. Codex, Claude Code, and Pi
use their session-start events; OpenCode performs the same bootstrap before the
first message in a session. If a later user input arrives more than 12 hours
after the preceding turn activity, paxm refreshes the local-time context before
the agent handles that input.

### OpenCode, Pi, CLI, or MCP

Install the latest release and run interactive setup. The default SQLite
provider makes the adaptor usable without first creating an account or API
key.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/pax-beehive/paxm/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
paxm setup
paxm config doctor
```

`paxm setup` asks only two questions: which providers to enable and which
agents get passive memory. Agents found on the machine are pre-selected and
marked `(detected)`, and cloud provider API keys are masked as they are typed.
Everything else uses the tuned defaults. When Team Memory is selected, setup
first reads the on-prem user ID from paxl device status, with channel status as
a compatibility fallback; otherwise the user ID comes from `$USER`. Agents get
IDs such as `codex-todd`, and selected providers route
read/write as required. Use up/down to move, space to toggle, and enter to
confirm. Fine-tuning (paths, profiles, routing policy, per-hook behavior) lives
in the config file; see `docs/config.md`.

Optional team IDs create explicit durable write profiles such as
`team-pax-core`; non-interactive setup can pass `--user-id todd --team-id
pax-core`. Scripts can also skip the selection prompts entirely with
repeatable flags, e.g. `paxm setup --provider sqlite --agent codex --agent
claude`.

Active recall skills remain user-installed. SQLite works without an API key;
remote providers such as Zep, Mem0, MemOS, and OpenViking require connection
details during setup.

SQLite health checks must be allowed to create WAL/SHM files beside the
configured database. A sandbox that can read the database but cannot write its
parent directory may report SQLite error 14.

Use an isolated writable SQLite path for sandboxed evaluations. The same
configuration may be healthy in the real agent process.

When Codex is using the bundled `paxm-memory` plugin, let the plugin own Codex's
hooks so paxm does not register a duplicate global hook:

Write and recall a memory:

```bash
paxm remember --profile ltm --text "We chose SQLite for the local memory layer"
paxm recall --query "local memory layer"
paxm history --days 7
paxm dashboard   # localhost metrics, logs, sessions, and recall inspection
```

Select OpenCode during setup to install a global local plugin under
`~/.config/opencode/plugins/`. Select Pi to install its passive extension.
Cursor, TRAE, TRAE CN, Kimi Code, ZCode, Kiro, and Cline selections install a
client-native hook/MCP integration while preserving unrelated client config.
See the [agent integration matrix](docs/agent-integrations.md) for exact event
mappings, paths, host limitations, verification, and rollback. Any
MCP-compatible client can use `paxm mcp serve --agent codex`; replace `codex`
with the configured client identity.

## SQLite quality preview

SQLite gives a new user a complete local memory loop before they choose or
deploy a dedicated memory system. It uses FTS5 and BM25 retrieval with
turn-level memories and deterministic, query-focused excerpts. Memory ingestion
and retrieval call no external LLM or embedding service.

In an initial 30-question LoCoMo agent evaluation, SQLite turn memory answered
13 questions successfully, compared with 11 for Mem0 product-default.

| Memory arm | Successful answers | Mean token F1 | External models in memory layer |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| paxm SQLite turn memory | 13 / 30 | 0.4211 | None |
| Mem0 product-default | 11 / 30 | 0.3811 | GPT-5 mini + OpenAI embeddings |

This is an exploratory result, not an official LoCoMo score or proof that
SQLite broadly outperforms Mem0. It covers one balanced conversation with
OpenCode and DeepSeek V4 Flash, using deterministic token F1. See the
[methodology and limitations](evals/locomo/README.md).

## How it works

![Animated PAXM architecture showing active recall and passive memory routed from AI agents through the adaptor to interchangeable providers](docs/assets/paxm-architecture-animated.gif)

PAXM is a memory adaptor, not another hosted memory service:

```text
AI agents  ->  CLI / MCP / skills / hooks  ->  paxm  ->  any memory provider
```

Agents reach paxm in two ways:

| Path | Entry points | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Active | CLI, MCP, skill | Deliberate recall, explicit writes, inspection |
| Passive | Agent lifecycle hooks | Prompt-time recall and automatic turn capture |

Both paths use the same runtime and provider router. Filtering, profiles,
ranking, timeouts, telemetry, and provider behavior stay consistent across
agent surfaces.

Passive writes commit to a local durable queue before provider delivery. Slow
or unavailable providers retry in the background instead of blocking the
agent.

Passive recall uses an `800ms` overall budget and `250ms` per-provider budget
by default. It returns healthy partial results and records downstream
timeouts.

</p>

PAXM keeps the agent-facing contract stable while profiles choose providers,
failure policy, ranking, and timeouts. SQLite is the zero-setup default, not a
required storage backend.

</p>

Lifecycle hooks recall context before the model request and capture completed
turns afterward. Writes enter a durable local queue before provider delivery,
so provider latency does not block the agent.

</details>

Read the detailed [architecture](docs/architecture.md) and
[provider adapter contract](docs/provider-adapter-contract.md).

Stored memories distinguish their `origin` (user, agent, session, and turn)
from their visibility `scope`. Providers that advertise attribution support
must round-trip both values; see the
[JSON-RPC provider protocol](docs/jsonrpc-provider-protocol.md#origin-scope-and-trust).

## Agents and providers

### Agent surfaces

| Agent/client | Active | Passive recall | Passive write |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Codex | CLI, MCP, skill | Hook | Hook |
| Claude Code | CLI, MCP, skill | Hook | Hook |
| Pi | CLI, MCP, skill | Extension | Extension |
| OpenCode | CLI, MCP | Plugin | Plugin |
| Cursor | MCP | — | Hook |
| TRAE / TRAE CN | MCP | Hook | Hook |
| Kimi Code | MCP | Hook | Hook |
| ZCode | MCP | Hook | Hook |
| Kiro `paxm` agent | MCP | Hook | Hook |
| Cline | MCP | Hook | Hook |
| Any MCP client | MCP tools | — | — |

### Memory providers

| Provider | Mode | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SQLite | Default, built in | Zero-setup turn memory; no API key, LLM, or embeddings |
| Zep | Built in | User or graph scoped |
| Mem0 | Built in | Self-hosted REST API |
| Mem0 Cloud | Built in | Managed Platform API with async v3 writes/search |
| MemOS | Built in | Self-hosted product API, scoped by memory cube |
| MemOS Cloud | Built in | Managed OpenMem API with Token authentication |
| OpenViking | Built in | Self-hosted session extraction and semantic memory search |
| Team Memory | Built in | On-prem JSON-RPC provider with paxl device credential discovery |
| Custom JSON-RPC | Adapter | Bring an existing or private memory system |

Enable multiple provider instances at once. Recall and write profiles control
routes, required or best-effort behavior, ranking weights, thresholds, memory
tiers, and timeouts.

### Team Memory through a paxl device

Connect the workstation once, then select Team Memory during setup:

```bash
paxl device connect onprem \
  --url https://memory.company.internal \
  --device-name todd-macbook-air \
  --enrollment-token tm_enroll_xxx
paxm setup
```

If `TEAM_MEMORY_API_KEY` is explicitly configured, paxm preserves the existing
behavior and does not call paxl. Otherwise the Team Memory adapter runs
`paxl device provision --agent <PAXM_AGENT_ID> --json`, caches the returned
agent credential under `~/.config/paxm/credentials/` with mode `0600`, and
passes the URL, user ID, agent ID, and key only to
`paxm-team-memory-provider`. A provider 401 triggers one re-provision and one
retry; a second failure is returned to the caller. If paxl or its device
credential is unavailable, the error directs the operator to run
`paxl device connect onprem`.

Passive capture uses the trusted hook origin to route each Team Memory batch
through that agent's credential. On a shared workstation, Codex and Claude
captures therefore use separate `team-<agent-id>.json` caches and are
attributed to their own Team Memory principals. A rejected credential is
re-provisioned only for the affected agent. Paxm passes the trusted hook target
as paxl's explicit agent type, so legacy IDs such as `claude-<user>` do not
depend on suffix inference. Captures without a resolved origin fall back to
the configured `PAXM_AGENT_ID`; an explicit
`TEAM_MEMORY_API_KEY` keeps the legacy single-credential behavior.

Mem0 score direction is deployment-specific. `score_semantics` defaults to
`similarity` for backward compatibility; set it to `distance` when the Mem0
endpoint returns pgvector cosine distance. Paxm cannot infer this from a field
named `score` or `similarity`.

Self-hosted Mem0 search scope placement is also version-dependent.
`search_scope_payload: auto` sends `user_id`, `agent_id`, and `run_id` inside
`filters` first, then retries once with top-level fields only when the server
returns a recognized missing-scope compatibility error. Set `top_level` for
Mem0 0.1.117-style servers or `filters` for strict nested-filter deployments.

### Self-hosted OpenViking

OpenViking support connects paxm to a user-operated OpenViking server. Writes
are recorded through OpenViking sessions and committed for asynchronous memory
extraction. Recall uses semantic memory search through `/api/v1/search/find`.
The server URL and optional API key remain in the user's paxm configuration.

Run `paxm setup`, select OpenViking, and provide the self-hosted base URL and
API key. OpenViking can then participate in the same recall and write profiles
as SQLite or any other provider, with required or best-effort routing and
provider-specific timeouts.

## MCP server

Run paxm as a local stdio MCP server:

```bash
paxm mcp serve --agent codex
```

```json
{
  "command": "paxm",
  "args": ["mcp", "serve", "--agent", "codex"]
}
```

The server exposes four focused tools:

- `paxm_recall`
- `paxm_remember`
- `paxm_history`
- `paxm_config_doctor`

Setup, credential management, hook installation, and backfill stay outside MCP
so an agent cannot silently take ownership of user configuration.

Writes carry user, agent, and named personal/team scope provenance. Recall does
not filter by that scope: CLI, MCP, and passive injection label every result
with its source scope, while provider-native routing and ACL remain under the
provider's control. Active CLI calls derive a stable session identity from the
configured user, config path, and current workspace. An MCP server creates one
session identity at startup and reuses it for that server lifetime. Paxm passes
these values as runtime recall context and structured write provenance, never
as provider search filters.

## Agent integrations

### Codex plugin

The Codex plugin packages the paxm setup skill, active memory skill, and native
Codex hooks. It does not install provider credentials or bypass hook trust.

Use `paxm setup --integration codex-plugin` so only the plugin owns the Codex
lifecycle hooks.

### Claude Code plugin

The Claude Code plugin is a first-class integration, not a generic setup shim.
It packages skills, an MCP server, and five native lifecycle hooks.

Setup removes only legacy paxm-managed Claude hooks, preserves unrelated hooks,
and records `claude-plugin` ownership.

### Pi extension

Pi support is installed through `paxm setup`. The extension handles passive
prompt recall and buffers visible user, assistant, and tool events into one
turn-end memory while excluding thinking blocks.

### OpenCode plugin

OpenCode support is installed through `paxm setup` as a dependency-free global
plugin. The plugin uses OpenCode's `chat.message` and model-message transform
hooks for passive recall.

On `session.idle`, it reads the completed session through the official client
and writes a durable turn. It captures visible user and assistant text while
excluding reasoning and tool payloads.

The generated plugin lives at `~/.config/opencode/plugins/paxm.ts`, or below
`OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`/`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` when configured.

See the complete [configuration guide](docs/config.md) for generated paths,
event mappings, profile settings, and uninstall behavior.

## Reliability by default

- Hook acknowledgement waits only for the local queue transaction.
- Provider delivery is resumable and retried in the background.
- Optional provider failures do not discard healthy provider results.
- A stuck provider is contained by its timeout and single-call bulkhead.
- Write-provider routes default to a 30-second timeout; optional failures remain
  isolated while required-provider failures are returned to the caller.
- Recall provenance is stripped before passive writes to prevent memory echo.
- Session-scoped writes receive a persisted monotonic sequence, preventing
  same-timestamp events from colliding across paxm processes.
- Exact LTM consolidation limits duplicate accumulation.
- SQLite preserves completed agent turns with explicit session, turn, and time
  boundaries.
- Telemetry stores hashes and lengths by default, not raw recall queries.

Historical imports are also resumable:

```bash
paxm backfill scan --agent codex --after 2026-07-21
paxm backfill run --agent codex --provider mem0-company --after 2026-07-21 --background
paxm backfill status --agent codex --provider mem0-company
```

`--after` is inclusive and `--before` is exclusive. Supplying `--after`
without `--before` intentionally scans through the latest session history,
including turns after passive capture was enabled.

## Performance

Benchmarks use runtime-generated temporary datasets modeled after real passive
agent workloads; no benchmark corpus is committed to the repository.

On an Apple M4 reference machine:

| Workload | Adapter latency |
| --- | ---: |
| 128 KiB SQLite write | 1.84 ms |
| 2 MiB SQLite write | 14.31 ms |
| 10-item / 1.25 MiB batch | 12.36 ms |
| Recall from 100,000 short memories | 0.54 ms |
| Recall from 10,000 x 32 KiB memories | 0.61 ms |

These numbers measure the adapter, not end-to-end agent response time. See the
datasets, commands, allocations, and machine details in
[SQLite adapter benchmarks](docs/benchmarks.md).

## Evaluation

paxm separates deterministic regression suites from paid, real-agent quality
evaluations. CI protects runtime behavior; opt-in benchmarks measure whether
memory helps an agent answer correctly.

The repository includes deterministic production-path evaluations:

```bash
go run ./cmd/paxm eval run --suite evals/baseline
go run ./cmd/paxm eval run --suite evals/conversation-write
```

- A 100-case retrieval suite reports recall@K, precision@K, MRR, false-positive
  rate, latency, and category-level results.
- A 50-case conversation-to-write suite checks admission, recall, forbidden
  fragments, metadata preservation, and adapter contract behavior.

CI runs unit tests, vet, the retrieval report, and the adapter write contract on
every push to `main` and every pull request.

The opt-in [LoCoMo agent benchmark](evals/locomo/README.md) exercises real
OpenCode sessions and production MCP or passive recall.

The [cross-agent benchmark](evals/cross-agent/README.md) tests whether one
agent's experience helps another avoid the same failure.

Paid agent evaluations are never run in ordinary CI. Their reports separate
memory-layer cost from answering-model cost and state their evidence limits.
