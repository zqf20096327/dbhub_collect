# Deploy MongoDB environments using Terraform and Ansible

This repository automates Percona software for MongoDB across cloud and local environments:

- Percona Server for MongoDB (PSMDB)
- Percona Backup for MongoDB (PBM)
- Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM)
- Percona ClusterSync for MongoDB (PCSM)

Supported deployment targets:

- Public cloud: AWS, GCP, Azure
- Private cloud: CHAOS
- Local: Docker containers or Libvirt/KVM virtual machines

Cloud and CHAOS deployments use Terraform for infrastructure and Ansible for software
configuration. Docker and Libvirt deployments are Terraform-only.

## Prerequisites

The controller machine needs `git`, Terraform 1.9 or newer, OpenSSH, and, for
cloud or CHAOS deployments, Ansible. Install these common tools with:

```bash
./scripts/install-prerequisites.sh
```

The installer supports macOS with an existing Homebrew installation, Debian-family
Linux, and RHEL-family Linux. It uses `apt` or `dnf`/`yum` as appropriate and
requires `sudo` on Linux. It does not bootstrap Homebrew, configure credentials,
or create SSH keys.

Add only the tools for the target you intend to use:

```bash
./scripts/install-prerequisites.sh --docker  # Docker Engine/Desktop
./scripts/install-prerequisites.sh --aws     # AWS CLI v2
./scripts/install-prerequisites.sh --gcp     # Google Cloud CLI
./scripts/install-prerequisites.sh --azure   # Azure CLI
./scripts/install-prerequisites.sh --ui      # Go 1.22+ for ui-go
./scripts/install-prerequisites.sh --libvirt # Linux KVM/Libvirt and genisoimage
```

Use `--all` to install every applicable target dependency, or `--dry-run` to
inspect the commands. Libvirt/KVM is Linux-only. The CHAOS target also requires
the privately distributed `percona/chaos` Terraform provider in the standard
Terraform plugin directory; the installer cannot obtain it.

Cloud and CHAOS deployments additionally require network access, provider account
permissions, and SSH key access to the instances. The cloud CLIs are required by
the Web UI; manual Terraform workflows can instead use their provider's standard
credential environment variables or profiles. Docker must be running after its
installation. Linux users must add themselves to the Docker or Libvirt group and
start a new login session before using those targets without `sudo`.

## Web UI (Recommended)

A zero-dependency web frontend (written in Go) is available in [`ui-go/`](./ui-go/README.md).
It lets you configure, deploy, stop, restart, and destroy MongoDB environments through a
browser instead of editing `.tfvars` files by hand.

Key features:
- Visual wizard for cluster topology, images/packages, credentials, and networking
- Audit plugin controls for every cluster and replica set, including enable/disable and custom filter expressions
- Optional YCSB workload generator with UI controls to insert data, start load, and stop load
- Live deployment log streamed in the browser via Server-Sent Events
- Hosts & Connections panel with one-click SSH/`docker exec` commands, MongoDB connection
  strings, and direct links to PMM and SeaweedFS Admin UIs
- Multiple concurrent environments supported — each gets its own prefixed inventory and
  SSH config files (e.g. `myenv_inventory_cl01`, `myenv_ssh_config_cl01`)

```bash
cd ui-go
UI_REPO_DIR=.. go run .
# then open http://127.0.0.1:5001
```

See [`ui-go/README.md`](./ui-go/README.md) for full details, including packaged PSMDB
Sandbox usage with the required `UI_REPO_DIR` and optional `UI_DATA_DIR`.

## Manual Instructions (without the Web UI)

1. Clone this repository on your machine and `cd` to it

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/percona/mongo_terraform_ansible.git
    cd mongo_terraform_ansible
    ```

2. Go to your desired target platform's subdirectory. Example:
    ```
    cd terraform/gcp
    ```

3. Follow the instructions on the README inside the subdirectory of your desired platform.

    - [AWS](./terraform/aws/README.md)
    - [GCP](./terraform/gcp/README.md)
    - [Azure](./terraform/azure/README.md)
    - [CHAOS](./terraform/chaos/README.md)
    - [Local Docker containers](./terraform/docker/README.md)
    - [Local Libvirt/KVM virtual machines](./terraform/libvirt/README.md)

## Advanced Workflows

The root README is a starting point. Detailed operational guidance lives with the component that runs each workflow:

- Existing topology expansion: [UI workflow](./ui-go/README.md#topology-expansion), [Ansible playbooks](./ansible/README.md#running), and each Terraform provider README.
- Workload generation with YCSB: [UI workflow](./ui-go/README.md#ycsb-workloads), [cloud Ansible notes](./ansible/README.md#ycsb-workloads), and [Docker workflow](./terraform/docker/README.md#simulating-a-workload-with-ycsb).
- ClusterSync: [manual cloud workflow](./ansible/README.md#percona-clustersync), [Docker workflow](./terraform/docker/README.md#percona-clustersync-for-mongodb), and the Terraform README for the selected cloud provider.
- TLS, Vault-backed encryption, PBM, PMM, stopping, restarting, and reset playbooks: [Ansible README](./ansible/README.md).
