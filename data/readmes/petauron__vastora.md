# Vastora

Vastora is a self-hosted desired-state control plane for applications
across multiple Sites and Nodes. The Center stores intent and orchestration
state; one Agent binary is the only node-side executor for Docker workloads,
verified native probes, and an optional local Caddy Gateway. Existing applications and applied routes continue
when the Center is unavailable.

> **Pre-alpha.** The repository is intentionally published only with working,
> tested building blocks. Do not use it to manage production workloads yet.

## What is implemented now

- A Go `vastora` CLI with a Center HTTP API, one-time Agent enrollment,
  authenticated Agent heartbeats, Agent-local encrypted credentials, and portable
  Catalog key generation, validation, signing, and verification commands.
- Browser-based first-administrator setup with a username, Argon2id password
  hashing, and authenticated sessions.
- AES-256-GCM encrypted secrets in SQLite, multi-source catalog persistence,
  Ed25519 signed catalog verification, and a bilingual React catalog console.
- Organization → Site → Node topology, typed Network Candidate/Profile state,
  private application Services, and independent multi-entry Publications.
- Leased, retryable, attempt-fenced Agent tasks with append-only audit events.
- LAN, Headscale, direct-public, shared-443, and Cloudflare Tunnel publication
  paths; each host uses one Agent-managed Caddy with a private Unix socket,
  while optional HAProxy provides TLS SNI passthrough only when Web HTTPS and
  raw TCP must share `443`.
- Signed Vastora Proxy, CPA, and Keeper runtimes pinned by digest, plus a native
  Komari Agent binary pinned by platform and SHA-256. Vastora Proxy workers run
  the official Xray image directly; only the temporary global controller keeps
  the pinned 3x-ui migration adapter.
- Separate CPA management and public client API entries: the public hostname
  routes only `/v1` through Cloudflare Tunnel and keeps CPA key authentication,
  while the management page remains on its protected entry.
- One global Vastora-owned subscription authority with cross-Site Xray-only
  workers, encrypted controller/worker journals, and sequential Alpha
  convergence from legacy per-Site 3x-ui controllers.
- An Ubuntu 24.04 Center installation path and an OS-aware Agent installer for
  Debian 12/13 and Ubuntu 22.04/24.04/26.04 on x86_64 and ARM64, including
  mixed-architecture Sites and architecture-aware Agent updates. The one-line
  Agent installer installs Docker from its official repository when missing.

## Development

Requirements: Go 1.26.6, Node.js 24.19, and npm.

```sh
make bootstrap
make check
make security-check
```

Start a local control plane after the checks pass:

```sh
GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.26.6 go run ./cmd/vastora center serve --data-dir .vastora/center --listen 127.0.0.1:8080 --agent-connect-url http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

To connect Headscale, authorize its exact HTTPS origin when Center starts by
adding `--headscale-allowed-url https://headscale.example.com`. Repeat the flag
to permit additional operator-approved control planes; browser users cannot
make Center send authenticated requests to any other host.

In another terminal, start the web development server with `cd web && npm run
dev`. On the first visit, create the administrator, then follow the required
wizard to create a real location and confirm how Agents reach Center. The
configured Agent address is reused automatically when adding nodes.

When a Cloudflare zone such as `example.com` is selected, the wizard keeps that
root zone separate and defaults Vastora to the `vastora.example.com` namespace.
Center and bundled Headscale use `center.vastora.example.com` and
`headscale.vastora.example.com`; only Headscale receives a public DNS record.
Center receives a browser-trusted DNS-01 certificate and a Headscale DNS record,
so its console is reachable only after joining the private network by default. The
wizard can optionally add a Cloudflare Tunnel fallback protected by Access. That
fallback accepts either one exact administrator email or one email domain and
still requires the Center administrator login. Agent APIs remain on their
separate private path. A Cloudflare connection created by an older Center must
be reauthorized once before enabling the fallback so its OAuth grant includes
Access management. App hostnames use a visible hierarchy such as
`manager.cpa.home.vastora.example.com`, and node-specific raw entries use names
such as `reality.edge-1.home.vastora.example.com`. Existing DNS records outside this
namespace are not overwritten.

Create an encrypted control-plane backup with a password stored in a local
`0600` file, then restore only into a new empty state directory:

```sh
GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.26.6 go run ./cmd/vastora center backup --data-dir .vastora/center --output center.vastora --password-file ./backup-password
GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.26.6 go run ./cmd/vastora center restore --input center.vastora --data-dir .vastora/restored-center --password-file ./backup-password
```

Restore uses an equivalent Vastora version and recreates the Center directory
with restrictive permissions. The archive contains SQLite, the Center root key,
and therefore the encrypted ACME account and certificate state stored in SQLite;
it does not contain Headscale, Agent, gateway, or application runtime volumes.

The Dockerfiles build an unprivileged Center image with the compiled web UI and
a separate Agent image. They intentionally do not provide an insecure default
command: a network-reachable Center must be started with its TLS certificate
and key.

Released versions use one public Center bootstrap command:

```sh
curl -LsSf https://vastora.petauron.com/install.sh | sudo sh -s -- center
```

It downloads a verified release bundle and starts Center only on the server's
loopback interface. The installer prints an SSH tunnel command; opening its
local URL starts the administrator, location, and network wizard without
claiming public port 443. Users do not clone this repository or enter a
container image digest. Each Center then generates its own short-lived,
one-line Agent install command. See [`deploy/center`](deploy/center/README.md)
for the complete bootstrap flow and local release packaging. Center checks the
official complete release selected by that endpoint and offers a confirmed
in-place update in Settings. The first release with this capability may still
be installed by running the same command again; later updates preserve the
configuration and use the built-in updater.

Released Center schemas upgrade in place through ordered, forward-only
migrations. Center writes a private, consistent SQLite snapshot before applying
pending migrations and refuses to start if migration, foreign-key, or integrity
verification fails. Restore that snapshot to downgrade; database downgrades are
never attempted automatically.

## Security model

- The Center never mounts a Docker socket.
- Agent enrollment uses a short-lived, one-time token; the Agent exchanges it
  for a unique credential encrypted in its own local state.
- Catalog source content is accepted only after Ed25519 signature verification.
- Registry credentials and catalog Bearer tokens are separate from catalogs and
  stored encrypted.
- Application runtime data is Agent-local and never uploaded as configuration.
- The Center deployment stack can run a fixed-version Headscale service with a
  separate data volume; an existing Headscale control plane is also supported.
  Bundled Headscale is the public Caddy HTTPS entry. Center stays private, while
  only its public Docker installer, token-protected Agent bootstrap and binary
  download, and task-bound uninstall completion paths are reachable through the
  Headscale hostname.
- Management pages remain private by default. Public publication requires an
  explicit high-risk confirmation and application-level authentication.
