[![CI](https://github.com/pgEdge/ColdFront/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pgEdge/ColdFront/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

ColdFront keeps tables in PostgreSQL and cold data in Apache Iceberg
(Parquet on S3-compatible, Azure, or GCS storage), and the cold tier is
both readable and writable through the same SQL with no application
changes. The application queries every table as an ordinary PostgreSQL
relation, and both operating modes present the same standard SQL
surface.

ColdFront provides two operating modes:

- Tiered mode keeps recent data in native PostgreSQL partitions and
  archives older data to Iceberg on a watermark; the application reads a
  single unified view, and the archiver moves rows from hot to cold on a
  schedule.
- Decoupled mode stores the table entirely in Iceberg from the first
  row; PostgreSQL holds a thin wrapper view and a registry row, and the
  coldfront extension handles every data-modifying statement on that
  view.

Both modes coexist within one database, and you choose the mode per
table at creation time. The SQL surface is identical for both modes:
standard SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE against the relation.

Decoupled mode scales out horizontally across many PostgreSQL nodes that
share one Lakekeeper catalog and one object store. The bakery protocol
in the coldfront extension serializes Iceberg commits on the PostgreSQL
side using Spock-replicated Snowflake tickets, so concurrent writers
never collide at the catalog. The protocol implements Lamport mutual
exclusion with the Ricart-Agrawala deferred-reply optimization, and the
[formal model](docs/formal/README.md) verifies its safety with TLA+.

## How It Works

ColdFront runs inside PostgreSQL and rewrites each statement to the
correct tier, so the application sees one relation:

```text
                       Application
                            │
              SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE
              against one relation: "events"
                            │
                 PostgreSQL 16 / 17 / 18
           events VIEW: reads union hot + cold
       coldfront extension: routes writes by tier
              ┌─────────────┴───────────────┐
              │                             │
          hot tier                      cold tier
      _events: native PostgreSQL    pg_duckdb: in-process DuckDB
      range partitions              Iceberg reads + writes
              │                             │
              │                     Lakekeeper (Iceberg REST catalog)
              │                             │
              │                     object store, S3 / Azure / GCS
              │                     (Parquet data + Iceberg metadata)
              │                             ▲
              └──── Archiver (Go, cron) ────┘
                    moves partitions past the hot window: hot → cold
```

## Installation

New here? Run the [guided walkthrough](docs/walkthrough.md) to see all
three modes in action with copy-pasteable commands.

ColdFront is open source under the PostgreSQL License and runs on stock
PostgreSQL 16, 17, and 18. The full build workflow lives in the
**[Installation guide](docs/installation.md)**: build the thin coldfront
layer on top of the published DuckDB 1.5.x base image (or build the base
yourself), or install bare-metal. Then continue with the Quickstart below.

**Setting up on cloud S3?** Once the image is built, the
**[S3 setup guide](docs/object_store.md)** takes you from an empty bucket to
a working cold tier end-to-end.

## Quickstart

Build the image (see the [Installation](docs/installation.md) guide) and
bring up the stack:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Bootstrap Lakekeeper and create a warehouse (see the one-time setup in
the [Using ColdFront](docs/usage.md) guide), then create a table in psql:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_duckdb;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS coldfront;
SELECT coldfront.set_storage_secret('admin', 'adminsecret', 'seaweedfs:8333');

-- Decoupled (iceberg-only) table, stored entirely in Iceberg on S3:
SELECT coldfront.create_iceberg_table('public', 'events',
  '[{"name":"id","type":"bigint"},{"name":"ts","type":"timestamptz"},{"name":"note","type":"text"}]'::jsonb,
  '{month(ts)}');
INSERT INTO events VALUES (1, now(), 'hello');
SELECT count(*) FROM events;
```

A table that already exists in the Iceberg catalog is adopted rather than
created: `coldfront.adopt_iceberg_table()` reads its schema from the
catalog and gives it the same wrapper view and registry row, read-only
unless writes are asked for. `coldfront.release_iceberg_table()` hands it
back with the Iceberg table untouched. See
[Adopting a table that already exists in the catalog](docs/usage.md#adopting-a-table-that-already-exists-in-the-catalog).

To remove a table again, `coldfront.drop_iceberg_table()` unregisters it
and drops the Iceberg table, deleting the stored objects only when asked
to. See
[Dropping an Iceberg table](docs/usage.md#dropping-an-iceberg-table-both-modes).

For compliance environments that cannot store an object-store credential,
`coldfront.set_storage_secret_vended()` runs with no credential in the
database: Lakekeeper issues short-lived per-table credentials at access
time. See [Vended credentials](docs/usage.md#vended-credentials).

## Least-privilege application roles

Application roles need no superuser and no server-file access, yet they
read and write the cold tier through the same transparent view.
Onboarding an application role is a single call:

```sql
SELECT coldfront.grant_app_access('alice');
```

grant_app_access grants only the minimum the cold path needs: membership
in duckdb.postgres_role, schema USAGE, SELECT on the registry, DML on
every registered view and the hot table and sequences behind it (all
derived from the registry, not hardcoded), plus EXECUTE on a fixed
allow-list of runtime cold-path functions. The
call is idempotent and is not executable by PUBLIC, so an application
role can never self-grant. The role is never granted
pg_read_server_files or pg_write_server_files, so it has no host-file
access. CREATE ROLE and GRANT both replicate over Spock, so you onboard
a role once on any node and it propagates across the mesh.

For how the non-superuser path works under the hood - the `SECURITY
DEFINER` attach helpers, the `PGC_SUSET` / `GUC_SUPERUSER_ONLY` config
hardening, the turnkey `duckdb.postgres_role` default, and how least
privilege holds across a Spock mesh - see [Architecture: non-superuser
app roles](docs/architecture.md#non-superuser-app-roles-least-privilege).

## Caveats

Iceberg on Azure ADLS Gen2 requires Blob soft-delete, container
soft-delete, and change feed (blob events) to be OFF on the storage
account. Lakekeeper warehouse creation otherwise fails with HTTP 409
("This endpoint does not support BlobStorageEvents or SoftDelete").
Disable those features on the storage account before using it as a cold
tier.

## Dependencies

The following table lists the services and components ColdFront runs
against:

| Component | Version | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| PostgreSQL | 16, 17, or 18 | Database with native partitioning (stock upstream; no fork) |
| pg_duckdb | 1.5.4 (PR #1025) | Iceberg reads + writes via DuckDB in-process |
| duckdb-iceberg | `v1.5-variegata` @ `5edc45f0`, patched | Iceberg catalog/IO for DuckDB; carries ColdFront's four patches (see [DUCKDB_1.5_PATCHED.md](DUCKDB_1.5_PATCHED.md)) |
| Lakekeeper | latest | Iceberg REST catalog (Rust binary) |
| S3-compatible store | any | SeaweedFS, MinIO, GCS, Azure Blob, etc. |

Building from source needs the Go toolchain (the version is pinned in
[go.mod](go.mod)). The Go module dependencies are the source of truth in
[go.mod](go.mod) / [go.sum](go.sum); the archiver and partitioner build
as static, CGO-free binaries on `pgx/v5`, and the compactor is a separate
module ([cmd/compactor/go.mod](cmd/compactor/go.mod)) built on
`apache/iceberg-go`.

## Versioning

ColdFront carries two independent version numbers, each following its own
convention:

- Release tags use three-part
  [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) (`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, for
  example `v1.0.0`); Git tags, GitHub releases, container image tags, and
  the changelog all use this form. Three parts are required because
  ColdFront is a Go module, and the toolchain recognises only full `vX.Y.Z`
  tags as releases. The patch field keeps a bugfix-only release (`v1.0.1`)
  distinct from a feature release (`v1.1.0`), which matters for a
  data-writing extension where "same behaviour, one safety fix" is worth
  stating plainly.
- The PostgreSQL extension uses the conventional two-part version in its
  control file (`default_version = '1.0'`) and upgrade-script filenames
  (`coldfront--1.0--1.1.sql`), as is standard for PostgreSQL extensions.

The two map cleanly: extension `1.0` ships inside release `v1.0.0`, and a
patch release may carry the same extension version or bump it with an
upgrade script when the SQL changes.
