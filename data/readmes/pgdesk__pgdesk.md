<p align="center">
  <b>An admin panel for your PostgreSQL database, mounted inside your own Go server.</b><br>
  Hand it a <code>pgxpool</code>. It reads your schema and serves lists, search, filters, forms and CSV export.

## The whole integration

That screen is [`examples/basic`](examples/basic). This is all the admin code in it:

```go
admin, err := pgdesk.New(pool, // your existing *pgxpool.Pool
    pgdesk.WithTitle("Shop Admin"),
    pgdesk.WithSecretKey(secret),           // signs CSRF tokens
    pgdesk.WithMiddleware(yourAuth),        // who is signed in
    pgdesk.WithAuthorizer(pgdesk.AllowAll), // what they may do
    pgdesk.WithResource("orders", func(r *pgdesk.Resource) {
        r.ListDisplay("id", "customer_id", "status", "total", "placed_at")
        r.SearchFields("customer_id") // find orders by the customer's name
        r.Filters("status", "placed_at")
        r.FieldLabel("customer_id", "Customer")
        r.DefaultSort("-placed_at")
    }),
    pgdesk.WithResource("customers", func(r *pgdesk.Resource) {
        r.ListDisplay("id", "name", "email", "country")
        r.SearchFields("name", "email")
        r.Filters("country")
    }),
)

admin.Mount(mux) // live at /admin/
```

The code only names columns. pgdesk works out the rest from the database:

| In your schema | What you get |
|---|---|
| `customer_id REFERENCES customers` | Shows **Ada Lovelace** instead of `1`, links to her record, gives the form a searchable customer picker, and lets you search orders by customer name |
| `CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'paid', ...))` | A dropdown in the form and in the filter |
| `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`, `DEFAULT now()` | `id` is read-only; leave `placed_at` empty to get the default |
| `timestamptz` | A date-range filter |
| A view PostgreSQL can't update | No edit button |

## Try it

```sh
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pgdesk postgres:16
git clone https://github.com/pgdesk/pgdesk && cd pgdesk
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:pgdesk@localhost:5432/postgres go run ./examples/basic
# open http://localhost:8080/admin/
```

## How it fits

```
browser ─▶ your Go server ─▶ your auth middleware ─▶ pgdesk (an http.Handler) ─▶ PostgreSQL
                             "who is this?"           schema from pg_catalog,
                                                      parameterized SQL only
```

- **Keep your stack.** It works with any router ([Gin](examples/gin)) and any ORM ([GORM](examples/gorm)), because pgdesk reads the database, not your models. Its only dependency is `pgx`.
- **Keep your auth.** pgdesk has no login page. Your middleware says *who* the user is ([example](examples/session-auth)). An `Authorizer` decides *what* they may do. An optional `Scoper` decides *which rows* they see, and pgdesk adds that to the SQL `WHERE` ([how scoping is enforced](docs/scoping.md)).
- **Nothing is exposed until you name it.** It shows only the tables you list, or all of them if you opt into `WithAutoRegister`.

Concurrent edits can't silently overwrite each other, and with `WithTxAuditLogger` each change and its audit entry commit together or not at all.

pgdesk is built for internal tools used by trusted operators. Put it behind your auth and your network, not on the open internet. Serve it over HTTPS. On a trusted network without TLS, pass `WithInsecureCookies()`.

## Requirements

Go 1.25+ and PostgreSQL 12+.

go get github.com/pgdesk/pgdesk@latest
