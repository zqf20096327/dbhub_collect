# PgDog Helm Chart

Production-ready [Helm](https://helm.sh) chart for PgDog with
high availability, security, and resource management features.

## Features

✅ Resource limits with guaranteed QoS (1GB:1CPU ratio)

✅ PodDisruptionBudget for high availability

✅ Pod anti-affinity for spreading across nodes

✅ ExternalSecrets integration for secure credential management

✅ ServiceAccount and RBAC with minimal permissions

✅ Pinned image versions for production deployments

## Quick Start

1. Install Helm
2. Configure `kubectl` to point to your K8s cluster
3. Add our Helm repository:
   `helm repo add pgdogdev https://helm.pgdog.dev`
4. Configure databases and users in `values.yaml`
5. Install:
   `helm install <name> pgdogdev/pgdog -f values.yaml`

All resources will be created in `<name>` namespace.

### Configuration

Configuration is done via `values.yaml`. All PgDog settings from
`pgdog.toml` and `users.toml` are supported. General settings
(`[general]` section) are top level. Use camelCase format instead
of snake_case, for example: `checkout_timeout` becomes
`checkoutTimeout`.

#### Basic Example

```yaml
workers: 2
defaultPoolSize: 15
openMetricsPort: 9090
logFormat: json
logLevel: info
```

### Docker Image

By default, the chart uses the `appVersion` from `Chart.yaml` as the image
tag. This ensures the chart deploys a known-compatible version of PgDog
without requiring explicit configuration.

To override with a specific version:

```yaml
image:
  repository: ghcr.io/pgdogdev/pgdog
  tag: "v1.2.3" # Pin to specific version
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```

To pin to an exact build, use a digest instead of a tag:

```yaml
image:
  repository: ghcr.io/pgdogdev/pgdog
  digest: "sha256:abc123def456..." # Immutable reference
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```

When `digest` is specified, it takes precedence over `tag`.

**Legacy format** (still supported for backward compatibility):

```yaml
image:
  name: ghcr.io/pgdogdev/pgdog:main
  pullPolicy: Always
```

### Databases & Users

Add databases to `databases` list:

```yaml
databases:
  - name: "prod"
    host: "10.0.0.1"
```

Add users to `users` list:

```yaml
users:
  - name: "alice"
    database: "prod"
    password: "hunter2" # See ExternalSecrets for secure storage
```

**⚠️ For production**: Use ExternalSecrets instead of plain text
passwords (see ExternalSecrets section below).

### Mirroring

Add mirrors to `mirrors` list. For example:

```yaml
mirrors:
  - sourceDb: "prod"
    destinationDb: "staging"
```

### High Availability

#### StatefulSet WAL storage

PgDog can persist its two-phase commit WAL when running as a StatefulSet.
Enable `walPvc` and configure the requested capacity:

```yaml
statefulSet:
  enabled: true
  walPvc:
    enabled: true
    size: 5Gi
```

The StatefulSet creates one `ReadWriteOnce` persistent volume claim per replica
and mounts it at `/var/lib/pgdog`. Before PgDog starts, an init container creates
`/var/lib/pgdog/wal` on the volume. The generated PgDog configuration sets
`two_phase_commit_wal_dir` to that directory automatically. An explicit
`twoPhaseCommitWalDir` value still takes precedence.

The claims use the cluster's default `StorageClass`. Ensure one is configured
for dynamic provisioning before enabling `walPvc`. This option has no effect
when PgDog runs as a Deployment.

#### PodDisruptionBudget

Ensures minimum pod availability during voluntary disruptions
(enabled by default):

```yaml
podDisruptionBudget:
  enabled: true
  minAvailable: 1 # At least 1 pod always available
```

#### Pod Anti-Affinity

Spreads pods across nodes for better reliability (enabled by
default):

```yaml
podAntiAffinity:
  enabled: true
  type: soft # "soft" (preferred) or "hard" (required)
```

#### Multi-AZ

Spread replicas evenly across availability zones with a maximum skew of one:

```yaml
multiAz:
  enabled: true
  whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway
```

This uses the `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` node label. Set
`whenUnsatisfiable` to `DoNotSchedule` to make the constraint strict. Additional
constraints can be set with `topologySpreadConstraints`.

### Config Change Restarts

By default, ConfigMap changes are not automatically picked up by
running pods. Enable `restartOnConfigChange` to trigger a rolling
restart whenever the rendered config changes:

```yaml
restartOnConfigChange: true
```

This injects a `checksum/config` pod annotation that changes when the
config template output changes, causing Kubernetes to roll the pods.

### ExternalSecrets Integration

Securely manage credentials using ExternalSecrets operator:

**Option 1: Create ExternalSecret with chart**

```yaml
externalSecrets:
  enabled: true
  create: true
  secretStoreRef:
    name: aws-secrets-manager
    kind: SecretStore
  remoteRefs:
    - secretKey: users.toml
      remoteRef:
        key: pgdog/users
```

**Option 2: Use existing ExternalSecret**

```yaml
externalSecrets:
  enabled: true
  create: false
  secretName: "my-secret" # Name of Secret you created
```

### Referencing Existing Secrets

If you manage Kubernetes Secrets yourself (via `kubectl`, sealed-secrets,
SOPS, etc.), point the chart at them directly instead of putting secret
values in `values.yaml`. This works without the ExternalSecrets operator.

#### users.toml from an existing Secret

Set `usersSecret.name` to reference a Secret you created that holds the
`users.toml` file. The chart then skips rendering its own users Secret and
mounts yours instead:

```yaml
usersSecret:
  name: my-pgdog-users # existing Secret in the same namespace
  key: users.toml # key holding the users.toml content (default: users.toml)
```

Create the Secret, for example:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic my-pgdog-users \
  --from-file=users.toml=./users.toml
```

The value is mounted at `/etc/secrets/pgdog/users.toml` regardless of the
key name. A custom `key` is remapped automatically.

#### pgdog.toml from an existing Secret

Set `configSecret.name` to reference a Secret you created that holds the
`pgdog.toml` file. The chart then skips rendering its own pgdog.toml
ConfigMap and mounts your Secret as the config volume instead. Use this when
your pgdog.toml contains values that must not live in a ConfigMap, such as
database hosts or the admin password sourced from a secrets manager:

```yaml
configSecret:
  name: my-pgdog-config # existing Secret in the same namespace
  key: pgdog.toml # key holding the pgdog.toml content (default: pgdog.toml)
```

Create the Secret, for example:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic my-pgdog-config \
  --from-file=pgdog.toml=./pgdog.toml
```

The value is mounted at `/etc/pgdog/pgdog.toml` regardless of the key name.
A custom `key` is remapped automatically. All pgdog.toml-related chart values
(`databases`, `defaultPoolSize`, sharding settings, etc.) are ignored, since
your Secret provides the whole file.

Note: swapping the volume source is required — overlaying a Secret-provided
`pgdog.toml` on top of the chart's ConfigMap with a `subPath` volume mount
fails at container start (the mount target is a symlink inside the ConfigMap
volume; see
[kubernetes/kubernetes#61545](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/61545)).

Note: `plugins[].config` entries render into the chart's ConfigMap and are
not mounted when `configSecret.name` is set. A Secret-provided pgdog.toml
controls its own plugin config paths, so mount plugin files elsewhere via
`extraVolumes`/`extraVolumeMounts`.

#### Datadog API key from an existing Secret

PgDog reads the Datadog API key from the `DD_API_KEY` environment variable.
Reference an existing Secret and the chart injects it as `DD_API_KEY`, so the
key is never written into `pgdog.toml` (or the ConfigMap):

```yaml
otel:
  endpoint: https://otlp.example.com/v1/metrics # your OTLP endpoint
  datadogApiKeySecret:
    name: my-datadog # existing Secret in the same namespace
    key: dd-api-key # key holding the API key (default: dd-api-key)
```

Create the Secret, for example:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic my-datadog \
  --from-literal=dd-api-key=<your-datadog-api-key>
```

This is mutually exclusive with the inline `otel.datadogApiKey`, which writes
the key into the ConfigMap as plaintext and should be avoided.

If both are set, the inline value takes precedence.

### ServiceAccount & RBAC

RBAC with minimal permissions is enabled by default:

```yaml
serviceAccount:
  create: true
  annotations: {}

rbac:
  create: true
```

### Resource Management

Default resources use Guaranteed QoS with 1GB:1CPU ratio:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 1000m # 1 CPU
    memory: 1Gi # 1GB
  limits:
    cpu: 1000m
    memory: 1Gi
```

You can set `noCpuLimits: true` to omit CPU limits. This allows containers to use idle CPU on the host.

```yaml
noCpuLimits: true
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 512Mi
  limits:
    memory: 512Mi
```

### Prometheus (optional)

Prometheus metrics can be collected with a sidecar. Enable by
configuring `prometheusPort`:

```yaml
prometheusPort: 9091

# Resources for Prometheus sidecar
prometheusResources:
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 100Mi
  limits:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 100Mi
```

Make sure it's different from `openMetricsPort`. You can configure
Prometheus in `templates/prom/config.yaml`.

#### Grafana Remote Write

To send metrics to Grafana Cloud or a Grafana instance, configure
the remote write settings:

```yaml
grafanaRemoteWrite:
  url: "https://prometheus-prod-XX-XXX.grafana.net/api/prom/push"
  basicAuth:
    username: "123456" # Grafana Cloud user ID
    password: "your-api-key" # Grafana Cloud API key
  queueConfig:
    capacity: 10000
    maxShards: 50
    minShards: 1
    maxSamplesPerSend: 5000
    batchSendDeadline: 5s
    minBackoff: 30ms
    maxBackoff: 5s
```

The `queueConfig` settings use Prometheus defaults and can be tuned
for performance. Remote write is automatically enabled when `url` is
set.

### Plugins

Add plugins to the `plugins` list. Each plugin requires a `name`; `config` is
optional and accepts inline TOML content. When `config` is provided, a
`<name>.toml` file is added to the ConfigMap and mounted at
`/etc/pgdog/<name>.toml`.

```yaml
plugins:
  - name: pgdog_routing
    config: |
      [routing]
      key = "value"
  - name: pgdog_auth
```

### TCP Keep-Alive Configuration

Configure socket-level TCP keep-alive behavior (optional):

```yaml
tcpKeepalive: true
tcpTime: 7200000 # 2 hours (ms) before first keepalive probe
tcpInterval: 75000 # 75 seconds (ms) between keepalive probes
tcpRetries: 9 # Number of keepalive probes before connection is dropped
```

These settings control the TCP keep-alive behavior for database
connections. All time values are in milliseconds. If not specified,
system defaults are used.

### Connection storms

`listenBacklog` controls the maximum number of pending client connections in
PgDog's listening TCP socket. The kernel caps the queue length at
`net.core.somaxconn`, so configure both values when increasing the connection backlog:

```yaml
listenBacklog: 4096
podSecurityContext:
  sysctls:
    - name: net.core.somaxconn
      value: "4096"
```
