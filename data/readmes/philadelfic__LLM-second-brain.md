A self-hosted **long-term memory server** for LLMs running in harnesses
(primarily Open WebUI). Models get MCP access to a shared knowledge store —
notes, plus three knowledge areas (skills, terms, facts about the user): they
can search it (hybrid vector + full-text), read, write, update and delete
records.

## What it is

- **One Docker container**, self-hosted, non-root.
- **MCP Streamable HTTP** (`/mcp`, natively supported by Open WebUI) with a
  Bearer token.
- **21 MCP tools**: 8 `memory_*` for notes and namespaces, plus three
  knowledge areas — 5 `skills_*`, 5 `user_*` and 3 `terms_*`.
- **Storage**: one SQLite database + `sqlite-vec` (vector search) + FTS5
  (full-text), merged via Reciprocal Rank Fusion; every knowledge area has
  its own tables and indexes, isolated from notes and from each other.
- **Three knowledge areas next to notes** (since v3.0): **skills** — stored
  procedures, read in full only when needed, with a version archive;
  **terms** — terminology keyed by (term + context), every sense returned and
  never overwritten; **user** — atomic facts about the user with dedup hints.
  Each area has MCP tools and operator REST mirrors.
- **Vectorization & summarization** are external LLM calls. Each of the three
  slots (embedding / summary / judge) is configured independently with its own
  provider (`ollama` or an OpenAI-compatible API), base URL, model and optional
  API key.
- **Hierarchical namespaces**: the store is split into large sections; the map
  is exposed to models via MCP instructions and `memory_namespaces`.
- **Related notes** (since v3.1): reading a note also returns its `links` —
  neighbours by meaning or by shared entities, from other namespaces; search,
  list and read outputs carry `chars`, the size of the full note text.
- **Listings that page** (since v3.1): `memory_list` and `skills_list` report
  `total` / `has_more` / `next_offset` / `next_cursor` and a `+N more` hint when
  a page is capped; the ceiling is tighter on the MCP surface than on REST.
- **Background worker**: pending vectors, summaries, dedup, classification,
  title generation and the new knowledge areas are processed asynchronously;
  scheduled maintenance jobs (related-notes recompute, default-namespace
  tidy-up) run on their own intervals; failures never break CRUD (pending
  states + back-off retry).
- **Observability** (since v3.1): `/health` (no token) reports the running
  application `version` and `queues` — how many jobs wait in each background
  queue and how long the oldest has waited.
- **Backups**: periodic online SQLite snapshots with rotation.

## Why

1. **Distributed knowledge with fast access.** Knowledge lives in a separate
   store, not in the system prompt or chat history; the model fetches only what
   is relevant, on demand.
2. **Token economy.** Instead of a monolithic context — a fixed small overhead
   for the tool spec (~1200 tokens), a compact skills announce (budget 2000
   characters, refreshed on every connect) and targeted retrieval of **short
   summaries**, not full texts.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <repo> llm-second-brain && cd llm-second-brain
mkdir -p data prompts
# Edit docker-compose.yml: set MCP_AUTH_TOKEN (openssl rand -hex 32) and the
# three LLM slot addresses/models. Full reference: docs/CONFIG.md.
docker compose up -d --build
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | python -m json.tool
```

`/health` answers without a token. See [Installation](docs/INSTALL.md) for the
first-run walkthrough (compose, token, Open WebUI, `/health`).

## Documentation

- [Installation](docs/INSTALL.md) — setup, first run, Open WebUI, `/health`.
- [Configuration](docs/CONFIG.md) — environment variables, the prompt files,
  and the `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE` note.
- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) — release history (Keep a Changelog).

## Operational notes

- **`keep_alive` is not sent by the client** (since v2.1). Model residency is
  managed by the server: set `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE` on the Ollama side if you want
  models to stay loaded. With the server default (5 min) models are unloaded
  more often, and a cold start (~22.6 GB for the summarizer) returns to
  latency.
- **Changing `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` / `EMBEDDING_MODEL` / `EMBEDDING_DIM`**
  triggers an automatic full reindex on startup: all notes go to `pending` and
  the worker re-encodes them, and the knowledge-area indexes are rebuilt the
  same way. Search/dedup thresholds are calibrated for `qwen3-embedding:8b` —
  recalibrate after changing the model.
- **Knowledge areas (since v3.0)**: skills, terms and user facts live in the
  same database but in their own tables and indexes; they are isolated from
  notes in both directions. Their form limits and similarity thresholds are
  environment-tunable and validated at startup.
- **Privacy**: an `openai` provider sends note texts to an external API (the
  dedup judge and classifier see full texts). Choose providers per slot
  deliberately.
