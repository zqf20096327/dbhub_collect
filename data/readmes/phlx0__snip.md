## Why snip?

You write a clever one-liner. You close the terminal. Three weeks later you're Googling the same thing again.

**snip** fixes that. It's a personal snippet vault that runs entirely in your terminal — local, offline, zero-account, instantly searchable. Open it, find what you need, yank it to your clipboard, and get back to work.

No Electron. No browser. No sync drama. Just your snippets, always there.

---

## Install

### One-liner (Linux / macOS)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phlx0/snip/main/install.sh | bash
```

Creates an isolated virtualenv at `~/.local/share/snip`, drops a `snip` launcher at `~/.local/bin/snip`, and patches your shell config if needed. Open a new terminal and you're done.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phlx0/snip
cd snip
make dev    # creates .venv + installs with dev extras
make run    # launch
```

---

## Usage

```bash
snip                          # open the TUI
snip ports                    # copy snippet titled "ports" to clipboard
snip run deploy               # run a snippet as a shell command
snip --list                   # print all snippet titles
snip --list docker            # filter titles by tag
snip --add myscript.sh        # save a file as a snippet
snip --delete ports           # delete a snippet without opening the TUI
snip --json ports             # output snippet as JSON (great for scripting)
snip --export > backup.json   # export all snippets to JSON
snip --import backup.json     # import snippets from JSON
snip --from-history           # pick a command from shell history and save it
snip --version                # show version
snip -q ports                 # suppress informational output (clean for scripts)
snip --db ~/sync/snippets     # use a custom snippets directory
snip theme list               # list available themes
snip theme set dracula        # switch to the Dracula theme
snip theme import my.json     # import a custom theme and activate it
snip --theme dracula          # one-shot: use a theme for this session only
```

### Shell completion

```bash
# zsh — add to ~/.zshrc
eval "$(snip init zsh)"

# bash — add to ~/.bashrc
eval "$(snip init bash)"
```

`snip <TAB>` will autocomplete snippet titles and flags.

### fzf integration

```bash
snip --list | fzf | xargs snip
```

Pick any snippet interactively with fuzzy search, pipe it straight to your clipboard.
