## Download

Please visit the [Picturama website](https://picturama.github.io/).

**Linux:** an AppImage requires FUSE to run, but Ubuntu and Debian no longer install FUSE 2 by default.
If it doesn't start, install it with `sudo apt install libfuse2` (on Ubuntu 24.04: `libfuse2t64`), or run
the AppImage with `--appimage-extract-and-run`. And make sure the file is executable (`chmod +x`).
