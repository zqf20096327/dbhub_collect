## Why Inkvoice

Inkvoice is a lightweight, **self-hosted** invoicing dashboard for people who'd rather own their billing than rent it. Send professional invoices, get paid online, keep an eye on expenses, and hand clean numbers to your accountant — without per-seat pricing or data lock-in.

- 🗄️ **Own your data** — everything lives in a single SQLite file you control.
- 📦 **One container, runs anywhere** — Docker, [Coolify](https://coolify.io), or [one-click on Dokploy](https://dokploy.com/templates/inkvoice); ~50–100&nbsp;MB RAM.
- ⚡ **Modern & fast** — Bun + Hono + React, no heavyweight runtime.
- 🌍 **Multi-currency, multi-user, multi-language** out of the box.
- ☁️ **Don't want to self-host?** Use the managed **[Inkvoice Cloud](https://cloud.inkvoice.app)** and skip the ops.

## Quick Start

### Docker (recommended)

Inkvoice ships as a **prebuilt multi-arch image** (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`), so there's nothing to clone and nothing to build:

```bash
docker run -d --name inkvoice \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v invoice-data:/app/data \
  --memory 512m \
  -e JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 48)" \
  -e ADMIN_PASS="change-me-please" \
  ghcr.io/pigontech/inkvoice:latest
```

Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** and log in with `admin` and the password you set.

Prefer Compose? Save this as `docker-compose.yml` and run `docker compose up -d`:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/pigontech/inkvoice:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - invoice-data:/app/data
    mem_limit: 512m
    environment:
      JWT_SECRET: change-this-to-a-random-string-of-at-least-32-chars
      ADMIN_PASS: change-me-please
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  invoice-data:
```

> **Keep the 512 MB cap.** Bun sizes its heap to the memory it can see, so the cap is what keeps
> Inkvoice in its usual ~60 MB working set. Measured on a fresh install: **62 MB** capped at 512 MB,
> versus **118 MB** uncapped.
>
> **Image tags:** `latest` tracks `main`. For a stable deployment, pin a release tag such as
> `ghcr.io/pigontech/inkvoice:0.3.0`.
>
> **Going public?** Put it behind HTTPS and add `-e COOKIE_SECURE=true -e ENABLE_HSTS=true`.
> Staying on plain HTTP? Add `-e COOKIE_SECURE=false`. It defaults to true, which marks the
> session cookie Secure, and browsers drop that on every non-HTTPS address except localhost,
> so logins fail with no visible error.

### Manual (development)

```bash
bun install
bun run dev          # backend (:3000) + frontend (:5173) together
```

### Build for production

```bash
bun run build        # build the frontend
bun run start        # serve API + static frontend on :3000
```

## Self-Hosting

[![Deploy on Dokploy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deploy-Dokploy-06b6d4)](https://dokploy.com/templates/inkvoice)
[![Deploy on Coolify](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deploy-Coolify-8b5cf6)](#coolify)
[![Deploy with Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deploy-Docker-2496ED?logo=docker&logoColor=white)](#plain-docker)

Inkvoice ships as a single container — expose port `3000` and mount a volume on `/app/data` so the SQLite database survives redeploys. The fastest path is the [official Dokploy template](https://dokploy.com/templates/inkvoice).

### Dokploy

Inkvoice is in the [official Dokploy templates catalog](https://dokploy.com/templates/inkvoice):

1. In your Dokploy panel, open a project and click **Create Service → Template**.
2. Search for **Inkvoice** and click **Create**.
3. Dokploy generates `ADMIN_PASS` and `JWT_SECRET`, mounts `/app/data`, and routes a domain to port `3000`.
4. Deploy, then sign in as `admin` with the generated password (under the service's environment variables).

The catalog template ships `COOKIE_SECURE=false` so login works on Dokploy's auto-generated HTTP domain. After you attach an HTTPS custom domain, set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` and `ENABLE_HSTS=true`.

To deploy a fork or a custom image tag, create a Compose/Docker service from this repo instead: expose port `3000`, mount `/app/data`, and set `JWT_SECRET` + `ADMIN_PASS`.

### Coolify

1. **New resource → Public Repository** → paste this repo's URL.
2. **Build pack:** Dockerfile (the repo root `Dockerfile`).
3. **Port:** `3000`.
4. **Persistent storage:** add a volume on `/app/data` — without it, every deploy wipes the database.
5. **Environment:** set at least `JWT_SECRET` (≥ 32 chars), `ADMIN_PASS`, and `COOKIE_SECURE=true`.
6. **Domain:** attach one and Coolify issues a Let's Encrypt cert; then set `ENABLE_HSTS=true`.
7. **Health check:** point it at `/health`.

### Plain Docker

```bash
docker build -t inkvoice .
docker run -d \
  --name inkvoice \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v invoice-data:/app/data \
  -e JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 48)" \
  -e ADMIN_PASS="change-me-please" \
  -e COOKIE_SECURE=true \
  -e ENABLE_HSTS=true \
  inkvoice
```

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to bootstrap a local config. Most runtime knobs (currency, locale, invoice number pattern, email templates, etc.) live on the in-app **Settings** page — environment variables are reserved for deploy-time concerns (auth, ports, secrets).

### Environment Variables

### SSO / OIDC

Any standards-compliant OIDC provider (Keycloak, Authentik, Authelia, Entra ID, Okta, Google Workspace, …) can act as the single sign-on source. Set `OIDC_ISSUER_URL`, `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` and `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` to enable it — everything else is auto-discovered via `/.well-known/openid-configuration`.

1. Register a **confidential** client at your provider with redirect URI `https://your-domain/api/v1/auth/oidc/callback` (use the origin your install is served from, or set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`).
2. First-time logins auto-provision a read-only **Viewer** account unless `OIDC_AUTO_PROVISION=false` — promote users in **Users**. Restrict who can self-register with `OIDC_ALLOWED_DOMAINS`.
3. Existing accounts link automatically on first SSO login only when the provider attests the email (`email_verified` claim). Password login remains available and is the admin recovery path.
