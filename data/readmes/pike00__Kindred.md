# Kindred

A self-hosted personal CRM for tracking your relationships — contacts, interactions, reminders, gifts, debts, journal entries — with CardDAV sync, full-text search, and a React frontend. Built on the
[FastAPI full-stack template](https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template) and deployed to a homelab via Docker Compose behind Traefik.

## Why Kindred?
We meet so many people, but keeping track of those connections isn't always easy. Kindred is built to help you stay in touch, remember the little things, and cultivate meaningful relationships. Whether you want to recall a past interaction, track a gift idea, or just get a reminder to text an old friend, Kindred provides a private, self-hosted space to keep your personal network organized without compromising your data privacy.

## Quick Start
Get up and running in under 30 seconds using Docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

That's it! Your Kindred instance and all necessary services (PostgreSQL, Meilisearch, Redis) will spin up automatically.

## Features Showcase
| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Contacts & Groups** | Keep everyone organized with tagging, favoriting, and relationship maps. |
| **Interactions Log** | Never forget a conversation. Log calls, texts, emails, and meetings. |
| **Smart Reminders** | Set up scheduled nudges so you don't lose touch with the people who matter. |
| **Gifts & Debts** | Track gifts given/received and easily manage "who owes who" scenarios. |
| **Daily Journal** | Maintain a freeform personal journal to reflect on your days. |
| **CardDAV Sync** | Native support for standard contacts syncing to your mobile devices. |

## Comparison to other tools
### Kindred vs. Monica
Monica is a fantastic and feature-rich personal CRM. However, it can feel heavy to host and navigate. Kindred aims for a lighter, faster, and more modern experience with a streamlined React frontend, native mobile-friendly UI, and fewer external dependencies.

### Kindred vs. Notion / Obsidian
While note-taking tools are extremely flexible, they lack the structured reminders, CardDAV syncing, and specialized relationship views (like decaying contact indicators or dedicated interaction timelines) that a purpose-built CRM like Kindred provides out of the box.

## Detailed Features
### Shipped (frontend + backend)

- **Contacts** — CRUD, favorites, archive, tagging, groups, list/detail views, inline editing
- **Interactions** — Log calls, texts, emails, in-person meetings, notes per interaction
- **Reminders** — Scheduled reminders with date/time, per-contact linking
- **Tags & Groups** — Organize contacts, many-to-many relationships
- **Journal** — Freeform personal journaling with entries
- **Gifts** — Track gifts given/received per contact
- **Debts** — "I owe them" / "they owe me" tracking per contact
- **Notes** — Freeform notes attached to a contact
- **Users & Admin** — Signup, login, logout, password recovery, superuser-gated user management
- **Dashboard** — Stats, "losing touch" suggestions, recent interactions

### Backend-only (no UI yet)

These routes are registered and tested at the API level, but have no frontend pages. Either build the UI or remove them when you decide the feature is out of scope.

- `addresses`, `pets`, `relationships`, `contact_fields` — read-only rendering on the contact detail page, no add/edit UI
- `custom_fields` — per-contact arbitrary fields
- `life_events` — birthdays, anniversaries, major events
- `import_export` — bulk contact import/export (CSV / vCard)
- `webhooks` — outbound webhook registrations

The Copier template's `items` module has been **removed from the API router** (the model + Alembic table remain for now — drop with a dedicated migration if/when desired).

## Layout
```
backend/       FastAPI app, Alembic migrations, pytest suite, Radicale CardDAV bridge
frontend/      React app (Vite), generated OpenAPI client in src/client/
e2e/           Puppeteer end-to-end tests (bun run e2e/*.test.ts)
docs/          architecture.md, DB_SCHEMA.md, HANDOFF.md
compose.yml    Homelab production stack (kindrednet networks, Meilisearch, Redis, ARQ worker)
compose.dev.yml Dev-against-homelab overlay (bind-mounted source, --reload, frontend dev server)
.env           Runtime env vars (gitignored)
.env.sops      Production secrets, encrypted with sops + age
```

## Running the stack
Production (homelab default):

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Dev against the homelab (bind-mounted source, live reload):

```bash
docker compose -f compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

First boot runs Alembic migrations and creates the admin user from `FIRST_SUPERUSER` / `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD` in `.env`.

## Testing
Backend (inside the running stack):

```bash
docker compose exec backend bash scripts/tests-start.sh
```

End-to-end (Puppeteer, requires a running stack):

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm run e2e
```

## Secrets
Production secrets live in `.env.sops`, encrypted with age. Rotate with:

```bash
EDITOR=vim sops .env.sops
```

> Note: because `.env.sops` uses the `.sops` extension (not a format sops auto-detects), you may need `--input-type dotenv --output-type dotenv`, or temporarily copy to a `*.env` path for editing.

After rotating `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`, the change only takes effect on fresh deployments. Existing homelab databases retain the old superuser password until you manually update it (or delete and recreate the user via `initial_data.py`).

## Release & deploy
The release flow is fully local (no GitHub Actions). Run on ares:

```bash
just release patch              # cut: cliff CHANGELOG + LLM notes + tag + push + GH release
just build v0.1.0             # build Dockerfile.prod, push to ghcr.io/pike00/kindred
just deploy v0.1.0                # delegate to homelab apps/kindred/justfile (pg_dump + roll + healthcheck)
# or all three at once:
just ship patch
```

What each step does:

- **`just release LEVEL`** runs `release-kit cut`: preflights (clean tree on `main`, in sync with `origin`), regenerates the unreleased section of `CHANGELOG.md` via `git-cliff`, drafts the GH release body via LiteLLM (`deepseek-v4-pro-cloud`), opens `$EDITOR` for review, commits `CHANGELOG.md`, tags + pushes + creates the GH release.
- **`just build TAG`** builds `Dockerfile.prod` with a local buildx cache and pushes `:<tag>` and `:sha-<short>` to `ghcr.io/pike00/kindred` (the running container brand; the repo is `personal-crm`). Requires GHCR auth in `~/.docker/config.json` (gh token with `write:packages`).
- **`just deploy TAG`** delegates to `~/Documents/Homelab/apps/kindred/justfile`, which does the mandatory pg-dump-before-bump, rolls the container, and runs the post-deploy healthcheck.

`CHANGELOG.md` is generated by `git-cliff` per `cliff.toml`; do not hand-edit it. Preview the next release section with `just changelog-preview` or `just notes-dry-run`.

## Deployment tiers
Three isolated environments. Each has its own credentials, database, and Docker volumes — nothing is shared across tiers.

| Tier | Where | Domain | Stack | Database | Backups |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Prod** | `~/Documents/Homelab/apps/kindred/` on ares | `kindred.khanpikehome.com` (tailnet-only) | Plain `docker compose`, single combined image `ghcr.io/pike00/kindred:vX.Y.Z` | `kindred-db` Postgres container, volume `kindred_db_data`, database `kindred` | Daily pg-dump at 03:17 + Kopia to S3+B2, 30-day retention |
| **Dev** | `~/projects/personal-crm/` | `kindred.dev.khanpikehome.com` (tailnet-only) | `compose.dev.yml` overlay (bind-mounted source, live reload) | Project-local `dev-db` volume, database `crm` | None (ephemeral) |
| **PR previews** | Deferred indefinitely | — | — | — | — |

### Hard isolation enforced by

- Distinct Postgres credentials per tier — secrets live only in their own `.env.sops`
- Distinct Docker volumes (`kindred_db_data` for prod, project-local `dev-db` for dev) — no `external: true` cross-references between tiers
- Distinct Docker networks — `pikenet-internal-kindred` for prod, default bridge for dev
- Distinct database names — prod is `kindred`, dev is `crm`
- Traefik label pinning — prod compose has the domain hard-coded, dev compose has its own hard-coded dev hostname; neither uses a `${DOMAIN}` variable that could claim the other's hostname
