# AgenticStore

AgenticStore is a repo for designing and curating SKILLS for code agents. It focuses on database and persistent workspace workflows for agentic apps, with TiDB Cloud as the current supported provider. Components are added incrementally and documented as the skill set grows.

## Goals

- Provide reusable SKILLS for database provisioning, lifecycle, and persistent workspace tasks
- Offer opinionated, composable data and workspace workflows for AI app builders
- Keep guidance practical, concise, and easy to apply in real projects

## Scope (Current + Planned)

- TiDB Cloud provisioning and lifecycle workflows
- TiDB Cloud Filesystem mounting for agents and ephemeral environments
- TiDB Cloud serverless driver usage and edge runtime guidance
- TiDB Cloud Kysely usage (TCP + serverless/edge)
- More managed database providers (planned)

## Structure

The repo is centered around the `skills/` directory:

- `skills/` - skill definitions and instructions

## How to Use

- Browse the `skills/` directory for capability-specific instructions.
- Use skills to provision, connect to, or manage database and filesystem resources.
- Open the relevant `SKILL.md` for step-by-step guidance and prerequisites.

## Skill Authoring

- Skill folders use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens (e.g., `object-storage-s3`).
- Each skill must include `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter containing `name`, `description`, and optional `allowed-tools`.
- Keep the body concise with a clear "when to use" section and a short workflow.
- Move long docs into `references/` and prefer runnable scripts or templates in `scripts/` or `assets/`.
- Avoid extra docs inside skill folders (no README or changelog).

## Current Skills

- `tidbx` - TiDB Cloud provisioning and lifecycle workflows.
- `tidbx-serverless-driver` - Serverless HTTP driver usage and edge runtime guidance.
- `tidbx-kysely` - Kysely integration patterns (TCP + serverless/edge).
- `tidbx-prisma` - Prisma ORM setup (schema, migrations, typed client) for TiDB.
- `tidbx-nextjs` - Next.js App Router patterns for TiDB (route handlers, runtimes, Vercel/serverless).
- `tidbx-javascript-mysql2` - Node.js mysql2 driver connection patterns (TLS/CA, pool, transactions).
- `tidbx-javascript-mysqljs` - Node.js mysqljs/mysql driver connection patterns (TLS/CA, pool, transactions).
- `pytidb` - PyTiDB (pytidb) setup and usage for TiDB from Python (CRUD + vector/full-text/hybrid search + embeddings).
- `tidb-sql` - TiDB SQL authoring and troubleshooting (MySQL compatibility diffs, vector/full-text, transactions, EXPLAIN, flashback recovery, TiDB Cloud SSL verification).
- `mysql` - MySQL guardrails and performance tips, with TiDB detection and migration recommendations when scale-out is needed.
- `tidb-query-tuning` - TiDB query performance tuning workflow (clue collection, plan analysis, index optimization, SQL rewrite, and optimizer hints).
- `tidb-cloud-zero` - Provision a disposable TiDB instance instantly (no auth), with references for vector search SQL and auto-embedding SQL usage.
- `mount-tidb-cloud-fs` - Mount an existing TiDB Cloud Filesystem in a clean or ephemeral environment with a Filesystem token and region.
