# FastSSH

A fast, minimal terminal and SSH client. It runs two ways from the same code:
as a server you open in a browser, and as a desktop app.

Status: early. It has an encrypted vault for saved passwords and keys, SSH
sessions and local shells in tabs, host key checking, and accounts on the
server.

## Layout

- `crates/core` — SSH, local shells, SQLite storage and the vault. No web code.
- `crates/server` — the `fastssh` binary: accounts, JSON API, websockets,
  embedded interface. Also a library, which the desktop app embeds.
- `crates/desktop` — the desktop app (Tauri): a native window around the same
  server, running privately inside the app.
- `web` — the interface (Svelte + xterm.js), built into `web/dist`.

## Run

```sh
cd web && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
cargo run
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:7422 and create the first account. That account is
the admin.

For interface work with hot reload, keep `cargo run` going and start
`npm run dev` in `web/`; open the address Vite prints.

## Release build

```sh
cd web && npm run build && cd ..
cargo build --release
```

`target/release/fastssh` contains the interface and needs nothing else.

Ready-made server binaries for Linux (x86_64 and ARM) and the desktop app are
attached to each [release](https://github.com/pintovillamar/fastssh/releases),
and a container image is published as `ghcr.io/pintovillamar/fastssh`.

## Desktop app

The desktop app needs no server and no account. It asks for a master password
the first time, which encrypts what you save. Nothing is opened to the network.

Releases include an AppImage and a `.deb` for Linux and an installer for
Windows.

- **Linux:** SSH sessions, plus a local shell on your own computer.
- **Windows:** SSH sessions only for now; the local shell is not built for
  Windows yet. The installer is not code-signed, so Windows shows a
  "Windows protected your PC" warning: choose "More info", then "Run anyway".
  The app uses the WebView2 runtime, which Windows 11 includes and the
  installer fetches when it is missing.

To run it from source on Linux you need WebKitGTK 4.1 (`webkit2gtk-4.1` on
Arch, `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev` on Debian and Ubuntu). On Windows the Rust MSVC
toolchain is enough.

```sh
cd web && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
cargo run -p fastssh-desktop
```

To build the packages yourself (AppImage and `.deb` on Linux, the installer
on Windows):

```sh
cd crates/desktop && npm install && npx tauri build
```

Its data is separate from the server's: `~/.local/share/io.github.pintovillamar.fastssh`
on Linux, `%APPDATA%\io.github.pintovillamar.fastssh` on Windows. Plain
`cargo build` and `cargo test` skip the desktop app, so the server can be
built without WebKitGTK.

## Options

Every flag also has an environment variable; `fastssh --help` lists them.

| Flag | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `--listen 127.0.0.1:7422` | Address to listen on. |
| `--data-dir <dir>` | Where the database lives (default `~/.local/share/fastssh`). |
| `--public-url https://ssh.example.com` | The address people use to reach the server. Needed behind a reverse proxy and for Google sign-in. With https, cookies are marked Secure. |
| `--allow-signup` | Let anyone who can reach the server create an account. Off by default: only the first account can be created. |
| `--no-local-shell` | Do not offer the admin a shell on the server machine. |

To reach FastSSH from other machines, put it behind a reverse proxy that
provides https and pass `--public-url`. Without https, passwords and terminal
sessions cross the network unencrypted. [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md) covers
running it as a systemd service or a container, with proxy examples.

### Sign in with Google

Create an OAuth client (type "Web application") in the Google Cloud console
with the redirect URI `<public-url>/api/auth/google/callback`, then set:

```sh
FASTSSH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
FASTSSH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

A Google sign-in is matched to an account by its verified email address. New
addresses get an account only when sign-ups are open (or no account exists
yet).

## Accounts and the vault

Signing in and unlocking the vault are separate:

- A **session** is a cookie that lasts 30 days.
- The **vault** holds saved passwords, private keys and key passphrases,
  encrypted with a key derived from your passphrase. That key is kept only in
  the server's memory while you are signed in.

Signing in with a password unlocks the vault at once. After a Google sign-in
or a server restart you are asked for the passphrase. For password accounts
the passphrase is the password; accounts that only use Google choose a vault
passphrase the first time.

There is no passphrase recovery. A forgotten passphrase means the saved
secrets are lost, by design: the server cannot decrypt them either.

Private keys are pasted or uploaded into the vault. OpenSSH and PEM files and
PuTTY `.ppk` files are accepted.

The first account is the admin. Only the admin gets the local shell, because
it runs as the operating system user FastSSH runs as.

## Data

Everything is in one SQLite file, `fastssh.db`, in the data folder. Connection
names, hosts and usernames are stored as plain text; secrets are stored
encrypted (XChaCha20-Poly1305, key wrapped with Argon2id).

## On a phone

On touch devices the terminal shows a row of keys a phone keyboard lacks:
Esc, Tab, arrows, Home/End, PgUp/PgDn and a few symbols. Ctrl and Alt are
sticky: tap one, then the next key (from the row or the keyboard) is sent
with it.

## Tests

```sh
cargo test
cd web && npm test
```

The SSH tests run against a small SSH server started inside the test process.
CI runs everything on Linux and on Windows.

## Security notes

- Requests from other websites are refused, and the session cookie is
  HttpOnly and SameSite.
- Five wrong passwords for one email block further attempts for five minutes.
- Signing out ends that session's open terminals.
