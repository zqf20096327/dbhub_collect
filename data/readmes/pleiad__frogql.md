## Project history and our use of AI

froGQL is a research prototype that grew into a working database. Its differentiator is a typechecker grounded in a gradual type system for GQL: it detects queries that cannot return results because of type mismatches, before they run. We combine hand-written research code with AI-assisted engineering, and we are explicit about the boundary between the two.

The path so far:

1. **Theory first.** The project grew out of [our paper on a gradual type system for GQL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3763061), which contributes the formalization and the soundness theorems (we have a background in gradual typing and databases). The central result is **Emptiness**: statically detecting queries that are guaranteed to return nothing because of type mismatches.

2. **A hand-written prototype.** We implemented the typechecker and the runtime semantics of the formal model in Python, by hand, without AI. This is the reference everything else is checked against.

3. **The question worth testing.** Does the typechecker earn its cost? That is, is *typecheck + run* worthwhile against blindly *running* a query only to discover it returns nothing? Answering this needed performance the Python prototype could not provide.

4. **Port to Rust, with AI.** We rewrote the engine in Rust with AI assistance, taking inspiration from SQLite's single-file storage architecture.

5. **Worst-case-optimal joins.** Joins were slow. Colleagues who work on databases pointed us to the [CompactLTJ paper](https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/ps/vldbj25.pdf) (Arroyuelo et al., VLDB Journal 2025) and its C++ reference implementation. We implemented the Leapfrog Triejoin algorithm with generative AI, keeping the test suite green throughout.

6. **LDBC and language growth.** To run the LDBC Social Network Benchmark we extended the language with more features, including our centerpiece, the typechecker. We did this carefully to avoid breaking the theorems we had proved formally.

7. **Where AI stopped being enough.** The benchmarks were strong on some fronts and weak on others. Closing the gaps took design decisions and research that generative AI could not deliver on its own: LTJ interacts poorly with GQL features such as `UNION`, and even with plain `ORDER BY`. We grow the system slowly, debating design strategies and testing several before each new feature lands.

Benchmark charts from the LDBC Social Network Benchmark are coming here as the numbers stabilize.

**Papers**
- [*Flexible and Expressive Typed Path Patterns for GQL*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3763061) — the gradual type system, formalization, and the Emptiness theorem behind froGQL's typechecker.
- [CompactLTJ](https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/ps/vldbj25.pdf) (Arroyuelo et al., VLDB Journal 2025) — the worst-case-optimal join algorithm froGQL uses for comma-joins and chains.

**Library / from source**:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Quick Start (REPL)

```bash
# Import a CSV dataset and open the REPL
./target/release/frogql movies.gdb --import-csv path/to/Spanner_Instance/

# Open an existing database
./target/release/frogql movies.gdb

# Skip the typechecker for the session
./target/release/frogql movies.gdb --no-typecheck

# Version and the full flag list
frogql --version
frogql --help
```

```
gql> .schema
GRAPH TYPE DEFAULT (active)
Node types:
    (:Movie  {released INT, title STRING, votes INT, *})
    (:Person {name STRING, *})
Edge types:
    (:Person)-[:ACTED_IN {roles LIST<STRING>}]->(:Movie)
    (:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(:Movie)
    (:Person)-[:REVIEWED {rating INT, summary STRING}]->(:Movie)
    ...

gql> MATCH (p: Person) -[:ACTED_IN]-> (m: Movie) WHERE m.released = 1999 RETURN p.name, m.title
p.name | m.title
-------+--------
"Keanu Reeves" | "The Matrix"
"Carrie-Anne Moss" | "The Matrix"
...

gql> MATCH (a: Person) -[:ACTED_IN]-> (m: Movie), (d: Person) -[:DIRECTED]-> (m) RETURN a.name, d.name
```

### REPL meta-commands

The REPL follows the SQLite convention: every meta-command starts with `.`.

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `.schema` | alias for `SHOW GRAPH TYPE DEFAULT` (the auto-inferred schema) |
| `.schema simple` | grouped by-label renderer of the inferred schema |
| `.graph-types` | alias for `SHOW GRAPH TYPES` |
| `.indexes` | alias for `SHOW INDEXES` |
| `.save` | atomically persist the in-RAM mutations to the open `.gdb` (tmp+rename) |
| `.dump-json <path>` | pg_dump-style JSON snapshot of the merged graph |
| `.dump-gql <path>` | pg_dump-style GQL script that re-creates the graph |
| `.help` | list meta-commands and quick query syntax |
| `.quit` / `.exit` | exit (bare `quit` / `exit` also work) |

Opening a path that does not exist creates an empty database (sqlite3 convention):

```bash
./target/release/frogql /tmp/fresh.gdb
creating new database: /tmp/fresh.gdb
gql> INSERT (a:Person {name: 'Alice'})
gql> .save
```

## Example Databases

The `examples/` directory contains ready-to-use `.gdb` files:

| Database | Nodes | Edges | Domain |
|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| movies.gdb | 171 | 253 | Movies (Person, Movie, ACTED_IN, DIRECTED, ...) |
| fraud_detection.gdb | 14,550 | 31,564 | Financial fraud (Transaction, Account, TRIGGERED_ALERT, ...) |
| bom.gdb | 1,500 | 2,248 | Bill of Materials (Product, Assembly, ConsistsOf, ...) |

Regenerate from CSV: `./target/release/frogql examples/movies.gdb --import-csv <csv_dir>`

## What you can do

| Topic | One-liner | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Load data | CSV (Spanner / Text2GQL / Cypher), LDBC SNB, or JSON; `DEFAULT` graph type is inferred at import. | [`docs/data-import.md`](docs/data-import.md) |
| Query | `MATCH`, `OPTIONAL MATCH`, comma-joins, `WHERE`, `RETURN`, `EXISTS`, repetition `{n,m}`, label algebra. | [`docs/query-language.md`](docs/query-language.md) |
| Mutate | `INSERT`, `SET`, `REMOVE`, `[DETACH] DELETE` (ISO §13 MVP-1). In-RAM overlay until `.save`. | [`docs/data-modification.md`](docs/data-modification.md) |
| Schemas | Persistent named graph types with `CREATE / USE / DROP / SHOW / VALIDATE GRAPH TYPE`; reserved `DEFAULT` is auto-inferred. | [`docs/graph-types.md`](docs/graph-types.md) |
| Vector search | `NEAREST k x.attr TO <vector>` — nodes that satisfy the pattern **and** are among the k nearest. Vectors live in sidecar files built offline. | [`docs/internals/vector-search.md`](docs/internals/vector-search.md) |
| Indexes | Auto-built hash + btree on every uniquely-keyed `(label, prop)` (rebuilt on open); explicit `CREATE [HASH \| BTREE] INDEX` for the rest, persisted in the `.gdb` header chain so they survive close/reopen. | [`docs/secondary-indexes.md`](docs/secondary-indexes.md) |

## Storage

froGQL uses a single `.gdb` file with 4KB pages:
- All node/edge IDs are `u32` internally (no string overhead at query time)
- Three storage backends: in-memory `Graph`, `LazyGraphStore` (topology in RAM, labels/props from disk via LRU page cache), `DiskGraphStore` (minimal RAM)
- The REPL uses `LazyGraphStore` for efficient memory usage on large graphs
- The GRAPH TYPE catalog persists in its own page chain, so `CREATE / USE / DROP GRAPH TYPE` survive close/reopen

See [`docs/internals/storage-architecture.md`](docs/internals/storage-architecture.md) for the full format specification.

## Join strategy

Comma-joins and chains of directed/undirected edges are executed with
**Leapfrog Triejoin** (LTJ), a worst-case-optimal multi-way join that
binds variables one at a time across all participating patterns
simultaneously, with no intermediate materialisation. Each directed edge
is modelled as a triple `(src, label, tgt)` indexed in six sorted
orderings. LTJ activates automatically when the pattern decomposes into
triples; non-decomposable shapes (any-direction edges, repetitions with
named variables, unbounded `{n,}`) fall back to pairwise hash-join.
Speedups on `soc-LiveJournal1-100k` (limit 1000) range from
**14× (3-clique) to 4097× (4-path)**, with a 4-clique going from "hung"
to 43 ms. See [`docs/internals/JOIN_STRATEGY_NOTES.md`](docs/internals/JOIN_STRATEGY_NOTES.md)
and `CLAUDE.md` for the algorithm in detail.

## Vector search

`NEAREST k x.attr TO <vector> [AS dist]` restricts a pattern to the nodes
nearest a query vector. Vectors are per-node side data in a sidecar file
per attribute (`<db>.vec.<attr>`), built offline by `vec_build` together
with an HNSW graph, and read-only at query time.

```
MATCH (u:User)-[:likes]->(i:Item)
NEAREST 10 i.emb TO VECTOR(1234, 'emb') AS dist
RETURN i, dist ORDER BY dist
```

Four evaluation algorithms are implemented and interchangeable:
post-filtering, an in-LTJ arm that drives the neighbour stream from inside
the join at a configurable variable-elimination level, a global pre-sort
variant of that arm, and pre-filtering. They are generated by two axes —
strategy (`post` / `inltj` / `pre`) crossed with ranking source (`hnsw` /
`localsort` / `globalsort`), eight runnable arms. Under either exact
source all of them return identical answers, which is what makes comparing
their latency meaningful. See
[`docs/internals/vector-search.md`](docs/internals/vector-search.md).

## Optimizer

The compiler pipeline is `parse → elaborate → typecheck → optimize → run`.
The optimizer is reserved for performance-preserving rewrites; ISO
syntactic sugar lives in `elaborate`. Major passes:

- **WHERE pushdown** into descriptor `value_preds` and `value_filters`
  (type ascriptions like `is T`, value comparisons like `<`, `<=`, `=`).
- **Index-driven constant folding**: `Eq` predicates that hit a hash
  index resolve to a single NodeId, get pre-bound in the result tuple,
  and excluded from the VEO. `<` / `<=` / `>` / `>=` that hit a btree
  precompute the matching sorted set and become an O(log n) membership
  test.
- **Bounded `Repeat` unrolling**: `(P){lb, ub}` with single-edge inner
  and `ub - lb + 1 ≤ 4` rewrites to `Union(P^lb, …, P^ub)` and
  distributes the Union out of any surrounding Concat — each arm
  becomes a flat chain that decomposes natively into triples.
- **ORDER BY alias resolution**: `ORDER BY <RETURN-alias>` lowers to
  the underlying `AttrLookup` so the runtime routes the sort through
  the pre-projection top-k heap (and the btree-driven path) instead of
  fully projecting every row before truncating.
- **OPTIONAL MATCH bind-pushdown** (runtime-side, in `run_match_chain`):
  for each outer row, the inner pattern runs as a small LTJ with the
  shared variables pre-pinned — SQLite's correlated nested-loop with
  index lookup, mapped onto the LTJ. Cuts a representative LDBC IS5
  query from 52 s → 0.56 s on SF0.1 (~93×).
- **BTree-driven top-k**: when the sort key has a btree (auto-built or
  declared) the runtime walks the btree in primary-attr order, runs an
  LTJ pin per id, and stops at `LIMIT k` (or at the first cohort
  boundary past `k` for multi-spec ORDER BY). Multi-label `Or`
  descriptors (`Comment | Post`) drive the search via a k-way merge
  over per-label btrees. Drops LDBC IC2 on SF0.1 from 3.0 s → 0.086 s
  with the right indexes declared.

See [`docs/internals/implemented-optimizations.md`](docs/internals/implemented-optimizations.md)
for benchmark numbers and code-level detail.

## Building and Testing

```bash
cargo build --release                    # build all binaries

# Strict clippy (run before every commit)
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D clippy::all

# Everything. Use the unqualified form so the set never drifts as tests
# are added.
cargo test

# Just the in-crate unit tests (~8 s)
cargo test --lib

# Single target / single test
cargo test --test runtime_test
cargo test --test runtime_test test_join_star_any_label -- --exact
```

A full sweep is ~7-8 minutes, and on macOS most of that is the OS
scanning each of the ~85 freshly linked test binaries on first run
(~4.3 s each; the same binary re-runs in 0.17 s). Excluding your terminal
under Settings > Privacy & Security > Developer Tools removes it. Of the
rest, `bench_test` is ~45 s of real work — it generates 10k-50k-node
graphs and measures RSS — and every other test together is ~14 s.

Other binaries in `src/bin/`:
- `bench_queries` — generic benchmark runner
- `bench_setup` — downloads + extracts LDBC datasets (`bench/data/` is gitignored)
- `ldbc_bench` — LDBC interactive-complete driver, queries in `bench/ldbc-queries/*.toml`
- `internal_bench` — gqlite-only diagnostic bench (typechecker on/off, lazy/disk backend)
- `convert_edgelist` — edge-list format converter
- `vec_build` — builds a vector-attribute sidecar (`<db>.vec.<attr>`) + its HNSW, offline
- `vec_bench` — vector-search strategy harness (post-filter vs pre-filter vs in-LTJ)
