> Connect PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, SQLite, or Convex and work with the data in one focused Mac app — no Electron, no browser tabs, no context switching.

## Installation

Download the latest signed DMG from [Releases](https://github.com/pluk-inc/Pluk/releases/latest), open it, and drag Pluk to Applications.

Pluk requires macOS 15 or later and runs on Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.

## A native home for your data

## Features

- **Native macOS interface** — AppKit and SwiftUI throughout, with real windows, tabs, sheets, keyboard navigation, and platform-standard controls.
- **Six database families** — PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, SQLite, and Convex in one connection model.
- **Editable data grid** — browse, filter, sort, copy, paste, and edit rows directly, with dedicated views for larger values.
- **Query workspace** — SQL editing, autocomplete, multiple result sets, history, schema-aware execution, and saved notebooks.
- **Schema tools** — inspect columns and indexes, create tables and databases, and make schema changes without leaving the app.
- **Notebook dashboards** — combine queries, values, text, and charts in a flexible native canvas.
- **Context-aware assistant** — chat about the open table or notebook and review generated writes before they run.
- **Real-world connections** — SSH tunnels, SSL certificates, URI import, local SQLite files, and Docker container discovery.
- **Secure local handling** — Keychain-backed secrets, encrypted query history, and no Pluk telemetry in unconfigured community builds.

## Supported databases

| Database | What Pluk supports |
| --- | --- |
| PostgreSQL | Tables, schemas, SQL, JSON, SSL, SSH tunnels |
| MySQL and MariaDB | Tables, SQL, SSL, SSH tunnels |
| MongoDB | Collections, documents, filters, aggregation |
| SQLite | Local database files and SQL |
| Convex | Projects, deployments, documents, and queries |

## Building from source

You need macOS 15 or later and Xcode 26 or later with Swift 6 support.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pluk-inc/Pluk.git
cd Pluk
open Pluk.xcodeproj
```

Build and run the shared `Collection` scheme. Swift Package Manager resolves the pinned dependencies on the first build.

If signing fails, select your own development team in Xcode or build locally with code signing disabled. Never commit personal signing configuration.

### Community builds

The database client builds without access to Pluk's hosted services. When `pluk/Secrets.xcconfig` is absent, PostHog, Sentry, WorkOS sign-in, Convex OAuth, and funded Bedrock AI are not configured. Manual Convex connections remain available.

Maintainers can copy `pluk/Secrets.xcconfig.example` to the ignored `pluk/Secrets.xcconfig` for official builds. Those values are embedded in the app binary and must not be treated as server-side secrets.

See [DATA_COLLECTION.md](DATA_COLLECTION.md) for the service and telemetry boundary.
