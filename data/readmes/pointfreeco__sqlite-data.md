## Overview

SQLiteData is a [fast](#performance), lightweight replacement for SwiftData, including CloudKit
synchronization (and even CloudKit sharing), built on top of the popular [GRDB] library.
To populate data from the database you can use `@Table` and `@FetchAll`, which are
similar to SwiftData's `@Model` and `@Query`:

<table>
<tr>
<th>SQLiteData</th>
<th>SwiftData</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=415>

```swift
@FetchAll
var items: [Item]

@Table
struct Item {
  let id: UUID
  var title = ""
  var isInStock = true
  var notes = ""
}
```

</td>
<td width=415>

```swift
@Query
var items: [Item]

@Model
class Item {
  var title: String
  var isInStock: Bool
  var notes: String
  init(
    title: String = "",
    isInStock: Bool = true,
    notes: String = ""
  ) {
    self.title = title
    self.isInStock = isInStock
    self.notes = notes
  }
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

Both of the above examples fetch items from an external data store using Swift data types, and both
are automatically observed by SwiftUI so that views are recomputed when the external data changes,
but SQLiteData is powered directly by SQLite and is usable from UIKit, `@Observable` models, and
more.

For more information on SQLiteData's querying capabilities, see
[Fetching model data][fetching-article].

## Quick start

Before SQLiteData's property wrappers can fetch data from SQLite, you need to provide–at
runtime–the default database it should use. This is typically done as early as possible in your
app's lifetime, like the app entry point in SwiftUI, and is analogous to configuring model storage
in SwiftData:

<table>
<tr>
<th>SQLiteData</th>
<th>SwiftData</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=415>

```swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {
  init() {
    prepareDependencies {
      let db = try! DatabaseQueue(
        // Create/migrate a database
        // connection
      )
      $0.defaultDatabase = db
    }
  }
  // ...
}
```

</td>
<td width=415>

```swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {
  let container = {
    // Create/configure a container
    try! ModelContainer(/* ... */)
  }()

  var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup {
      ContentView()
        .modelContainer(container)
    }
  }
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on preparing a SQLite database, see
> [Preparing a SQLite database][preparing-db-article].

This `defaultDatabase` connection is used implicitly by SQLiteData's strategies, like
[`@FetchAll`][fetchall-docs] and [`@FetchOne`][fetchone-docs], which are similar to SwiftData's
`@Query` macro, but more powerful:

<table>
<tr>
<th>SQLiteData</th>
<th>SwiftData</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=415>

```swift
@FetchAll
var items: [Item]

@FetchAll(Item.order(by: \.title))
var items

@FetchAll(Item.where(\.isInStock))
var items



@FetchAll(Item.order(by: \.isInStock))
var items

@FetchOne(Item.count())
var itemsCount = 0

```

</td>
<td width=415>

```swift
@Query
var items: [Item]

@Query(sort: [SortDescriptor(\.title)])
var items: [Item]

@Query(filter: #Predicate<Item> {
  $0.isInStock
})
var items: [Item]

// No @Query equivalent of ordering
// by boolean column.

// No @Query equivalent of counting
// entries in database without loading
// all entries.
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

And you can access this database throughout your application in a way similar to how one accesses
a model context, via a property wrapper:

<table>
<tr>
<th>SQLiteData</th>
<th>SwiftData</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=415>

```swift
@Dependency(\.defaultDatabase)
var database

let newItem = Item(/* ... */)
try database.write { db in
  try Item.insert { newItem }
    .execute(db))
}
```

</td>
<td width=415>

```swift
@Environment(\.modelContext)
var modelContext

let newItem = Item(/* ... */)
modelContext.insert(newItem)
try modelContext.save()

```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on how SQLiteData compares to SwiftData, see
> [Comparison with SwiftData][comparison-swiftdata-article].

Further, if you want to synchronize the local database to CloudKit so that it is available on
all your user's devices, simply configure a `SyncEngine` in the entry point of the app:

```swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {
  init() {
    prepareDependencies {
      $0.defaultDatabase = try! appDatabase()
      $0.defaultSyncEngine = SyncEngine(
        for: $0.defaultDatabase,
        tables: Item.self
      )
    }
  }
  // ...
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on synchronizing the database to CloudKit and sharing records with iCloud
> users, see [CloudKit Synchronization].

This is all you need to know to get started with SQLiteData, but there's much more to learn. Read

## Performance

SQLiteData leverages high-performance decoding from [StructuredQueries][] to turn fetched data into
your Swift domain types, and has a performance profile similar to invoking SQLite's C APIs directly.

See the following benchmarks against
[Lighter's performance test suite](https://github.com/Lighter-swift/PerformanceTestSuite) for a
taste of how it compares:

```

## SQLite knowledge required

SQLite is one of the
[most established and widely distributed](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html) pieces of
software in the history of software. Knowledge of SQLite is a great skill for any app developer to
have, and this library does not want to conceal it from you. So, we feel that to best wield this
library you should be familiar with the basics of SQLite, including schema design and normalization,
SQL queries, including joins and aggregates, and performance, including indices.

With some basic knowledge you can apply this library to your database schema in order to query
for data and keep your views up-to-date when data in the database changes, and you can use
[StructuredQueries][] to build queries, either using its type-safe, discoverable
[query building APIs][], or using its `#sql` macro for writing [safe SQL strings][].

Further, this library is built on the popular and battle-tested [GRDB] library for
interacting with SQLite, such as executing queries and observing the database for changes.

## Demos

This repo comes with _lots_ of examples to demonstrate how to solve common and complex problems with
SQLiteData. Check out [this](./Examples) directory to see them all, including:

* [**Case Studies**](./Examples/CaseStudies)
  <br> Demonstrates how to solve some common application problems in an isolated environment, in
  both SwiftUI and UIKit. Things like animations, dynamic queries, database transactions, and more.

* [**CloudKitDemo**](./Examples/CloudKitDemo)
  <br> A simplified demo that shows how to synchronize a SQLite database to CloudKit and how to
  share records with other iCloud users. See our dedicated articles on [CloudKit Synchronization]
  and [CloudKit Sharing] for more information.

  [CloudKit Sharing]: https://swiftpackageindex.com/pointfreeco/sqlite-data/main/documentation/sqlitedata/cloudkitsharing

* [**Reminders**](./Examples/Reminders)
  <br> A rebuild of Apple's [Reminders][reminders-app-store] app that uses a SQLite database to
  model the reminders, lists and tags. It features many advanced queries, such as searching, stats
  aggregation, and multi-table joins. It also features CloudKit synchronization and sharing.

* [**SyncUps**](./Examples/SyncUps)
  <br> This application is a faithful reconstruction of one of Apple's more interesting sample
  projects, called [Scrumdinger][scrumdinger], and uses SQLite to persist the data for meetings.
  We have also added CloudKit synchronization so that all changes are automatically made available
  on all of the user's devices.
