_[PowerSync](https://www.powersync.com) keeps a client-side SQLite database in sync with your backend database. Changes appear across users and devices in real-time, user interactions feel instant and your app continues to work even when offline. Supports Postgres, MongoDB, MySQL, and SQL Server. Client SDKs are available for a wide range of environments including web, mobile, desktop, headless and embedded._

# PowerSync .NET SDKs

`powersync-dotnet` is the monorepo for PowerSync .NET SDKs.

## Monorepo Structure: Packages

Packages are published to [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/PowerSync).

- [PowerSync.Common](./PowerSync/PowerSync.Common/README.md)
  - Core package: .NET implementation of a PowerSync database connector and streaming sync bucket implementation. Packages meant for specific platforms will extend functionality of `Common`.
- [PowerSync.Maui](./PowerSync/PowerSync.Maui/README.md)
  - Extends the PowerSync.Common package to provide the .NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI) integration for PowerSync for cross-platform mobile and desktop applications.

## Demo Apps / Example Projects

Demo applications are located in the [`demos/`](./demos/) directory. Also see our [Demo Apps / Example Projects](https://docs.powersync.com/resources/demo-apps-example-projects) gallery which lists all projects by the backend and client-side framework they use.

- [demos/CommandLine](./demos/CommandLine/README.md): A CLI-based app demonstrating real-time data sync
- [demos/WPF](./demos/WPF/README.md): A Windows desktop to-do list app real-time data sync
- [demos/MAUITodo](./demos/MAUITodo/README.md): A cross-platform mobile and desktop to-do list app built with .NET MAUI, running on iOS, Android and Windows

# Supported Frameworks

## Target Frameworks

This PowerSync SDK supports the following target frameworks:

- **.NET 9** - [Latest version](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0)
- **.NET 8** - [Current LTS Version, used for development of this project](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- **.NET 6** - supported for compatibility with older projects
- **.NET Standard 2.0** - for compatibility with older libraries and frameworks, tested/verified older versions will be listed below.

- .NET Framework 4.8:

  To get a .NET Framework 4.8 working with this SDK add the following to your `.csproj` file:

  ```xml
  <PropertyGroup>
    ...
    <!-- Ensures the correct SQLite DLL is available -->
    <RuntimeIdentifiers>win-x86;win-x64</RuntimeIdentifiers>
    <RuntimeIdentifier>win-x64</RuntimeIdentifier>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    ...
    <!-- Ensures the HTTP client resolves in the SDK -->
    <PackageReference Include="System.Net.Http" Version="4.3.4" />
  </ItemGroup>
  ```

  and create a `IsExternalInit.cs` file in your project with the following contents:

  ```cs
  using System.ComponentModel;

  namespace System.Runtime.CompilerServices
  {
      [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]
      internal class IsExternalInit { }
  }
  ```

---

When running commands such as `dotnet run` or `dotnet test`, you may need to specify the target framework explicitly using the `--framework` flag.

## Application Frameworks

- MAUI - Cross-platform native apps for mobile and desktop
  - Platforms: iOS, Android, Windows
- WPF - Windows desktop applications
- Console Applications - Command-line and binary apps

# Development

## Setup Development Environment

### Formatting

This project uses [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) for formatting, which may require certain extensions/plugins to function properly in your IDE.

- **VSCode**: Available via [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig).
- **JetBrains Rider**: Supported by default.
- **Neovim**: Supported by default, or via the `gpanders/editorconfig.nvim` plugin for versions prior to `v0.9`.
- **Emacs**: Available via `editorconfig-mode`, or the `editorconfig` package for versions prior to `v30.1`.

### Project Setup

Download PowerSync extension

```bash
dotnet run --project Tools/Setup
```

Install dependencies

```bash
dotnet restore
```

## Tests

Run all tests

```bash
dotnet test -v n --framework net8.0
```

Run a specific test

```bash
dotnet test -v n --framework net8.0 --filter "test-file-pattern"
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests in `PowerSync.Common.IntegrationTests` are intended to run against the [self-host nodejs demo](https://github.com/powersync-ja/self-host-demo/tree/main/demos/nodejs).
The integration tests are disabled by default, define the following environment variable when running the tests.

```bash
RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=true dotnet test -v n --framework net8.0
```

Only run integration tests, without any unit tests.

```bash
RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=true dotnet test -v n --framework net8.0 --filter "Category=Integration"
```

### Performance Tests

Performance tests in `PowerSync.Common.PerformanceTests` are disabled by default, define the following environment variable when running the tests.

```bash
RUN_PERFORMANCE_TESTS=true dotnet test -v n --framework net8.0
```

Only run performance tests, without any unit tests.

```bash
RUN_PERFORMANCE_TESTS=true dotnet test -v n --framework net8.0 --filter "Category=Performance"
```

## Using the PowerSync.Common package in your project

```bash
dotnet add package PowerSync.Common
```
