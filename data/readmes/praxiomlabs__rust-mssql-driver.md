- **TDS 7.3 – 8.0** — SQL Server 2008 through 2022+ strict encryption, plus Azure SQL
- **Tokio-native** — async from the ground up, no compatibility layers
- **Built-in connection pooling** — no external pooling crate required
- **Type-state connections** — invalid operations are compile errors
- **Pure-Rust TLS** — rustls; no OpenSSL, no system dependencies
- **Incremental streaming** — `query_stream` reads rows from the socket on
  demand (peak memory ~one row); `query_stream_blob` sub-streams a multi-GB
  MAX/BLOB column without buffering it
- **Beyond queries** — transactions and savepoints, stored procedures with OUTPUT
  params, table-valued parameters, bulk insert, Always Encrypted (read + write),
  OpenTelemetry

## Installation

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
mssql-client = "0.20"
tokio = { version = "1.48", features = ["full"] }
```

**Windows note:** The default TLS feature requires a C compiler (`ring`/`aws-lc-sys`). Install [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) with the "Desktop development with C++" workload — a one-time setup; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#4-platform-specific-windows-c-build-tools) for details.

## Quick Start

```rust,no_run
use mssql_client::{Client, Config};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), mssql_client::Error> {
    // Connect using a connection string
    let config = Config::from_connection_string(
        "Server=localhost;Database=mydb;User Id=sa;Password=Password123!;TrustServerCertificate=true"
    )?;

    let mut client = Client::connect(config).await?;

    // Execute a query
    let rows = client.query("SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE active = @p1", &[&true]).await?;

    for result in rows {
        let row = result?;
        let id: i32 = row.get(0)?;
        let name: String = row.get(1)?;
        println!("{}: {}", id, name);
    }

    client.close().await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

## Connection Strings

ADO.NET-style connection strings are supported, including the quoting rules
and the keywords you'd expect (`Server`, `Database`, `User Id`, `Password`,
`Encrypt`, `TrustServerCertificate`, timeouts, `Application Name`, and more):

```text
Server=hostname,port;Database=dbname;User Id=user;Password=pass;Encrypt=strict;
```

The full keyword reference lives in the
[`mssql-client` config docs](https://docs.rs/mssql-client/latest/mssql_client/config/).

## Connection Pooling

Use the built-in connection pool for production applications:

```rust,no_run
use mssql_driver_pool::Pool;
use mssql_client::Config;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let config = Config::from_connection_string("...")?;

    let pool = Pool::builder()
        .client_config(config)
        .max_connections(10)
        .min_connections(2)
        .build()
        .await?;

    // Get a connection from the pool
    let mut conn = pool.get().await?;

    let rows = conn.query("SELECT 1", &[]).await?;
    // Connection returned to pool when dropped

    Ok(())
}
```

## Transactions

```rust,no_run
use mssql_client::{Client, Config, IsolationLevel};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let config = Config::from_connection_string("Server=localhost;Database=mydb;User Id=sa;Password=Password123!")?;
    let client = Client::connect(config).await?;

    let mut tx = client.begin_transaction_with_isolation(IsolationLevel::Serializable).await?;

    tx.execute("UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = @p1", &[&1i32]).await?;

    // Savepoints let you roll back part of a transaction
    let sp = tx.save_point("transfer").await?;
    tx.execute("UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = @p1", &[&2i32]).await?;
    tx.rollback_to(&sp).await?;

    // Commit (returns the client)
    tx.commit().await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## Derive Macros

Map rows to structs automatically:

```text
use mssql_derive::FromRow;

#[derive(FromRow)]
struct User {
    id: i32,
    #[mssql(rename = "user_name")]
    name: String,
    #[mssql(default)]
    email: Option<String>,
}

let rows = client.query("SELECT id, user_name, email FROM users", &[]).await?;
for result in rows {
    let user: User = result?.try_into()?;
    println!("{}: {}", user.id, user.name);
}
```

## Authentication

SQL authentication works out of the box. Azure AD / Entra logins use the TDS
FEDAUTH SecurityToken workflow and require an encrypted connection. Every
method below is **validated against live Azure SQL**:

| Method | How | Feature |
|--------|-----|---------|
| SQL Server | `User Id` / `Password`, or `Credentials::sql_server(...)` | default |
| Pre-acquired Entra token | `Credentials::azure_token(...)` | default |
| Service Principal | `Authentication=ActiveDirectoryServicePrincipal` (`User Id=<client-id>@<tenant-id>`, `Password=<secret>`) | `azure-identity` |
| Managed Identity | `Authentication=ActiveDirectoryManagedIdentity` | `azure-identity` |
| Default chain | `Authentication=ActiveDirectoryDefault` — managed identity → signed-in `az`/`azd` CLI | `azure-identity` |
| Certificate | programmatic only: `Credentials::certificate(tenant, client, cert_path, password)` (X.509 → Entra; not TDS mutual TLS) | `cert-auth` |

```rust,no_run
use mssql_client::{Client, Config};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), mssql_client::Error> {
    // Managed identity, via a connection string:
    let config = Config::from_connection_string(
        "Server=myserver.database.windows.net;Database=mydb;\
         Authentication=ActiveDirectoryManagedIdentity;Encrypt=mandatory",
    )?;
    let mut client = Client::connect(config).await?;
    client.close().await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

The **interactive** Entra flows (`ActiveDirectoryPassword` / `Interactive` /
`DeviceCodeFlow`) are not built in — `azure_identity` ships no such
credentials. Acquire the token yourself (MSAL, the `oauth2` crate,
`az account get-access-token`, or any broker) and pass it via
`Credentials::azure_token`, exactly like .NET's `SqlConnection.AccessToken`.

## Feature Flags

| Feature | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `chrono` | Yes | Date/time type support via chrono |
| `uuid` | Yes | UUID type support |
| `decimal` | Yes | Decimal type support via rust_decimal |
| `encoding` | Yes | Collation-aware VARCHAR decoding |
| `json` | No | JSON type support via serde_json |
| `tls` | Yes | TLS/SSL encryption via rustls (disable for `Encrypt=no_tls` environments) |
| `azure-identity` | No | Azure AD / Entra logins via Managed Identity, Service Principal, or the default credential chain (pre-acquired tokens work without it) |
| `otel` | No | OpenTelemetry tracing and metrics |
| `zeroize` | No | Secure credential wiping |
| `filestream` | No | FILESTREAM BLOB access (Windows only, requires OLE DB Driver) |

### Authentication Features (mssql-auth crate)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `azure-identity` | Azure Managed Identity and Service Principal |
| `integrated-auth` | Kerberos/GSSAPI (Linux/macOS) |
| `sspi-auth` | Windows SSPI (cross-platform via sspi-rs) |
| `cert-auth` | Client certificate authentication |
| `zeroize` | Secure credential wiping from memory |
| `always-encrypted` | Transparent column decryption with Azure Key Vault and Windows CertStore key providers |

Enable optional features:

```bash
cargo add mssql-client --features otel
cargo add mssql-auth --features sspi-auth
```

## SQL Server Compatibility

| Version | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| SQL Server 2008 – 2016 | TDS 7.3/7.4. These servers often lack TLS 1.2 (rustls requires it); use `Encrypt=no_tls` on a trusted network |
| SQL Server 2017 – 2019 | TDS 7.4, full TLS |
| SQL Server 2022+ | TDS 7.4 or 8.0 strict mode |
| Azure SQL Database / Managed Instance | Including automatic gateway redirects |

**How each version is validated:** SQL Server **2017, 2019, and 2022 are
CI-verified** — the integration suite runs the full ignored test suite against
all three on every change. SQL Server 2008–2016 and Azure SQL are **validated
manually** against real servers, not in CI.

Known quirks: SQL Server 2014 RTM reports `ProductMajorVersion` as NULL (the
driver falls back to parsing `ProductVersion`), and legacy servers negotiating
TLS 1.0/1.1 fail with "TLS handshake eof" under `Encrypt=true` — use
`Encrypt=no_tls` there. See [LIMITATIONS.md](LIMITATIONS.md) for the rest.

## Status

Pre-1.0 and actively maintained — by a single maintainer on a best-effort
basis (see [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md)), with the aim of a first response
to issues and pull requests within about a week. The API may still change
between 0.x minors; [STABILITY.md](STABILITY.md) describes what is already
considered settled and the road to 1.0. An integration suite runs against a
real SQL Server in CI on every change.

Known gaps, so you don't have to discover them yourself:

- Kerberos/GSSAPI and FILESTREAM are implemented but not yet validated against
  live infrastructure.
- Always Encrypted reads are fully transparent; writes cover the full scalar,
  temporal, and fixed-width type set (see LIMITATIONS.md for the exact list and
  constraints).
- Parameterized queries run via `sp_executesql` by default (the server still
  reuses plans); a client-side prepared-statement cache is available opt-in
  (`Statement Cache=true`).
- No MARS (multiple active result sets on one connection).

The full list, with workarounds where they exist, is in
[LIMITATIONS.md](LIMITATIONS.md).

## Scope

This driver speaks TDS natively in pure Rust — no ODBC driver manager, no
OpenSSL, no C toolchain (outside the optional Windows SSPI feature) — and is
Tokio-only by design. It does not do compile-time query checking; if you want
sqlx-style checked queries, this is not that. Coming from Tiberius?
[MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) maps the API differences.
