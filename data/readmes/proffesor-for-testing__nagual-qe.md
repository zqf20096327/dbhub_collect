**A Rust-native self-learning knowledge system for Quality Engineering.**

Nagual-QE stores every pattern, test insight, and decision you encounter,
learns which ones actually work, and surfaces the right one when you need it
again. It is a local-first, privacy-respecting memory layer for engineers and
their AI agents.

New here? Read **[learn-nagual.md](learn-nagual.md)** — a layered,
earned-recognition onboarding walkthrough that takes you from your first
pattern to the Constitution in six steps. The full principles live in
[NAGUAL_CONSTITUTION.md](NAGUAL_CONSTITUTION.md).

## What it does

- **Stores** problem → solution patterns with provenance, tags, and embeddings
- **Learns** from outcomes: every success or failure updates a Bayesian quality
  score (Beta distribution), not just a scalar reward
- **Retrieves** with hybrid search — full-text (FTS5) + cosine similarity over
  128-dim embeddings + graph-boosted scoring
- **Consolidates** near-duplicates automatically (BLAKE3 + cosine thresholds)
- **Predicts** with Brier-calibrated confidence; self-scores its own accuracy
- **Redacts PII** before any data ever leaves the local machine
- **Serves** a browser dashboard + HTTP/WebSocket API + Unix socket for local
  agent integration

Designed to be the memory layer behind AI-assisted QE workflows — but it works
equally well as a standalone engineer's notebook.

## Why `nagual-qe`

This is the **public** edition of Nagual — the same core engine, shipped with
a QE-flavoured seed pattern set (optional) so you get value on day one. Use it
to back an [agentic-qe](https://github.com/proffesor-for-testing/agentic-qe)
fleet, or stand it up on its own.

## What it looks like

```console
$ nagual knowledge store "Flaky async test caused by race in setup fixture" \
    --solution "Add explicit await on the shared fixture. The fixture runs in a
                tokio::spawn and the test starts before it completes ~5% of
                the time. Using an Arc<Notify> fixes this." \
    --domain "qe.flaky" --tags "async,race-condition,tokio"
  stored pattern 7a9f3b1c (domain=qe.flaky, reward=0.500, tier=booster)

$ nagual knowledge search "flaky async"
  1. qe.flaky  score=0.84  Flaky async test caused by race in setup fixture
     Add explicit await on the shared fixture. The fixture runs in a
     tokio::spawn and the test starts before it completes ~5% of the time.
     Using an Arc<Notify> fixes this.

$ nagual learn record 7a9f3b1c success --feedback "Worked on CI too"
  recorded outcome — bayesian_score: Beta(2.0, 1.0) → mean 0.667 (1 trial)

$ nagual status
  Patterns:       515 (seed) + 3 (local)    Avg reward: 0.547
  Embeddings:     518 / 518 (onnx)          DB size:    1.6 MB
  Drift (7d):     +0.02                     Sessions:   1 active
  Constitution:   enforce (audit)           Tier:       booster 3, reflex 0
```

**Reproduce it**: `bash scripts/demo.sh` (drops a temp DB so your real store
stays untouched). Or record your own session:

```bash
brew install asciinema
asciinema rec demo.cast -c 'bash scripts/demo.sh'
```

## Quick start

### Fastest path — no ONNX Runtime, no model files

Needs only Rust and a C toolchain. Uses the built-in hash embedder (deterministic SHAKE-256,
128-dim) instead of the ONNX sentence model, and includes the dashboard. Good for trying the
learning loop, CI and minimal containers. (The
[HUSTEF 2026 masterclass](https://github.com/proffesor-for-testing/hustef-2026-memory-masterclass)
devcontainer uses the ONNX build below, so `knowledge search --semantic` works.)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/proffesor-for-testing/nagual-qe
cd nagual-qe
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features "kos serve"
cp target/release/nagual ~/.local/bin/

nagual status --db-path ./nagual.db
nagual knowledge import --seed seeds/qe-seed-v1.jsonl --db-path ./nagual.db   # optional QE seed
```

Hash vectors are not semantic, so `knowledge search --semantic` is of little use in this build;
full-text search, the learning loop, scoring and the dashboard behave the same. Don't mix
hash and ONNX embeddings in one database.

### macOS (with ONNX embeddings)

```bash
# Prereqs: Rust, ONNX Runtime
brew install onnxruntime

# Build + install
git clone https://github.com/proffesor-for-testing/nagual-qe
cd nagual-qe
bash scripts/mac-setup.sh

# Verify
nagual status
nagual knowledge store "Flaky test caused by async race" \
  --solution "Add explicit await on the setup fixture" \
  --domain "qe.flaky" --tags "async,race-condition"
nagual knowledge search "flaky async"
```

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu, with ONNX embeddings)

```bash
# Prereqs
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev sqlite3
# ONNX Runtime (arm64 example; x86_64: replace aarch64 with x64). Tested with 1.24.1.
wget https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases/download/v1.24.1/onnxruntime-linux-aarch64-1.24.1.tgz
tar xf onnxruntime-linux-aarch64-1.24.1.tgz
sudo cp onnxruntime-linux-aarch64-1.24.1/lib/libonnxruntime.so* /usr/lib/ && sudo ldconfig

# Model (~90 MB): anywhere in $NAGUAL_MODEL_DIR, ./models or ~/.nagual/models
mkdir -p ~/.nagual/models
curl -L -o ~/.nagual/models/all-MiniLM-L6-v2.onnx \
  https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/resolve/main/onnx/model.onnx
curl -L -o ~/.nagual/models/tokenizer.json \
  https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/resolve/main/tokenizer.json

# Build
cargo build --release
sudo cp target/release/nagual /usr/local/bin/
```

### Without ONNX (hash embedder only)

```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features kos
```

### Run the dashboard

```bash
cargo build --release --features serve          # or: --no-default-features --features "kos serve"
nagual serve --port 3333
# open http://localhost:3333
```

## Data storage

- **SQLite** at `./nagual.db` (or `~/.nagual/nagual.db`) — always.
- **PostgreSQL** (optional) via `DualWriteAdapter` — needed for the
  `ruvector-postgres` extension (HNSW + GNN + SONA) and multi-host deployments.

No data ever leaves your machine unless you explicitly enable cloud sync.
When you do, the PII redactor strips 12 classes of sensitive strings
(paths, IPs, emails, API keys, SSH keys, JWTs, phone numbers, etc.) before
any write to PostgreSQL or any outbound HTTP call. The same redactor runs on the
`nagual serve` read path (`/api` search, get and list responses), so a secret stored
locally is not handed to an agent through an ordinary search. The local SQLite file
itself is never rewritten.

---

## Status

Pre-1.0, actively developed. The public surface is stable enough to build on,
but expect migration notes between minor versions. All changes are documented
in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the local
development loop, code style, and the test requirements we enforce before
merging.

## Acknowledgements

Nagual-QE stands on the work of three upstream projects:

- **[RuVector](https://github.com/ruvnet/RuVector)** — the pgvector-compatible
  PostgreSQL extension (GNN + SONA + hybrid search) that backs the optional
  Postgres dual-write path. Nagual's `ruvector(128)` columns, cosine operator
  class, and HNSW indexing all come from here.
- **[Ruflo](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruflo)** — the agent workflow framework
  whose memory primitives, hooks, and MCP tooling informed the shape of
  Nagual's own hooks and swarm coordination.
- **[agentic-qe](https://github.com/proffesor-for-testing/agentic-qe)** — the
  sister QE fleet. Nagual-QE is designed to be the memory layer that an
  agentic-qe swarm reads and writes through, and the two projects share a
  common vocabulary for patterns, outcomes, and learning.

Thanks to the authors and contributors of all three.
