Nitro Porter — free your community! 🚀
==============

Nitro Porter is the _only_ multi-platform community migration tool.
Its goal is fast no-code migrations for any community with accessible data.

Every community deserves the agency to choose the best software for its mission while preserving its history.
All proprietary software has a finite lifespan and lock-in stifles competition, which leads to stagnation. 
When we own our data and can freely choose betweeen platforms, everyone wins.

## What Can It Do?

Migrate a community from a supported Source to a supported Target as comprehensively as possible.

Don't see your software below? [Start a discussion](https://github.com/prosembler/nitro-porter/discussions/new) to request it and check our [informal roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/prosembler/projects/1).

## Get Started

Working through a migration often takes weeks, not hours! Set reasonable expectations and be patient.

* [**User Guide**](https://nitroporter.org/guide) — requirements & install steps.
* [**Migration Guide**](https://nitroporter.org/migrations) — plan a community migration.
* [**Sources**](https://nitroporter.org/sources) & [**Targets**](https://nitroporter.org/targets) — support details.

We greatly appreciate [feedback](https://github.com/prosembler/nitro-porter/discussions)! However, we check in periodically as our schedule allows, not daily.

# Project Info Q&A

## What gets migrated, exactly? 🚥

All sources & targets support migrating:

* users & roles
* discussions (or _threads_) & posts (or _comments_)
* categories (or _subforums_, _channels_, etc.)

Beyond that, each package as different support based on feature availability, extension choice, and maturity of the package.
These include things like badges, reactions, bookmarks, & polls. Both source and target must support a data type for it to transfer.
Read more about [how data is transferred](https://nitroporter.org/data).

## How does it work? 🤔

Data is first converted to an intermediary "porter schema," reducing the number of data paths from `#sources x #targets` to `#sources + #targets`.
The result is repeatable results in a single multi-tool rather than myriad low-quality, single-purpose tools.

## Why not use 1-off migration tools? 🪴

Data migrations typically require either time & skill (you are a programmer) or capital (you are a for-profit company).
Nitro Porter aims to become increasingly accessible to _everyone else_ by making both migrations & extensibility simple.
Software tools should not be assumed disposible just because they don't have a 30% profit margin to exploit.

## Can't AI do this? 📿

No.

## Will you do it for me? 🙏

We encourage you to work through using the tool and ask us questions.
Feedback on how the tool works for you (or doesn't) is very valuable! 
However, if you prefer to outsource, contact migrations@prosembler.com for a cost estimate.

## Where did this come from? 📚

Vanilla Porter was created in 2010 at Vanilla Forums as a single-script multi-source export tool, abandoned by 2020.
Nitro Porter 3.0 was a rewrite[^1] that preserved compatibility with existing sources while reimagining the framework.
In 2026, the [Open Social Fund](https://nlnet.nl/opensocial), a fund established by [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl/), 
sponspored major development work in the 5.0 release. [More history on our website](docs/history.md).
