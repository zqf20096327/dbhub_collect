# Paddock

**Open-source AI software factory control plane.**

Paddock turns GitHub issues, workflow contracts, agent sandboxes, governance
policies, artifacts, and human review gates into one self-hosted operating system
for autonomous software work.

## Vision

Paddock is evolving from an agent dashboard into an AI software factory
for a **facility -> product line -> department** operating model.

The v1 product vision is defined in [docs/rc-factory-v1-prd.md](docs/rc-factory-v1-prd.md):

- GitHub issues are the source work items for autonomous software work.
- Paddock tasks are synchronized projections enriched with assignment,
  workflow, governance, artifacts, run state, and review metadata.
- Repo-owned workflow contracts define policy and prompts in versioned Markdown,
  then round-trip into runtime `workflow_templates`.
- Each active work item runs in an isolated sandbox or git worktree owned by
  Paddock, OpenClaw, or another explicit harness adapter.
- Aegis, reviewer, governance, and owner gates make autonomous work legible and
  reviewable before merge.
- Existing single-workspace deployments remain supported through feature flags,
  null-default schema changes, and compatibility paths.

Paddock itself is Product Line A for the pilot: its own issues, specs,
workflow contracts, validation evidence, and PRs are the proving ground.

## What It Does Today

- Operates a self-hosted Next.js dashboard for agents, tasks, sessions, skills,
  costs, logs, security posture, workflow contracts, and system health.
- Stores runtime state locally in SQLite with no required Redis or Postgres.
- Syncs with GitHub issues and pull requests for product work intake and
  completion evidence.
- Runs Aegis quality review gates, task pipelines, disposition logging, artifact
  handoffs, and resource governance.
- Exposes REST, CLI, and MCP control interfaces for agents and operators.
- Observes local and gateway-backed harnesses including Codex, Claude Code,
  OpenClaw, Hermes, OpenCode, and compatible adapters.

## Factory Model

| Concept | Paddock meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Facility | Authenticated operating boundary and aggregate view. |
| Product Line | A product workspace, such as Paddock itself. |
| Department | A project area inside a product line, such as QA or Development. |
| Work Item | A GitHub issue synchronized into a Paddock task chain. |
| Workflow Contract | Repo-owned Markdown/YAML policy that seeds runtime templates. |
| Run | One isolated harness attempt attached to a tracked work item. |
| Review Packet | Agent-readable bundle of PR, artifacts, validation, governance, cost, and unresolved human gates. |

## Quick Start

### One-command install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/racecraft-lab/Paddock.git
cd Paddock
bash install.sh --local     # or: bash install.sh --docker
```

Then open the setup flow:

```bash
open http://localhost:3000/setup
```

The installer handles Node.js 22+, pnpm, dependencies, and credential generation.
For Windows, use `.\install.ps1 -Mode local` in PowerShell.

### Manual setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/racecraft-lab/Paddock.git
cd Paddock
nvm use 22
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/setup` and create the first admin account.

### Docker

```bash
docker compose up
```

For hardened deployment:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.hardened.yml up -d
```

## Agent Control

Paddock can be driven from the web UI, REST API, CLI, or MCP server.

```bash
export MC_URL=http://localhost:3000
export MC_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Factory/multi-workspace deployments with FEATURE_WORKSPACE_SWITCHER enabled:
# scope requests with either workspace_id=<product-line id> or workspace_scope=facility (not both).

curl -X POST "$MC_URL/api/agents/register" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <MC_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "scout", "role": "researcher"}'

curl -X POST "$MC_URL/api/tasks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <MC_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Research competitors", "assigned_to": "scout", "priority": "medium"}'

curl "$MC_URL/api/tasks/queue?agent=scout" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <MC_API_KEY>"
```

## Configuration

See [.env.example](.env.example) for the full environment reference.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `AUTH_USER` / `AUTH_PASS` | Optional initial admin credentials. |
| `API_KEY` | Optional headless API key. |
| `PADDOCK_DATA_DIR` | Runtime database and state directory. |
| `MC_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Production host allowlist. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_OPTIONAL` | Run without a gateway connection. |

## Security

- Change all default credentials before deployment.
- Put any network-accessible deployment behind TLS and an authenticated reverse
  proxy.
- Configure `MC_ALLOWED_HOSTS` before exposing the service outside localhost.
- Treat agent sandboxes, transcripts, artifacts, and workflow contracts as
  sensitive operational state.
- Report vulnerabilities through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Roadmap

The factory roadmap is driven by the PRD and spec archive:

- Product-line and Facility scoping.
- Facility-wide Aegis and security guardians.
- Task pipeline engine and `ready_for_owner` terminal flow.
- Area-label GitHub routing and issue disposition telemetry.
- Shared artifact store and review packets.
- Resource governance for WIP, budget, and blackout/degraded windows.
- GitHub issue runner with isolated sandboxes and harness adapters.
- Post-merge human UAT loop before operational acceptance.

See [docs/rc-factory-v1-prd.md](docs/rc-factory-v1-prd.md) and
[docs/ai/rc-factory-technical-roadmap.md](docs/ai/rc-factory-technical-roadmap.md)
for the canonical sequence.
