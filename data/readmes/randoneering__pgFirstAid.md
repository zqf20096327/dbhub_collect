# pgFirstAid

Easy-to-deploy, open source PostgreSQL function (and view!) that provides a prioritized list of actions to improve database stability and performance.Inspired by Brent Ozar's [FirstResponderKit](https://github.com/BrentOzarULTD/SQL-Server-First-Responder-Kit) for SQL Server, **pgFirstAid** is designed for everyone to use - not just DBAs! Get actionable health insights from your PostgreSQL database in seconds.

Neon gives you serverless PostgreSQL that scales to zero when you're not using it. You get Git-like branching for your database; fork it for testing, preview environments, whatever. Plus, it's just Postgres. All your tools and extensions just work. This project uses Neon for testing pgFirstAid for compatibility, which means you can use it too!

## Features

- **Zero Dependencies** - Single SQL function, no external tools required
- **Detailed Checks** - built-in health checks covering critical performance and stability issues
- **Prioritized Results** - Issues ranked by severity (CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW → INFO)
- **Actionable Recommendations** - Each issue includes specific remediation steps
- **Documentation Links** - Direct links to official PostgreSQL documentation for deeper learning
- **Optional `pg_stat_statements` Checks** - Runs additional query workload checks when `pg_stat_statements` is installed

## Quick Start

### Installation

```sql
-- Copy and paste the function or view definition into your PostgreSQL database
-- Then run it:

--- function
SELECT * FROM pg_firstAid();

--- view
SELECT * FROM v_pgfirstAid;
```

That's it! No configuration needed. Deploy as a user with the highest possible privileges (in your environment) to avoid issues.

### Example Output

| severity | category | check_name | object_name | issue_description | current_value | recommended_action | documentation_link |
|----------|----------|------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| CRITICAL | Table Health| Missing Primary Key | public.users | Table missing a primary key... | No primary key defined | Add a primary key or unique constraint... | https://www.postgresql.org/... |
| HIGH | Table Health | Missing Statistics | public.orders | Table has never been analyzed... | Last analyze: Never | Run ANALYZE on this table... | https://www.postgresql.org/... |

## What Does It Check?

See the full list of checks, grouped by severity, in [`docs/health-checks/README.md`](docs/health-checks/README.md).

## Usage Tips

### Filter by Severity

```sql
-- Show only critical issues
SELECT * FROM pg_firstAid() WHERE severity = 'CRITICAL';

SELECT * FROM v_pgfirstAid WHERE severity = 'MEDIUM';

-- Show critical and high priority issues
SELECT * FROM pg_firstAid() WHERE severity IN ('CRITICAL', 'HIGH');

SELECT * FROM v_pgfirstAid WHERE severity IN ('CRITICAL', 'HIGH');
```

### Filter by Category

1. Table Health
2. Query Health
3. Replication Health
4. System Health
5. Database Health

```sql
-- Check table health   
SELECT * FROM v_pgfirstAid WHERE category = 'Table Health';
```

### Count Issues by Severity

```sql
SELECT severity, COUNT(*) as issue_count
FROM pg_firstAid()
GROUP BY severity
ORDER BY MIN(CASE severity
    WHEN 'CRITICAL' THEN 1
    WHEN 'HIGH' THEN 2
    WHEN 'MEDIUM' THEN 3
    WHEN 'LOW' THEN 4
    ELSE 5 END);
```

## When to Run

- **Daily** - Quick health check as part of morning routine
- **Before Deployment** - Catch potential issues before they impact production
- **After Major Changes** - Verify database health after schema modifications or data migrations
- **Performance Troubleshooting** - First step when investigating slow queries or system issues
- **Capacity Planning** - Regular monitoring to track database growth trends

## Important Notes

**Read Before Acting**
- Always review recommendations carefully before making changes. I have been supporting Postgres databases for close to a decade, but I learn something new each day
- Test in a non-production environment first
- Some operations (like VACUUM FULL) require maintenance windows
- Never drop an index without validating its usage patterns over time

**Permissions**
- Requires read access to system catalogs (`pg_catalog`)
- Works with standard user permissions for most checks
- Some checks may return fewer results for non-superuser accounts

**Optional: Enable pg_stat_statements For Deeper Query Checks**
- pgFirstAid keeps running without this extension and reports a setup action when it is missing.
- Self-hosted PostgreSQL: set `shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'`, restart PostgreSQL, then run `CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;`
- AWS RDS for PostgreSQL: add `pg_stat_statements` to the DB parameter group `shared_preload_libraries`, reboot, then run `CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;`
- GCP Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL: enable `cloudsql.enable_pg_stat_statements`, restart if required, then run `CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;`
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL: add `pg_stat_statements` to `shared_preload_libraries`, restart, then run `CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;`

## Performance Impact

pgFirstAid is designed to be lightweight and safe to run on production systems:
- Read-only operations (no modifications to your data or schema)
- Uses system catalog views that are already cached
- Typical execution time: <1 second on most databases
- No locking or blocking of user queries

## CI/CD Integration

Drop-in GitHub Actions workflows in [`workflows/`](workflows/) for integrating pgFirstAid into your pipeline:

| Workflow | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [`pgfirstaid-pr-audit.yml`](workflows/pgfirstaid-pr-audit.yml) | Posts a health audit on every PR |
| [`pre-post-migration-validate.yml`](workflows/pre-post-migration-validate.yml) | Gates deployments on migration safety |
| [`neon-before-after-validate.yml`](workflows/neon-before-after-validate.yml) | Isolated before/after checks via Neon branching |
| [`db-health-checks.yml`](workflows/db-health-checks.yml) | Scheduled daily health monitoring |
| [`managed-db-validate.yml`](workflows/managed-db-validate.yml) | Cloud-specific compatibility validation |

Copy any workflow file to `.github/workflows/` in your repo. See [`workflows/README.md`](workflows/README.md) for setup and configuration.

## Testing

- Query and health-check coverage is validated with pgTAP assertions grouped by severity.
- Integration tests cover live runtime behavior, function/view parity, and checks that need concurrent sessions or timing control.
- A coverage guard ensures every `check_name` in `pgFirstAid.sql` is referenced by at least one pgTAP assertion.
- The GitHub Actions validation workflows also run `testing/seed_and_validate.py --managed` against live database targets to confirm the seeded checks actually fire end-to-end.
- Managed database validation is exercised through the reusable workflow in `.github/workflows/managed-db-validate.yml`.

> **Important:** We currently validate managed-database testing against AWS, but we do not have the funding or credits needed to keep Azure and GCP test environments running. If you have access to Azure Database for PostgreSQL or GCP Cloud SQL and want to help validate pgFirstAid there, we would be happy to have the help.

## Compatibility

- **PostgreSQL 10+** - Supported, with active automated validation focused on PostgreSQL 15-18
- **PostgreSQL 9.x** - Most features work (minor syntax adjustments may be needed)
- Works with PostgreSQL-compatible databases, including Amazon RDS, Aurora, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, GCP Cloud SQL, and self-hosted PostgreSQL
- Automated managed-database validation is active for AWS today. Azure and GCP support is best-effort until we can fund those test environments.

## Contributing

Found a bug? Have an idea for a new health check? Let me know! I want this to grow to be a tool that is available for all, accidental DBA or not.
