## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- (Recommended) [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) for managing Go and Node.js versions

### Installation

**Download Pre-built Binary:**

Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/rapidforge-io/rapidforge/releases) to download the latest binary for your platform.

**Docker:**

```bash
docker pull celdem/rapidforge
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/data:/data celdem/rapidforge
```

Docker images are available at [hub.docker.com/r/celdem/rapidforge](https://hub.docker.com/r/celdem/rapidforge).

**Or Build from Source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rapidforge-io/rapidforge.git
cd rapidforge

mise install

make build
```

> **Note:** For development and building, check the [makefile](makefile) for available commands including `make build`, `make build-fe`, `make dev`, and more.

## 🔧 Development

### Managing Tool Versions

This project uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage Go and Node.js versions. All version specifications are centralized in [.mise.toml](.mise.toml).

**To update versions:**

1. Edit [.mise.toml](.mise.toml) with the desired Go and Node versions
2. Run `make sync-versions` to propagate changes to all files (Dockerfile, CI workflows, README, etc.)
3. Run `mise install` to install the new versions locally

This ensures version consistency across your development environment, CI/CD pipelines, and Docker builds.

### Running RapidForge

```bash
./rapidforge
```

When RapidForge starts for the first time, it will create admin user and password which will be printed to stdout for the first time only. Please login with those credentials and change your password later on.


## 📖 Documentation

For detailed configuration, deployment guides, and API documentation, visit:

**[https://rapidforge.io/docs](https://rapidforge.io/docs)**

## 🌙 About the Lua Binary

RapidForge ships with a bundled Lua binary sourced from the [superconfigure](https://github.com/ahgamut/superconfigure) project, which builds portable executables using the [Cosmopolitan](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/) libc. This means the binary runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows without any native dependencies — no installation required.

If you prefer not to use the bundled binary (e.g. for security, licensing, or platform-specific reasons), simply install Lua on your host machine. RapidForge will automatically detect and prioritise a system-installed `lua` executable over the bundled one.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Go with Gin framework
- **Database:** SQLite with migrations support
- **Frontend:** HTMX for interactivity, Shoelace web components.
- **Editor:** CodeMirror for code editing
- **Visual Editor:** React-based drag-and-drop page builder

## 🔧 Configuration

RapidForge can be configured through environment variables:

See [rapidforge.io/docs](https://rapidforge.io/docs) for configuration options.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on how to submit pull requests, report issues, and contribute to the project.

##  Release Process

Our release process ensures stability by testing RapidForge **with** RapidForge.

1.  **Code Merger**: Pull Requests are reviewed and merged into the `main` branch.
2.  **Staging Deployment**: The main branch is deployed to our internal test server by maintainer.
3.  **Dogfooding & Testing**: We use this internal rapidforge instance to run integration tests and perform manual testing. We verify changes by using RapidForge to test RapidForge.
4.  **Release**: Once changes are verified and stable, we create a new release.
