**Kernel and userspace tracing for io_uring.** A single-binary tracer and
analyzer. It attaches to any process that uses io_uring, whatever the
language or runtime, and reconstructs what each request did: per-opcode
latency, hidden async-worker punts, batching efficiency, and stalls. The
report ends with findings that name the problem and suggest a fix.

## Quick start

```sh
# one static binary, no toolchain, no runtime deps beyond a BTF kernel
curl -LO https://github.com/rch0wdhury/uringscope/releases/latest/download/uringscope-$(uname -m)
chmod +x uringscope-$(uname -m)
sudo mv uringscope-$(uname -m) /usr/local/bin/uringscope

# the three commands you'll reach for most:
sudo uringscope ./myapp           # run a program under the scope
sudo uringscope -p 31337 -d 30    # watch a running pid for 30 seconds
sudo uringscope -a -d 10          # everything on the box for 10 seconds
```

(Prefer a package or building from source? See
[Install / build](#install--build).)

Each run prints a per-ring report that ends in a findings section. It looks
like this:

```
$ sudo uringscope ./myapp
... myapp runs ...

findings
  [BATCH]  You average 1.0 SQEs per io_uring_enter(). You are paying a
           syscall per request -- the thing io_uring exists to avoid.
           Queue more SQEs before calling submit.
  [PUNT]   63% of READ requests fell off the fast path into io-wq worker
           threads (likely buffered reads missing the page cache). This
           is where your p99 lives. Consider O_DIRECT + registered
           buffers, or provoke readahead.
```

io_uring carries its request flow through shared-memory rings rather than a
syscall per request, so syscall-level tracing sees only ring setup, not the
requests inside. uringscope reads the kernel's io_uring tracepoints, adds
optional liburing uprobes for the userspace boundary, and stitches the
events back into per-request flows. The kernel ships ~18 static tracepoints
for this, but their prototypes are not ABI and have changed every few
releases. uringscope probes kernel BTF at startup and picks the program
variants that match the running kernel.

What it surfaces:

- **per-opcode latency histograms** (submit to complete), aggregated inside
  the kernel. Per-event data never crosses to userspace in the default mode.
- **async-punt detection**: which requests fell off the submit fast path
  into the io-wq worker pool, per opcode. A common source of hidden tail
  latency.
- **SQPOLL stall accounting**: how long your `iou-sqp` thread spent off-CPU
- **io-wq worker fan-out**: how many `iou-wrk` threads the kernel spawned
- **batching efficiency**: SQEs per `io_uring_enter()` syscall
- **CQ overflow / short write / poll-retry / task-work counters**
- **leak detection**: requests submitted but never completed. The buffer
  stays pinned and the app may be waiting on a completion that never comes.
- **`--check` correctness mode**: overlapping in-flight buffer ranges,
  registered-buffer lifetime violations (`HAZARD-BUFREG`), and the unmap
  variant of buffer use-after-free (`HAZARD-UAF`). The docs state plainly
  which hazards are and are not detectable from the kernel side.
- **end-to-end boundary timing** via best-effort liburing uprobes: submit
  batching and the lag between a CQE becoming ready and the app reaping it,
  the two segments kernel tracepoints can't see
- **findings**: named problems with evidence and a suggested fix
- **live mode** (`-i 2`, iostat-style) and an **OpenMetrics endpoint**
  (`--metrics :9090`) for Prometheus scraping, no extra dependencies
- **`--json`** reports with a versioned schema
  ([docs/json.md](docs/json.md)): findings carry stable tags, structured
  evidence, and a suggested fix. `--fail-on info|warn|crit` puts the
  worst finding in the exit code for CI gates, and
  `--baseline`/`--diff` compare before and after a change.
- **`--trace`**: a per-request timeline you can open in
  [Perfetto](https://ui.perfetto.dev)

## Install / build

The releases page carries a static binary per architecture
(x86_64, aarch64) plus `.deb` and `.rpm` packages. The packages wrap the
same static binary, so they install on any distro with a BTF kernel and
pull in no libraries of their own:

```sh
sudo dpkg -i uringscope_<ver>_amd64.deb     # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo rpm -i uringscope-<ver>-1.x86_64.rpm   # Fedora/RHEL
```

To build from source instead:

```sh
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install clang libbpf-dev linux-tools-common linux-tools-$(uname -r)
# Fedora
sudo dnf install clang libbpf-devel bpftool

make             # ./uringscope
make STATIC=1    # fully static binary you can scp anywhere
sudo make install  # -> /usr/local/bin (PREFIX= to relocate)
```

Runtime requirements: a kernel with `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y` (stock on
mainstream distros since around 5.15) and CAP_BPF + CAP_PERFMON, or root.
The tool links only libbpf, libelf, and zlib. liburing is not a dependency
of uringscope itself. It is needed only to build the test injector
(`test/faults/inject.c`) and by the fio benchmark workloads
(`apt install liburing-dev fio` for those).

## Usage

```sh
sudo uringscope ./myapp --my-args        # run a command under the scope
sudo uringscope -p 31337 -d 30           # watch a running pid for 30s
sudo uringscope -a -d 10                 # everything on the box, 10s
sudo uringscope -c -p 31337              # compact: per-op table + findings,
                                         #   like strace -c
sudo uringscope -e op=READ,WRITE -p 31337 # display only these opcodes
sudo uringscope -e punt -p 31337         #   ...or only punted / -e error
sudo uringscope -f -p 31337              # follow children/threads too
sudo uringscope -i 2 -p 31337            # live per-op deltas every 2s
sudo uringscope --metrics :9090 -p 31337 # OpenMetrics at :9090/metrics
sudo uringscope --json report.json -- ./myapp  # machine-readable report
sudo uringscope --json --fail-on=warn -p 31337 -d 10  # CI/agent gate: exit 3
                                         #   on a finding >= warn
sudo uringscope --baseline b.json -- ./myapp   # save for later --diff
sudo uringscope --diff b.json -- ./myapp # delta table vs the baseline
sudo uringscope --trace t.json -- ./myapp # + Perfetto timeline
sudo uringscope --check -- ./myapp       # hazard mode: buffer races,
                                         #   reg-buffer lifetime, unmap-UAF
sudo uringscope --no-findings -p 31337   # numbers only, no findings
uringscope --version                     # version + kernel support tiers
uringscope --list-ops                    # the opcode table
```

(`-c` was the short form of `--check` before 0.2. It now means the
strace-style compact summary, and `--check` is long-form only.)

`--check` is a higher-overhead debugging mode. Run your io_uring test suite
under it the way you would under ASan. It catches two in-flight requests
targeting overlapping memory, which corrupts data silently and returns no
error.

Containers: Docker's default seccomp profile blocks the io_uring syscalls
entirely, so the interesting targets are bare-metal and VM workloads
(databases, storage engines, io_uring-native runtimes).

PID namespaces (WSL2 distros, containers): the kernel reports root-namespace
tgids while you filter on namespaced pids. uringscope detects that it is in
a child pid namespace and translates inside the BPF programs, so
`uringscope ./myapp` works unchanged under WSL2.

## What the report means

| Section | Source | What to look for |
|---|---|---|
| avg batch / enter | `syscalls:sys_enter_io_uring_enter` | under 2 means you pay syscall overhead per request |
| punted % | `io_uring:io_uring_queue_async_work` | high % on READ/WRITE means the fast path was missed, usually where the p99 comes from |
| sqpoll off-cpu | `sched:sched_switch` on `iou-sqp-*` | the poller you paid a core for is asleep. Raise `sq_thread_idle` or drop SQPOLL |
| workers seen | `sched:sched_switch` on `iou-wrk-*` | unbounded fan-out means blocking ops (buffered I/O, fsync) are flooding io-wq |
| CQ overflow | `io_uring:io_uring_cqe_overflow` | CQ ring too small or reaping too slow. Completions took the slow path |
| poll-retry | `io_uring:io_uring_poll_arm` | sockets/pipes not ready at submit. Normal for network, news for disk |
| untracked completions | (tool fidelity) | requests submitted before attach, or map pressure. Latency stats cover tracked requests only |

## Guides

- [Profiling PostgreSQL 18's io_uring](docs/postgres.md). PostgreSQL 18 can
  submit reads through io_uring with `io_method=io_uring`. The guide shows
  which access paths actually use it (fewer than you might expect), which
  knobs move the findings, and how to read an empty report. Everything in
  it was measured against a live 18.6 cluster.

## Kernel support

| Kernel | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 6.1+ (incl. 6.6, 6.8, 6.12 LTS) | full | modern tracepoint prototypes |
| 5.15 LTS | counters + batching | legacy `submit_sqe`/`complete` prototypes, no punt attribution |
| < 5.15 | unsupported | |

uringscope probes the running kernel's BTF at startup and enables only the
program variants whose tracepoints exist, by name and prototype. A missing
tracepoint disables one feature instead of failing the load. See
`test/kernels.txt` for the CI matrix. `test/vmtest/run.sh <kernel>` boots a
kernel under virtme-ng/KVM and runs the full suite on it, checking that the
BTF probe selected the right variant (for example 6.17's cqe-collapsed
`io_uring_complete`) and that every injected fault is still detected.
CI runs this matrix nightly.

## How it works (short version)

- CO-RE eBPF, `tp_btf` attachments to the kernel's io_uring tracepoints.
- Request state is read from the `io_kiocb` pointer through minimal,
  relocatable shadow structs (`bpf/io_uring_shims.bpf.h`) rather than
  positional tracepoint arguments, because the struct fields have been far
  more stable than the tracepoint prototypes.
- Known layout changes (like `io_kiocb.user_data` moving into
  `io_kiocb.cqe` in 5.19) are handled with CO-RE flavors and
  `bpf_core_field_exists()`.
- Renamed or re-prototyped tracepoints are handled with multiple compiled
  program variants. `src/probe.c` inspects kernel BTF and flips autoload
  per variant before load.
- The default mode aggregates everything in kernel maps (per-opcode log2
  latency histograms, counters) and userspace reads the maps once at exit.
  `--trace` streams per-request records over a ring buffer instead.

## Testing / validating effectiveness

`test/faults/` deliberately injects faults and scores the findings
against ground truth:

```sh
make                          # build uringscope
cd test/faults && sudo ./run.sh
```

`inject.c` induces one anomaly per scenario (punt storm, no batching, CQ
overflow, error floods, dropped/leaked requests, SQPOLL stalls, worker
storms, buffer use-after-unmap, registered-buffer races and lifetime
violations, and reaping lag) and prints machine-readable `GROUND-TRUTH`
lines. `run.sh` runs each under the scope and checks the finding was
reported. The same harness produces the detection-effectiveness table.

## Benchmarks / evaluation

`bench/` contains the fio workloads, baseline commands, and collection script
used for the overhead-vs-fidelity evaluation. See `bench/README.md`.

## Scripting, CI, and coding agents

The JSON report is a versioned machine API (`"schema": 2`, documented in
[docs/json.md](docs/json.md)). Every finding carries a stable tag
(`PUNT`, `BATCH`, `OVERFLOW`, `HAZARD`, ...), structured numeric evidence,
and a suggested fix, so nothing has to parse the human tables. With
`--fail-on`, the verdict is in the exit code:

```sh
sudo uringscope --json=report.json --fail-on=warn -p "$PID" -d 10 || alert
```

Exit codes: `0` clean · `1` uringscope error · a spawned command's nonzero
status propagates · `3` a finding at or above the threshold.

For AI coding agents, [skills/uringscope/](skills/uringscope/) ships an
agent skill ([SKILL.md](skills/uringscope/SKILL.md), following the
[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard used by
[Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) and other tools). It
tells an agent when to reach for uringscope and maps each finding tag to
concrete code-level fixes in liburing, tokio-uring, glommio, and netty. To
install for Claude Code:

```sh
cp -r skills/uringscope ~/.claude/skills/            # all your projects
cp -r skills/uringscope your-project/.claude/skills/ # one project
```

## Status

Early. The aggregate mode, findings rules, hazard (`--check`) detectors,
live/metrics/JSON output, liburing-uprobe boundary timing, and Perfetto
export work on modern kernels. The 5.15 legacy tier remains best-effort
(counters and batching only). If the startup tier summary shows a degraded
or missing feature on your kernel, please open an issue with `uname -r` and
the output of
`bpftool btf dump file /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux format c | grep io_uring_`.
Tracepoint churn reports are the most useful thing you can send this
project.
