## 🏗️ What is EnergyDB?

EnergyDB is a database for energy portfolios. It stores three things together in one connected system:

| Layer | Description | Real-World Example |
| :---- | :--- | :--- |
| 🌳&nbsp;**Asset hierarchy** | Arbitrary-depth tree of portfolios, sites, and assets | *"Offshore-1 → WindTurbine T01 → power"* |
| 🔗&nbsp;**Grid topology** | Typed edges (lines, transformers, pipes, interconnections) connecting any two assets | *"Cable-1: BusA → BusB"* |
| ⏱️&nbsp;**3-dimensional time series** | Actuals and versioned forecasts attached to any node or edge, queryable as-of any point in time | *"power_flow on Cable-1, valid Wed 12:00, known Mon 18:00"* |

Structure lives in PostgreSQL, values live in ClickHouse, and stable UUID identity lets Python objects round-trip to the database without losing any structural state.

EnergyDB extends [TimeDB](https://github.com/rebase-energy/timedb) with persistent storage for [EnergyDataModel](https://github.com/rebase-energy/energydatamodel) hierarchies.

## ✨ Why EnergyDB?

Most time-series systems are agnostic about what their series represent — they treat data as opaque `(series_id, timestamp, value)` triples. EnergyDB knows it is a portfolio, and links every series back to the asset or grid edge it describes.

- 🔁 **Round-trip persistence:** Every `Element` keeps its UUID7 from in-memory object to row primary key — renames, moves, and property edits become silent `UPDATE`s, never delete-then-insert.
- 📋 **Diffable structural changes:** `dry_run=True` previews every insert, rename, move, and delete as a `TreeDiff` before you apply — no surprise mutations, and the same preview is available across a whole `transaction()`.
- ⏱️ **Time-of-knowledge queries:** Forecast revisions, corrections, and as-of backtests, powered by [TimeDB](https://github.com/rebase-energy/timedb).
- 🧭 **Lazy fluent navigation:** `client.get_node("Portfolio", "Site", "T01").read(...)` resolves to one indexed SQL query, regardless of subtree size.
- ⚖️ **Unit conversion at the boundary:** Declare canonical units once; pint rescales every read and write automatically.
- 🧹 **Idempotent writes:** `write(..., skip_unchanged=True)` drops rows that only duplicate the latest stored value before insert, so writing the same window repeatedly doesn't bloat storage. The comparison key is chosen *per series* — actuals dedupe per `valid_time`, versioned forecasts per `(valid_time, knowledge_time)` — so a republished forecast is never mistaken for a duplicate. Opt-in; the write still returns its `run_id` (a `WriteResult` carrying `.written` / `.skipped` counts).
- 🎯 **Partial reads that don't fail:** `read(manifest, on_missing="skip")` returns every series that resolved plus the triples that didn't, so one unregistered series in a 1,500-series manifest costs you that series — not the whole batch.
- 🧯 **Typed errors:** `NodeNotFoundError`, `SeriesNotFoundError` (carrying every unresolved triple), `ManifestError`, … all under one `EnergyDBError` base — so you branch on types and structured fields instead of matching message text. Every raisable class also subclasses `ValueError`, so broad handlers keep working.

- 🏢 **Opt-in multi-tenancy:** `client.namespace("acme")` returns a view of the client bound to one tenant — it shares the pool, stamps every row it writes with that namespace, and (once the host app enables PostgreSQL RLS) sees only that tenant's rows. A client that never calls it behaves exactly as a single-tenant client always has.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
pip install energydb
```

Requires Python 3.12+, PostgreSQL 15+ (asset hierarchy + series catalog), and ClickHouse (time-series values).

> **Need a local Postgres + ClickHouse?** One command brings both up: `cd local-db && docker compose up -d` (see [`local-db/`](local-db/), or [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for the full setup).

### 2. Usage Example

```python
from datetime import UTC, datetime
import energydb as edb
import pandas as pd

with edb.Client() as client:  # reads TIMEDB_PG_DSN / TIMEDB_CH_URL
    client.create()

    # 1. Declare your portfolio: a tree of typed assets with their series.
    t01 = edb.wind.WindTurbine(
        name="T01", capacity=3.5, hub_height=80,
        timeseries=[edb.TimeSeries(name="power", unit="MW",
                                   data_type=edb.DataType.ACTUAL)],
    )
    portfolio = edb.Portfolio(
        name="my-portfolio",
        members=[edb.Site(name="Offshore-1", members=[t01])],
    )
    client.register_tree(portfolio)   # create-only; edit existing nodes via scope mutators

    # 2. Write hourly power for that turbine.
    start = datetime(2026, 1, 1, tzinfo=UTC)
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        "valid_time": pd.date_range(start, periods=24, freq="1h", tz="UTC"),
        "value":      [2.5 + 0.05 * i for i in range(24)],
    })
    client.get_node("my-portfolio", "Offshore-1", "T01").write(
        df, name="power", data_type="actual",
    )

    # 3. Read across the whole portfolio in one fluent call.
    client.get_node("my-portfolio").read(name="power", data_type="actual")
# the pool and background loop are released once the `with` block exits;
# without it, call client.close() yourself when you're done.
```

> **Async?** `edb.Client` is a synchronous facade over `edb.AsyncClient`. For
> `async`/`await` code, use `AsyncClient` directly, either as an async
> context manager (`async with edb.AsyncClient(...) as client:`) or with
> `await client.open()` / `await client.close()` around every method shown
> above.

## 🧪 Try it in Google Colab

Want to try EnergyDB without a local setup? Open our Quickstart in Colab — the first cell automatically installs PostgreSQL + ClickHouse inside the VM.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rebase-energy/energydb/blob/main/examples/quickstart.ipynb)

> **Note:** Data persists only within the active Colab session. Additional notebooks are available in the `examples/` directory.
