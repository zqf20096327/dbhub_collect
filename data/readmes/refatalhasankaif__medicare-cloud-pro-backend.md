## 📖 Overview

Medicare-Cloud-Pro is a full-stack healthcare platform backend that enables patients to book appointments with doctors, attend video consultations, receive digital prescriptions, and manage medical records. The backend is built with a modular, layered architecture using Node.js and Express 5, backed by PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM, and secured with JWT-based session authentication via better-auth.

Key capabilities include multi-role access control (Super Admin, Admin, Doctor, Patient), complete appointment lifecycle management, Stripe-powered payment processing for consultation fees, digital prescriptions, and medical document storage via cloud.
