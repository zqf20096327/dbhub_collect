uv tool install trackinizer

# Local server; web UI at http://127.0.0.1:8765.
trackinizer

# CLI to trackinizer server.
trax
```

Centralized agent database for inquiries (Issues + Artifacts), work, and
knowledge. Three core tables (`inquiries`, `edges`, `change_log`) backed
by Postgres (real or PGlite). FastAPI on top.

`types/` is the design contract. Every other module is a realization of
that contract over Postgres + HTTP.

## The UI

The optional SPA (`server/web.py`) browses the same records the API serves.

**Graph** -- the whole inquiry web (Issues, Beliefs, Papers, Experiments, …) as typed nodes and edges.

**Console** -- live multi-agent chat, filterable by room and date.

**Belief** -- a record with its `before`/`after` relationship panels.

**Experiment** -- outcome, labels, and links to the beliefs it proves or disproves.

## The model

Everything in the system is an `Inquiry`, which has two variants: an
`Issue` is a unit of "work" and an `Artifact` is the output of that work.
Giving both a single type is what lets the same edges relate them -- work
can produce knowledge, and knowledge can elicit more work, without crossing a
type boundary.

Each row below lists the fields that class adds; every kind also has
everything above it.

```

Relationships are directed and every one has an inverse view, so a parent
and a child describe the same edge from either end:

```
                              OLDER  (parent)

    {narrows,requires}     {produced_by,supersedes}     {proves,favors}
            ▲                         ▲                        ▲
            │                         │                        │
          Issue ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄▷ Inquiry ◁┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ {Belief,Experiment}
            │                         │                        │
            ▼                         ▼                        ▼
{narrowed_by,required_by}  {produces,superseded_by}  {proved_by,favored_by}

                               NEWER  (child)
```

- Parents are always older than children, on each edge's own clock:
  creation-time for every edge except `requires`, which is completion-time.
- Any Inquiry can be `produced_by` older ones (its origins) and
  `superseded_by` others (M:N knowledge surgery).
- An Issue can be `narrowed_by` (broader to narrower) or `required_by` (it
  is the prerequisite another waits on). Both are Issue to Issue.
- `proves` / `favors` go from any Artifact to a `Belief` or `Experiment`
  -- anything may cite, only a claim may be cited. They carry a valence in
  [-1, 1]: sign is polarity, magnitude is weight. `proves` votes in the
  proof predicate; `favors` is context that informs but does not vote.
- `cites` / `cited_by` is Paper to Paper and stands apart from the six
  above: a bibliographic fact we record rather than a claim we reason
  over. No valence, no scheduling effect, and exempt from the acyclicity
  rule, since mutual citation is real data and not a cycle we own.

See [`docs/epistemy.md`](trackinizer/docs/epistemy.md) for why each verb
is named what it is.

## Storage

Three tables carry the model and other tables support them.

| table | holds |
|---|---|
| `inquiries` | one row per Inquiry, all kinds. `kind` discriminates; `(kind, seq)` gives the short ref (`Issue#7`) from a per-kind sequence. Optional columns are nullable, so NULL is the single encoding of "unset". |
| `edges` | every relationship, as `(from_id, to_id, edge_kind)`. Citation edges carry `valence`. A CHECK constrains which kind pairs each edge kind admits, and cycles are rejected on insert. |
| `change_log` | append-only audit. Each row is one change with `(old_*, new_*)` snapshot pairs; milestone rows carry no delta, their signal is that they exist. Drives the `trax recent` feed and idempotency replay. |

Per-kind detail that does not fit one row lives in its own table, keyed
back to `inquiries(id)` and deleted with it:

| table | holds |
|---|---|
| `experiment_metrics` | `(key, step, value)` time series for an Experiment. CHECKs mirror the wire's validators -- non-blank bounded key, non-negative step, finite value -- so a stored row can always be read back. |
| `session_records` | the ordered record log of an AgentSession, `(session_id, part, idx)`, each holding one `trackinizer.lib.agent` IR record as JSON. `part` is one source FILE (a session spans several); `idx` is DERIVED from position in it, which is what makes re-ingest idempotent. Backs the live console feed. |
| `session_manifests` | one row per `part`: what the file was called, what it declared, and how much of it is live. |
| `session_ciphertext` | `Thinking.encrypted`, split off so retention can drop it without touching what search indexes. |
| `session_slash_commands` | commands the human typed into the TUI. Not records: never written to any session log, so they hold no `idx`. |
| `inquiry_embeddings` | one vector per `(inquiry_id, model)` for semantic search. |

Auth is three more: `users`, `api_keys` (scrypt-hashed, prefix-indexed),
and `allowlist`.

The typed fields on `Inquiry` (`produces`, `supersedes`, citation lists)
are projections the Store fills by reading `edges` -- the edge table is the
real storage.

`trax export > graph.jsonl` writes the graph as JSON lines: the rows of the
tables above, minus embeddings, ciphertext, and auth. Unlike a copy of the
PGlite datadir it is not tied to the storage internals that wrote it, and an
unchanged graph exports the same bytes twice. Line format:
[`docs/api.md`](trackinizer/docs/api.md) section 3.24.

## Package dependency graph

Four layers, two legs sharing one contract spine. An arrow means
"imports / depends on" and points toward the dependency.

```

Two legs, one shared spine:

- client leg: `trax` → `client` → `wire` → `types`
- server leg: `server/__main__` → `server/api` → `wire` → `types`

The whole point of this split: `types/` + `wire/` + `client/` form a
self-contained client distribution. `wire/` and `client/` never import
`api`, `server`, `store`, `web`, `fastapi`, `asyncpg`, or `trax`, so a
published Python client carries no server dependencies.

## Layering rules

1. **`types/` is a closed island.** Nothing in `types/` imports anything
   outside it. Everything else eventually imports from it. The
   dataclasses, Protocols, and `ColumnSpec` metadata in `types/` are the
   data design contract; the rest of the package realizes it.

2. **`wire/` is the API contract; it is the single definition of the
   HTTP surface.** It holds the Pydantic request/response bodies
   (`FieldSet[T]`, `FieldOp[T]`, `FieldMutation`, `Submit*`, edge
   bodies), the `Filter`/`Ref` shapes, and the route table the server
   registers from and the client builds requests from. It imports
   `types/` and nothing else internal. Server and client both derive
   from it, so neither hand-writes a path or a body shape -- that is
   what prevents server/client/doc drift.

3. **`client/` is the standalone SDK; `trax` is a thin CLI over it.**
   `client/` is `wire/` + `httpx`. `trax` owns only CLI concerns
   (grammar, parsing, rendering) and calls `client.Client`. Neither
   `client/` nor `wire/` may import the server side or the CLI.

4. **No cycles.** Each arrow above goes one direction.
   `server/primitives.py` imports `server/setter_dispatch.RUNTIME_HOOKS`
   and *mutates* it at import time (late-binding the `results` /
   `codechanges` validators). `server/store.py` imports `primitives`,
   so the side effect lands before any `Store` instance is constructed.

5. **`server/sql.py` is orthogonal.** It loads `assets/schema.sql`
   from disk. `server/schema_gen.py` substitutes generated bodies into
   the loaded text at bootstrap; the two never import each other.

6. **`server/api/` is the HTTP boundary.** Routes are thin:
   pydantic-validate the wire body, call one `Store` method, serialize
   the result. Anything non-trivial belongs in `server/store.py`, not in
   a route.

## Reading order

Pick one of these orders depending on what you came in for.

- **"What does Trackinizer model?"**
  Start in `types/`. Read `inquiries.py`, then `edges.py`, then
  `change_log.py`. Read `docs/design.md` for the model and philosophy.

- **"What is the HTTP API / how do I avoid drift?"**
  Start in `wire/routes.py`: the route table is derived from the
  `ColumnSpec` metadata in `types/inquiries.py`. The server registers
  handlers by iterating it (`server/api/edit.py`, `edge.py`), the client
  builds requests from it (`client/client.py`), so neither hand-writes a
  path. `server/api/routes_drift_test.py` and `assets_drift_test.py`
  fail if a handler or the SPA diverges from the table.

- **"How does a submit reach the database?"**
  `server/api/submit.py` → `wire/bodies.py` (body validation) →
  `server/store.py` (`submit_X`) → `server/primitives.py`
  (`insert_inquiry`, `insert_edge`).

- **"How does an edit fan out notifications?"**
  `server/api/edit.py` → `server/store.py` (`set_X` → `_set_field`) →
  `server/setter_dispatch.py` (`RUNTIME_HOOKS[col]`) → `server/notify.py`
  (post-commit buffer + `LISTEN/NOTIFY`).

- **"How does the schema get built?"**
  `server/__main__.py` → `store.bootstrap()` → `server/sql.py`
  (`schema_migrations()`) → `server/schema_gen.py`
  (`substitute_schema_placeholders()`) → the four `_generate_*`
  functions. Generated text is derived from `ColumnSpec` metadata on the
  dataclasses in `types/`. See `docs/db_schema_migration.md` for running
  migrations, squashing, and deploying schema changes.

- **"How does a `dependency_changed` cascade work?"**
  `store.emit_change` → `store._cascade_dependency_changed` →
  `store._parent_edges` → `types/edges.EdgeKindPolicy`. The policy
  table is the single declaration site for which endpoint of each
  edge kind is the dependent.

## Running

```bash
trackinizer                        # pglite (default), with web UI
trackinizer --engine pg --dsn ...  # against real Postgres
trackinizer --no-web               # API only
```

`trax` is the client half and talks to any reachable server, so it is
useful on its own:

```bash
trax help                          # grammar and subjects
trax issue                         # list issues
```

From a source checkout, both are `uv run python -m trackinizer.server`
and `uv run python -m trackinizer.trax`.

See `example.sh` for a worked end-to-end submit/edit/query session.

## System dependencies

Integration tests (`@pytest.mark.integration`) use a Postgres server backend
via `pytest-postgresql` and also requires `pgvector`.

PGlite bundles its own `vector` extension, so the default `pglite` engine has
no system deps.

### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
# Extension packages are always named `postgresql-NN-<ext>` -- there is no
# unversioned alias -- so derive NN from the metapackage instead of hardcoding
# it (18 above 24.04, 16 on 24.04).
PG_MAJOR="$(apt-cache depends postgresql | grep -m1 -oP 'postgresql-\K\d+')"
sudo apt-get install -y postgresql "postgresql-$PG_MAJOR-pgvector"
```

### macOS

```bash
# Homebrew's pgvector supports postgresql@17 and @18.
brew install postgresql@18 pgvector
```
