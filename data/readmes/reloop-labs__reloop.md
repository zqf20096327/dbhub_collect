## What is Reloop?

Reloop gives you the same capabilities as SendGrid, Mailchimp, Resend, and Loops — but the codebase is open source and fully self-hostable.

- **Transactional email** — REST API and SMTP relay for programmatic sending
- **Email campaigns** — broadcast and sequence campaigns with audience segmentation
- **Inbound email** — receive, parse, and process incoming mail at your own domain
- **Email templates** — a visual drag-and-drop editor built for developers and marketers
- **Real-time analytics** — open rates, click rates, bounces, and delivery events stored in PostgreSQL
- **Webhooks** — push delivery events to your own endpoints the moment they happen
- **Contacts & lists** — manage subscribers, tags, and suppression lists
- **Workflows** — automate multi-step email sequences triggered by user actions
- **API keys & auth** — granular API key management with team-level permissions

Use Reloop as a **hosted service** (Reloop Labs handles the infrastructure) or **self-host** on Docker, Kubernetes, or bare metal. Same APIs. Same features. Your choice.

## Why Reloop?

| | Reloop | SendGrid / Mailchimp / Resend |
|---|---|---|
| Open source | ✅ | ❌ |
| Self-hostable | ✅ | ❌ |
| Vendor lock-in | ❌ None | ✅ Locked in |
| Transparent pricing | ✅ | ❌ |
| Data stays on your servers | ✅ (self-hosted) | ❌ |

---

## Who This Is For

**Developers** who need a reliable email API without vendor lock-in — integrate via REST or SMTP, manage sending domains, and receive webhook events for every delivery state.

**DevOps and platform teams** who want full control over their email infrastructure — run Reloop on your own servers, inspect every component, and keep all data inside your network.

**Marketing and growth teams** who need campaign tools and audience management without depending on a proprietary SaaS platform that can change pricing or terms at any time.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reloop-labs/reloop.git
cd reloop
bun setup
bun dev
```

For full setup instructions — prerequisites, environment config, Docker services, database setup, and per-service commands — see the **[Setup Guide →](https://reloop.sh/docs/setup)**

| Setup Doc | Description |
|---|---|

| [Architecture overview](https://reloop.sh/docs/setup/overview) | Monorepo layout and tech stack |
| [Port reference](https://reloop.sh/docs/setup/port) | All local ports and gateway routes |

## Self-Host

Deploy the whole stack on a fresh Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 or Debian 12/13 server with one command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://reloop.sh/install.sh | sudo bash
```

The installer runs preflight checks, installs Docker, prompts for your domain, generates production secrets, deploys every service, verifies health, and prints the DNS records to add. See the **[VPS guide →](https://reloop.sh/docs/self-host/vps)**

---

## Hosted Service

Reloop is also available as a fully managed hosted service from Reloop Labs — same codebase, zero infrastructure to run. [Sign up at reloop.sh](https://reloop.sh/dashboard/signup).
