# RPA Core

Deterministic, stateful RPA in Python for code-first enterprise automation.

Requires Python 3.11+.

Documentation shipped with a release describes that release. The default
branch may include changes intended for the next release; when exact
compatibility matters, use the source and documentation at the tag matching
your installed package.

## Package Name

The public project name is **RPA Core**. The package, import path, and CLI
command are `rpacore`.

## What Is RPA Core?

RPA Core is a pip-installable Python library for building reliable, auditable
robotic process automations. Define your steps, wire them into a transaction,
and the framework handles execution order, retry logic, persistence, logging,
queues, reports, credentials, and notifications.

For complete working automations, see the separate
[RPA Core examples](https://github.com/renatomoselli/rpacore-examples)
repository. It includes file inbox processing, JSON event log processing,
database reconciliation, Excel reorganization, checkpoint/resume behavior, API
batching, and other user-facing examples built against the released package.

The design direction is:

> AI-assisted development, deterministic execution.

That means RPA Core should be friendly to humans and AI coding agents, but the
runtime remains deterministic. There are no runtime AI dependencies.

Core traits:

- **Deterministic execution**: predictable behavior, no hidden runtime magic.
- **Stateful transactions**: every step's status is tracked and persisted.
- **Idempotent retries**: resume from failure and re-run only failed work.
- **Explicit exceptions**: business rule failures and system failures are
  classified separately.
- **Structured logging**: text or JSON output through stdlib logging.
- **TOML configuration**: externalized settings with simple defaults.
- **SQLite persistence**: local transaction history without a service.
- **Queue processing**: SQLite-backed queue with atomic item claiming.
- **Reports and notifications**: text/HTML reports, SMTP email, and webhooks.

## Installation

```bash
pip install rpacore
```

## Quick Start

```python
from rpacore import (
    Engine,
    Transaction,
    configure_logger,
    execute_transaction,
    load_config,
)

from my_steps import FetchRecord, ProcessRecord, WriteOutput


config = load_config("config.toml")
configure_logger(level=config["log_level"], fmt=config["log_format"])

tx = Transaction(
    reference="my-automation",
    definition_identity="my-automation/v1",
)
tx.steps = [
    FetchRecord(
        name="fetch_record",
        execution_order=1,
        arguments={"record_id": "ABC-001"},
    ),
    ProcessRecord(name="process_record", execution_order=2),
    WriteOutput(name="write_output", execution_order=3),
]

engine = Engine(
    max_retries=config["max_retries"],
    retry_delay=config["retry_delay"],
    retry_backoff=config["retry_backoff"],
)
execute_transaction(
    tx,
    config=config,
    engine=engine,
    transaction_db_path=config["transaction_db_path"],
)
```

`definition_identity` is your automation's recovery-compatibility token. It is
not tied to the RPA Core package version: keep it stable through compatible
fixes, and change it when older in-progress transactions must not resume under
the new automation definition.

## CLI

Create a new project scaffold:

```bash
rpacore init my_project
cd my_project
rpacore run
```

`rpacore init <project_name>` creates a normal Python project with
`pyproject.toml`, `rpacore.toml`, `config.toml`, `main.py`, a `steps/` package,
a pytest step test, and `.gitignore`. Step tests use normal pytest with
plain step instances and `ProcessContext`; see [Testing RPA Core Steps](docs/testing.md).

`rpacore run` discovers `rpacore.toml` from the current directory, resolves the
declared `module:callable` entrypoint, and invokes it. The CLI does not build
steps, transactions, config, or persistence automatically; that wiring remains
in project Python code. Entrypoint imports temporarily prioritize the manifest's
project directory and replace only conflicting cached modules in that Python
package namespace; the process working directory is unchanged. Dependencies
outside the entrypoint's top-level package follow normal Python import-cache
semantics and are never globally purged by RPA Core.

Inspect persisted local transactions:

```bash
rpacore transaction list
rpacore transaction list --json
rpacore transaction show <transaction_id>
rpacore transaction show <transaction_id> --json
rpacore transaction export --format json
rpacore transaction export --format ndjson
```

Transaction inspection uses `[storage].transaction_db_path` from `rpacore.toml`
by default. Pass `--db path/to/rpacore.db` to inspect a specific database.
`--db` paths are resolved relative to the current working directory; manifest
storage paths are resolved relative to `rpacore.toml`. `transaction list`
returns the latest 100 transactions by default; pass `--limit N` to choose a
different cap. Human output is intended for operators; `--json` writes parseable
JSON to stdout with diagnostics only on stderr. Transaction inspection JSON uses
`schema_version = 2` and embeds the canonical transaction record with
`transaction_format_version = 3`. The record includes the caller-owned
`definition_identity` used to guard recovery compatibility.

Transaction export writes portable machine-readable records for all persisted
transactions. JSON export uses an envelope with `export_format_version = 2`,
`framework_version`, `exported_at`, and `transactions`. NDJSON export writes one
record per line with `export_format_version = 2` on each record. Export selects
records through normalized-UTC cursor pages in `created_at DESC, id ASC` order.
It keeps one page of summaries at a time and releases the page query before
loading records, so slow output or partial consumption does not hold a SQLite
read lock against concurrent checkpoints. Inserts before the current cursor do
not appear later; inserts after it can appear in a later page. Updates to a
selected transaction are visible when that record is loaded, while a selected
transaction deleted by concurrent cleanup before its load is omitted. Unlike
`transaction list`, export has no 100-record cap.

Machine-readable transaction records include user-supplied state, metadata,
step arguments, exception messages, and artifact metadata. These fields can
contain sensitive business data. They never include resources, config,
credentials, or artifact file contents. Webhook notifications preserve their
compact payload shape by default while including report metadata and artifact
records. Set
`[notification.webhook].include_transaction = true` to include the canonical
transaction record in the webhook JSON payload.

Webhook URLs must use `http` or `https`. Local, private, loopback, and
link-local hosts are allowed because webhook endpoints are trusted operator
configuration in local automation deployments. Treat webhook config as
sensitive: outbound requests can still reach internal services. The stdlib URL
open timeout bounds socket operations after resolution starts, but it does not
fully control operating-system DNS resolution latency.

Email notifications attach screenshots referenced by exception reports only
when `[notification.email].attach_screenshots` is true, which is the default.
Missing or unreadable screenshot files are skipped; report and notification
payloads include artifact records and paths, not artifact file contents.

Set `log_format = "json"` and pass it to `configure_logger(..., fmt=...)` for
line-delimited JSON logs. Each JSON log line contains `log_format_version`,
UTC `timestamp`, `severity`, `logger`, namespaced `event`, `message`, and nested
`attributes`. User extras cannot replace canonical envelope fields. Logged
exceptions add an `exception` object with `type`, `message`, and `stacktrace`;
explicit stack data uses `stacktrace`. Text logs preserve the same diagnostic
evidence.

Exit behavior is stable across platforms:

- entrypoint returns `None`: exit `0`
- entrypoint returns an integer from `0` through `255`: propagate it
- entrypoint or framework execution raises: exit `1` with diagnostics on stderr
- CLI usage errors, invalid manifests, entrypoint-resolution errors, or invalid
  return values: exit `2`

`rpacore version` prints the installed framework version.

## Writing a Step

```python
from rpacore import BusinessException, ProcessContext, Step


class FetchRecord(Step):
    def execute(self, ctx: ProcessContext) -> None:
        record_id = self.arguments.get("record_id")
        if not record_id:
            raise BusinessException(
                message="record_id is required",
                action="FetchRecord",
            )

        # Fetch and store durable state for later steps.
        ctx.state["record"] = {"id": record_id}
```

## Project Structure

```text
rpacore/              # Framework core
  __init__.py      # Public API re-exports
  exceptions.py    # BusinessException, SystemException
  status.py        # Status enum
  step.py          # Step base class
  transaction.py   # Transaction model
  engine.py        # Execution engine
  persistence.py   # SQLite persistence
  logger.py        # Logging helpers
  config.py        # Configuration loader
  context.py       # ProcessContext
  credentials.py   # Credential providers
  queue.py         # SqliteQueue, QueueProvider
  runner.py        # run_queue_loop
  report.py        # Report generation and rendering
  notify.py        # Email and webhook notifications
```

User automations should live outside `rpacore/`, usually in their own repository
with a `steps/` package and a small `main.py` wiring layer.

## Execution Model

```text
main.py
  load_config()
  configure_logger()
  create Transaction
  attach ordered Steps
  execute_transaction(transaction, transaction_db_path=...)
  generate report / dispatch notifications
```

Transaction lifecycle:

```text
PENDING -> IN_PROGRESS -> SUCCESSFUL
                       -> FAILED
```

`Engine.run()` validates transaction wiring and durable JSON data before any
step runs. Transaction references and step names must be non-empty, step
names must be unique within the transaction, and step execution orders must be
unique positive integers. Transaction state and metadata, step arguments, and
artifact metadata must contain only JSON-safe values. Malformed input raises
`ExecutionValidationError` or `JsonStateError` and should be treated as a
permanent configuration or code issue, not as a retryable runtime failure. The
same validation applies before persistence and recovery, so invalid data is not
partially persisted or silently coerced.

Persistence is written by user wiring. For strict crash boundaries in ordinary
one-off runs, use `execute_transaction(transaction, transaction_db_path=...)`;
it supplies `save_transaction()` as the engine checkpoint after each transaction
or step state transition. Advanced callers can still build `ProcessContext`
directly and call `Engine.run(ctx, checkpoint=...)`. Without a checkpoint
callback, user code may still save only after `Engine.run()` returns. Loading a
persisted transaction preserves the stored status; explicit recovery happens
when user code calls `resume_transaction()` with the exact application-owned
definition identity. Unidentified or mismatched non-successful records fail
closed before recovery mutation.

## Configuration

Create a `rpacore.toml` in your project to declare the Python entrypoint and
transaction storage:

```toml
[project]
entrypoint = "main:main"

[storage]
transaction_db_path = "rpacore.db"
```

`rpacore.toml` is intentionally small. Step construction and transaction wiring
stay in Python; the manifest does not define pipelines or automatic step
discovery. See `docs/project-manifest.md` for the full schema.

When both `rpacore.toml` and `config.toml` are present, the value passed to the
runner or storage layer by user wiring still decides which transaction database
is used. Queue settings, retry settings, credentials, screenshots, and
notifications remain `config.toml` settings; they are not part of the project
manifest schema.

Create a `config.toml` in your project:

```toml
max_retries = 2
retry_delay = 0.0
retry_backoff = 1.0
log_level = "INFO"
log_format = "text"  # "text" or "json"
transaction_db_path = "rpacore.db"
screenshot_dir = ""
credential_provider = "env"

[queue]
db_path = "queue.db"
lease_timeout = 30
max_retries = 3

# [notification.email]
# host = "smtp.example.com"
# port = 587
# from_addr = "rpacore@example.com"
# to_addrs = ["admin@example.com"]
# attach_screenshots = true

# [notification.webhook]
# url = "https://hooks.example.com/rpacore"
# include_transaction = false
```

Relative `transaction_db_path`, `queue.db_path`, and non-empty
`screenshot_dir` values are resolved from the directory containing
`config.toml`. An empty `screenshot_dir` remains the disabled sentinel;
whitespace-only values and `:memory:` with or without surrounding whitespace
are invalid screenshot directories. These config paths are independent from
paths declared in `rpacore.toml`, which resolve from the manifest's directory.

## Exception Model

| Exception | Meaning | Engine behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `BusinessException` | Expected rule violation, such as invalid input data. | Step fails; remaining steps continue unless explicitly halted. |
| `SystemException` | Technical failure, such as network or file errors. | Step fails, execution stops, retryable. |
| Any other exception | Unhandled Python exception. | Wrapped as `SystemException`. |

Use `halts_remaining_steps=True` for a business failure that should halt downstream work:

```python
raise BusinessException("bad row", action=self.name, halts_remaining_steps=True)
```

## Timeouts and Deadlines

RPA Core does not provide a generic per-step timeout. Python threads cannot be
safely stopped, so an in-process timeout can mark a step failed while the timed
out code keeps running and mutating external systems.

Configure I/O timeouts in the library that performs the work, such as the HTTP,
SMTP, browser, database, or desktop automation client used by a step. If an
automation needs a hard deadline with termination, run it behind a separate
worker process boundary and record the outcome back into RPA
Core. RPA Core intentionally rejects Pebble or similar process-timeout
dependencies because process termination cannot make arbitrary external side
effects reversible. See [Runtime Dependency Decisions](docs/runtime-dependencies.md)
for the current decisions on process-timeout libraries, Pydantic, Tenacity, and
AnyIO.

## Optional Dependencies

```bash
pip install "rpacore[screenshots]"   # mss: auto-capture screenshots on exception
pip install "rpacore[keyring]"       # keyring: OS credential store integration
```

## Examples

This repo keeps a minimal in-repo automation under `examples/` to support
integration-style tests for the framework itself:

- `examples/sample_step.py`
- `examples/sample_main.py`

Fuller user-facing automations live in the separate
[RPA Core examples](https://github.com/renatomoselli/rpacore-examples)
repository. Start there if you want complete projects that install RPA Core as a
package and show recommended project structure.

Example projects include:

- file inbox processing
- JSON event log processing
- database reconciliation
- Excel reorganization
- checkpoint/resume behavior
- REST API batch processing
- browser and desktop automation examples

[docs/durability.md](docs/durability.md). For CLI, API, config, export, and
import-boundary references, see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).
For vulnerability reporting and local security posture, see
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and [docs/security.md](docs/security.md).

## Local-First Design

RPA Core is local-first:

- projects remain normal Python repos
- runs persist locally
- logs, reports, queues, transactions, and artifacts stay readable

Remote orchestration and distributed worker protocols are outside the current
Core runtime; see
[docs/non-goals.md](docs/non-goals.md) for current non-goals.

## Compatibility

RPA Core's documented public APIs, CLI behavior, storage schemas, export
formats, and generated-project persistence patterns are compatibility
boundaries. A breaking change requires a correctness, security, or
release-blocking reason, a documented migration path, and focused validation.
