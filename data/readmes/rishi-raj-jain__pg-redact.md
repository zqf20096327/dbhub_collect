# pg_redact()

A live demo of **content-aware PII redaction, enforced in Postgres**: a support inbox stored in **Neon Postgres**, where **Jev** (TypeSafe's System One model) decides per span whether each piece of text is personal data and of what kind. Switch your role (Guest → Support Agent → Admin) and watch a `redact()` SQL function seal or reveal every field in real time.

It is content-aware, not pattern-based: "the front office" stays visible, a phone number does not. The decision carries a calibrated confidence, and the redaction is enforced inside Postgres by a `redact()` SQL function gated on the viewer's clearance.

Built with Next.js, React 19, Tailwind v4, [Neon UI](https://ui.neon.com) components, `@neondatabase/serverless`, and the [Jev API](https://docs.typesafe.ai/).

## How it works

1. **Candidate generation** (`src/lib/pii.ts`): tokenizes a message into candidate spans (structured shapes, capitalized runs, number-led runs). This part is deliberately dumb.
2. **Jev classification** (`src/lib/jev.ts`): one System One request with one `choice` question per candidate, decided in a single parallel pass. Jev returns a typed label (`name`, `email`, `phone`, `address`, `id_number`, or `none`) with calibrated probabilities. Only confident PII spans are kept.
3. **Storage**: spans are stored as JSONB next to the message in Neon Postgres.
4. **Masking**: each PII type has a sensitivity, each role a clearance. A span is revealed only when clearance ≥ sensitivity. The API strips unauthorized values before they ever reach the browser, and the same rule is enforced in-database by `redact(body, spans, clearance)` (see the "what Postgres returns for this role" panel on each message).

| Role          | Clearance | Sees               |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| Guest         | 0         | nothing            |
| Support Agent | 2         | name, email, phone |
| Admin         | 3         | everything         |

## Setup

Requires Node 20+.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in DATABASE_URL and TYPESAFE_API_KEY
npm run db:setup       # create the table + pii_sensitivity() + redact()
npm run db:seed        # classify the seed messages through Jev and insert them
npm run db:prewarm     # optional: warm the buffer cache after a cold start
npm run dev            # http://localhost:3000
```

### Environment

- `DATABASE_URL` — Neon Postgres connection string.
- `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` — Jev API key from https://typesafe.ai (server-side only, never shipped to the client).

## Deploying to Vercel

1. Push this directory to a git repository and import it into Vercel.
2. Add `DATABASE_URL` and `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` as Project Environment Variables.
3. Deploy. Run `npm run db:setup && npm run db:seed` once against the production database (locally with the prod `DATABASE_URL`, or from a one-off shell) to provision the schema and seed data.

## Project layout

```
src/
  app/
    page.tsx              the interactive console (client)
    api/messages/route.ts GET masked messages for a role
    api/classify/route.ts POST text -> Jev -> store -> masked response
    api/reveal/route.ts   GET the in-database redact() output for a message + role
  lib/
    pii.ts                PII types, sensitivity/clearance, candidates, segment builder
    jev.ts                Jev System One client
    db.ts                 single Neon HTTP client
  components/             Neon UI components (added via the shadcn registry)
scripts/
  setup.ts               schema + masking functions
  seed.ts                seed messages classified through Jev
```

## Rate limiting

`POST /api/classify` (the "add your own message" flow) is capped at **10 new queries per IP per day**. The client IP comes from `@vercel/functions` `ipAddress()` on Vercel, falling back to the first `x-forwarded-for` hop locally. Counts are kept in a `rate_limits(ip, day, count)` table and reset each calendar day; over the limit returns `429` with a `Retry-After` header.

## Indexes and caching

The list query reads every row ordered by `id`, and the per-message lookup already uses the `messages_pkey` primary-key index. `npm run db:prewarm` uses `pg_prewarm` to pull the table and its index into the buffer cache, which only helps after a Neon scale-to-zero cold start.
