Whole-codebase knowledge for AI coding agents. A field-aware code graph plus persistent memory, built on Rust, Postgres + pgvector, and exposed over MCP.

**The problem:** AI coding agents see a few pages out of the book each session. They grep, read, and re-derive how the codebase fits together from scratch - no map of what calls what, no way to know what breaks when something changes, and no memory of decisions made in past sessions.

**The solution:** RemembrallMCP gives the agent the whole codebase - a field-aware dependency graph (functions, classes, methods, **fields**, and the references between them) across 9 languages, plus persistent memory that survives between sessions.

**1. Field-Aware Code Graph** - A live map of your codebase built with tree-sitter. Functions, classes, methods, and data fields, plus call, import, defines, inherits, and field-reference relationships across 9 languages. Ask "what breaks if I change this?" - down to a single struct field - and get an answer in milliseconds, before the agent touches anything.

**2. Persistent Memory** - Decisions, patterns, and organizational knowledge that survive between sessions. Hybrid semantic + full-text search finds relevant context instantly.

```
remembrall_recall("authentication middleware patterns")
-> 3 relevant memories from past sessions

remembrall_index("/path/to/project", "myapp")
-> Builds dependency graph: 847 symbols, 1,203 relationships

remembrall_impact("AuthMiddleware", direction="upstream")
-> 12 files depend on AuthMiddleware (with confidence scores)

remembrall_impact("amount", direction="upstream")
-> methods that read self.amount, across the whole codebase

remembrall_store("Switched from JWT to session tokens because...")
-> Decision stored for future sessions
```

### Why the code graph matters

Without RemembrallMCP, agents explore your codebase from scratch every session. Claude Code spawns `Explore` agents, Codex reads dozens of files, Cursor greps through directories - all burning tokens and time just to understand what calls what. A single "find all callers of this function" task can cost thousands of tokens across multiple tool calls.

With RemembrallMCP, that same query is a single `remembrall_impact` call that returns in <1ms with zero exploration tokens. The dependency graph is already built and waiting.

| | Without RemembrallMCP | With RemembrallMCP |
|---|---|---|
| "What calls UserService?" | Agent greps, reads 8-15 files, spawns sub-agents | `remembrall_impact` - 1 call, <1ms |
| "Where is auth middleware defined?" | Agent globs, reads matches, filters | `remembrall_lookup_symbol` - 1 call, <1ms |
| "Who references the `amount` field?" | Agent greps for `self.amount`, misses ORM and cross-module usages | `remembrall_impact` - 1 call, <1ms |
| "What did we decide about caching?" | Agent has no context, asks you | `remembrall_recall` - 1 call, ~25ms |
| Typical exploration cost | 5,000-20,000 tokens per question | ~200 tokens (tool call + response) |

The savings scale with codebase size. On a small project, an agent can grep and read its way through. On a 500-file monorepo, that exploration becomes the bottleneck - agents hit context limits, spawn multiple sub-agents, or miss cross-module dependencies entirely. RemembrallMCP's graph queries stay under 10ms regardless of project size because the structure is pre-indexed in Postgres, not discovered at runtime.

This is the difference between an agent that reads a few pages out of the book every time and one that already holds the whole codebase.

### Benchmarks

RemembrallMCP is currently benchmarked on two surfaces:

- **Agent productivity on code tasks** - Tested on [pallets/click](https://github.com/pallets/click) v8.1.7 (594 symbols, 1,589 relationships). Five identical coding tasks run with and without RemembrallMCP. [Full report](benchmarks/reports/benchmark-2026-04-02.md).
- **Memory recall quality** - Local recall harness run against 31 ground-truth queries covering search quality, filtering, edge cases, ranking, and latency.

| Metric | Without RemembrallMCP | With RemembrallMCP | Delta |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Total tool calls (5 tasks) | 112 | 5 | **-95.5%** |
| Estimated tokens | ~56,000 | ~1,000 | **-98.2%** |
| Avg tool calls per question | 22.4 | 1.0 | **-95.5%** |

The savings compound on larger codebases. Click is ~90 files - on a 500+ file monorepo, agents without RemembrallMCP need proportionally more exploration calls, while graph queries stay under 10ms regardless of size.

| Memory Recall Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Queries passed | **31 / 31** |
| Recall@5 | **0.917** |
| Precision@5 | **0.619** |
| MRR | **0.908** |
| p95 latency | **14ms** |

## Requirements

- Docker (for the easiest setup) or PostgreSQL 16 with [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector)
- For GitHub ingestion: [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) installed and authenticated

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker Compose (easiest)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roboticforce/remembrallmcp.git
cd remembrallmcp

# Start Postgres, initialize the schema, download the embedding model,
# and run the MCP server. The remembrall container stays up after setup.
docker compose up -d

# Verify it's running (database connected, schema ready)
docker compose exec remembrall remembrall status
```

That's it. Postgres with pgvector, the schema, and the embedding model are all set up automatically. The database and model cache persist across restarts.

The `remembrall` container runs `remembrall init` (idempotent setup) followed by `remembrall serve` on startup, so it stays running and `docker compose exec` works for status, doctor, and other commands.

To connect an MCP client (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) to the server, see [Connect to your MCP client](#connect-to-your-mcp-client) below.

### Option 2: Download prebuilt binary

```bash
# macOS (Apple Silicon)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/roboticforce/remembrallmcp/releases/latest/download/remembrall-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz | tar xz
sudo mv remembrall /usr/local/bin/

# Linux (x86_64)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/roboticforce/remembrallmcp/releases/latest/download/remembrall-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz | tar xz
sudo mv remembrall /usr/local/bin/

# Initialize (sets up Postgres via Docker, creates schema, downloads model)
remembrall init
```

### Option 3: Build from source (requires Rust 1.94+)

```bash
cargo build -p remembrall-server --release
# Binary is at target/release/remembrall

remembrall init
```

### Connect to your MCP client

#### Codex

Codex uses the same MCP server definition format. Register the server as `remembrall` and point it at either the installed binary or your local release build.

**If `remembrall` is installed in `PATH`:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remembrall": {
      "command": "remembrall"
    }
  }
}
```

**If running from a local source checkout:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remembrall": {
      "command": "/path/to/remembrallmcp/target/release/remembrall",
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URL": "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5450/remembrall"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**If using Docker Compose from Codex:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remembrall": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["compose", "-f", "/path/to/remembrallmcp/docker-compose.yml", "run", "--rm", "-T", "remembrall"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Codex after adding the server so it reconnects and loads the tools.

#### Claude Code, Cursor, and other MCP clients

Add to your project's `.mcp.json` (works with Claude Code, Cursor, and any MCP-compatible client).

**If using a prebuilt binary or built from source:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remembrall": {
      "command": "remembrall"
    }
  }
}
```

**If using Docker Compose:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remembrall": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["compose", "-f", "/path/to/remembrallmcp/docker-compose.yml", "run", "--rm", "-T", "remembrall"]
    }
  }
}
```

Each invocation starts a fresh container, runs `remembrall init` (idempotent; its output goes to stderr so it never corrupts the MCP stream), then `remembrall serve` over stdio. The `-T` flag is required - it disables TTY allocation so JSON-RPC passes through cleanly. The `db` service starts automatically via `depends_on`.

**If running from source (not installed to PATH):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remembrall": {
      "command": "/path/to/remembrallmcp/target/release/remembrall",
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URL": "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5450/remembrall"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart your MCP client. All 9 tools will be available automatically.

### Try it

```
> "Store a memory: We chose Postgres over MongoDB because our query patterns
   are relational. Type: decision, tags: database, architecture"

> "Recall what we know about database decisions"

> "Index this project and show me the impact of changing UserService"
```

Scores measured against real open-source projects (Click, Gson, Axios, bat, Cobra, Sidekiq, Hono, Exposed, MediatR) using automated ground truth tests. The C# score is measured against MediatR 12.4.1 (69 symbols, 48 relationships, 9 impact queries, 10 edge cases): symbols, imports, and edge cases at 100%, with the gap coming from generic-interface inheritance (`: IPipelineBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>` resolves to a synthetic UUID instead of the class symbol) and a field-dispatch call misresolution. C# field-level references are validated separately by the field-capture fixture at 100%.

## Cold Start

A new RemembrallMCP instance has no knowledge. Use the ingestion tools to bootstrap from existing project history.

**From GitHub PR history:**

```
> remembrall_ingest_github repo="myorg/myrepo" limit=100
```

Fetches merged PRs via `gh`, digests titles and bodies into memories, and tags them by project. PRs with less than 50 characters of body are skipped. Deduplication by content fingerprint prevents re-ingestion on repeat runs.

**From markdown docs:**

```
> remembrall_ingest_docs path="/path/to/project"
```

Walks the directory tree, finds all `.md` files, splits them by H2 section headers, and stores each section as a searchable memory. Skips `node_modules`, `.git`, `target`, and similar directories. Good for README, ARCHITECTURE, ADRs, and any written docs.

Run both once per project. After ingestion, `remembrall_recall` has immediate context.
