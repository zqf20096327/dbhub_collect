## 🏗️ Architecture & System Design

SoulPlayer follows a classic **Model-View-Template (MVT)** architecture utilized by Django, augmented with **ASGI (Daphne)** for asynchronous operations, **Django Channels** for real-time WebSocket communication, and vanilla JavaScript for asynchronous frontend operations (AJAX) to maintain a seamless, single-page-application feel during media playback.

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand Architectural Flow</b></summary>

1. **Client Layer (The Browser):** Renders the UI using HTML rendered by Django Templates and Tailwind CSS for styling. Global event listeners capture media playback actions.
2. **Asynchronous Handlers (Vanilla JS `fetch` APIs):** When a user plays a song, the global `audio` element begins streaming the buffer. Simultaneously, an invisible `/record_play/<id>/` POST request is fired to the backend, complete with explicit CSRF token verification, to track user listening history.
3. **WebSocket Layer (Django Channels + Redis):** Real-time features like Live Listening Rooms use WebSocket connections managed by Django Channels with a Redis channel layer. This enables synchronized audio playback, live chat, and song change notifications across all connected clients.
4. **Routing Layer (`music/urls.py`):** Django's URL dispatcher routes incoming REST-like endpoints and standard GET requests to the appropriate controller views. WebSocket routes are handled separately via `music/routing.py`.
5. **Controller Layer (`music/views.py`):** Handles the core business logic. 
    - Queries the database via the Django ORM.
    - Processes Natural Language queries through the `spaCy` NLP engine.
    - Interfaces with the JioSaavn API for external music streaming.
    - Makes external calls to the Google/YouTube Data API for podcast ingestion.
6. **External API Layer (`music/jiosavan.py`):** A dedicated service module that wraps the unofficial JioSaavn API for song search, trending charts, song details, suggestions, and streaming URLs. Implements intelligent caching via Django's cache framework, quality selection for audio and images, and multi-tier fallback strategies for trending content.
7. **Data Layer (`models.py` & SQLite Database):** Stores the relational mapping of Users, UserProfiles (1-to-1 User mapping), Artists, Songs, Playlists (Many-to-Many relationships), and ListeningRooms for collaborative sessions.

## 🌟 Core Features Deep-Dive

### 1. 🎙️ Natural Language Voice Search (NLP)
Instead of forcing users to explicitly filter by artist or genre, SoulPlayer integrates **spaCy**, an industry-level Natural Language Processing library.
* **How it works:** When a user searches *"play some romantic arijit singh songs"*, the NLP pipeline intercepts the query. It categorizes grammatical tokens, actively stripping out stop words (*"some", "songs", "play"*) to isolate target keywords. It then routes the request intelligently—if it finds an exact song match, it auto-plays it. If it finds an artist match, it redirects to the Artist Portfolio.
* **Voice Search UI:** A dedicated full-screen voice search interface (`/voice_search/`) uses the Web Speech API for browser-native speech recognition. It features animated ripple effects, real-time audio visualizer bars, and auto-submission to the NLP search pipeline upon voice capture.

### 2. 🎧 Real-Time Listening Rooms (Live Jams)
SoulPlayer features collaborative listening rooms powered by **Django Channels** and **Redis**, enabling synchronized music experiences across multiple users.
* **WebSocket Architecture:** Uses `ListeningRoomConsumer` for real-time bidirectional communication. Events include `play`, `pause`, `change_song`, and `chat` actions, all broadcast to every connected client in the room group.
* **Host/Guest Model:** The room creator (host) has full playback controls—play, pause, seek, and search for new tracks. Guests receive synchronized audio state updates with a 2-second tolerance threshold for seamless sync.
* **Live In-Room Chat:** Real-time text chat alongside synchronized music playback. System messages announce join/leave events. Chat UI features self/other message styling with avatar initials and timestamps.
* **Room Management:** Rooms are created with unique 6-character alphanumeric codes. Hosts can search and swap tracks mid-session using an in-room JioSaavn search interface that updates the backend and notifies all guests.
* **Lobby Interface:** A premium glass-morphism lobby (`/jam/lobby/`) allows users to create new rooms or join existing ones via room codes.

### 3. 🎵 JioSaavn API Integration
SoulPlayer integrates with the unofficial JioSaavn API to provide access to millions of songs without requiring any API keys.
* **Song Search & Streaming:** Search across JioSaavn's entire catalog and stream songs directly at up to 320kbps quality. Results are normalized into a consistent format and seamlessly integrated into the SoulPlayer UI.
* **Trending Charts:** Fetches songs from official JioSaavn chart playlists (Top 50 Hindi, Trending Today, Bollywood Hits) with deduplication and intelligent fallback to curated search queries if playlist endpoints fail.
* **Trending Today:** A dedicated "Trending Today" section that dynamically discovers and fetches the official JioSaavn "Trending Today" playlist, cached for 30 minutes for optimal performance.
* **Song Suggestions:** "Up Next" recommendations powered by JioSaavn's suggestion engine, displayed on the full-screen player with smooth navigation between suggested tracks.
* **Playlist Integration:** JioSaavn songs can be added to user playlists directly from search results or trending sections via a context menu. Songs are synced to the local database on first interaction.
* **Caching Layer:** All trending data is cached using Django's cache framework (Redis in production, in-memory for development) with configurable TTLs (1 hour for trending, 30 minutes for Trending Today, 24 hours for playlist IDs).

### 4. 🎶 Premium Music Player & State Management
The project features a sleek, global bottom-bar player and a dedicated Full-Screen View (`/play_song/<id>`).
* **Design:** Utilizes modern "Glassmorphism" paradigms (blur backdrops, semi-transparent gradients, glowing accents).
* **DOM APIs:** Interacts deeply with the HTML5 `<audio>` API to calculate track duration, current timestamp precision, and smooth slider tracking.
* **Dual Source Playback:** Seamlessly handles both local library songs (uploaded files/external links) and JioSaavn streamed content with unified controls.
* **Previous/Next Navigation:** Intelligent navigation supporting both local song sequences and JioSaavn suggestion chains, with automatic song-end transition to the next track.

### 5. 🔄 Background Sync & User Profiles
We utilize Django Signals (`post_save`) to automatically attach an extended `UserProfile` model to every new user registration.
* **History Tracking:** JavaScript asynchronous `fetch` requests bypass the need for full page reloads. As users listen to tracks (both local and JioSaavn), their `played_songs` Many-To-Many relationship is updated silently in the background via dedicated `/record_play/` and `/record_play_jiosaavn/` endpoints.
* **JioSaavn Song Sync:** When a JioSaavn song is played or added to a playlist for the first time, it is automatically synced to the local database with all metadata (title, artist, duration, image, stream URL, JioSaavn ID).
* **Dashboard:** Users have a dedicated customizable Profile page featuring listening history, favorite artist collections, tracks played stats, and profile editing capabilities.
* **Favorite Artists:** Users can toggle favorite/follow status on artist detail pages, which appears on their profile dashboard.

### 6. 🎙️ YouTube Podcast Integration
SoulPlayer isn't just limited to local database music. It uses the `requests` library to interface with the **YouTube Data API v3**. It dynamically queries YouTube for high-quality music podcasts, parses the incoming JSON, and renders fully playable media cards directly within the SoulPlayer UI.

### 7. 🎨 Premium UI/UX Design
* **Hero Carousel:** An auto-sliding 3-slide hero section with manual navigation arrows, dot indicators, and pause-on-hover functionality.
* **Infinite Scroll Cards:** Moods & Genres and Popular Artists sections feature CSS-animated auto-scrolling card strips with pause-on-hover.
* **Global Sidebar:** A shared sidebar across all pages via Django context processors, showing playlists, recent songs, and navigation links including the Live Jams feature with a pulsing broadcast icon.
* **Responsive Layout:** Full desktop layout with sidebar, top navigation, and bottom player bar. Mobile-optimized with responsive breakpoints.
* **Add to Playlist:** Context menu dropdown for adding JioSaavn songs to user playlists directly from any song card.

### 8. 🤖 Machine Learning Recommendation Engine
SoulPlayer features a hybrid, personalized recommendation pipeline designed to analyze listening habits and song features.
* **Hybrid Recommender System:** Blends Content-Based Filtering (using TF-IDF on genres, tags, and artists) and Collaborative Filtering (analyzing patterns from mathematically similar users). 
* **Prioritized Engine Logic:** Implements a multi-tier fallback: Cache → Real-time Hybrid calculation → Trending/Popularity fallback (for cold-start new users).
* **Asynchronous Training:** Features a dedicated `train_recommendations` background command to pre-compute and store heavy vector math in the database.
* **Made For You Interface:** A premium glassmorphism "Recommended" interface dynamically serving AI-curated feeds to listeners.

### 9. 🕶️ 3D Immersive XR Studio (Three.js)
SoulPlayer escapes the flat 2D player limitation with a full 3D interactive WebGL environment using **Three.js**.
* **True 3D Audio-Reactive World:** 360° mouse look-around camera controls (OrbitControls) drops users onto a reflective grid floor with 64 dynamic frequency pillars, floating particles, and a central deforming orb. Web Audio API live-analyzes track frequencies to dynamically warp geometries and scale lights.
* **Cinematic Genre Themes:** 9 custom environmental themes (Cosmic, Romance, Pop, Rock, Hip-Hop, Indie, EDM, Classical, Lo-Fi) that alter sky gradients, lighting colors, fog densities, and waveform aesthetics.
* **Auto Genre Detection:** The engine parses metadata keywords ("metal", "dj", "acoustic", etc.) upon playing a track and automatically switches the 3D environment's theme to match the vibe.
* **Live In-World JioSaavn Search:** Fully functional in-world floating UI that lets users search the entire music catalog and enqueue tracks without terminating the 3D WebGL context.

### 10. Offline-First Music Experience with JavaScript Service Worker–Powered Browser Side Caching
Browser-side caching and offline functionality using JavaScript Service Workers significantly enhance the performance and resilience of a web application. A Service Worker acts as a background proxy between the browser and the network, intercepting requests and caching essential assets such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and media content like songs. This enables faster load times by serving cached resources instantly, reducing dependency on network latency. Additionally, it allows users to download songs and store them locally within the browser cache, making them accessible even when the user is offline or experiencing poor connectivity. By implementing strategies like Cache First or Network Falling Back to Cache, developers can ensure a seamless user experience where music playback continues uninterrupted regardless of network conditions, effectively bringing native app-like reliability to web applications.

### 11. 🤝 Collaborative Playlists (Real-Time)
SoulPlayer enables users to collaborate on playlists in real-time, powered by a dedicated `PlaylistConsumer` WebSocket consumer.
* **Invite System:** Playlist owners generate unique, secure invite tokens (`secrets.token_urlsafe`). Invite links are shared via the native **Web Share API** on mobile (triggering WhatsApp, Instagram, Messages, etc.) or a premium glassmorphism modal on desktop with direct share buttons for WhatsApp, Telegram, X/Twitter, and Email.
* **WebSocket Architecture:** A dedicated `PlaylistConsumer` handles four event types: `song_added`, `collaborator_joined`, `collaborator_removed`, and `presence_update`. Views broadcast mutations via `channel_layer.group_send()` → Redis → WebSocket → Browser, keeping permissions centralized in HTTP views.
* **Real-Time UI Updates:** When a collaborator adds a song, a new row animates into the song table instantly (no page refresh). Animated toast notifications slide in from the bottom-right for all events: song additions, collaborator joins, and presence indicators.
* **Visual Indicators:** Collaborative playlists display a shimmer-animated "Collaborative" badge, overlapping color-coded avatar circles (owner with crown badge), and collaborator count. On the library page, shared playlists show a "Shared by @username" label.
* **Permission Model:** Collaborators can add songs (both local and JioSaavn). Only the playlist owner can remove songs, remove collaborators (via ✕ button on avatars), and generate invite links.

---

### 12. 🎟️ Live Concerts & Events Discovery (Ticketmaster API)
SoulPlayer integrates with the **Ticketmaster Discovery API v2** to offer users real-time information on live concerts and tours.
* **Discovery Hub:** A dedicated `/live-events/` page features a premium glassmorphism design where users can search for events by keyword, artist, or city.
* **API Architecture:** The `ticketmaster_api.py` module acts as a wrapper for the external API. It parses raw JSON into normalized, template-friendly dictionaries containing event dates, venues, high-res images, and ticket prices.
* **Smart Caching:** To respect rate limits and improve performance, all Ticketmaster API calls are routed through Django's caching layer with a 5-minute TTL.
* **Artist Synergy:** When users view an Artist's portfolio page, a background API call fetches and displays that specific artist's upcoming global tour dates, creating a unified music ecosystem.

## 🚀 Installation & Local Setup

To run SoulPlayer locally on your machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudra00434/SoulPlayer.git
cd SoulPlayer
cd SPOTIFY
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv

# For Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# For macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download the spaCy NLP Model
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### 5. Environment Variables Configuration
Create a file named `.env` in the same directory as `manage.py`.
```env
# Required for Podcast fetching module:
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here

# Optional: For production Redis caching & Channels
REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379

# Optional: For production deployment (auto-disables DEBUG)
# RENDER=true
```

### 6. Run Database Migrations
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. Initialize Admin Account
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 8. Run the Development Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You can log into the admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` to add Artists, Songs, and Categories manually.

> 💡 **Note:** For Live Listening Rooms to work locally, you need Redis running on your machine. Install Redis and ensure it's running on `redis://127.0.0.1:6379`. Without Redis, the app will still function but the Jam Rooms feature will not be available.

---

## ☁️ Deployment Architecture (Render)

SoulPlayer utilizes a custom deployment flow designed specifically for PaaS providers like **Render.com**.

The application uses an automated `build.sh` script to handle production environments. Instead of manually SSHing into the server to install dependencies, the script:
1. Installs Python packages via `pip`.
2. Downloads the heavy `spaCy` NLP model binaries to the production server.
3. Automatically maps static assets via `collectstatic` for the `Whitenoise` middleware to serve.
4. Executes zero-downtime Django database migrations via `migrate`.

**Infrastructure Details:**
* **ASGI Server:** Daphne (supports both HTTP and WebSocket protocols)
* **Static File Serving:** Whitenoise (Configured in `settings.py`)
* **Channel Layer:** Redis (via `channels-redis`) for WebSocket communication
* **Caching:** Redis for JioSaavn API response caching

> ⚠️ **Limitation Warning:** If utilizing ephemeral free-tier instances (like Render Free Web Services), local media assets (User uploaded MP3s and JPGs located in `/media/`) will be purged upon container sleep. A permanent production scale-up requires migrating the `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` to an **AWS S3** bucket or **Cloudinary**.
