## ✨ What it does

- 🎧 Scans local folders recursively into SQLite with incremental refresh and exclusions.
- 📚 Browses Tracks, Albums, Artists, Album Artists, Lyrics Browser, and Lyrics Activity.
- 📝 Edits synced (`.lrc`) and plain lyrics, with unsaved drafts and playback highlighting.
- 🌐 Downloads through an ordered provider matrix; LRCLIB is enabled by default.
- 💾 Exports `.lrc` / `.txt` sidecars and embeds lyrics into supported formats.
- 🤖 Provides local AI Auto Sync with CUDA when available and CPU fallback.
- 🎨 Includes playback controls, themes, keyboard shortcuts, logs, and responsive layouts.

Provider settings are opt-in: a disabled provider is never used as an automatic
fallback. See [Musixmatch provider notes](docs/MULTI_PROVIDER_MUSIXMATCH.md).
When enough lyrics already exist on the same album, language detection can
reject a confidently mismatched provider result instead of saving it.

## 📸 Screenshots

Add final captures under `docs/screenshots/`. The following views are the most
useful for the project page and release notes:

| File | What to capture | Why it is useful |
|---|---|---|
| `tracks-light.png` | Light theme, selected track, library table, and lyrics panel. | Main product view and light-theme readability. |
| `tracks-dark.png` | The same view in the Dark theme. | Theme support and normal navigation hierarchy. |
| `lyrics-editor.png` | Synced editor with timestamps, toolbar, and player bar. | Core editing workflow. |
| `empty-lyrics.png` | Missing-lyrics state with provider actions visible. | First-run/download experience. |
| `settings-providers.png` | Provider matrix with LRCLIB/Musixmatch settings. | Provider configuration and disabled-provider behavior. |
| `settings-appearance.png` | Appearance settings with theme and page-size controls. | Customization and indexed table pagination. |
| `responsive-narrow.png` | Narrow window with compact actions and lyrics pane. | Responsive layout and overflow actions. |
| `clear-lyrics.png` | Clear Lyrics dialog with grouped TXT/LRC options. | Safe cleanup and embedded-lyrics controls. |

When the captures are ready, add the image links below this table. Keep the
images inside the repository so the README also renders offline:

## 🚀 Quick start

```powershell
py -3.13 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python --version  # must report Python 3.13.15
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
python main.py
```

The project is pinned to Python 3.13.15 for development, AI setup, tests, and
release builds. The app does not modify a music folder during normal scanning;
exports and embedding are explicit user actions.

## 🤖 Optional AI Auto Sync

```powershell
python -m pip install -e ".[ai]"
```

The packaged app can install the AI stack into its own runtime. WhisperX
supports the multilingual path; `lyrics-aligner` is used for English when it
is available. CUDA is selected automatically when available, but GPU is not
guaranteed to be faster for every backend.

If the bootstrap interpreter must be selected explicitly:

```powershell
$env:PYLRCGET_AI_BOOTSTRAP_PYTHON = "C:\Path\to\python.exe"
```

Optional Demucs is used only as a candidate vocal-stem path and is not
required for the base AI workflow.

## 🌐 Lyrics providers

| Provider | Default | Notes |
|---|:---:|---|
| LRCLIB | Yes | Download, search, and publish support. |
| Musixmatch | No | Website transport needs no key; official API accepts a user-provided key. |

Enable and order providers in `Settings -> Lyrics -> Providers`. Provider
matching uses artist, title, album, duration, and version metadata. Full
transport limitations are documented in
[docs/MULTI_PROVIDER_MUSIXMATCH.md](docs/MULTI_PROVIDER_MUSIXMATCH.md).

## 🎼 Supported audio formats

| Format | Scan | Lyrics read/write | Sidecar export |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| MP3, WAV | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| M4A / MP4 | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| FLAC, OGG / OGA, OPUS | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| WMA / ASF | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| DSF, DFF, MPC / Musepack | Yes | Yes | Yes |

Playback depends on the active backend and installed codecs. Metadata support
can be broader than playback support for a specific format.

## ⚙️ Important settings

| Area | Examples |
|---|---|
| Library | Music folders, exclusions, worker count, scan source, startup view |
| Lyrics | Download mode, provider order, sidecars, embedding, filename pattern |
| AI Sync | Device, language, fuzzy matching, optional Demucs candidate |
| Appearance | Theme, UI scale, font size, album art |
| Shortcuts | Global playback keys and lyrics-editor keys |

Download modes are `Prefer synced`, `Synced only`, and `Plain only`. Export
and embedding format choices are configured independently from download mode.

## ⚡ Performance and design notes

The scanner separates audio and sidecar state, reuses stored metadata for
unchanged audio, and avoids unnecessary Mutagen and sidecar reads. LRCLIB
bulk work uses batched metadata reads, bounded concurrency, duplicate lookup
collapse, and shared rate-limit coordination.

See the [benchmark summary](benchmarks/RESULTS_SUMMARY.md) for measured
results, known trade-offs, and the TagLib decision. The benchmark harnesses
are documented in [tools/perf/README.md](tools/perf/README.md) and
[tools/ai_sync_bench/README.md](tools/ai_sync_bench/README.md).

## 🛠️ Development

Run the test suite and static checks from the repository root:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
python -m pytest
ruff check .
```

Useful focused commands:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests/widgets_navigation -q
python tools/perf/benchmark_lrclib.py --tracks 250 --duplicate-every 5 --warmups 2 --runs 3
```

Performance fixtures and benchmark output are generated under `benchmarks/`;
do not point a mutating benchmark at a real music folder. Read-only source
measurements must use the harness `--read-only-source` option.

## 📦 Building locally

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt pyinstaller
pyinstaller --noconfirm pylrcget.spec
```

For the portable single-file build:

```powershell
pyinstaller --noconfirm pylrcget-portable.spec
```

## 🧭 Releases and troubleshooting

Releases use Conventional Commits and semantic-release. See
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for published changes.

- **No lyrics found:** check provider enablement/order and the track metadata.
- **AI dependencies missing:** use the AI setup dialog or install the `ai` extra with Python 3.13.15.
- **Playback issue:** verify the backend and codec support for the file format.
- **Windows SmartScreen warning:** release executables are currently unsigned.
