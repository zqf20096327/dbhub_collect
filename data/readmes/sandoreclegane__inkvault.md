**A long-term memory you own: rescue what Pieces knew about you, keep every Claude Code and Codex session and the
pages you open in your browser from here on, and search all of it from your AI tools.**

Your working memory is scattered across tools that don't keep it. Pieces for Developers shut down on September 27,
2026. Claude Code deletes your sessions after 30 days. Codex keeps them in files nobody reads twice. Your browser
forgets what you read after about 90 days.

InkVault gathers all of it into one file on your machine: your Pieces memory, rescued once, and your conversations
with Claude Code, Codex and the Claude desktop app and the history of the browser profiles you choose, added every
night. It makes the whole thing searchable by your AI
tools and draws it as a private dashboard. InkVault itself does not upload your archive. If you connect an AI client,
memories returned to that client may be sent to its model provider under that client's settings.

**Coming from Pieces?** Rescue your memory while PiecesOS still runs (read-only now, and gone once you uninstall it):

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/sandoreclegane/inkvault inkvault rescue
```

**Never used Pieces?** Start a vault from your Claude Code and Codex sessions and your browser history alone (in a
terminal, it first asks which browser profiles are yours):

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/sandoreclegane/inkvault inkvault sync
```

Either way, add [`inkvault schedule`](#keep-it-up-to-date) and the vault keeps growing on its own. All it needs is
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### The vault keeps learning

Every night, InkVault reads the session files Claude Code and Codex already keep on disk, and the history of the
browser profiles you chose, and copies in what's new: what you asked, what the assistant answered, what each session
was called, and which pages you opened. Your AI tools can then search what they helped you with, and what you were
reading, last month or last year, long after the original files are gone.

- **Claude Code**: every project, from `~/.claude/projects`. Kept past its 30-day cleanup.
- **Codex**: every session it saved, from `~/.codex/sessions`.
- **Claude desktop app** (agent mode, Windows): including prompts only its audit log kept.
- **Your browsers**: Chrome, Edge, Comet, Brave, Arc, Vivaldi, Opera and Firefox, only the profiles you say are yours
  ([how](#your-browser-history)). Kept past the browser's own cleanup.

Only what's new since the last sync is added. Tool output and attachments are left out, and sign-in codes and
tokens are cleaned out of web addresses (see [Privacy](#privacy)).

### Rescuing from Pieces

**It takes a while.** PiecesOS hands records over at about 8 per second, so a year of captures (~100,000) takes
around 3-4 hours. Leave it running, or press **Ctrl+C** anytime: InkVault keeps everything saved so far and opens
a dashboard of what you have. Run the same command again later and it picks up where it left off.

## What you get

- **The vault**: everything PiecesOS will hand over (captures, summaries and their text, chats, snippets, tags,
  websites, people), saved as the raw records Pieces returned, so nothing is lost to interpretation. One SQLite file.
- **Search for your AI tools**: an MCP server with `search_memories` (keyword + meaning, merged), `timeline`
  ("what was I doing in March?"), `get_memory`, and `memory_stats`.
- **Memory Atlas**: a dashboard of your year. Active hours per day (hover a day for what it was about), when you work,
  how your projects connect, projects over time, topics over time (from Pieces' own topic tags: ongoing interests
  and short bursts), top apps and sites. Every chart has a table view.
- **Your Claude Code, Codex and Claude desktop sessions**: your prompts and the replies, side by side with your
  Pieces history, searchable as chats (named like `Claude Code · project: title`), and part of the timeline, the
  digests and the dashboard.
- **Your browser history** (new in 0.2.1): pages you opened in Chrome, Edge, Comet, Brave, Arc, Vivaldi, Opera or
  Firefox, from the browser profiles you say are yours. Browsers delete history after about 90 days; the vault
  keeps it. Searchable as `web`, on the timeline, in the digests and on the dashboard.
- **Daily digests** (optional): a 2-3 sentence summary of each day, written by a *local* model through
  [Ollama](https://ollama.com). Pieces stopped writing summaries; this picks up where it left off.

## Connect your AI tools

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude mcp add inkvault --scope user -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/sandoreclegane/inkvault inkvault serve
```

**Codex** (`~/.codex/config.toml`)

```toml
[mcp_servers.inkvault]
command = "uvx"
args = ["--from", "git+https://github.com/sandoreclegane/inkvault", "inkvault", "serve"]
```

**Hermes, Claude Desktop, and other MCP clients**: run `uvx --from git+https://github.com/sandoreclegane/inkvault inkvault serve` over stdio.

Then ask: *"What was I working on the week of March 10?"*, *"Find that retry helper I saved"*, *"When did I last look at the Stripe dashboard?"*

## Your browser history

A browser profile can belong to someone else, so InkVault reads none until you choose:

```bash
inkvault browsers
```

It lists every profile it finds (browser, name, signed-in email) and asks which are yours. `sync` and `rescue`
ask too when they find a new one; the nightly run never asks, and skips profiles you haven't chosen. If someone
else starts using a browser on this computer, run `inkvault browsers` again: InkVault notices a profile that was
replaced on Windows and macOS, and when a profile's signed-in account changes, but it can't always tell.

- `inkvault browsers --no "chrome/Profile 2" --forget` stops copying a profile and removes what was copied, even
  after the browser is uninstalled.
- `inkvault browsers --skip-site mybank.com` never keeps that site or its subdomains, and removes what's there.

Removing rebuilds search and the dashboard and deletes the digests for each removed visit's day (in UTC) and the day
either side. If it's interrupted, the next `inkvault sync`, `inkvault index` or nightly run finishes it, and search
stays off until then. It can't recall an answer your AI tool already received, or a dashboard tab that's already
open. The nightly backups still hold the removed visits until they rotate out (7 nights).

**What's kept:** each page's address and title, and when you opened it. Before anything is stored, InkVault
removes parts of addresses that carry sign-in codes, tokens, signed links, password-reset tokens, and your email
or username. Searches (`?q=…`) stay. This catches the common shapes, not every possible secret. Copying happens
while the browser runs, so the newest few visits can wait for the next sync.

Safari isn't supported yet (macOS blocks reading it without Full Disk Access).

## Keep it up to date

PiecesOS keeps capturing for as long as it runs on your computer. To pull in what's new every night and back up
your vault:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/sandoreclegane/inkvault inkvault schedule
```

This installs InkVault as a permanent `inkvault` command (with `uv tool install`, or updates an older one) and sets
up a nightly run at 03:00 with your system's own scheduler: Task Scheduler on Windows, launchd on macOS, a systemd
user timer (or cron) on Linux. If uv's tool folder isn't on your PATH, it tells you to run `uv tool update-shell`.

Each run exports new captures (if PiecesOS is running), copies new Claude Code and Codex sessions and new browser
history from the profiles you chose, and saves a dated copy of `vault.db` in `backups/` right after (the last 7 are
kept). Then it rebuilds search, writes new digests (if
Ollama is running) and rebuilds the dashboard. One step failing never stops the others. The computer is kept awake
while it runs (Windows and macOS). The export has a time budget: if a big backlog doesn't fit, the run stops
cleanly, backs up what it has, and the next night continues where it stopped.

`rescue` won't start while a nightly run is going; it tells you to try again. If a rescue is going when the nightly
run starts, the run waits for it (up to an hour); the rescue makes its own backup when it finishes.

`inkvault status` shows the schedule and how the last run went. It checks the scheduler itself, and says so if the
task was disabled, runs a different vault (there's one nightly run per computer user, so scheduling another vault
replaces it), or points at an InkVault install that's gone, and it flags a run that's overdue (none in 26 hours).
Each run is logged to `nightly.log` in your InkVault folder (or `nightly-fallback.log` next to it, if `nightly.log`
can't be written).

The schedule is tied to your vault folder, so if you rescued with `--home`, run `schedule` with the same `--home`.

If the computer is asleep or off at run time:

- **Windows** and **systemd** catch up when the computer is next on.
- **macOS** catches up after sleep, but not after a power-off.
- **cron** doesn't catch up.

The Windows task runs only while you're logged in. You can have the computer wake for the run:

- **Windows**: `schedule` asks. Your power plan must allow wake timers, and some laptops (Modern Standby) ignore them.
- **macOS**: `schedule` asks, then prints a one-time `sudo pmset repeat ...` command for you to run. It replaces any
  `pmset repeat` schedule you already have.
- **Linux**: a user timer can't wake the computer. systemd runs the timer while you're logged in;
  `loginctl enable-linger $USER` keeps it going always.

`inkvault schedule --at 02:30` picks another time, `--wake` or `--no-wake` skips the question, `--off` turns it off,
and `uv tool upgrade inkvault` updates InkVault.

| `inkvault nightly` | One refresh + backup now (what the schedule runs) |

## Privacy

This is your screen history, your chats, your browsing and your code. InkVault stores and searches your archive locally:

- Everything is stored in your app-data folder (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\InkVault`, `~/Library/Application Support/InkVault`,
  or `~/.local/share/inkvault`), or wherever `INKVAULT_HOME` points. Never inside the code folder.
- No telemetry, no accounts, no cloud.
- InkVault itself does not upload your archive. When you connect an AI client through MCP, memories returned to that
  client may be sent to its model provider under that client's settings. Choose your client and settings accordingly.
- Two things are downloaded: the search model (~130 MB from Hugging Face, once)
  and the dashboard's chart library (from cdnjs, when you open the page).
- Digests use Ollama on your own machine. Skip them with `--no-digest`.
- From Claude Code and Codex sessions, InkVault keeps what you typed, what the assistant replied and session titles.
  Claude Code's replies include its tool calls, so a file it wrote is kept as written. Tool output (files it read,
  command output), pasted images and attachments are left out: they are most of each file and where secrets tend
  to show up. That lowers the risk; it can't rule it out, since anything you typed or pasted as text is kept.
- Browser history is read only from the profiles you choose (`inkvault browsers`), from a copy of the browser's
  file. InkVault keeps each page's address and title and when you opened it, after removing parts of addresses
  that carry sign-in codes, tokens, signed links, reset tokens, or your email or username. It can't promise to catch
  every secret. `inkvault browsers --skip-site` and `--no … --forget` remove what you don't want kept.
- Captured text and page titles were written by other people, apps and websites. The MCP server tells your AI tool
  to treat them as data, not instructions.

**Back up your vault.** It is one file: `vault.db` in your InkVault folder. Everything else can be rebuilt from it
with `inkvault index`.

## Good to know

- **Your projects** on the dashboard are detected from recurring phrases in your session titles. To choose your own,
  create `themes.txt` in your InkVault folder with lines like `Website = website|landing page|stripe` and run
  `inkvault dashboard`.
- **Topics** come from the topic tags Pieces wrote on each session summary. *Ongoing* topics recur across months;
  *bursts* are concentrated in a few weeks. They appear after the next `inkvault index` (part of `rescue` and the
  nightly run). Thanks to Anthony at Pieces for the idea.
- **Claude Code and Codex sessions** are read from `~/.claude/projects` and `~/.codex/sessions` (or
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `CODEX_HOME` if you set them). `rescue` and the nightly run do this too; `inkvault sync`
  does it on its own, and works without Pieces. Only what's new since the last sync is read.
- **Claude desktop app sessions** (agent mode, Windows) are read from the app's own folder
  (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Claude_*\LocalCache\Roaming\Claude\local-agent-mode-sessions`) and named
  `Claude desktop · project: title`. On macOS and Linux they aren't read yet.
- **PiecesOS port**: InkVault reads the port PiecesOS saved in its own config (`.port.txt`), then the port that worked
  last time, then tries 39300 and 1000. To force a port, set `INKVAULT_PIECES_PORTS` or pass `--pieces-ports`
  (for the nightly run: `inkvault --pieces-ports 39301 schedule`).
- **Pieces' own export tool**: Pieces said they'd send one. Use it too; two copies are better than one. Support
  for importing its format into InkVault is planned.
- Tested on Windows with PiecesOS 12.6.2 and a vault of 120,000 captures. macOS and Linux should work;
  reports are welcome. `inkvault schedule` has been tested end to end on Windows; on macOS and Linux it is
  covered by automated tests only so far, so a report from a real Mac or Linux machine would help a lot.
