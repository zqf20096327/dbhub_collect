# InkVault

**Rescue your Pieces memory before it's gone, then search it from Claude, Codex, or any MCP client, and see it as a map of your year.**

Pieces for Developers shut down on September 27, 2026. PiecesOS still runs in read-only mode on your computer, and
your long-term memory is still inside it: every capture, session summary, chat and saved snippet. Once you
uninstall PiecesOS, it's gone.

InkVault copies all of it into a single file on your machine, makes it searchable by your AI tools, and draws it
as a private dashboard. Nothing is uploaded anywhere.

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/sandoreclegane/inkvault inkvault rescue
```

That's the whole thing. It needs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and PiecesOS running.

**It takes a while.** PiecesOS hands records over at about 8 per second, so a year of captures (~100,000) takes
around 3-4 hours. Leave it running, or press **Ctrl+C** anytime: InkVault keeps everything saved so far and opens
a dashboard of what you have. Run the same command again later and it picks up where it left off.

## What you get

- **The vault**: everything PiecesOS will hand over (captures, summaries and their text, chats, snippets, tags,
  websites, people), saved as the raw records Pieces returned, so nothing is lost to interpretation. One SQLite file.
- **Search for your AI tools**: an MCP server with `search_memories` (keyword + meaning, merged), `timeline`
  ("what was I doing in March?"), `get_memory`, and `memory_stats`.
- **Memory Atlas**: a dashboard of your year. Active hours per day (hover a day for what it was about), when you work,
  how your projects connect, projects over time, topics over time (from Pieces' own topic tags: ongoing interests
  and short bursts), top apps and sites. Every chart has a table view.
- **Your Claude Code and Codex sessions** (new in 0.2.0), and the Claude desktop app's agent-mode sessions: your
  prompts and the replies, copied from the session files these tools keep on disk, so the vault keeps growing after
  Pieces. Claude Code deletes sessions after 30 days by default; the vault keeps them. Searchable as chats, and on the dashboard and in the digests.
- **Daily digests** (optional): a 2-3 sentence summary of each day, written by a *local* model through
  [Ollama](https://ollama.com). Pieces stopped writing summaries; this picks up where it left off.

## Connect your AI tools

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude mcp add inkvault --scope user -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/sandoreclegane/inkvault inkvault serve
```

**Codex** (`~/.codex/config.toml`)

```toml
[mcp_servers.inkvault]
command = "uvx"
args = ["--from", "git+https://github.com/sandoreclegane/inkvault", "inkvault", "serve"]
```

**Hermes, Claude Desktop, and other MCP clients**: run `uvx --from git+https://github.com/sandoreclegane/inkvault inkvault serve` over stdio.

Then ask: *"What was I working on the week of March 10?"*, *"Find that retry helper I saved"*, *"When did I last look at the Stripe dashboard?"*

## Keep it up to date

PiecesOS keeps capturing for as long as it runs on your computer. To pull in what's new every night and back up
your vault:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/sandoreclegane/inkvault inkvault schedule
```

This installs InkVault as a permanent `inkvault` command (with `uv tool install`, or updates an older one) and sets
up a nightly run at 03:00 with your system's own scheduler: Task Scheduler on Windows, launchd on macOS, a systemd
user timer (or cron) on Linux. If uv's tool folder isn't on your PATH, it tells you to run `uv tool update-shell`.

Each run exports new captures (if PiecesOS is running), copies new Claude Code and Codex sessions, and saves a dated
copy of `vault.db` in `backups/` right after (the last 7 are kept). Then it rebuilds search, writes new digests (if
Ollama is running) and rebuilds the dashboard. One step failing never stops the others. The computer is kept awake
while it runs (Windows and macOS). The export has a time budget: if a big backlog doesn't fit, the run stops
cleanly, backs up what it has, and the next night continues where it stopped.

`rescue` won't start while a nightly run is going; it tells you to try again. If a rescue is going when the nightly
run starts, the run waits for it (up to an hour); the rescue makes its own backup when it finishes.

`inkvault status` shows the schedule and how the last run went. It checks the scheduler itself, and says so if the
task was disabled, runs a different vault (there's one nightly run per computer user, so scheduling another vault
replaces it), or points at an InkVault install that's gone, and it flags a run that's overdue (none in 26 hours).
Each run is logged to `nightly.log` in your InkVault folder (or `nightly-fallback.log` next to it, if `nightly.log`
can't be written).

The schedule is tied to your vault folder, so if you rescued with `--home`, run `schedule` with the same `--home`.

If the computer is asleep or off at run time:

- **Windows** and **systemd** catch up when the computer is next on.
- **macOS** catches up after sleep, but not after a power-off.
- **cron** doesn't catch up.

The Windows task runs only while you're logged in. You can have the computer wake for the run:

- **Windows**: `schedule` asks. Your power plan must allow wake timers, and some laptops (Modern Standby) ignore them.
- **macOS**: `schedule` asks, then prints a one-time `sudo pmset repeat ...` command for you to run. It replaces any
  `pmset repeat` schedule you already have.
- **Linux**: a user timer can't wake the computer. systemd runs the timer while you're logged in;
  `loginctl enable-linger $USER` keeps it going always.

`inkvault schedule --at 02:30` picks another time, `--wake` or `--no-wake` skips the question, `--off` turns it off,
and `uv tool upgrade inkvault` updates InkVault.

## Commands

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `inkvault rescue` | Export, index, digest (if Ollama is running), build and open the dashboard |
| `inkvault export` | Copy everything out of PiecesOS. Safe to stop and re-run: it only adds what's new |
| `inkvault sync` | Copy new Claude Code and Codex sessions into the vault, then rebuild search |
| `inkvault index` | Rebuild search |
| `inkvault digest [--model M] [--redo]` | Daily digests with a local model (default `qwen3.5:4b`) |
| `inkvault dashboard` | Rebuild and open the Memory Atlas |
| `inkvault serve` | Run the MCP server |
| `inkvault status` | What's in your vault and where it lives, plus the schedule and last nightly run |
| `inkvault schedule [--at HH:MM] [--wake\|--no-wake] [--off]` | Refresh and back up the vault every night |
| `inkvault nightly` | One refresh + backup now (what the schedule runs) |

## Privacy

This is your screen history, your chats and your code. InkVault is built so that none of it leaves your machine:

- Everything is stored in your app-data folder (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\InkVault`, `~/Library/Application Support/InkVault`,
  or `~/.local/share/inkvault`), or wherever `INKVAULT_HOME` points. Never inside the code folder.
- No telemetry, no accounts, no cloud.
- Two things are downloaded, and nothing of yours is uploaded: the search model (~130 MB from Hugging Face, once)
  and the dashboard's chart library (from cdnjs, when you open the page).
- Digests use Ollama on your own machine. Skip them with `--no-digest`.
- From Claude Code and Codex sessions, InkVault keeps what you typed, what the assistant replied and session titles.
  Claude Code's replies include its tool calls, so a file it wrote is kept as written. Tool output (files it read,
  command output), pasted images and attachments are left out: they are most of each file and where secrets tend
  to show up. That lowers the risk; it can't rule it out, since anything you typed or pasted as text is kept.
- Captured text was written by other people and apps. The MCP server tells your AI tool to treat it as data, not
  instructions.

**Back up your vault.** It is one file: `vault.db` in your InkVault folder. Everything else can be rebuilt from it
with `inkvault index`.

## Good to know

- **Your projects** on the dashboard are detected from recurring phrases in your session titles. To choose your own,
  create `themes.txt` in your InkVault folder with lines like `Website = website|landing page|stripe` and run
  `inkvault dashboard`.
- **Topics** come from the topic tags Pieces wrote on each session summary. *Ongoing* topics recur across months;
  *bursts* are concentrated in a few weeks. They appear after the next `inkvault index` (part of `rescue` and the
  nightly run). Thanks to Anthony at Pieces for the idea.
- **Claude Code and Codex sessions** are read from `~/.claude/projects` and `~/.codex/sessions` (or
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `CODEX_HOME` if you set them). `rescue` and the nightly run do this too; `inkvault sync`
  does it on its own, and works without Pieces. Only what's new since the last sync is read.
- **Claude desktop app sessions** (agent mode, Windows) are read from the app's own folder
  (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Claude_*\LocalCache\Roaming\Claude\local-agent-mode-sessions`) and named
  `Claude desktop · project: title`. On macOS and Linux they aren't read yet.
- **PiecesOS port**: InkVault reads the port PiecesOS saved in its own config (`.port.txt`), then the port that worked
  last time, then tries 39300 and 1000. To force a port, set `INKVAULT_PIECES_PORTS` or pass `--pieces-ports`
  (for the nightly run: `inkvault --pieces-ports 39301 schedule`).
- **Pieces' own export tool**: Pieces said they'd send one. Use it too; two copies are better than one. Support
  for importing its format into InkVault is planned.
- Tested on Windows with PiecesOS 12.6.2 and a vault of 120,000 captures. macOS and Linux should work;
  reports are welcome. `inkvault schedule` has been tested end to end on Windows; on macOS and Linux it is
  covered by automated tests only so far, so a report from a real Mac or Linux machine would help a lot.
