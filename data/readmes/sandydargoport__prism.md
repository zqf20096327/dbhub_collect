# Prism

**A subscription-free, self-hosted family dashboard that integrates with the tools you already use without becoming yet another system of record.**

Prism is a configurable family dashboard designed for large wall-mounted screens and handheld tablets. It connects to Google Calendar, Microsoft To Do, OneDrive, Apple iCloud (CalDAV), Kroger / Mariano's, and more, and surfaces the information your family actually needs in one place. Built for people who value privacy, hate subscriptions, and are comfortable with Docker.

## Quick start

<details>
<summary><b>Option 1: Clone and build (any platform)</b></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sandydargoport/prism.git
cd prism
bash scripts/install.sh
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Option 2: Pull pre-built image (includes Raspberry Pi / ARM64)</b></summary>

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sandydargoport/prism/master/docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sandydargoport/prism/master/.env.example
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up -d
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Option 3: Home Assistant add-on (no terminal, no certs)</b></summary>

In Home Assistant, go to **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on store**, open the **⋮** menu in the top right, choose **Repositories**, and paste:

```
https://github.com/sandydargoport/prism
```

Find **Prism** in the store, click **Install**, then **Start** on the Info tab. Postgres and Redis run inside the add-on container, and all state lives under Home Assistant's `/data` volume, so add-on updates and HA snapshots keep your family's history.

Add-ons are not distributed through HACS, so the custom-repository flow above is the install path. Options, data layout and troubleshooting: [`ha-app/README.md`](ha-app/README.md).

</details>

Open **<http://localhost:3000>** (on the Home Assistant add-on, use the port 3000 link in the add-on panel). A fresh install boots into the setup wizard, where you create family members and set each member's PIN (4 or 6 digits). The demo seed logs in with PIN `1234` for every account.

Full installation notes (HTTPS / Nginx cert prerequisite, Raspberry Pi notes, troubleshooting) are in the [install guide](https://sandydargoport.github.io/prism/getting-started/install/).

## Behind the project

I wanted a family dashboard that connected to the tools we already use and didn't require a monthly subscription. DAKboard is configurable but feels like a solo project that outgrew itself. Skylight is clean but fairly limited. Both offer free tiers that don't go very far, and the paid versions cost money on an ongoing basis. Open-source alternatives like MagicMirror², Homarr, and Home Assistant exist, but they're all built for somewhat different use cases.

The integrations reflect the tools my family actually uses: Microsoft To Do for tasks and shopping, Google Calendar for scheduling, OneDrive for photos, Open-Meteo / OpenWeatherMap for weather, Kroger online cart for groceries.

I'm not a software developer, but I work in a technical field where AI tools are increasingly central to how work gets done. This project was built entirely with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) — I directed requirements, design, and product decisions; Claude Code handled the implementation. I've done what I can to make this solid (CI pipeline, E2E tests, security policy), but I can't make guarantees I'm not qualified to make. Use reasonable judgment about what you expose to the internet.
