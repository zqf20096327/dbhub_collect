## What's New in v2.0.0 (September 20, 2026)

**Full Feature Parity Release** -- PAM is now fully in sync with the internal
production system. Every feature from months of real-world use is now public.

- **Core Identity System** -- Distills a complete profile of who the user is
  across all conversations. Pulls from curated memories, the OpenWebUI memory
  table, and archived databases. Updates incrementally rather than starting
  from scratch each time.
- **Automated Memory Maintenance** -- Background tasks reformat old memories,
  detect contradictions and updates, and link orphaned memories to their source
  conversations. Includes a backlog processor that deduplicates entries, fills
  in missing metadata, and re-ranks memory importance using the LLM.
- **Task Coordinator** -- Centralized scheduler replaces ad-hoc sleep loops.
  Proper concurrency control with per-database locking and LLM call gating.
  Detects user activity and waits until idle to run heavy work.
- **Vision Support** -- Precomputes image embeddings via a separate vision
  server so the main LLM does not need mmproj loaded. Caches embeddings for
  cross-turn injection. Works with llama.cpp, LM Studio, and any
  OpenAI-compatible embedding provider.
- **Cross-System Deduplication** -- When promoting short-term memories to
  long-term storage, checks for exact and semantic duplicates. Merges related
  memories instead of creating redundant copies.
- **Heartbeat-Based Idle Detection** -- The system respects when you are
  actively using it and delays heavy background tasks until you are idle.
- **New Utility Tools** -- Interactive model-specific memory deletion
  (pam_delete_model_memories.py), memory export to text files
  (export_memories.py), and MCP tool call filtering (filter_tool_calls.py).
- **Normalization Migration** -- One-time migration that normalizes user and
  model IDs for consistent multi-user isolation.

**Upgrade from v1.5.0:** Drop-in replacement. Replace your existing PAM files
with the new versions. The database schema is backward compatible.

## What's New in v1.5.0 (March 28, 2026)

**Major Architectural Rewrite: OpenWebUI-Native Integration**
- ✅ **OpenWebUI-first design** - AI Memory System now deeply integrated into OpenWebUI via plugin (primary deployment method)
- ✅ **Advanced short-term memory** - sophisticated memory extraction, filtering, and injection for chat conversations
- ✅ **User ID & Model ID isolation** - strict multi-tenant support with configurable enforcement for security and tracking
- ✅ **Complete system portability** - all hardcoded paths replaced with environment variables (works anywhere)
- ✅ **Generic class names** - removed all Friday-specific branding (FridayMemorySystem → AIMemorySystem)
- ✅ **Production-ready** - enhanced error handling, validation, and logging throughout

**Upgrade from v1.1.0:** See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for migration guide.

## � Important: User ID & Model ID Requirements

**All memory operations require `user_id` and `model_id` parameters for data isolation and tracking.**

This ensures:
- ✅ **Multi-user safety** - Each user's memories are completely isolated
- ✅ **Model tracking** - Different AI models can maintain separate memories
- ✅ **Audit trail** - All operations are traceable to the user and model

### Configuration Options

By default, `user_id` and `model_id` are **required**. You can change this in `memory_config.json`:

```json
{
  "tool_requirements": {
    "require_user_id": true,
    "require_model_id": true,
    "default_user_id": "default_user",
    "default_model_id": "default_model"
  }
}
```

- `require_user_id/require_model_id: true` → Strict mode (recommended for production, security-focused, or multi-user systems)
- `require_user_id/require_model_id: false` → Use defaults instead (simpler for single-user/single-model setups)

### For AI Assistants: Auto-Fill in System Prompt

To make your AI automatically provide these values, add this to its **system prompt**:

```
When using memory system tools (store_memory, search_memories, etc.), 
ALWAYS include these parameters:
- user_id='your_user_identifier' (e.g., 'nate_user_1')
- model_id='your_model_name' (e.g., 'llama-2:7b' or 'gpt-4')

If the actual values are unknown, use safe defaults:
- user_id='default_user'
- model_id='default_model'

This isolates memories per user and tracks which AI model generated each memory.
```

### Examples

**With user_id and model_id:**
```python
# Memories are stored with full isolation
await system.store_memory(
    "User likes Python", 
    user_id="alice", 
    model_id="gpt-4"
)

# Search returns only this user's memories for this model
results = await system.search_memories(
    "programming", 
    user_id="alice", 
    model_id="gpt-4"
)
```

**Without strict requirements (if disabled):**
```python
# Uses defaults from memory_config.json
await system.store_memory("User likes Python")  # user_id="default_user", model_id="default_model"
```

See [API.md](API.md) for complete parameter documentation.

## �🔄 Integration Methods (Choose One)

### 1. OpenWebUI Plugin (Recommended)
**Primary deployment method** - Deep integration for sophisticated memory management:
- Deploy `ai_memory_short_term.py` as an OpenWebUI Function
- Automatically extracts memories from conversations
- Intelligently injects relevant memories before AI response
- Configurable memory scoring, filtering, and injection preferences
- No additional setup required beyond copying file into OpenWebUI Functions editor

**Installation:**
1. In OpenWebUI: **Settings → Functions → +New Function**
2. Paste entire `ai_memory_short_term.py` file
3. Set trigger to `Inlet` (runs before model response)
4. Configure memory preferences via function settings

### 2. MCP Server (Alternative Platforms)
Use with any MCP-compatible AI assistant (Claude, custom integrations, etc.):
```bash
# Via mcpo
python -m ai_memory_mcp_server

# Or make streamable for OpenWebUI's alternative integration
# (OpenWebUI supports both plugin and streamable MCP methods)
```

### 3. Standalone Library (Custom Implementations)
Use memory capabilities directly in your Python code:
```python
from ai_memory_core import AIMemorySystem
system = AIMemorySystem()
await system.store_memory("Important information", user_id="user1", model_id="model1")
results = await system.search_memories("query", user_id="user1", model_id="model1")
```
