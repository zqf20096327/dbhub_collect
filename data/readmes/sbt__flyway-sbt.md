## sbt plugin for [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org)

Welcome to the home for the sbt plugin for flyway. This project is based on the original 
[flyway-sbt](https://github.com/flyway/flyway/tree/flyway-4.2.0/flyway-sbt) that was in the flyway repository through 
version 4.2.1.

### Getting started

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.github.sbt/flyway-sbt_2.12_1.0)](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.github.sbt/flyway-sbt_2.12_1.0)

Adding Flyway to your build is very easy. First, update to your `project/plugin.sbt` file to include:

```sbt
 addSbtPlugin("com.github.sbt" % "flyway-sbt" % "x.y.z")
```
Please check out [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/github/sbt/flyway-sbt_2.12_1.0/) 
for versions of `flyway-sbt` for previous versions of Flyway.

Edit `build.sbt` to enable the plugin and configure the database access:
```sbt
enablePlugins(FlywayPlugin)
version := "0.0.1"
name := "flyway-sbt-test1"

libraryDependencies += "org.hsqldb" % "hsqldb" % "2.7.4"

flywayUrl := "jdbc:hsqldb:file:target/flyway_sample;shutdown=true"
flywayUser := "SA"
flywayPassword := ""
flywayLocations := Seq("filesystem:src/main/resources/db/migration")
Test/ flywayUrl := "jdbc:hsqldb:file:target/flyway_sample;shutdown=true"
Test/ flywayUser := "SA"
Test/ flywayLocations := Seq("filesystem:src/main/resources/db/migration")
Test/ flywayPassword := ""
```

Migrate your database using `sbt flywayMigrate` or clean it using `sbt flywayClean`.

To run flyway before any code generation, let compile depend on flywayMigrate

```scala
(Compile / compile) := ((Compile / compile) dependsOn flywayMigrate).value,
```

Note that the `flywayTarget` setting has been disabled due to [this bug](https://github.com/flyway/flyway/issues/1919).

## Maintenance
This repository is a community project and not officially maintained by the Flyway Team at Redgate.
This project is looked after only by the open source community. Community Maintainers are people who have agreed to be contacted with queries for support and maintenance.

### Building and testing
Build and testing uses `sbt` and it's plugin [testing framework](http://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Testing-sbt-plugins.html). 
The test cases are pretty basic (hint: we need more of those). There is no support for `sbt` prior to 1.0. Use the 
[legacy plugin](https://github.com/flyway/flyway/tree/master/flyway-sbt) instead.

Note that from v5.0.0 onwards, the plugin has to be explicitly enabled using `enablePlugins(FlywayPlugin)`. This prevents
Flyway actions triggering unrelated build activity and addresses [this issue](https://github.com/flyway/flyway/issues/1329).

Build and test the plugin using

```bash
sbt scripted
```

Early adopters should just publish a clone or fork of this repository locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sbt/flyway-sbt.git
cd flyway-sbt
sbt publishLocal
```
