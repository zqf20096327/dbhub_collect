## The Problem

Telegram is a great publishing tool — but it's a **walled garden**:

- Content is **invisible to Google**
- Old posts are **impossible to find**
- Readers **need the app** to see your work
- There's **no archive**, no search, no categories

## The Solution

Telepage bridges Telegram and the open web. Every post you publish becomes a searchable web page — automatically.

```
You post on Telegram  →  Webhook fires instantly  →  Card appears on your site
```

## Features

### ⚡ Real-Time Sync
Every new Telegram post appears on your site within seconds via webhooks. No cron jobs, no manual steps.

### 🤖 AI Auto-Tagging *(Optional)*
Connect a Google Gemini API key and every post gets automatic tags and a summary. Free tier available.

### 📜 History Scanner
Already have hundreds of posts? Import your entire archive — even years of past content — by scanning backwards through your channel's message history.

### 🏷️ Smart Tag Navigation
Hashtags in your Telegram posts become clickable, color-coded filters. `#recipe` becomes a tag. Readers browse by topic instantly.

### 🔍 Full-Text Search
Search across titles, descriptions, and AI summaries. Results update as you type.

### 🎨 Visual Themes
6 built-in themes (Dark, Ocean, Forest, Sunset, Rose, Slate) plus a full color picker. Change the look in one click.

### 📱 Mobile-First
Responsive card grid that works on phones, tablets, and desktops.

### 🔒 Isolated Sessions
Multiple Telepage installations on the same domain have completely separate admin sessions and credentials.

### 🌐 Multilingual
Interface in English, Italian, Spanish, French, and German.

## Requirements

| | Minimum |
|---|---|
| PHP | 8.1+ |
| Extensions | `pdo_sqlite`, `curl`, `mbstring`, `gd` |
| HTTPS | Required (Telegram webhooks mandate SSL) |
| Database | None — SQLite is built in |

Works on shared hosting (cPanel, Aruba, SiteGround). No root access required.

> **Note on folder structure:** Telepage is designed for standard shared hosting where users cannot change the document root. Sensitive files (`config.json`, `data/`) are protected via `.htaccess` rules. A `public/` folder structure is planned for environments that support it.
