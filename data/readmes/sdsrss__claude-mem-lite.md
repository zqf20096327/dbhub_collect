# claude-mem-lite

`claude-mem-lite` is a **persistent memory** (also called *long-term memory* or *cross-session context*) system for **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)** — Anthropic's CLI coding agent. It runs as an **[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server** plus a set of Claude Code hooks, automatically capturing coding observations, decisions, and bug fixes during sessions, then providing full-text search with query expansion to recall them later.

Compared to general-purpose LLM memory frameworks like [`mem0`](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) or the MCP reference [`memory`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory) server, claude-mem-lite is purpose-built for Claude Code's hook lifecycle: episode batching cuts LLM calls 7–10× vs the original [claude-mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem) (an estimated ~600× lower total cost — see the cost model below; this is an architecture estimate, not a measured benchmark), while the FTS5 retriever benchmarks at 0.90 Recall@10 / 0.85 Precision@10
(see [Search Quality](#search-quality) for the reproduction command).

> 中文简介：claude-mem-lite 是 Claude Code 的轻量级**持久化记忆 / 长期记忆 / 跨会话上下文**插件，基于 MCP 协议 + 钩子机制，自动捕获编码会话中的决策、修复和上下文，并通过 FTS5 全文检索召回。详见 [中文 README](README.zh-CN.md)。

Zero external services. Single SQLite database. Minimal overhead.

## Why claude-mem-lite?

A ground-up redesign of [claude-mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem), replacing its heavyweight architecture with a smarter, leaner approach.

### Architecture comparison

| | claude-mem (original) | claude-mem-lite |
|---|---|---|
| **LLM calls** | Every tool use triggers a Sonnet call | Only on episode flush (5-10 ops batched) |
| **LLM input** | Raw `tool_input` + `tool_output` JSON | Pre-processed action summaries |
| **Conversation** | Multi-turn, accumulates full history | Stateless single-turn extraction |
| **Noise filtering** | LLM decides via "WHEN TO SKIP" prompt | Deterministic code-level Tier 1 filter |
| **Runtime** | Long-running worker process (1.8MB .cjs) | On-demand spawn, exits immediately |
| **Dependencies** | Bun + Python/uv + Chroma vector DB | Node.js only (3 npm packages) |
| **Source size** | ~2.3MB compiled bundles | ~50KB readable source |
| **Data directory** | `~/.claude-mem/` | `~/.claude-mem-lite/` (hidden, auto-migrates) |

### Token & cost efficiency

For a typical 50-tool-call session (illustrative cost model — the ratios below are
architecture estimates derived from batch size, token counts, and model pricing, **not**
a measured end-to-end benchmark):

| | claude-mem | claude-mem-lite | Ratio (estimated) |
|---|---|---|---|
| LLM calls | ~50 (every tool use) | ~5-8 (per episode) | **~7-10x fewer** |
| Tokens per call | 1,000-5,000 (raw JSON + history) | 200-500 (summaries only) | **~5-10x smaller** |
| Total tokens | ~100K-250K | ~1K-4K | **~50-100x less** |
| Model cost | Sonnet ($3/$15 per M) | Haiku ($0.25/$1.25 per M) | **~12x cheaper** |
| Combined savings | | | **~600x lower cost (estimated)** |

### Quality comparison

| Dimension | Winner | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Classification accuracy** | Tie | Both produce correct type/title/narrative |
| **Noise filtering** | **lite** | Code-level filtering is deterministic; LLM "WHEN TO SKIP" is unreliable |
| **Observation coherence** | **lite** | Episode batching groups related edits into one coherent observation |
| **Code-level detail** | original | Sees full diffs, but rarely useful for memory search |
| **Search recall** | Tie | Users search semantic concepts ("auth bug"), not code lines |
| **Hook latency** | **lite** | Async background workers; original blocks 2-5s per hook |

### Design philosophy

The original sends **everything to the LLM and hopes it filters well**. claude-mem-lite **filters first with code, then sends only what matters** to a smaller model. This is not a downgrade; it's a smarter architecture that produces equivalent search quality at a fraction of the cost.

### Comparison: memory systems for AI coding agents

How claude-mem-lite differs from the major neighbors in the LLM-memory space (verified May 2026):

| | **claude-mem-lite** | [`mem0`](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) | MCP reference [`memory`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory) | [claude-mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem) (original) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Target client** | Claude Code only | Any LLM app via SDK | Any MCP client | Claude Code only |
| **Capture model** | Auto via hooks | Manual `memory.add()` | Manual tool calls (`create_entities`, `add_observations`) | Auto via hooks |
| **Code-aware retrieval** | FTS5 + 100+ synonym pairs (incl. CJK↔EN) | General-purpose | Generic graph nodes | Code-aware |
| **Search** | FTS5 BM25 + query expansion (PRF, concept co-occurrence) | Hybrid: semantic + BM25 + entity linking | Knowledge-graph traversal | FTS5 + Chroma vector |
| **Storage** | Single local SQLite | Pluggable; Qdrant or configurable vector store | Single JSONL file (knowledge graph) | SQLite + Chroma |
| **LLM dependency** | Haiku per episode (5–10 ops batched) | LLM per add/search op | None (graph CRUD only) | Sonnet per tool call |
| **Setup** | One command (`/plugin install` or `npx`) | SDK integration + vector store config | MCP install (per-client) | Bun + Python + Chroma |

**When to pick which**: pick `mem0` if you need a memory layer for a non-Claude-Code app (your own agent, multiple LLM providers). Pick the MCP reference `memory` server if you specifically want a knowledge-graph data model and don't mind invoking memory tools by hand. Pick claude-mem-lite if you want zero-touch automatic capture purpose-built for Claude Code's hook lifecycle, with code-domain retrieval and no external services.

## Features

- **Automatic capture** -- Hooks into the Claude Code lifecycle (SessionStart, PreCompact, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, PostToolUseFailure, Stop, UserPromptSubmit — the seven events in `hooks/hooks.json`) to record observations without manual effort
- **Lexical search with query expansion** -- FTS5 BM25 scoring, an AND->OR rescue pass, pseudo-relevance feedback and concept co-occurrence. A TF-IDF vector arm shipped alongside it until it was measured net-negative and removed; `--deep` still fuses multiple LLM-rewritten queries with Reciprocal Rank Fusion
- **Timeline browsing** -- Navigate observations chronologically with anchor-based context windows
- **Episode batching** -- Groups related file operations into coherent episodes before LLM encoding
- **Error-triggered recall** -- Automatically searches memory when Bash errors occur, surfacing relevant past fixes
- **Proactive file history** -- When editing a file, automatically shows relevant past observations for that file
- **Session summaries** -- LLM-generated summaries at session end (via background workers using `claude -p`)
- **Project-scoped context** -- Injects recent memory into `CLAUDE.md` and session startup for immediate context
- **Observation types** -- Categorized as `decision`, `bugfix`, `feature`, `refactor`, `discovery`, or `change`
- **Importance grading** -- LLM assigns 1-3 importance levels (routine / notable / critical) to each observation
- **Observation relations** -- Bidirectional links between related observations based on file overlap
- **User prompt capture** -- Records user prompts via UserPromptSubmit hook for intent tracking
- **Read file tracking** -- Tracks files read during sessions for richer episode context
- **Zero data loss** -- If LLM fails, observations are saved with degraded (inferred) metadata instead of being discarded
- **Two-tier dedup** -- Jaccard similarity (5-minute window) + MinHash signatures (7-day cross-session window) prevent duplicates
- **Synonym expansion** -- Abbreviations like `K8s`, `DB`, `auth` automatically expand to full forms in FTS5 search (100+ pairs including CJK↔EN cross-language mappings)
- **CJK synonym extraction** -- Unsegmented Chinese text is scanned for known vocabulary words (数据库→database, 搜索→search, etc.) enabling cross-language memory recall
- **Stop-word filtering** -- English stop words filtered from FTS queries, preventing false negatives from noise terms like "how", "the", "does"
- **Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF)** -- Top results seed expansion queries for broader recall
- **Concept co-occurrence** -- Shared concepts across observations expand search to related topics
- **Context-aware re-ranking** -- Active file overlap boosts relevance (exact match + directory-level half-weight)
- **Superseded detection** -- Marks older observations as outdated when newer ones cover the same files with higher importance
- **Adaptive time windows** -- Session startup recall uses velocity-based time windows (high/medium/low activity tiers)
- **Token-budgeted context** -- Greedy knapsack algorithm selects session-start context within a 2,000-token budget, prioritizing by recency and importance
- **Observation compression** -- Old low-value observations can be compressed into weekly summaries to reduce noise
- **Secret scrubbing** -- Automatic redaction of API keys, tokens, PEM blocks, connection strings, and 15+ credential patterns
- **Atomic writes** -- All file writes (episodes, CLAUDE.md) use write-to-tmp + rename to prevent corruption on crash
- **Robust locking** -- PID-aware lock files with automatic stale/orphan cleanup (>30s timeout or dead PID)
- **Stale session cleanup** -- Sessions active for >24h are automatically marked as abandoned on next start
- **Domain synonym expansion** -- Search queries expand to domain synonyms (e.g., "fix" → debug, bugfix, troubleshoot, diagnose, repair)
- **Multi-provider LLM mode** -- Provider priority `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (direct Anthropic API) → `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (OpenRouter, OpenAI-compatible — point it at any model via `OPENROUTER_MODEL`) → `claude -p` CLI fallback when no key is set
- **Lesson-learned indexing** -- `lesson_learned` field indexed in FTS5 with weight 8, making past debugging insights directly searchable
- **Cross-source normalization** -- `mem_search` normalizes scores across observations, sessions, and prompts before merging, preventing any source from dominating results
- **Exponential recency decay** -- Type-differentiated half-lives (decisions: 90d, discoveries: 60d, bugfixes: 14d, changes: 7d) consistently applied in all ranking paths
- **Prompt-time memory injection** -- UserPromptSubmit hook automatically searches and injects relevant past observations with recency and importance weighting
- **Dual injection dedup** -- `user-prompt-search.js` and `handleUserPrompt` coordinate via temp file to prevent duplicate memory injection
- **Plugin cache hook self-heal** -- Claude Code runtime reads plugin hooks from `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<mp>/<plugin>/<ver>/hooks/hooks.json`, not from the marketplace source. When `install.mjs`-managed `settings.json` hooks coexist with a stale cache `hooks.json` (e.g. from a previous marketplace install or a plugin auto-update), the runtime registers hooks twice → every session start / user prompt fires twice. `install.mjs` and `hook-update.mjs` now clear cache `hooks.json` in every version dir, and `hook.mjs session-start` self-heals on every session (gated by `hasInstallManagedHooks` so plugin-only users are not affected). `install.mjs status` reports cache pollution state (since v2.31.1/2.31.2).
- **Result-dedup cooldown** -- User-prompt memory injection uses result-overlap detection (>80% ID overlap → skip) instead of time-based cooldown, allowing topic switches within seconds while preventing redundant injections
- **OR query fallback** -- When AND-joined FTS5 queries return zero results, automatically relaxes to OR-joined queries for broader recall (applied in both user-prompt-search and hook-memory paths)
- **Configurable LLM model** -- Switch between Haiku (fast/cheap) and Sonnet (deeper analysis) via `CLAUDE_MEM_MODEL` env var
- **DB auto-recovery** -- Detects and cleans corrupted WAL/SHM files on startup; periodic WAL checkpoints prevent unbounded growth
- **Schema auto-migration** -- Idempotent `ALTER TABLE` migrations run on every startup, safely adding new columns and indexes without data loss
- **LLM concurrency control** -- File-based semaphore limits background workers to 2 concurrent LLM calls, preventing resource contention
- **stdin overflow protection** -- Hook input truncated at 256KB with regex-based action salvage for oversized tool outputs
- **Cross-session handoff** -- Captures session state on `/exit` and `/clear`, then injects context when the next session detects continuation intent
  <br>**Changed in v6.10.0**: the injected block went from two sections to six. Its observation queries were keyed on the hook-minted session id while every `mem_save` writes a `manual-<project>` id, so `completed` and `key_decisions` could not reach a saved lesson at all — 17 of 17 stored rows held 0 bytes in both. The block now also carries `## Tree state` (branch, short sha, uncommitted count) and `## Next steps`, read from the project's newest `tasks/<slug>-paused.md` when it is under a week old. Four additive nullable columns land on `session_handoffs`; the schema version deliberately does not move, so an older build still opens the database (measured: the v6.9.1 tree read and wrote a database this release had migrated). Revert by pinning `claude-mem-lite@6.9.1` — no data-directory work.
  <br>Original behaviour and the measurements behind it via explicit keywords or FTS5 term overlap. **The `/clear` and `/compact` arm fires since v5.4.0** (R10-P1-1); before that it had never once written a row — `session_handoffs` on the maintainer's install held 4 `exit` rows and **0** `clear` rows. Two host facts settled it, both measured rather than assumed. (1) `Stop` runs at the end of every assistant *turn*, not once per session, and it deleted the session file that SessionStart reads to learn which session just ended — so the branch was unreachable, and mem sessions were minted per turn (58 prompts over 16 host sessions produced 56 mem sessions and 56 summary rows, 2026-09-07). (2) Claude Code **rotates its session id across `/clear`**: of 21 real transcripts, 12 carry a `/clear` command record, and in 12/12 that record's timestamp precedes its own file's first record by ~0.1s — the command is issued in the old session and replayed into a new file under a new id. So `Stop` no longer deletes the file, SessionStart asks the host's `source` (`startup`/`clear`/`compact`/`resume`) instead of guessing from the file, and the handoff's prompt lookup falls back to the unscoped set when the new session's id matches none. Revert path: `CLAUDE_MEM_LEGACY_STOP_UNLINK=1`
- **Git-SHA continuation anchor** (v2.31.0) -- Handoff rows include `git_sha_at_handoff`; any handoff matching the current `HEAD` counts as continuation regardless of TTL. Code state is a stronger continuation signal than wall-clock time
- **Startup dashboard** (v2.31.0) -- SessionStart hook aggregates `git status` + `~/.claude/tasks/*.json` + `~/.claude/plans/*.md` + most-recent exit handoff + recent event count into a single structured block injected via `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`
- **Activity namespace** (v2.31.0) -- Dedicated `events` table + FTS5 for non-memdir types (`bugfix`, `lesson`, `bug`, `discovery`, `refactor`, `feature`, `observation`, `decision`) that don't compete with `WHAT_NOT_TO_SAVE` semantics on the observations table. CLI: `claude-mem-lite activity save|search|recent|show`. `hook-llm` routes non-memdir summary types through `persistHaikuSummary` so upgrades from observations→events are atomic. (v3.39: the `/lesson` and `/bug` slash commands were redirected from this events table to searchable **observations** — `mem_search` never read the events table, so explicit saves were unfindable; the events table remains the auto-capture activity log.)
- **In-place observation updates** -- `mem_update` tool modifies existing observations atomically (field update + FTS text rebuild in one transaction), preserving original IDs and references
- **Bulk export** -- `mem_export` tool exports observations as JSON or JSONL, with project/type/date filtering and 1000-row pagination cap with batch guidance
- **FTS integrity management** -- `mem_fts_check` tool verifies FTS5 index health or rebuilds indexes on demand, useful after database recovery or when search results seem wrong
- **Atomic multi-table writes** -- `saveObservation` wraps the observations + observation_files INSERTs in a single `db.transaction()`, preventing orphaned rows on crash
- **Modular NLP pipeline** -- Synonym maps, stop words, scoring constants, and query building extracted into focused modules (`synonyms.mjs`, `stop-words.mjs`, `scoring-sql.mjs`, `nlp.mjs`) for independent testing and maintenance
- **Surface-form PRF expansion** -- `observations_fts` is built on FTS5's default `unicode61` tokenizer, so the index is **not stemmed**: a query term matches the word forms actually stored, and `crash` does not match a row that only contains `crashes`. Pseudo-relevance feedback therefore uses the Porter stemmer only to *bucket* morphological variants when judging which candidate terms are discriminative, and emits the most frequent **surface** form of each — emitting a bare stem (`cach`) would match nothing and kill expansion recall

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Linux** | Supported | Primary development and testing platform; the whole CI matrix runs here |
| **macOS** | Supported | Fully compatible (Intel and Apple Silicon) |
| **Windows** | Installs, not CI-covered | The MCP server, the CLI and the `node` hooks work (`better-sqlite3` ships `win32-x64` and `win32-arm64` prebuilds, so nothing is compiled). **Three hook commands run under `bash`** — `setup.sh`, `post-tool-use.sh`, `pre-agent-inject.sh` — and need Git for Windows or WSL on `PATH`; `claude-mem-lite doctor` reports it when `bash` cannot be found. No GitHub Actions runner exercises Windows, so this rests on user reports ([#28](https://github.com/sdsrss/claude-mem-lite/issues/28)), not on a green pipeline |
| **WSL2** | Untested | Linux under the hood, so it should behave as the Linux row; nobody has reported either way |

From v5.1.0 through v6.1.0, `package.json` declared `os: ["darwin", "linux"]`. That is an npm *install*
gate, not a runtime check: on Windows it made `npm install` exit `EBADPLATFORM`, which the
plugin launcher runs on the first MCP start after every plugin update — so the server never
came up and `/mcp` reported `CONNECTION_CLOSED`. `win32` is now in the list. A platform that
is still outside it gets a message naming both sides of the mismatch instead of a guess.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** >= 22
- **Claude Code** CLI installed and configured (`claude` command available)
- **SQLite3** support (provided by `better-sqlite3` 13, which ships prebuilt binaries for 8 platforms — no compiler needed on any of them; a platform it has no prebuild for falls back to building from source)
- **Platform**: Linux or macOS; Windows installs and runs but is not CI-covered and needs Git Bash or WSL for three hooks (see [Platform Support](#platform-support))

## Installation

### Method 1: Plugin Marketplace (recommended)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add sdsrss/claude-mem-lite
/plugin install claude-mem-lite
```

Plugin mode manages its own hooks/runtime. On session start it only **checks and reports** new claude-mem-lite versions; it does **not** self-overwrite plugin files in place. Update plugin-mode installs through Claude's plugin workflow.

> **The plugin install is complete on its own** — hooks, MCP tools, and the bundled slash commands (`/mem`, `/lesson`, `/bug`, `/adopt`) all run from the plugin with no second step. The slash commands invoke the bundled CLI by an absolute path resolved from the plugin directory (`node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/cli.mjs" <cmd>`), so they work without anything on your `PATH`. A global `claude-mem-lite` **shell** command (for running queries yourself in a terminal) is **optional** — `npm i -g claude-mem-lite` — and is a *separate* npm install: the plugin's auto-update does **not** refresh it, so re-run `npm i -g claude-mem-lite@latest` if you want that shell command kept in sync. You do **not** need it for the plugin to be fully functional.

> **Auto-adopt writes into your project, on every SessionStart (v3.13+).** The plugin adds a slug-scoped **managed block** to your project's own **`<cwd>/CLAUDE.md`** — a file that is normally committed to git — plus a `<cwd>/.claude/plugin_claude_mem_lite.md` detail file. The block is a system-authority pointer that boosts Claude's proactive use of `mem_recall` / `mem_save`. Everything outside the block is preserved verbatim, and it coexists with other plugins' blocks in the same file ([details](#invited-memory-v232)). This happens on **every** SessionStart, not just the first: the sync is idempotent and re-applies the block if it is edited away, and refreshes it when the shipped template changes. It applies regardless of install path (npm, npx, `/plugin`, manual), so **no manual `/adopt` is needed**.
>
> Opt out per project with `claude-mem-lite adopt --disable` (`--enable` to re-arm), globally with `export MEM_NO_AUTO_ADOPT=1`, or freeze an already-adopted block against template refreshes with `CLAUDE_MEM_NO_TEMPLATE_REFRESH=1`. `claude-mem-lite unadopt` removes the block and the detail file. Manual `/adopt` remains available for re-applying after edits and for the `--all` batch path.

### Method 2: npx (one-liner)

```bash
npx github:sdsrss/claude-mem-lite
```

Source files are automatically copied to `~/.claude-mem-lite/` for persistence.

> **Note:** `npx github:…` installs from the repo's **default branch (HEAD)**, which can be ahead of the latest published release. For the stable released version use the npm package (`npx claude-mem-lite`), or pin a release tag: `npx github:sdsrss/claude-mem-lite#vX.Y.Z`.

### Method 3: git clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sdsrss/claude-mem-lite.git
cd claude-mem-lite
node install.mjs install
```

Source files stay in the cloned repo. Update via `git pull && node install.mjs install`.

### What happens during installation

1. **Install dependencies** -- `npm install --omit=dev` (compiles native `better-sqlite3`)
2. **Register MCP server** -- `mem-lite` server with 18 tools (9 core exposed via `tools/list` + 9 hidden-but-callable; see the Usage section for the full table). The pre-v2.78 generic server name `mem` is renamed to `mem-lite` for namespace hygiene; the tool names themselves (`mem_search`, `mem_recall`, ...) are unchanged.
3. **Configure hooks** -- all seven lifecycle events: `SessionStart`, `PreCompact`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `Stop`, `UserPromptSubmit`
4. **Create data directory** -- `~/.claude-mem-lite/` (hidden) for database, runtime, and managed resource files
5. **Auto-migrate** -- If `~/.claude-mem/` (original claude-mem) or `~/claude-mem-lite/` (pre-v0.5 unhidden) exists, migrates database and runtime files to `~/.claude-mem-lite/`, preserving the original untouched
6. **Initialize database** -- SQLite with WAL mode, FTS5 indexes created on first server start

Restart Claude Code after installation to activate.

### Migration

All installation methods auto-detect and migrate from previous versions:

**From claude-mem (original `~/.claude-mem/`):**
- Copy `claude-mem.db` → `~/.claude-mem-lite/claude-mem-lite.db` (renamed)
- Copy the `runtime/` directory
- **Original `~/.claude-mem/` is preserved** (no deletion, no overwrite)

**From pre-v0.5 unhidden directory (`~/claude-mem-lite/`):**
- Entire directory is moved to `~/.claude-mem-lite/` (hidden)

**In-place rename:**
- Existing `claude-mem.db` in `~/.claude-mem-lite/` is automatically renamed to `claude-mem-lite.db`

Remove old directories manually after confirming:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude-mem/       # original claude-mem
rm -rf ~/claude-mem-lite/   # pre-v0.5 unhidden (if not auto-moved)
```

### Directory Structure

```
~/.claude-mem-lite/
  claude-mem-lite.db       # SQLite database — memory (WAL mode)
  runtime/
    session-<project>    # Active session state
    ep-<project>.json    # Episode buffer

    repos/               # Shallow-cloned source repos
```

## Upgrading to 6.11.0

**One default changes: re-enrich stops leaving part of its budget idle.** It reserves half of
each run's budget for two backfill passes and gives its main scope the rest. When the main
scope had fewer rows to enrich than its share, the remainder went unspent; it now goes to the
backfills. The daily unattended pass runs once per machine per day, over all projects
together, so with an empty main pool it now makes up to 6 of these LLM calls a day where it
made 3. The ceiling of 6 is unchanged — it was always the declared budget — and a separately
budgeted scope-classification pass, also unchanged, can add up to 6 more short calls. A manual
`claude-mem-lite optimize --run` or `mem_optimize` behaves the same way. No schema change and
no migration: an older build still opens the database, so reverting is pinning
`claude-mem-lite@6.10.3`.

**One security fix does not reach data you already have.** In some combinations of two
labelled credentials on one line — `token: <v> secret: <v>` is one, when the first value ends
in a letter — earlier versions redacted the first and stored the second as typed. Values on
separate lines were never affected. This release fixes the write path; nothing already in
your database is rewritten.

<!-- normalize-per-project-note:start -->
## Upgrading to 6.8.0

**Two things change on upgrade. Neither needs an action from you, and neither is a schema
change — an older build can still open the database.**

*The first open backfills the file-lookup table, once.* Observations imported from a
transcript before 6.7.2 carry their modified-files list but no row in the junction table the
file-recall paths join, so asking about a file never found them. The repair was gated on that
table being completely empty, which one ordinary `mem_save` falsifies forever. It now runs
once per database, keyed on its own marker, and retries on a later open if it fails. A store
that never ran `import-jsonl` matches no rows and pays nothing.

Those rows become reachable through `recall` / `mem_recall` and the prompt-submit path. Two
limits, both measured:

- Not through the pre-tool recall hook, which admits only `importance >= 2` while every
  imported row carries `1`.
- Not for `NotebookEdit` rows imported before 6.7.2. Those were stored with an empty
  modified-files list, because the importer of the day read `file_path` and `NotebookEdit`
  sets `notebook_path` instead — so the backfill, which selects on that column being
  non-empty, passes over them. Re-importing the transcript is what recovers those, and 6.7.2
  made that work by putting the path into the title the dedup key is built from.

*`doctor --json` changes shape.* Checks that print a repair command now carry it in a
`details` array — previously the human screen got the command and the JSON got only the
diagnosis. And four checks (dev drift, managed files, and both hook-script branches) now
report `"level": "fail"` where they used to report `"warn"`, with a new `"glyph": "warn"`
recording that they still render as ⚠ rather than ✗. They always counted toward the issue
total and the exit code; the level now says so. If you filter on `level === "fail"` you will
see four findings you were missing. The `issues` count, the summary line and the exit code
are unchanged.

## Upgrading to 6.1.0

**One default changes, and only for the daily background pass.** Until 6.1.0 the unattended
`normalize` task read the concept vocabulary of EVERY project at once, sent it to the model as
one list, and wrote the answer back across every project — so one project's stored content
could steer the synonym groups applied to an unrelated project's rows. It now runs one scoped
pass per project.

| | Before 6.1.0 | 6.1.0 |
|---|---|---|
| Unattended `normalize` | one pass over every project's vocabulary | one pass per project, at most 8 per run, rotating |
| Cross-project synonym unification | automatic | does not happen |
| `optimize --run --task normalize` with no `--project` | one cross-project pass | fans out the same way |

**What you may notice:** `k8s` in one project and `kubernetes` in another are no longer folded
together by the daily pass. Nothing is deleted, no row moves project, and search behaviour is
unchanged — only which terms the background pass will unify.

**It is forward-only.** Terms that earlier cross-project runs already unified stay unified.
The replaced term is kept on the row as a search alias, so those rows are still findable under
the old wording, but there is no record of which unification came from another project.

**To keep the old behaviour:** set `CLAUDE_MEM_NORMALIZE_CROSS_PROJECT=1`. It restores the
cross-project scope — and that scope is exactly the guard it gives up. The other two checks
added in this release (a shape gate on concept tokens, and a check that the model's answer only
uses terms the corpus already had) do still run on that path, but the second one is then judged
against the union of every project's vocabulary, so it no longer keeps one project's term out
of another project's rows. Set it only if you want cross-project unification and trust the
contents of every project in the store. A foreground `optimize` run prints a warning when the
flag is set, and `claude-mem-lite doctor` reports it as ⚠ — the daily pass runs in a worker
with stderr closed, so it cannot warn you itself.

## Upgrading to 6.0.0 (breaking)

**The default search path does not change.** 6.0.0 removes the TF-IDF vector arm, which has
been disabled by default since 3.17.0 — if you never set CLAUDE_MEM_VECTORS, upgrading is
behaviour-identical and there is nothing to do.

Three surfaces are gone:

| Removed | What happens now |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_MEM_VECTORS=1` | Inert. Setting it has no effect. |
| `maintain execute --ops rebuild_vectors` | Exits 1: `Unknown operation(s): rebuild_vectors`. |
| Tables `observation_vectors`, `vocab_state` | Dropped by schema migration v49 on first open. |

**The migration is one-way.** Once a 6.0.0 build has opened your database, older versions
refuse it — `schema.mjs`'s forward-incompat guard throws *"DB schema is v49 but this
claude-mem-lite binary supports up to v48"*. If you want to stay on the vector arm, pin
`claude-mem-lite@5.6.0` **before** upgrading. If you have already upgraded and need to go
back, either re-upgrade, point `CLAUDE_MEM_DIR` at a fresh directory, or restore a
pre-upgrade backup (`claude-mem-lite export` / the snapshots under your data dir).

Why it was removed: measured directly against the shipped path, the arm was negative on both
benchmark fixtures — including the vocabulary-mismatch suite that is the only reason a vector
arm would exist (Recall@10 0.3407 → 0.3018, and roughly +88% P95 latency). No observations
are lost; only the derived vector index is.

## Usage

### MCP Tools (used automatically by Claude)

As of v2.70.0, the server registers 18 tools in total but only the 9 **core**
tools appear in `tools/list`. The 9 **hidden** tools remain callable at the
protocol layer (`tools/call` by exact name still routes normally); they're
omitted from the list response so Claude Code sessions don't load 9 extra
tool schemas at startup. (It read 20 / 11 until v5.0.0 removed the two skill-registry
tools — `tool-schemas.mjs` is the source of truth, and
`tests/tool-count-docs.test.mjs` now holds this paragraph, both README tool tables,
`README.zh-CN.md`, `llms.txt` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to it.) Hidden tools are the maintenance / admin / browser
surface — reach them through the CLI column in the second table.

**Core (9, exposed to Claude Code)**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `mem_search` | FTS5 full-text search with BM25 ranking. Filters by type, project, date range, importance level. |
| `mem_recent` | Show most recent observations, ordered by time. Quick snapshot of latest activity. |
| `mem_recall` | Recall observations related to a file. Use before editing to surface past bugfixes and context. |
| `mem_timeline` | Browse observations chronologically around an anchor point. |
| `mem_get` | Retrieve full details for specific observation IDs (includes importance and related_ids). |
| `mem_save` | Manually save a memory/observation. Accepts `closes_deferred` array for transactional closure of deferred work. |
| `mem_defer` | Mark work for a future session (v2.70+). First-class carry-forward signal, surfaced in SessionStart `### Deferred Work` block. |
| `mem_defer_list` | List open deferred items for the current project. |
| `mem_defer_drop` | Drop a deferred item without fixing it; requires a `reason` for the audit trail. |

**Hidden-but-callable (9, CLI-routed)**

| Tool | CLI equivalent | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| `mem_update` | `claude-mem-lite update <id>` | Edit an observation in place. |
| `mem_stats` | `claude-mem-lite stats` | Counts, type distribution, daily activity. |
| `mem_delete` | `claude-mem-lite delete <id>` | Preview / confirm workflow, FTS5 cleanup. |
| `mem_compress` | `claude-mem-lite compress` | Roll up old low-value observations (preview default; `--execute` to apply). |
| `mem_maintain` | `claude-mem-lite maintain scan --ops dedup,decay` | dedup / decay / cleanup / vacuum (`scan` previews, `execute` applies). |
| `mem_optimize` | `claude-mem-lite optimize` | LLM-powered re-enrich / normalize / cluster-merge (preview default; `--run` to apply). |
| `mem_export` | `claude-mem-lite export` | JSON / JSONL dump, filters by project, type, date. |
| `mem_fts_check` | `claude-mem-lite fts-check <check\|rebuild>` | FTS5 integrity + rebuild. |
| `mem_browse` | `claude-mem-lite browse` | Tier-grouped dashboard (working / active / archive). |

### Skill Commands (in Claude Code chat)

```
/mem search <query>        # Full-text search across all memories
/mem recent [n]            # Show recent N observations (default 10)
/mem recall <file>         # Show past observations for a file
/mem save <text>           # Save a manual memory/note
/mem stats                 # Show memory statistics
/mem timeline <query>      # Browse timeline around a match
/mem browse                # Tier-grouped memory dashboard
/mem <query>               # Shorthand for search
/lesson <text>             # Save a non-obvious lesson to the events table (v2.31.0)
/bug <text>                # Log a known bug + repro steps to the events table (v2.31.0)
/verify                    # Check memories against the current code; correct stale ones after you approve
```

### Efficient Search Workflow

```
1. mem_search(query="auth bug")     -> compact ID index
2. mem_timeline(anchor=12345)       -> surrounding context
3. mem_get(ids=[12345, 12346])      -> full details
```

### Invited Memory (v2.32+)

Opt-in mechanism that installs a slug-scoped managed block into the project's
own `CLAUDE.md` (plus an on-demand detail doc under `.claude/`) so Claude Code
loads the plugin's MCP-tool triggers as **project instructions** — a higher
instruction-following authority than MCP server instructions (which are framed
as tool metadata). Claude Code loads `CLAUDE.md` and the memdir `MEMORY.md` at
equal weight, so steering lives in `CLAUDE.md` (the canonical home for project
instructions) rather than polluting `MEMORY.md`, which is reserved for the user's
own memories. The pre-v3.13 scheme wrote into `MEMORY.md`; it is migrated away
automatically on the next SessionStart.

```bash
claude-mem-lite adopt              # install for current project
claude-mem-lite adopt --all        # install for every project under ~/.claude/projects/
claude-mem-lite adopt --status     # list adopted/disabled projects + current gating snapshot
claude-mem-lite adopt --dry-run    # preview without writing
claude-mem-lite adopt --disable    # opt out of auto-adopt for current project (writes .mem-no-auto-adopt sentinel)
claude-mem-lite adopt --enable     # re-arm auto-adopt for current project (deletes the sentinel)
claude-mem-lite unadopt            # remove sentinel + doc (runtime marker stays to honor the explicit removal)
```

Slash commands `/adopt` and `/unadopt` wrap the same CLI.

**What adoption changes:**
- A `<!-- claude-mem-lite:begin v1 -->…<!-- claude-mem-lite:end -->` managed
  block is added to `<cwd>/CLAUDE.md` under its own
  `## claude-mem-lite — persistent memory` header, containing a compact trigger
  table pointing at `mem_recall` / `mem_save` / `mem_defer` with their key
  arguments. The block is slug-scoped: only this region is managed; the rest of
  your `CLAUDE.md` is preserved verbatim, and it coexists with other plugins'
  blocks (e.g. `code-graph-mcp`) in the same file.
- A `<cwd>/.claude/plugin_claude_mem_lite.md` detail file is written (not
  auto-loaded; read on demand when the `CLAUDE.md` block points to it). The
  block auto-refreshes when the shipped content drifts (version bump or template
  change), unless `CLAUDE_MEM_NO_TEMPLATE_REFRESH=1`.
- Post-adopt the conservative hook layer auto-trims: MCP server instructions
  drop the `WHEN TO USE` section, SessionStart injection drops the `File Lessons`
  / `Key Context` sections. `#ID` references and the `Recent` table still fire
  so `mem_get` remains reachable.

**When does it take effect?**
- The `CLAUDE.md` managed block and the hook-layer trim (`File Lessons` /
  `Key Context` / lesson suffix) apply on the **next SessionStart** (any new
  Claude Code session in the adopted project).
- The MCP server instructions are built once at server boot and MCP has no
  "push" protocol — the `WHEN TO USE` / `Decision rules` trim only applies
  after Claude Code restarts and re-spawns the mem-lite MCP server. A single
  `/exit` + fresh session is enough. Same caveat applies to `unadopt`.

**Safety:**
- Hash-guarded: editing the managed-block body yourself blocks automatic
  rewrites unless you pass `--force`.
- Slug-scoped & dedup-guarded: only the `claude-mem-lite:begin…end` region is
  ever rewritten, and duplicate / CRLF-orphaned copies are collapsed to one.
  Unlike the legacy `MEMORY.md` scheme there is no line-budget gate — `CLAUDE.md`
  has no truncation cap.
- **Auto-adopt runs on EVERY SessionStart, for any install path (v2.82.1+;
  target moved from the memdir to `<cwd>/CLAUDE.md` in v3.13).** The sync is
  idempotent — it re-applies the managed block if it was edited away and
  refreshes it when the shipped template changes (freeze with
  `CLAUDE_MEM_NO_TEMPLATE_REFRESH=1`). Per-project opt-out: `claude-mem-lite adopt --disable`
  (writes a durable `<memdir>/.mem-no-auto-adopt` sentinel that survives marker
  deletion / plugin reinstalls). Global opt-out: `MEM_NO_AUTO_ADOPT=1`.
  Pre-v2.82.1 the `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` gate left auto-adopt unreachable for
  every `install.mjs`-written hook (the common path) — see CHANGELOG v2.82.1.
- The fallback hook layer is never removed from source — conditional trim is
  runtime-gated on sentinel presence, so projects without adoption get the
  full verbose output.

See [the invited-memory design][invited-memory] for the full design (including the
reusable template other plugins can follow). It is a development-time document and
is no longer in the repository at HEAD, so that link is pinned to `v3.95.0`, the
last release that carried it.

## Database Schema

Five core tables with FTS5 virtual tables for search:

**observations** -- Individual coding observations (decisions, bugfixes, features, etc.)
```
id, memory_session_id, project, type, title, subtitle,
text, narrative, concepts, facts, files_read, files_modified,
importance, related_ids, created_at, created_at_epoch,
lesson_learned, minhash_sig, access_count, compressed_into, search_aliases,
branch, superseded_at, superseded_by, last_accessed_at
```

**session_summaries** -- LLM-generated session summaries
```
id, memory_session_id, project, request, investigated,
learned, completed, next_steps, files_read, files_edited, notes,
remaining_items, lessons, key_decisions
```

**sdk_sessions** -- Session tracking
```
id, content_session_id, memory_session_id, project,
started_at, completed_at, status, prompt_counter
```

**user_prompts** -- User prompts captured via UserPromptSubmit hook
```
id, content_session_id, prompt_text, prompt_number
```

**session_handoffs** -- Cross-session handoff snapshots (UPSERT, max 2 per project)
```
project, type, session_id, working_on, completed, unfinished,
key_files, key_decisions, match_keywords, created_at_epoch
```

**observation_files** -- Normalized file membership for efficient file-based recall
```
obs_id, filename
```

FTS5 indexes: `observations_fts` (title, subtitle, narrative, text, facts, concepts, lesson_learned), `session_summaries_fts`, `user_prompts_fts`

## How It Works

### Hook Pipeline

```
SessionStart
  -> Read the host's `source` (startup | clear | compact | resume) from stdin
  -> On clear/compact: read the outgoing session from the session file, save its
     'clear' handoff, emit the Working State block  (R10-P1-1, fixed v5.4.0)
  -> Generate session ID (overwrites the session file)
  -> Mark stale sessions (>24h active) as abandoned
  -> Clean orphaned/stale lock files
  -> Query recent observations (24h)
  -> Inject context into CLAUDE.md + stdout

PostToolUse (every tool execution)
  -> Bash pre-filter skips noise in ~5ms (Read paths tracked to reads file)
  -> Detect Bash significance (errors, tests, builds, git, deploys)
  -> Accumulate into episode buffer
  -> Proactive file history: show past observations for edited files
  -> Flush when: buffer full (10 entries) | 5min gap | context change
  -> Collect Read file paths into episode on flush
  -> Spawn LLM episode worker for significant episodes
  -> Error-triggered recall: search memory for related past fixes

UserPromptSubmit (two parallel paths)
  -> [user-prompt-search.js] Auto-search memory via FTS5 + active file context
  -> [user-prompt-search.js] Inject relevant past observations with recency/importance weighting
  -> [user-prompt-search.js] Write injected IDs to temp file for dedup
  -> [hook.mjs handleUserPrompt] Capture user prompt text to user_prompts table
  -> [hook.mjs handleUserPrompt] Increment session prompt counter
  -> [hook.mjs handleUserPrompt] Handoff: detect continuation intent → inject previous session context
  -> [hook.mjs handleUserPrompt] Semantic memory injection (hook-memory.mjs), deduped via temp file

Stop
  -> Flush final episode buffer
  -> Save handoff snapshot (type 'exit')
  -> Mark session completed
  -> Spawn LLM summary worker (poll-based wait)
  -> Keep the session file  <- Stop fires per TURN; deleting it here re-minted a mem
     session every turn and left the SessionStart /clear branch unreachable (v5.4.0)
```


### Episode Encoding

Episodes are batched related operations (edits to the same file group) that get processed by a background LLM worker:

```
Episode buffer -> Flush to JSON -> claude -p --model haiku -> Structured observation -> SQLite
```

Each observation includes type, title, narrative, concepts, facts, importance (1-3), and is automatically deduplicated via two tiers: Jaccard similarity (>70% within 5 minutes) and MinHash signatures (>80% within 7 days across sessions). If the LLM call fails, a degraded observation is saved with inferred metadata (zero data loss). Related observations are linked via `related_ids` based on FTS5 title similarity and file overlap.

## Management Commands

```bash
# Plugin install:
/plugin install claude-mem-lite       # Install / update
/plugin uninstall claude-mem-lite     # Uninstall

# git clone install:
node install.mjs install              # Install and configure

node install.mjs uninstall --purge    # Remove and delete all data
node install.mjs status               # Show current status
node cli.mjs doctor                   # Diagnose issues  (cli.mjs, not install.mjs — see note)
node cli.mjs repair                   # Recover a broken install from the latest signed release
node install.mjs cleanup-hooks        # Remove only stale claude-mem-lite hooks from settings.json
node install.mjs update               # Force-check for updates and install them (direct install / npx mode)

# npx install:
npx claude-mem-lite                   # Install / reinstall
npx claude-mem-lite uninstall         # Remove (keep data)
npx claude-mem-lite doctor            # Diagnose issues
```

> `doctor` and `repair` are spelled `cli.mjs`, not `install.mjs`, on purpose. Those two are
> the commands you reach for when the install is already broken, and `install.mjs` resolves
> around a dozen static imports before its first line runs — one missing file and it exits
> with a Node stack instead of telling you which file. `cli.mjs` has no static local imports
> and catches that, naming the file and a repair command. Everything else in the list is
> unaffected either way.

Notes:
- Plugin mode only reports available updates; it does not self-update plugin files.
  To upgrade an installed plugin to the latest published version, run **inside Claude Code**:
  ```
  /plugin marketplace update sdsrss
  /plugin install claude-mem-lite@sdsrss
  ```
  (The first command refreshes the local marketplace clone; the second reinstalls from it. Without the first command, `/plugin install` reuses the stale local clone and you stay on whichever version you originally pulled.)
- Direct install / npx mode keeps auto-update enabled and uses staged replacement with rollback on install failure.
- If you disabled the plugin but still have old mem hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`, run `node install.mjs cleanup-hooks`.

#### Trust model per install path

The three install paths do **not** carry the same supply-chain guarantees — pick the one that matches your threat model:

| Path | Update mechanism | Ed25519 release-signature verification |
|------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| npm / npx / git-clone direct install | auto-update from GitHub Releases | **Yes** — every runtime file (140 entries incl. hook scripts, MCP launcher, plugin declaration files) is hash-pinned in a signed manifest; verification is fail-closed |
| `/plugin install` (marketplace) | manual `/plugin marketplace update` + reinstall | **No** — Claude Code installs from a git clone of the marketplace repo; the plugin's own signature chain is not consulted on this path. You are trusting GitHub + the repo's branch protection, not the release signing key |

**Rollback recipe (plugin path).** If an update misbehaves, pin the marketplace clone to the previous release tag and reinstall from it:

```bash
# 1. Find the local marketplace clone
ls ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/          # e.g. sdsrss

# 2. Pin it to the previous good tag (tags mirror npm versions, e.g. v3.62.0)
cd ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/sdsrss
git fetch --tags && git checkout v3.62.0

# 3. Reinstall from the pinned clone — inside Claude Code:
#    /plugin install claude-mem-lite@sdsrss
# 4. To leave the pin later: git checkout main, then the normal update flow.
```

Your data directory (`~/.claude-mem-lite/`) is untouched by install/rollback; schema migrations are forward-only, so after rolling back more than one minor version check `node cli.mjs doctor` before trusting search results.

### doctor

Checks Node.js version, dependencies, server/hook files, database integrity, FTS5 indexes,
stale processes, MCP registration, and whether the marketplace clone can still be updated.

It runs `claude mcp list` to answer the registration question, and that **health-checks every
MCP server you have configured** — i.e. briefly launches each one, including remote endpoints.
`status` deliberately does not: on a plugin install it answers from the manifest instead.

### status

Shows MCP registration, hook configuration, plugin disabled state, and database stats (observation/session counts).

### Recovery (stuck install / hook errors)

If you see `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on PreToolUse:Read/Edit hooks, or `claude-mem-lite` commands crash with import errors, you're likely hit by a partial auto-update — the updater copied new scripts but missed a sibling `lib/*` file, breaking the hook chain (and the next auto-update that would have healed it).

**v2.84.0+** ships a `repair` subcommand that re-syncs from the latest GitHub release:

```bash
claude-mem-lite repair
```

**If `repair` itself fails** (the bin is older than v2.84.0, or the bin is also broken), run this one-liner — it pulls a fresh tarball into a temp dir and runs *that* tarball's `install.mjs`, bypassing every file on your disk:

```bash
T=$(mktemp -d) && U=$(curl -sL https://api.github.com/repos/sdsrss/claude-mem-lite/releases/latest | grep -o '"tarball_url"[^,]*' | cut -d'"' -f4) && curl -sL "$U" | tar xz -C "$T" --strip-components=1 && node "$T/install.mjs" install
```

It resolves the latest **release** tag first. A shell one-liner cannot verify the release signature the way `repair` does, so running it is a trust decision you are making explicitly — that is why it is the last resort and not the first suggestion.

After it finishes, `~/.claude-mem-lite/` is back in sync with the latest release and `claude-mem-lite repair` is available for next time.

## Uninstall

```bash
# Plugin:
/plugin uninstall claude-mem-lite

# git clone:
cd claude-mem-lite
node install.mjs uninstall            # Keeps ~/.claude-mem-lite/ data
node install.mjs uninstall --purge    # Deletes ~/.claude-mem-lite/ and all data

# npx:
npx claude-mem-lite uninstall
npx claude-mem-lite uninstall --purge
```

Data in `~/.claude-mem-lite/` is preserved by default. Delete manually if needed:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude-mem-lite/
```

**`/plugin uninstall` does not delete the plugin cache.** Claude Code materializes each
version under `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`, with its own `node_modules`. While the plugin is
installed these get pruned to the newest three (SessionStart does it, and so does the update
path), so the directory is bounded — measured at 241 MB — not unbounded. But `/plugin
uninstall` removes the manifest and there is no uninstall hook a plugin can attach to, so the
hooks stop firing and whatever is left is never reclaimed. `claude-mem-lite uninstall` does
reclaim it, but after `/plugin uninstall` that command may no longer be on your PATH. Either
run it **first**, or delete the directory yourself:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/cache/sdsrss/claude-mem-lite
```

### Mixed-install residue (read this if you've used multiple install methods)

`/plugin uninstall` only removes the plugin manifest — it **does not touch `~/.claude/settings.json`**. If you've ever run `claude-mem-lite install` (npx or git-clone path), hook entries pointing at `~/.claude-mem-lite/hook.mjs` were written into your user-global settings, and they keep firing after `/plugin uninstall`. If `~/.claude-mem-lite/hook.mjs` still exists they double-fire alongside the plugin; if you also ran `rm -rf ~/.claude-mem-lite/` they error every session.

**The safe sequence is**: run `claude-mem-lite uninstall` first (which cleans the settings.json hooks plus the global MCP registration), then `/plugin uninstall claude-mem-lite`, then optionally `rm -rf ~/.claude-mem-lite/`.

If you already uninstalled in the wrong order, `claude-mem-lite doctor` flags orphan hooks under `Orphan hooks:` with the exact cleanup command.

## Search Quality

Benchmarked on 200 observations across 30 queries (standard + hard-negative categories),
measuring the **production-hybrid** retriever (the real `searchObservationsHybrid`) — the path
`mem_search` / `recall` actually use. The CI gate (`npm run benchmark:gate`) runs this same
path and fails on regression.

| Metric | Score (production-hybrid) |
|--------|---------------------------|
| Recall@10 | 0.90 |
| Precision@10 | 0.85 |
| nDCG@10 | 0.97 |
| MRR@10 | 0.96 |
| P95 search latency | ~1.8ms |

> **Where these numbers come from.** Reproduce with
> `node benchmark/benchmark.mjs --production-hybrid` (deterministic — same fixture corpus,
> same query set, no sampling). The CI reference capture is `benchmark/baseline.json`, and
> `npm run benchmark:gate` fails the build when a run drifts more than 5% from it. This is
> the single source for every retrieval figure quoted in this README.

### Recall on LongMemEval (standard benchmark)

Beyond the in-repo micro-benchmark above, claude-mem-lite is measured on
[LongMemEval](https://github.com/xiaowu0162/LongMemEval) (Wu et al.) — a
500-question long-term-memory benchmark — so its recall is comparable to the
field, not just to itself. Metric is **recall_any@k**: does *any* gold evidence session appear in the
top *k* retrieved? This is the same session-level definition the systems we
compare against report on this split — [agentmemory](https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory)
(BM25 + vector + graph) and dense-embedding systems like MemPalace — so the rows
below sit on one axis, not metric-shopped. (Note: 65% of the 500 questions have
multiple gold sessions, so `recall_any@k` is looser than fractional recall there;
all systems in this comparison report the any-hit form.) Corpus is user-turns-only
(the standard raw-baseline rule). Runners: `benchmark/longmemeval.mjs` (lexical)
and `benchmark/longmemeval-rerank.mjs` (rerank).

| Retriever (zero embeddings) | @1 | @5 | @10 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lexical — FTS5 BM25 + query expansion | **83.4%** | **95.2%** | **96.0%** |
| + one top-20 LLM rerank pass † | 92.8% | 96.8% | 97.4% |

*n = 500 questions.* The lexical row was re-measured 2026-07-18: the v3.39–v3.45
alias/synonym-pipeline work lifted it from the previously published 76.8/90.6/95.2
on the **same harness and dataset** (both unchanged since that run — the gain is
engine-side, not metric drift). † The rerank row is the 2026-06 measurement taken
against the *older* lexical baseline; with lexical now at 95.2 @5 its remaining
headroom is ~1.6pt and a re-measurement is pending. The rerank pass hands the top
20 lexical candidates to a single Haiku call (~1.4 s/query) that reorders them; it
is **never worse than the lexical baseline by construction** — any LLM or parse
failure falls back to the original candidate order.

**Stricter metric, for the record.** The rows above are `recall_any@k` — does *any*
gold session reach the top *k* — the metric agentmemory and MemPalace publish, so the
comparison is like-for-like. Under the stricter **standard recall@k** (`|gold ∩ top-k| /
|gold|`, the *fraction* of all gold sessions retrieved), the lexical stack scores
@1 = 52.9% / @5 = 87.8% / @10 = 91.0%. The whole gap is the 65% of questions with
multiple gold sessions — any-hit needs one, fractional needs them all, and @1 is capped
at 1/|gold| there; single-gold question types score identically under both.
`benchmark/longmemeval.mjs` reports both columns (the rerank row's fractional is not yet
measured).

**On embeddings, honestly.** With no LLM in the loop, our zero-embedding lexical
stack now **ties** the BM25 + vector + graph hybrid (agentmemory, 95.2% @5) at the
same retrieval stage; a dense-embedding baseline (MemPalace, ~96.6% @5) still leads
by ~1.4pt. The remaining gap concentrates in paraphrase (single-session-preference
is our lowest category at 80.0% @5). The rerank row's point stands: a *single cheap
LLM call* reorders the top-20 lexical candidates because the candidate set is
already rich enough that ranking, not recall, is the bottleneck. An
embedding-plus-rerank stack still leads when both sides spend an LLM call; the
takeaway is that claude-mem-lite reaches embedding-competitive recall with **no
vector model, no knowledge graph, no Python, and no external service**.

Per-category any@5, lexical (2026-07-18 run): knowledge-update 100.0 ·
single-session-user 100.0 · multi-session 94.7 · single-session-assistant 94.6 ·
temporal-reasoning 94.0 · single-session-preference 80.0.

## Environment Variables

Every environment variable the shipped code reads is listed below, grouped by what it
controls. Booleans accept `1` unless noted. Anything not listed here is not read by
claude-mem-lite.

### Core

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `CLAUDE_MEM_DIR` | Custom data directory. All databases, runtime files, and managed resources are stored here. | `~/.claude-mem-lite/` |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_MODEL` | LLM model for background calls (episode extraction, session summaries). Accepts `haiku` or `sonnet`. | `haiku` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key. When set, all background LLM calls go directly to the Anthropic Messages API (with prompt caching). Highest priority. | _(unset → CLI)_ |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | OpenRouter API key (OpenAI-compatible). Used for background LLM calls when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is **not** set. If neither key is set, calls fall back to the `claude -p` CLI. | _(unset)_ |
| `OPENROUTER_MODEL` | Overrides the OpenRouter model slug for **all** background calls (e.g. `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct`). When unset, the `CLAUDE_MEM_MODEL` tier maps to `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5` (haiku) or `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5` (sonnet). | _(tier default)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_DEBUG` | Enable debug logging (`1` to enable). | _(disabled)_ |
| `MEM_QUIET_HOOKS` | Low-noise hooks. `1` drops the `File Lessons` / `Key Context` sections from SessionStart injection, the lesson suffix from `[mem] Related memories`, and the `WHEN TO USE` / `Decision rules` blocks from MCP server instructions. IDs and the `Recent` table still surface so `mem_get(ids=[…])` remains reachable. Intended for users running the invited-memory adopt path or who otherwise want minimal auto-injection. **Since v2.82.0 this env no longer gates auto-adopt — use `MEM_NO_AUTO_ADOPT=1` for that.** | _(disabled)_ |
| `MEM_NO_AUTO_ADOPT` | Global opt-out for auto-adopt (v2.82.0+). `1` prevents the per-SessionStart auto-write of the `CLAUDE.md` managed block across **all** projects. For per-project opt-out use `claude-mem-lite adopt --disable` instead (writes a durable `<memdir>/.mem-no-auto-adopt` sentinel that survives marker deletion). | _(disabled)_ |
| `MEM_NO_ADOPT_HINT` | Silences the one-line "Invited-memory 未启用：`claude-mem-lite adopt`…" hint that SessionStart appends when the current project hasn't been adopted. Since v2.82.1 auto-adopt runs on every SessionStart for any install path, so this hint typically surfaces only when you've explicitly opted out (`MEM_NO_AUTO_ADOPT=1` or `claude-mem-lite adopt --disable`). | _(disabled)_ |

### What gets injected into your context

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `CLAUDE_MEM_ALL_TOOLS` | `1` exposes all 18 MCP tools in `tools/list` instead of the 9 core ones (pre-v2.34.0 behavior). The 9 hidden tools stay callable by exact name either way. | _(9 core)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_FILE_INTEL` | `0` disables the file-intel block injected before `Read` (past observations about the file you are about to open). | _(on)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_FILE_INTEL_MIN_TOKENS` | Files smaller than this stay silent — file-intel only pays for itself on large files. | `800` |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_REREAD_GUARD` | `0` disables the warning when the same file is read twice in a session. Never fires on `offset`/`limit` paging. | _(on)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_REREAD_MIN_TOKENS` | Token floor below which the re-read guard stays silent. | `600` |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_PRETOOL_NUDGE` | `1` extends the pre-tool recall nudge from `Read` to other tools. | _(Read only)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_KEEP_LOW_SIGNAL` | `1` keeps low-signal observations that the deterministic filter would otherwise drop before dedup/vector work. | _(filtered)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_NO_TEMPLATE_REFRESH` | `1` stops SessionStart from refreshing the adopted `CLAUDE.md` managed block when the shipped template changes. | _(refreshes)_ |
| `MEM_QUIET_HOOKS` | See Core above — the broadest injection-volume switch. | _(disabled)_ |


### Retrieval tuning

Prompt-time search (`UPS_*` = the UserPromptSubmit surface). Defaults are the values the
benchmark and A/B harness are calibrated against — changing them invalidates the numbers in
[Search Quality](#search-quality).

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `CLAUDE_MEM_UPS_MAX_RESULTS` | Max memories injected per prompt. | `3` |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_UPS_REQUIRE_SIGNAL` | `0` restores always-search; by default the prompt must carry an explicit retrieval signal. | _(signal required)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_UPS_BM25_MIN` | BM25 relevance floor for a result to be injected. | `1e-5` |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_UPS_BM25_MIN_FOLLOWUP` | Looser floor for follow-up prompts inside an already-injected session. | `5e-6` |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_UPS_OR_BM25_MIN` | Floor applied to the OR-fallback arm (looser query, needs a stricter floor). | `30` |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_UPS_TOP_MIN` | Minimum score for the top hit; `0` disables (useful on tiny test corpora). | `50` |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_UPS_FLOOR_REF_CORPUS` | Reference corpus size the score floors are normalized against, so a fresh install with few rows is not silently gated to zero injections. Shared by every floor-bearing surface, including error-recall below. | `584` |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_ERROR_RECALL_BM25_MIN` | Relevance floor for the error-recall surface (memories injected after a failed Bash command). **Off by default.** Setting it to `10.5` (the calibrated value) makes the surface stay silent when its best-matching memory is not actually about the failure — the whole set is dropped, never trimmed row-by-row. **It is a real trade, not a free win:** measured on a live database at that threshold, injections fall ~37% and ~39% of firings go silent, concentrated in projects with few memories. Off by default because nothing shows the dropped rows were noise. Explore with `node benchmark/error-recall-suite.mjs --sweep`. | `0` (off) |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_ERROR_RECALL_RERANK` | `off` restores the flat keyword ordering of the error-recall surface. **On by default**, and unlike the floor above it removes nothing: memories that share only the failed command's vocabulary are demoted below memories that mention the failure itself, and when a project has none of the latter the result is unchanged. Measured on a live database over 52 real failing commands × 15 projects: the lead memory matched no error term in 42.3% of firings before, 21.5% after, with the injected row count identical. | _(on)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_ERROR_RECALL_ON_FAILURE` | `off` stops the plugin from recalling memories when a Bash command **fails at the host level**. On by default. Claude Code delivers failed tool calls to a separate `PostToolUseFailure` hook event, so before this the surface only ever saw commands that exited `0` while printing error-ish text — a genuinely failing build recalled nothing. Denials from your own guardrails (sandbox, policy hooks, declined permission prompts) and commands you interrupted are never recalled for. | _(on)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_UPS_IDENTIFIER_BYPASS` | `0` disables the bypass that lets an exact identifier match skip the score floors. | _(on)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_UPS_PROMPT_FALLBACK_LIMIT` | How many past-prompt rows the fallback arm may return. | `1` |
| `MEM_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD` | Fraction of query terms a memory must cover to qualify (∈ [0,1]). | `0.4` |
| `MEM_CROSS_PROJECT_BOOST` | Multiplier for matches from other projects (∈ [0,1]); raise it for installs that want more cross-project sharing. | `0.4` |
| `MEM_OR_FALLBACK_MAX_TOKENS` | Max query tokens allowed into the OR fallback (∈ [0,50]). | `8` |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_CJK_PREC_MIN` | Precision floor for CJK segmentation candidates. | `0.2` |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_AUTO_DEEP` | `0` disables automatic deep-search escalation (one Haiku call rewriting a weak query into keyword/concept/HyDE variants). Explicit `deep: true` still works. | _(auto)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_DEEP_DISCLOSURE` | `off` suppresses the one-line caveat appended to a multi-variant deep result. The caveat exists because deep search fills the page even when the corpus cannot answer — measured at 10 of 10 slots on queries whose answers had been removed (`benchmark/deep-search-holdout.mjs`) — and `deep` is AUTO by default on the MCP surface, i.e. it escalates precisely when the honest answer is "nothing". It does not change retrieval, ranking, or which rows are returned. | _(on)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_REACH_DISCLOSURE` | `off` suppresses the one-line note that fires when a search's reported `total` exceeds what its pagination can hand back. The candidate pool is sized from `limit` alone and deliberately does not grow with `offset` (D#30 — an offset-scaled pool re-ranks its own prefix under RRF, so pages overlapped and gapped), while `total` is the full match count. Measured on a 128-row corpus: at the default limit of 20 the last non-empty offset is 59, so 60 of 128 rows are unreachable at any offset. The note reports that; it does not change retrieval, ranking, or which rows are returned. It stays **silent** when a filter you asked for (`tier`, or the CJK precision gate on prompts) removed rows after the count was taken — that gap is your filter, not the pool, and raising the limit would not recover it. | _(on)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_NORMALIZE_CROSS_PROJECT` | `1` restores the pre-fix behaviour where the daily unattended `normalize` runs ONCE over every project's concepts at the same time. That is how one project's stored content could steer synonym groups applied to another project's rows, so the default is now one scoped pass per project (bounded to 8 per run). The cost of the default is that `k8s` in one project and `kubernetes` in another are no longer unified automatically. Note that EVERY unscoped run fans out, including an explicit `optimize --run --task normalize` with no `--project` — this variable is the only route back to the single cross-project pass. A foreground `optimize` run prints a warning when it is set; the daily unattended pass cannot (its worker is spawned with stderr closed), so `claude-mem-lite doctor` reports it as a ⚠ instead. | _(off)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_AUTO_DEEP_CLI` | `0` disables the same auto-escalation on the CLI path only. | _(auto)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_SCOPE_FILTER` | `1` stops environment-scoped observations from firing on file-triggered recall. They stay reachable via search. **Leave it off**: on the face it gates, `environment` is not the low-relevance class its premise assumes — it cites at least as well as `project` (47.5% vs 44.3%, intervals overlapping), and an earlier measurement left 173 recall groups empty with it on. | _(off)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_READS_CARRY` | An episode flush collects `reads-<project>.txt` only when it will actually save an observation, so a flush that records nothing no longer discards the Read paths it swept up (42.2% of the paths a flush consumed, measured over 1122 transcripts). `0` restores the pre-v3.83.0 behaviour. | _(on)_ |

### Citation tracking and feedback

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `CLAUDE_MEM_NO_CITATION_TRACK` | `1` disables both the access-count bump and the decay loop — no citation bookkeeping at all. | _(enabled)_ |
| `MEM_DISABLE_CITATION_DECAY` | `1` disables only the decay writes, keeping access-count bumps. | _(enabled)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_CITATION_ADOPTION_THRESHOLD` | **Removed — inert.** Tuned the per-project adoption gate, which is gone (D#204). Setting it warns on stderr and changes nothing. | _(n/a)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_NO_CITE_NUDGE` | `1` fully silences the cite-back nudge. | _(enabled)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_CITE_NUDGE_THRESHOLD` | Cite-rate below which the nudge fires. | `0.4` |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_CITE_NUDGE_WIDE_DENOMINATOR` | `1` judges the wide cite-recall ratio (every `#NN`-shaped token the model saw) instead of the lessons the hooks injected. **Half of the revert**: the threshold moved too, so pre-v6.6.0 gating needs this **and** `CLAUDE_MEM_CITE_NUDGE_THRESHOLD=0.6`. This switch alone gives you the wide ratio judged at 0.4, which is neither release's behaviour. | unset |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_CITE_NUDGE_MIN_INJECTED` | Minimum injection volume before the ratio gate is judged at all. | `5` |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_CITE_NUDGE_SILENCE_AFTER` | Consecutive low-cite sessions before the nudge goes quiet; `0` = never silence. | `3` |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_CITATION_RELEVANCE_GATE` | Stop credits an `access_count` to a memory the session cited only when something made that memory relevant to the session — it was injected, or you typed its `#NN` yourself. `off` restores the pre-v3.84.0 behaviour of crediting every `#NN` the assistant wrote, which over-counts sessions that discuss memories in prose (release notes, audit reports): measured on real transcripts, 267 of 859 credited (id, session) pairs — 31.1% — were mentions nothing had put in front of the model. Superseded citations are redirected to their keeper on both settings. | _(on)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_SUBAGENT_DECAY` | The `subagent` injection face feeds the decay loop: memories handed to a dispatched agent enter the denominator, and the citation that agent makes in its own transcript counts as the numerator. `0` returns the face to metered-but-never-decaying (v3.77–v3.82). | _(on)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_METRICS` | `1` records feature-injection counters surfaced by `claude-mem-lite stats`. | _(off)_ |

### Background work

All of these turn *off* work that normally happens in the background. Nothing here changes
what is already stored — only whether new work runs.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `CLAUDE_MEM_SKIP_SUMMARY` | Skip the background LLM session summary at **both** of its spawn sites — `Stop`, and the SessionStart `/clear`-handoff path. Until v5.3.0 only the `Stop` one honoured it. | _(runs)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_LEGACY_STOP_UNLINK` | Restore the pre-v5.4.0 behaviour where `Stop` deletes the session file. Documented revert path for the session-lifecycle change, not a supported configuration: it re-mints a mem session per turn and makes the `/clear` handoff unreachable again. Only reach for it on a host that fires `Stop` once per session rather than once per turn. | _(file kept)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_SKIP_EPISODE_LLM` | Skip LLM extraction on episode flush — observations are still batched, just not summarized. | _(runs)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_SKIP_SAVE_ENRICH` | Skip the background Haiku call that backfills `lesson_learned` / search aliases after a save. | _(runs)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_SKIP_COMPRESS` | Skip auto-compression of old observations. | _(runs)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_SKIP_MAINTAIN` | Skip the 24h auto-maintain pass (decay, purge, backup). | _(runs)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_SKIP_OPTIMIZE` | Skip the LLM optimization pass (re-enrich, normalize, cluster-merge). | _(runs)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_SKIP_AUTO_DEDUP_FUZZY` | Skip the MinHash near-duplicate pass, keeping exact dedup. | _(runs)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_SKIP_MARKER_GC` | Skip the runtime-marker sweep. **Must be exactly `1`** — unlike the other `CLAUDE_MEM_SKIP_*` flags, which accept any truthy value, this one compares against the string `1`. That is deliberate: a truthy check makes `=0` mean "skip", which is the opposite of what anyone typing it intends. | _(runs)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_SKIP_UPDATE` | Skip the 24h auto-update check against GitHub Releases. | _(runs)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_SKIP_SIG_VERIFY` | Skip Ed25519 signature verification of a downloaded update. **Escape hatch — leaves updates unauthenticated.** | _(verifies)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_NO_LESSON_RETRY` | `1` disables the one-shot retry that re-asks for a missing `lesson_learned`. | _(retries)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_FLUSH_TIMEOUT` | Seconds the Stop hook waits for pending episode flushes. | `15` |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_BACKUP_BUDGET_MB` | Disk budget for backup snapshots; the next maintain/save evicts oldest snapshots past the 7-day undo grace. | `256` |

### Experimental

Off or shadow-mode by default. These are measurement arms, not finished features — behavior
and names can change between releases.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `CLAUDE_MEM_TASK_IMPERATIVE` | `on`/`1` injects the single most relevant lesson at prompt position under an imperative template. | _(off)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_SUBAGENT_INJECT` | Dispatch-time memory injection for subagents. | _(off)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_SALIENCE` | Selects a comprehension-bridge arm (`bridge`, `bind`); unset = current default behavior. | _(unset)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_EDGE_DECAY` | Enables decay of file↔observation edges. | _(off)_ |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_EDGE_DECAY_K` | Edge-decay threshold when the flag above is on (clamped to ≥1). | `3` |

### Internal and test-only

Set by the tool or by the test harness. Setting these by hand is not supported:
`CLAUDE_MEM_HOOK_RUNNING`, `CLAUDE_MEM_BINDING_HEALED`, `CLAUDE_MEM_BRIDGE_FAKE`,
`CLAUDE_MEM_NO_DELAY`, `CLAUDE_MEM_CATCH_SAMPLE`, `CLAUDE_MEM_QUIET_TRACE`,
`CLAUDE_MEM_DB_PATH`, `CLAUDE_MEM_RUNTIME_DIR`, `MEM_DISABLE_SPAWN_LOG`.
`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is set by Claude Code itself.

The last two are worth one more sentence each, because they are the ones a harness reaches
for. `CLAUDE_MEM_RUNTIME_DIR` relocates the runtime directory for hook-written state — markers,
cooldowns, hook-error telemetry, the native-binding breakage marker, episode buffers.
(`metrics/` is NOT in that set: it is a sibling of `runtime/` under the data dir and moves
with `CLAUDE_MEM_DIR` only.) Before v3.93.0 it was honoured by some readers and ignored by others, so setting it
split the runtime rather than moving it. Installation-identity state (`install.lock`,
`update-state.json`, update residue) deliberately stays under `CLAUDE_MEM_DIR`: two
installers pointed at different override directories would otherwise each take their own
lock and both proceed. **`CLAUDE_MEM_DB_PATH` still has the split shape**, and more narrowly
than it looks: exactly ONE component reads it — `scripts/pre-tool-recall.js` — so setting it
aims that single hook at one database and leaves the other four hook faces, the CLI and the
MCP server on the default. Use `CLAUDE_MEM_DIR` — the only override
every component respects, including the bash pre-filter — to isolate state.

Three more are set by `vitest.config.mjs` / `tests/global-setup.mjs` and exist only to
keep a test run off the live database: `CLAUDE_MEM_TEST_GUARD` (`1` arms the guard, `off`
opts a test out), `CLAUDE_MEM_TEST_REALDIR` (the live data dir, captured before the suite
relocates anything) and `CLAUDE_MEM_TEST_SANDBOX` (this run's throwaway dir). With the
guard armed, any resolution that lands on the live data dir is redirected to the sandbox
instead — including from a subprocess that inherited the ambient environment. Unset in
normal use, and inert when unset.

## FAQ

### What is a memory system for Claude Code?

A memory system lets Claude Code remember context — coding decisions, bug fixes, file history — across sessions. By default Claude Code's context resets each session; claude-mem-lite persists observations to a local SQLite database and re-injects them at session start and on relevant prompts.

### Does Claude Code have built-in long-term memory?

No. Claude Code's `CLAUDE.md` and `MEMORY.md` files act as static instruction memory, but there is no native dynamic recall of past sessions, bug fixes, or decisions. claude-mem-lite adds that layer via MCP and hooks, with no manual note-taking required.

### How is claude-mem-lite different from mem0 or MCP's reference memory server?

`mem0` and the MCP `memory` server are general-purpose LLM memory frameworks designed for any client. claude-mem-lite is purpose-built for Claude Code's hook lifecycle: it captures *episodes* (batched tool calls), uses domain-specific synonym expansion for code terms (`K8s`, `DB`, `数据库`, ...), and surfaces past observations proactively before file edits via the `PreToolUse:Edit` hook.

### Why "lite"? What did the original claude-mem do differently?

The original called an LLM on every tool use with raw JSON inputs. claude-mem-lite batches 5–10 operations per LLM call, uses a smaller model (Haiku), and runs a deterministic code-level filter before sending anything to the model. Net result: an estimated ~600× lower cost (an architecture estimate from the cost model above, not a measured benchmark) with equivalent search quality. See the [Architecture comparison](#architecture-comparison) above.

### Does this work cross-project? Cross-machine?

Project-scoped by default — each project has its own memory namespace. Single-machine only (SQLite, not networked). Use `mem_export` (JSON / JSONL) to back up or migrate between machines.

### What about privacy? Does it call external APIs?

Only the Haiku summarization step calls Anthropic's API (or the local `claude -p` CLI if no API key is set). All search, storage, and retrieval is local SQLite — no telemetry, no third-party services.

### 中文常见问题

**Claude Code 怎么跨会话记住内容？** 默认不能。claude-mem-lite 通过 MCP 协议和钩子自动把决策、bug 修复、文件历史持久化到本地 SQLite，下次会话开始时再注入。

**和 mem0、官方 MCP memory server 有什么区别？** 那两个是通用 LLM 记忆框架；claude-mem-lite 是为 Claude Code 钩子生命周期定制的：批量 episode 处理、代码领域同义词扩展（K8s/DB/数据库等）、文件编辑前主动召回相关历史。

**支持中文吗？** 完整支持。FTS5 + 中英文同义词扩展（100+ 对，含 CJK ↔ EN 跨语言映射），中文记忆也可用英文关键词召回，反之亦然。
