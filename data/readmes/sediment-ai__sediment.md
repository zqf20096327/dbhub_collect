<!-- docs-home:start -->

Sediment is an open-source, self-hosted evidence store for coding agents.

Capture model calls, code changes, developer decisions, and check results on
your infrastructure.

- [Evaluate agent work](docs/operate/measure-agent-work.md): compare models by
  recorded decisions, code retention, and automated checks.
- [Reuse context](docs/operate/resume-with-evidence.md): give agents selected
  messages, tool calls, and results from a previous Session.
- [Build training datasets](docs/exports/training-exports.md): export examples
  for fine-tuning, preference training, and reinforcement learning.

<!-- docs-home:end -->

## Get started

On macOS with Homebrew, Debian, or Ubuntu:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://sediment.so/install.sh | sh
sediment server
```

Follow the
[Quickstart](docs/quickstart.md) to connect an agent and verify capture.

[Integrations](docs/capture/agent-integrations.md): Claude Code, Codex, Cursor,
pi, and Copilot Chat. Available signals vary by agent.

[Deploy a shared server](docs/operate/deploy.md).
