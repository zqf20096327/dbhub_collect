SereneDB unifies **Elasticsearch-like search** and **ClickHouse-like analytics** in a single, **Postgres-compatible** database.

Search is a first-class citizen of the query engine. All search functionality is powered by [IResearch](iresearch/README.md), an open-source C++ information retrieval library that core members of the SereneDB team have been developing since 2016.

## Why Choose SereneDB?

SereneDB is designed to be powerful, convenient and dev-friendly.

* **[Zero-ETL Remote Search](https://github.com/serenedb/serenedb/tree/main/examples)**: Query your data (Parquet, Iceberg, CSV, JSON) directly on remote storage (S3/HDFS) with full BM25 ranking and vector search, eliminating the need for expensive ingestion pipelines.
* **Unified Search & Analytics:** The search experience of Elasticsearch and the analytical power of ClickHouse in a **single, high-performance solution**.
* **Faster Than Elasticsearch:** Powered by IResearch, which outperforms Lucene (the engine behind Elasticsearch) across every query type in the [Search Benchmark, the Game](https://serenedb.com/search-benchmark-game).
* **Efficient Real-Time Updates:** Column-wise updates that keep your data fresh without performance hits.
* **Vector & Hybrid Search:** Built-in vector search and hybrid ranking for AI-powered applications.
* **Postgres-Compatible:** Leverage your existing Postgres ecosystem, tools and knowledge. If you know SQL, you know SereneDB.
* **[UI Client](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVaudH7w8yw):** An intuitive Postgres-compatible UI for managing and querying your data.

## Our Philosophy

* **Truly Open Source:** The complete, single-node version is and always will be licensed under **Apache 2.0**.
* **Built for Scale:** Horizontal scalability, high availability and advanced security for production deployments.
* **Transparent Performance:** All benchmarks are open and reproducible. Methodology, hardware and raw results are published alongside numbers.
* **Giving Back:** We build on, contribute back to and openly collaborate with the open-source community, including projects like Velox, PostgreSQL and RocksDB.
