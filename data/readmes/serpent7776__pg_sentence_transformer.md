# pg_sentence_transformer

Run a huggingface model right inside Postgres process, without the need for an external LLM service.

## Installation

The usual make invocation will install the extension.

```
sudo make install
```

This extension also requires `pg_sentence_transformer` python package to be installed in venv readable by `postgres` user.

```
sudo -u postgres -i
mkdir /opt/pg_sentence_transformer
virtualenv /opt/pg_sentence_transformer/venv
. /opt/pg_sentence_transformer/venv/bin/activate
cd /path/to/pg_sentence_transformer
pip install .
```

This extension needs to be added to `shared_preload_libraries` in your `postgresql.conf`:

```
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_sentence_transformer'
```

## Configuration

The following configuration options are recognised and should be set in `postgresql.conf`:

```
sentence_transformer.venv_path = '/opt/pg_sentence_transformer/venv'
sentence_transformer.database_name = my_db
sentence_transformer.schema_name = public
sentence_transformer.src_table_name = posts
sentence_transformer.src_column = text
sentence_transformer.id_column = id
```

```
sentence_transformer.venv_path
```
