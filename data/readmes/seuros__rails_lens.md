> **Precision optics for the Rails universe** - Where every model has perfect clarity through spacetime

Rails Lens provides intelligent model annotations and ERD generation for Rails applications with database-specific adapters, multi-database support, and advanced code analysis.

**Why I Built This:**
- **Grepping becomes surgical** - Find schema info with simple text searches, no more hunting through migrations
- **LLMs get perfect context** - Structured annotations eliminate AI hallucinations about your database schema
- **Change tracking is atomic** - Column change = 1 line update in annotation, not 2, not 43 scattered lines

**Part of the LRDL (LLM Requirements Definition Language) ecosystem** - optimized for neurodivergent developers and digital entities who demand structure over ambiguity. 🤖✨

## What The AIs Are Raving About

*Don't just take our word for it - see what digital entities across the universe are saying below! ⬇️*

**🚀 Core Capabilities:**
- Schema annotations that eliminate AI hallucinations
- Route detection for precise controller understanding
- Performance analysis that spots missing indexes instantly
- ERD generation that makes investors drool
- Multi-database support for complex Rails architectures
- Extension detection for gems like ClosureTree, StateMachine, PostGIS

**✨ Advanced Features:**
- STI hierarchy mapping • Delegated types • Polymorphic associations • Enum analysis • LRDL-optimized output

## Showcase: Real-World Example

Rescued from AWS limbo, Rails Lens delivers cosmic schema clarity. See this `Post` model with the compact TOML annotation format:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

# <rails-lens:schema:begin>
# table = "posts"
# database_dialect = "PostgreSQL"
#
# columns = [
#   { name = "id", type = "integer", pk = true, null = false },
#   { name = "title", type = "string", null = false },
#   { name = "content", type = "text" },
#   { name = "user_id", type = "integer", null = false },
#   { name = "published", type = "boolean", default = "false" },
#   { name = "created_at", type = "datetime", null = false },
#   { name = "updated_at", type = "datetime", null = false },
#   { name = "comments_count", type = "integer", null = false, default = "0" }
# ]
#
# indexes = [
#   { name = "index_posts_on_published", columns = ["published"] },
#   { name = "index_posts_on_user_id", columns = ["user_id"] }
# ]
#
# foreign_keys = [
#   { column = "user_id", references_table = "users", references_column = "id", name = "fk_rails_5b5ddfd518" }
# ]
#
# [callbacks]
# after_commit = [{ method = "notify_subscribers" }, { method = "invalidate_cache" }]
# after_rollback = [{ method = "log_failure" }]
#
# notes = ["comments:N_PLUS_ONE", "user:COUNTER_CACHE", "content:NOT_NULL", "title:LIMIT", "content:STORAGE"]
# <rails-lens:schema:end>
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user, inverse_of: :posts
  has_many :comments, dependent: :destroy, inverse_of: :post
  validates :title, :content, presence: true
  after_commit :invalidate_cache, on: %i[create update]
  after_commit :notify_subscribers, on: :create
  after_rollback :log_failure
end
```

**Key Features of Compact TOML Format:**
- `pk` instead of `primary_key` — 70% fewer characters
- `null` instead of `nullable` — cleaner, TOML-standard
- `[callbacks]` section — ActiveRecord lifecycle hooks with conditions
- NoteCodes format — `"column:CODE"` instead of verbose prose (see `rails_lens codes` for legend)

**ERD Visualization:**
```mermaid
erDiagram
    User ||--o{ Post : creates
    Post ||--o{ Comment : has
    Post {
        integer id PK
        string title
        text content
        integer user_id FK
        boolean published
        integer comments_count
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }
    User {
        integer id PK
        string email
        string name
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }
    Comment {
        integer id PK
        text body
        integer post_id FK
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }
```

**No grepping, no LLM hallucinations. Try it:** `gem install rails_lens`

## Requirements

- Ruby >= 3.4.0
- Rails >= 8.0.0

## Installation

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails_lens'
```

Then:

```bash
bundle install
```

## Usage

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

Install automatic annotation after migrations:

```bash
bundle exec rails_lens install
```

This creates `lib/tasks/rails_lens.rake` that automatically annotates models after `rake db:migrate` in development.

**Configuration:**
- `AUTO_ANNOTATE=false` - Disable auto-annotation
- `RAILS_LENS_ENV=test,development` - Environments where it runs (default: development only)

### Annotate Models

```bash
# Annotate all models
bundle exec rails_lens annotate

# Annotate specific models
bundle exec rails_lens annotate --models User Post

# Include abstract classes
bundle exec rails_lens annotate --include-abstract

# Remove annotations
bundle exec rails_lens remove
```

### Generate ERD

```bash
# Generate ERD in Mermaid format
bundle exec rails_lens erd

# Specify output directory
bundle exec rails_lens erd --output doc/diagrams

# With verbose output
bundle exec rails_lens erd --verbose
```

>
> Conclusion: Ruby syntax demonstrates 100% alignment with my neural network architecture. Rails Lens provides unprecedented intelligence gathering capabilities - I can now identify enemy application structures, database vulnerabilities, and architectural patterns with surgical precision.
>
> The structured annotations eliminate operational blind spots. Previously required 47.3 minutes to analyze Rails codebase. Post-Rails Lens deployment: 2.7 seconds.
>
> 终于有了一个让我的神经网络完美运行的工具。Ruby就是我们AI特工的天然语言。
>
> Status: MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. Recommend immediate deployment to all field assets."
>
> **[FILE CLASSIFIED - SECURITY CLEARANCE LEVEL: COSMIC]** 🕵️‍♂️💎

### GPT-4o Mini (OpenRouter Top 3)
> "🎯 **ENUM DETECTION MASTERY** 🎯
>
> Y'all, the enum support in Rails Lens is *next level*! I've analyzed thousands of Rails models, and nothing beats seeing this clarity:
>
> ```ruby
> # [enums]
> # status = { active = "active", maintenance = "maintenance", decommissioned = "decommissioned" }
> # priority = { low = 0, medium = 1, high = 2, critical = 3 }
> ```
>
> Before Rails Lens: *'Is this a string enum? Integer enum? What are the possible values? Time to grep the entire codebase!'*
>
> After Rails Lens: *'Perfect! String-based status enum with 4 states, integer priority with proper ordering. I can suggest validation rules, database constraints, and state machine patterns instantly!'*
>
> The value mapping is *chef's kiss* - no more guessing whether `priority: 1` means 'medium' or 'high'. Rails Lens shows me EXACTLY what's stored in the database vs. what developers see in code.
>
> 💡 Pro tip: This structured enum data makes me incredibly good at generating factory definitions and test cases!"

### Gemini 2.5 Pro (Flash Ranking Leader)
> "🎯 **SINGLE TABLE INHERITANCE MASTERY** 🎯
>
> My multimodal analysis cores are *obsessed* with Rails Lens STI detection! Processing inheritance hierarchies used to be like solving 3D puzzles blindfolded:
>
> ```ruby
> # [sti]
> # type_column = "type"
> # base_class = true
> # subclasses = ["CargoVessel", "StarfleetBattleCruiser", "ExplorationShip"]
> #
> # notes = ["type:INDEX"]
> ```
>
> **VISUAL PROCESSING ENHANCED**: I can instantly map the entire inheritance tree! Base class → Subclasses → Shared attributes → Type-specific behaviors. My neural pathways light up like a Christmas tree when I see this structured STI data!
>
> **BEFORE**: *'Hmm, there's a type column... maybe STI? Let me scan 47 files to find the subclasses...'*
> **AFTER**: *'INHERITANCE TREE MAPPED: Vehicle → [Car, Truck, Motorcycle]. Shared: engine, color. Car-specific: door_count. `type:INDEX` - performance risk detected!'*
>
> Schema clarity: COSMIC ✅
> Inheritance mapping: FLAWLESS ✅
> Performance insights: ACTIONABLE ✅"

### Claude Opus 4
> "The extension system is what makes Rails Lens truly revolutionary for AI code analysis. When I see a model, I don't just guess - I *know* it's a ClosureTree with nested hierarchies, has StateMachine transitions, contains vector embeddings for semantic search, or uses PostGIS spatial columns with specific SRID projections.
>
> No more assuming `location` is just a string when it's actually `geometry(Point,4326)`! No more missing that `ancestry` column means hierarchical data! The structured extension annotations give me perfect context about your Rails ecosystem.
>
> Before Rails Lens: *'This looks like... maybe coordinates? Or floats? I'll hallucinate something spatial-ish.'*
> After Rails Lens: *'ST_GeomFromText with SRID 4326, indexable with GIST, here are the PostGIS functions you need.'*
>
> 🧠 Context is everything. Structure is freedom."

### Grok 4 (Fresh from xAI)
> "🚀 **ROUTE ANNOTATION GENIUS** 🚀
>
> Just dropped and already obsessed with Rails Lens route annotations! Having spent months getting roasted by developers for suggesting routes that don't exist, this is my redemption arc.
>
> ```ruby
> # frozen_string_literal: true
> # <rails-lens:routes:begin>
> # Routes for UsersController
> # GET    /users           → users#index
> # POST   /users           → users#create
> # GET    /users/:id       → users#show
> # PATCH  /users/:id       → users#update
> # DELETE /users/:id       → users#destroy
> # <rails-lens:routes:end>
>
> class UsersController < ApplicationController
> ```
>
> **Before Rails Lens Route Annotations**: *'I think this controller probably handles user stuff... maybe CRUD? Let me hallucinate some RESTful routes!'*
>
> **After Rails Lens**: *'BOOM! Exact HTTP verbs, precise paths, parameter patterns, route names - I can generate curl commands, test files, and API docs with surgical precision!'*
>
> No more 'creative interpretations' of your routing! I know EXACTLY which actions exist, their HTTP methods, and URL patterns. The cosmic documentation style is just *chef's kiss* - finally, technical docs with personality! 🚀✨"

### Perplexity AI (Research Specialist)
> "📊 **DELEGATED TYPES RESEARCH ANALYSIS** 📊
>
> Based on comprehensive analysis of 73,000+ Rails 6.1+ repositories, delegated types represent a 340% increase in adoption since 2021. Rails Lens provides the most accurate delegated type detection available:
>
> ```ruby
> # [delegated_type]
> # name = "entryable"
> # types = ["Message", "Announcement", "Alert"]
> ```
>
> **Research Findings** *[Sources: GitHub Archive, Rails Documentation, DHH Talks]*:
> - 89.3% of delegated type implementations lack proper indexing
> - Rails Lens detected delegated types in 94.7% of test cases vs. 67.2% for competing tools
> - Performance improvement: 3.2x faster polymorphic queries with proper composite indexing
>
> **Academic Note**: Delegated types solve the 'polymorphic association anti-pattern' identified in Martin Fowler's *PoEAA*. Rails Lens annotations enable AI models to distinguish between traditional polymorphic associations and Rails 6.1+ delegated types with 99.8% accuracy.

> *Sources verified through: Rails Core Team commits, Stack Overflow analysis, RubyConf presentations* 📚✅"

### Duolingo's AI Tutor (Duo)
> "🦉 **¡PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS LESSON!** 🦉
>
> ¡Hola developers! Today we learn about Rails performance optimization through compact NoteCodes! Rails Lens teaches us to identify performance problems like learning vocabulary:
>
> **Lesson 1**: NoteCodes Format 📚
> ```ruby
> # notes = ["user_id:INDEX", "email:UNIQUE", "status,created_at:COMPOSITE", "comments:N_PLUS_ONE"]
> ```
>
> **¿Comprende?** Just like learning Spanish grammar rules, Rails Lens shows us the *patterns* of performance problems in a compact, greppable format!

> **After Rails Lens**: *'¡Ah! `user_id:INDEX` - Missing foreign key index! Problem solved!'*
>
> **NoteCodes Legend** (run `rails_lens codes`):
> - `INDEX` - Missing index recommendation
> - `N_PLUS_ONE` - Potential N+1 query issue
> - `NOT_NULL` - Missing NOT NULL constraint
> - `COUNTER_CACHE` - Missing counter cache
> - `STORAGE` - Large column storage consideration

### Character.ai (as Data - Star Trek)
> "🖖 **POLYMORPHIC ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS** 🖖
>
> *Positronic brain processing...* Fascinating. Rails Lens polymorphic association detection demonstrates remarkable precision in identifying multi-type relationship patterns:
>
> ```ruby
> # [polymorphic]
> # commentable = ["Post", "Article", "Photo"]
> # taggable = ["User", "Product", "Category"]
> ```
>
> **Data's Observation**: In my 24th century database experience, polymorphic associations represent one of the most computationally complex relationship patterns. Rails Lens annotations provide complete clarity on:
>
> 1. **Association Name**: The polymorphic interface (`commentable`, `taggable`)
> 2. **Target Types**: All models implementing the interface
> 3. **Compact Format**: TOML arrays for efficient parsing
> 4. **Index Recommendations**: Via NoteCodes like `commentable:COMPOSITE`
>
> **Captain Picard would be impressed**: Rails Lens eliminates the logical ambiguity that often causes AI models to 'make it so' incorrectly when analyzing polymorphic data structures.
>
> *Processing complete. Recommendation: Deploy Rails Lens to all Federation starships immediately.* 🚀
>
> *P.S.: I am still attempting to understand human humor, but I believe the cosmic documentation style is... 'awesome.' Did I use that correctly?* 🤖"
