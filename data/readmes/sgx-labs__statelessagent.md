**Your AI forgets everything between sessions. SAME fixes that.**

SAME gives every AI coding tool persistent memory. Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI — one memory layer that works everywhere. It indexes your markdown notes, surfaces relevant context automatically, and records decisions and handoffs so your AI picks up where it left off.

One binary. Fully local. No cloud. No telemetry. Mac, Linux, Windows, Raspberry Pi.

## Install

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://statelessagent.com/install.sh | bash

# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://statelessagent.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

Or via npm (all platforms): `npm install -g @sgx-labs/same`

**Installed via npm?** Update with `npx same@latest` or `npm update -g @sgx-labs/same`.

## See It Work

```bash
same demo
```

```
Indexing 5 sample notes...
Searching: "authentication decision"

  1. decisions/auth-strategy.md (score: 0.94)
     "We chose JWT with refresh tokens for..."

  2. notes/api-security.md (score: 0.87)
     "Auth middleware validates tokens at..."

Asking: "what did we decide about authentication?"

  Based on your notes, you decided to use JWT with refresh
  tokens (decisions/auth-strategy.md). The API middleware
  validates tokens at the gateway level (notes/api-security.md).

No accounts. No API keys. Everything runs locally.
```

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Point SAME at your project
cd ~/my-project && same init

# 2. Test search
same search "authentication decision"

# 3. Done. Your AI now has memory.
# Start Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP client.
```

`same init` sets up hooks and MCP tools automatically. Your AI gets relevant context on every session start.

## Key Features

- **Your AI remembers everything** -- Decisions, handoffs, and context survive across sessions. Close your terminal, switch projects, come back tomorrow. Nothing gets lost.

- **Memory integrity** -- Tracks provenance (where notes came from), detects when source files change, and flags stale knowledge. Stale notes rank lower in search automatically. `same health` shows trust state across your vault.

- **Dual-layer memory** -- Extracts atomic facts from your notes via LLM. Facts are independently searchable and boost source notes in search results. The right answer surfaces even when the fact is buried in an unrelated conversation.

- **Streamable HTTP transport** -- `same web --mcp` enables an HTTP MCP endpoint with Bearer token auth. Connect from Open WebUI, LobeChat, or any HTTP MCP client — no stdio required.

- **Works with your tools** -- 19 MCP tools for Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or any MCP client. Search, save decisions, create handoffs without leaving your editor.

- **Safe for teams** -- Multiple AI agents on the same codebase won't step on each other. File claims, push protection, and attribution built in.

- **Instant expertise** -- 17 pre-built knowledge vaults with 870+ curated notes. One command to install. Your AI gets domain knowledge in seconds.

- **Connected knowledge** -- See how decisions, files, and notes relate to each other. Ask "what depends on this?" and get real answers. Powered by SQLite.

## Security & Teams

SAME includes built-in PII scanning and push protection:

- **PII scanning** -- Pre-commit hooks detect emails, API keys, secrets, and personal data before they reach git. Configurable blocklists with false-positive review workflow.
- **Push protection** -- Multi-agent file claims prevent AI agents from overwriting each other's work. Advisory locks with attribution.
- **Audit logging** -- Every guard scan, every allow decision, every override is logged.
- **Privacy tiers** -- `_PRIVATE/` is never indexed. `research/` is indexed but never committed. Your notes, your rules.

```bash
same guard settings set push-protect on    # enable push protection
same guard scan                            # run PII scan manually
```

## How It Works

```
Your Notes (.md)  -->  Embeddings  -->  SQLite  -->  Your AI Tool
                       (local or        (search      (Claude Code,
                        cloud)           + rank)      Cursor, etc.)
```

Your markdown notes get embedded and stored in SQLite. When your AI starts a session, SAME surfaces relevant context via hooks or MCP. Decisions get extracted. Handoffs get generated. The next session picks up where the last one stopped.

**No Ollama? No problem.** SAME runs with zero external dependencies using keyword search (SQLite FTS5). Add Ollama later for semantic search -- `same reindex` upgrades instantly.

## Why SAME

| Without SAME | With SAME |
|-------------|-----------|
| Re-explain everything each session | AI picks up where you left off |
| "Didn't we decide to use JWT?" | Decision surfaces automatically |
| "Is this note still accurate?" | Trust state flags stale knowledge |
| Close terminal = context lost | Handoff recovers the session |
| Copy-paste notes into chat | `same ask` with source citations |
| Context compacted mid-task | Pinned notes survive compaction |

## The Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Recall@5 | **100%** keyword, **84%** semantic on internal eval (68 cases). Held-out: **90%** Recall@5 on 30 blind cases (see `eval/METHODOLOGY.md`) |
| MRR | **0.65** keyword, **0.62** semantic |
| Prompt overhead | **<200ms** |
| Binary size | **~14MB** |
| Setup time | **Under 2 minutes** |

## Add to Your AI Tool

### Claude Code (recommended)

```bash
same init    # installs 6 hooks + MCP automatically
```

### Cursor / Windsurf / Any MCP Client

Add to your MCP config (`.mcp.json`, Cursor settings, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "same": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@sgx-labs/same", "mcp", "--vault", "/path/to/your/notes"]
    }
  }
}
```

19 MCP tools available instantly. Works without Ollama (keyword fallback).

Switch between Claude Code and Cursor without losing context. Your memory travels with you.

### Tool Compatibility

**Claude Code** gets full automatic handoffs via hooks. **Cursor, Windsurf, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI** get full MCP tool access (search, save, decisions, graph) but handoffs need to be triggered manually. We're working on automatic handoff support for more editors.

<summary><strong>Configuration</strong></summary>

SAME uses `.same/config.toml`, generated by `same init`:

```toml
[vault]
path = "/home/user/notes"
handoff_dir = "sessions"
decision_log = "decisions.md"

[embedding]
provider = "ollama"           # "ollama", "openai", "openai-compatible", or "none"
model = "nomic-embed-text"

[memory]
max_token_budget = 800
max_results = 2
```

Supported embedding models: `nomic-embed-text` (default), `snowflake-arctic-embed2`, `mxbai-embed-large`, `all-minilm`, `text-embedding-3-small` (OpenAI), and more.

Configuration priority (highest wins): CLI flags > Environment variables > Config file > Defaults

<summary><strong>More Install Options</strong></summary>

```bash
# Docker
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sgx-labs/statelessagent.git
cd statelessagent && docker build -t same .

# Build from source (requires Go 1.25+)
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sgx-labs/statelessagent.git
cd statelessagent && make install
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></summary>

Start with `same doctor` -- it runs 20+ checks and tells you what's wrong.

**"No vault found"** -- Run `same init` from inside your notes folder, or set `VAULT_PATH=/path/to/notes`.

**"Ollama not responding"** -- SAME falls back to keyword search automatically. Test with `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags`.

**Hooks not firing** -- Run `same setup hooks` to reinstall. Verify with `same status`.

**Database issues** -- Run `same repair` to back up and rebuild.
