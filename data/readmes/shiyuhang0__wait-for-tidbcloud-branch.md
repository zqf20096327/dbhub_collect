# wait-for-tidbcloud-branch

A JavaScript action that works with [TiDB Cloud App](https://github.com/apps/tidb-cloud). It allows you to:

- Wait for TiDB Cloud Branch check which created by TiDB Cloud App to complete.
- Generate a SQL user for this TiDB Cloud branch.


## Usage

```
uses: shiyuhang0/wait-for-tidbcloud-branch@v0
with:
  token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  publicKey: ${{ secrets.TIDB_CLOUD_API_PUBLIC_KEY }}
  privateKey: ${{ secrets.TIDB_CLOUD_API_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

## Inputs

The action supports the following inputs:
- token - (required) The GitHub token to use for making API requests. Typically, this would be set to ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}.
- publicKey - (required) The public key of TiDB Cloud api. Generate it from [TiDB Cloud](https://tidbcloud.com/).
- privateKey - (required) The private key of TiDB Cloud api. Generate it from [TiDB Cloud](https://tidbcloud.com/).
- intervalSeconds - (optional) The interval seconds to check the status of TiDB Cloud Branch check. Default is 10.
- timeoutSeconds - (optional) The timeout seconds to wait for TiDB Cloud Branch check. Default is 300.
- addMask - (optional) Whether to add mask for the password output. Default is true.

## Outputs

The action provide the following outputs:

- host - The host of the TiDB Cloud branch.
- user - The user of the TiDB Cloud branch.
- password - The password of the TiDB Cloud branch.

## Best practices

Set TiDB Cloud API publicKey and privateKey in your action secrets, and use them in your workflow.

Here is an example of how to use this action in a single job:

```
steps:
  - name: Wait for TiDB Cloud branch ready
    uses: shiyuhang0/wait-for-tidbcloud-branch@v0
    id: wait-for-branch
    with:
      token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      publicKey: ${{ secrets.TIDB_CLOUD_API_PUBLIC_KEY }}
      privateKey: ${{ secrets.TIDB_CLOUD_API_PRIVATE_KEY }}

  - name: Use the output
     run: |
        echo "The host is ${{ steps.wait-for-branch.outputs.host }}"
        echo "The user is ${{ steps.wait-for-branch.outputs.user }}"
        echo "The password is ${{ steps.wait-for-branch.outputs.password }}"
```

Here is an example of how to use this action for multiple jobs. 

> You must set addMask to false if you want to use the password in other jobs. Because GitHub action does not support sharing secrets between jobs now. See [this discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/13082) for more details.
