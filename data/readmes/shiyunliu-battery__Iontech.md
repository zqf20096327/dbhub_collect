### 2. Lithium-Ion Battery Field Data: 28 LFP battery systems with 8 cells in series, up to 5 years of operation
This data set contains data from 28 portable 24V lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery systems with approximately 160Ah nominal capacity. Each system's specific use case is unknown, but battery systems of this size are typically used as power sources for recreational vehicles, solar energy storage, and more.

All battery systems in this data set showed some form of unsatisfactory behavior and were returned to the manufacturer. Many reasons can cause a consumer to return a battery to the manufacturer for maintenance. The user's individual decisions may be motivated by personal judgment, BMS warnings, or customer support advice. This data set comprises a very small fraction of batteries sold of this version. Therefore, this data set is biased and not representative of the operational data of the entire population of this system version. An improved version replaced this battery system type. The battery system manufacturer provided the data set for this study and allowed its open-source release under the condition of anonymity.

Each battery system consists of 8 prismatic cells in series. Each system has one load current sensor, and each cell has one voltage sensor. The four temperature sensors are placed between adjacent cells, i.e., each temperature sensor is shared by two cells. Furthermore, the battery systems have active cell balancing. The available measurements vary from a single month to five years. Consequently, the number of data rows per system varies from several thousand to millions, depending on the duration of battery operation. The data set contains a total of 133 million rows of measurements.

### 3. Battery Failure Databank
The Battery Failure Databank features data collected from hundreds of abuse tests conducted on commercial lithium-ion batteries. Methods of abuse include nail penetration, thermal abuse, and internal short-circuiting.

This databank provides the heat output from cells undergoing thermal runaway, the breakdown of heat from the cell casing and its ejected contents, as well as the mass of the cells before and after thermal runaway and the quantity of mass ejected from the cell. The databank also organizes the stored data for understanding test-to-test variability for each cell type and trigger mechanism combination.

Additionally, most tests feature associated high-speed X-ray radiography videos for review alongside the data.

### 38. Dataset - Dynamic cycling enhances battery lifetime
The study presents a systematic comparison of dynamic discharge profiles, representative of electric vehicle driving, with constant-current discharge profiles, commonly used in laboratory testing. The results indicate that dynamic discharge profiles can extend the lifetime of lithium-ion batteries significantly. Specifically, under identical average current and voltage conditions, dynamic profiles result in up to a 38% increase in equivalent full cycles at the battery's end-of-life. This enhancement is attributed to the influence of low-frequency current pulses and time-induced aging, as revealed through explainable machine learning. These findings emphasize the necessity of incorporating realistic load profiles in the evaluation of new battery chemistries and designs to better understand aging mechanisms and improve battery performance.

 ### 50. Aging dataset LCO battery with mechanical measurements

Aging dataset of a commercial 22Ah LCO-graphite pouch Li-Po battery.
The cycling procedure involves aging steps consisting of 22 aging cycles at 1C CC discharge and C/2 CC-CV charge, with no pauses in between. Periodic RPTs are carried out after each aging step. In particular, two series of RPTs are alternated, referred to as RPT-A and RPT-B, with this pattern: 22 aging cycles -> RPT-A -> 22 aging cycles -> RPT-A + RPT-B -> repeat.
The RPT-A consists of three high rate cycles (1C CC discharge and C/2 CC-CV charge) with 1 hour rest.
The RPT-B consists of three high rate cycles (1C CC discharge and C/2 CC-CV charge) with 1 hour rest, one low rate cycle (C/20) and the HPPC test. In this way, high rate test cycles are carried out periodically every 25 cycles (22 aging + 3 test), whereas low rate test cycles and HPPC are carried out every 50 cycles. The exact number at which each reference performance test was carried out is reported in the sixth column of the data structure.

In total, 1125 cycles were achieved untill SOH 70%.

The cycling reference performance tests (high rate cycling 1C-C/2, and low rate cycling C/20-C/20) are reported in the MATLAB structure called Aging_Dataset_Cycling. On the other, the data of the HPPC tests are reported in the MATLAB structure called Aging_Dataset_HPPC.

The data structure of cycling reference performance tests is a MATLAB cell organized so that in the first row there are data of RPT-A (high rate cycles), and in the second row the data of RPT-B (low rate cycles). In the first column there are discharge data, in the second column the charge data, in the third column the data recorded in the one hour rest after discharge and in the fourth column the data recorded in the one hour rest after charge. In each element of this 2x4 matrix there is a cell containing the structures referring to each reference performance tests. The different reference performance tests are organized so that in the row there are the reference performance tests carried out at different aging cycles (detailed in the vector in the sixth column of the main data structure) and in the column there are the tests repeated at the same aging cycles for statistical studies. Generally RPT-A tests are repeated three times and RPT-B tests are repeated one times. Then, each cell, e.g. D{1,1}{1,1} contains a structure with the data of that test coded as explained in the bullet list below.

 ### 53. An ultrasonic and deep-learning dataset for real-time State of Charge estimation in large-format lithium-ion cells

 This dataset contains experimentally collected ultrasonic waveforms acquired from large-format lithium-ion pouch cells during controlled charging and discharging procedures. Four ultrasonic sensors were arranged around each cell, enabling multiple bidirectional actuator–receiver transmission paths.

The collected signals were processed into two complementary data forms:  
(1) time-series CSV files containing the raw waveform amplitudes for each sensor pair, and  
(2) waveform-derived image representations suitable for convolutional neural network–based transfer learning. Charging data follow the naming convention `SignalA_B_SoC_raw.csv`, while discharging data follow `SignalA_B_SoCD_raw.csv`, where A and B denote the actuator and receiver sensor IDs.
