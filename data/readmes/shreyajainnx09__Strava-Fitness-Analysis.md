## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores wearable fitness-tracker data to understand **when, how, and how much users are physically active**.

The analysis takes raw fitness data through a complete data analytics pipeline:

```

       ↓
Python Exploratory Data Analysis
       ↓
MySQL / SQL Analysis
       ↓

Actionable Insights
```

The project focuses on identifying:

| | Focus Area |
|---|---|
| 📅 | Weekly activity patterns |
| ⏰ | Hourly activity patterns |
| 👟 | Step-count behaviour |
| 🔥 | Relationship between steps and calories burned |
| 👥 | Differences in user activity levels |
| 😴 | Availability of sleep data |
| 🎯 | Opportunities for personalized fitness engagement |

---

## 🎯 Business Questions

The analysis was designed around five core questions:

1. **📅 When are users most active during the week?**
   Which days have the highest and lowest average step counts?

2. **⏰ When are users most active during the day?**
   At what hours does physical activity increase, peak, and decline?

3. **🔥 Do more steps correspond to more calories burned?**
   What relationship exists between daily step count and calories burned?

4. **👥 How different are users from one another?**
   Can users be grouped into meaningful activity-level segments?

5. **😴 How much sleep data is available?**
   Does limited sleep tracking affect the depth of sleep-related analysis?

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

The project uses the **FitBit Fitness Tracker Data** dataset, containing activity, calorie, intensity, sleep, heart-rate, weight and other fitness-tracking information collected at different levels of granularity.

| Dataset | Description |
|---|---|
| `dailyActivity` | Daily activity, steps, distance, calories and intensity |
| `hourlySteps` | Hourly step counts |
| `hourlyCalories` | Hourly calories burned |
| `hourlyIntensities` | Hourly activity intensity |
| `minuteCalories` | Minute-level calorie data |
| `minuteSteps` | Minute-level step data |
| `minuteSleep` | Minute-level sleep information |
| `minuteMETs` | Minute-level MET measurements |
| `minuteIntensities` | Minute-level activity intensity |
| `heartrate` | Heart-rate measurements |
| `weightLogInfo` | User weight-log information |

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Python and Pandas were used to prepare the raw datasets for analysis. The preprocessing workflow included:

- ✅ Checking dataset structure
- ✅ Inspecting data types
- ✅ Checking for missing values
- ✅ Checking for duplicate records
- ✅ Converting date/time columns into appropriate formats
- ✅ Merging relevant activity datasets
- ✅ Combining daily activity and sleep information
- ✅ Creating analytical datasets for SQL and Tableau

The cleaned datasets were then used for further analysis and visualization.

---

## 🐍 Python Analysis

Python was used for data cleaning, exploration, and analytical preparation.

**Libraries used**

`Python` · `Pandas` · `NumPy` · `Matplotlib`

**Analysis included**

| Category | Details |
|---|---|
| Activity | Daily, hourly, and step-count analysis |
| Energy | Calories burned & activity intensity |
| Behaviour | Day-of-week and hour-of-day patterns |
| Users | User-level activity patterns & segmentation |
| Statistics | Correlation analysis |
| Sleep | Sleep-data analysis |

Python was also used to prepare the datasets that were later used in the SQL and Tableau stages.

---

## 🗄️ SQL / MySQL Analysis

The cleaned datasets were loaded into MySQL for structured querying and analysis. SQL was used to investigate:

- Daily activity patterns
- Hourly activity patterns
- User-level behaviour
- Step and calorie relationships
- Activity-level segmentation
- Aggregated fitness metrics

The SQL analysis provided structured outputs that were then used for Tableau visualization.

---

## 📊 Tableau Dashboard

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/shreya.jain4118/viz/Book1_17874683186530/Dashboard1">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/🚀%20OPEN%20INTERACTIVE%20TABLEAU%20DASHBOARD-E97627?style=for-the-badge&logo=tableau&logoColor=white"/>
  </a>
</p>

The dashboard contains three main analytical views:

| View | What it Shows |
|---|---|
| 📅 **Average Steps by Day of Week** | How average activity changes across the days of the week |
| ⏰ **Average Steps by Hour** | The daily rhythm of physical activity across different hours |
| 🔥 **Steps vs. Calories** | The relationship between daily steps and calories burned across users |

---

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. 📅 Weekly Activity Pattern
- Activity varies throughout the week
- **Tuesday** and **Saturday** stand out as the most active days
- **Sunday** has the lowest average step count
- The gap between the highest and lowest activity days is moderate
- Overall, users show relatively stable weekly activity patterns

### 2. ⏰ Hourly Activity Pattern
- Activity follows a clear daily rhythm
- Minimal activity overnight, roughly **12 AM – 5 AM**
- Steps increase steadily through the morning
- Activity stays elevated through the afternoon and early evening
- Clearest peak occurs around **6–7 PM**
- Activity gradually tapers off later at night

### 3. 🔥 Steps vs. Calories

There is a clear positive relationship between daily steps and calories burned:

```
More Steps  →  Higher Activity  →  More Calories Burned
```

However, the relationship is **not perfectly linear** — different users can burn different amounts of calories at similar step counts, potentially due to differences in activity intensity, body composition, or activity type.

### 4. 😴 Sleep Data Coverage
- Fewer users logged sleep data compared with activity data
- Because of this limited coverage, sleep-specific analysis was more restricted and was not included as a core dashboard view
- Improving sleep-data collection could enable deeper analysis of the relationship between **sleep ↔ activity ↔ calories**

---

## 👥 User Activity Segmentation

Users were segmented according to their average daily step counts:

| Segment | Average Daily Steps |
|---|---:|
| 🪑 Sedentary | Under 5,000 |
| 🚶 Lightly Active | 5,000 – 7,499 |
| 🏃 Moderately Active | 7,500 – 9,999 |
| 🏃‍♀️ Very Active | 10,000+ |

The user base shows variation across activity levels — an opportunity for **personalized fitness goals** rather than one identical target for every user.

---

## 🎯 Actionable Recommendations

### 📆 1. Focus Engagement on Low-Activity Days
Since Tuesday and Saturday already show high activity, engagement campaigns could focus more heavily on lower-activity days, particularly Sunday.

> Step challenges · Activity reminders · Weekend fitness campaigns · Personalized goals

### 🌆 2. Use the Evening Activity Window
The 6–7 PM activity peak is a valuable engagement window.

> Workout recommendations · Fitness reminders · Social challenges · Activity prompts

### 😴 3. Encourage Consistent Sleep Tracking
Improving sleep-data collection could enable deeper analysis of:

> Sleep vs. activity · Sleep vs. calorie expenditure · Sleep patterns across activity segments · Recovery and activity behaviour

### 🎯 4. Personalize Fitness Goals

Personalized targets could be more effective than one universal step goal:

| Segment | Suggested Focus |
|---|---|
| Sedentary | Gradual activity increase |
| Lightly Active | Moderate step progression |
| Moderately Active | Higher activity targets |
| Very Active | Performance-focused goals |
