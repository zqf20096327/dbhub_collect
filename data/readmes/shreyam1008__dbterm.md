`dbterm` is one keyboard-first binary for connecting to database servers, exploring and querying data, operating local services, and protecting local or remote databases with durable backups.

Save a PostgreSQL or MySQL server login once—without memorizing a database name—then browse every database that account can access. Open one temporarily with the same credentials, choose a default, or save a separate database connection only when you need one.

## What ships today

| Area | Current capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| **Connections** | PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, SQLite, Turso/LibSQL, and Cloudflare D1; server-first PostgreSQL/MySQL logins; database discovery; optional defaults; reusable prefilled local/cloud connection forms; one stable per-user profile even after an accidental `sudo dbterm` launch. |
| **Data workspace** | Local schema-aware SQL autocomplete, schema/object discovery, named Change Profiler anchors with row/cell/schema diffs, a command/object/recent-SQL palette, persistent table pins, query history, asynchronous cancellable execution, typed results, composable `AND` filters, sorting, first/last pagination, bidirectional related-row navigation, same-value discovery, schema inspection, and streamed CSV export. |
| **Database operations** | PostgreSQL/MySQL SQL-dump import with progress and cancellation, plus local MySQL/PostgreSQL service status, start, stop, install guidance, saved-login connection, and server-wide database browsing. |
| **Local agent access** | STDIO MCP server for scoped schema inspection, bounded read-only SQL, query plans, and declared relationship following; stored secrets stay hidden and profile changes require explicit opt-in. |
| **Backup and recovery** | Instant or scheduled backups from local or remote sources to absolute local or OS-mounted destinations; native dumps, private staging, portable manifests, verification, compression, age encryption, SHA-256 history, retention, email alerts, native OS agents, content inspection, and guarded PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite restore. |

The current backup-generation routes are:

| Source | Absolute local / OS-mounted destination |
| --- | --- |
| **Local database** | Supported |
| **Remote / cloud database** | Supported |

New `rclone://...` generation jobs fail closed because generic rclone finalization cannot guarantee dbterm's atomic create-only publication rule across backends. Use independent copy jobs for verified off-machine copies: push local artifacts to local or pinned-SFTP destinations, or pull from local, pinned-SFTP, or rclone sources into a local vault. Generic rclone push remains disabled for the same immutability reason.

PostgreSQL uses custom `pg_dump` archives; MySQL/MariaDB uses single-database `mysqldump` SQL; SQLite uses a consistent built-in snapshot; Turso uses a single-transaction logical export; and D1 uses Cloudflare's native export API. Restore currently targets PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, and local SQLite.

### Debian / Ubuntu

Stable releases include versioned amd64 and arm64 `.deb` artifacts. The signed
APT repository is published from the same release artifacts; see the
[distribution guide](https://github.com/shreyam1008/dbterm/blob/main/packaging/PACKAGING.md) for the repository key and install
commands.

### Snap candidate

The release workflow also attaches `dbterm_<version>_amd64.snap`. It uses classic
confinement so the terminal client can reach local database files, backup paths,
and the user's local MCP STDIO process. Snap Store publication is a separate
candidate/review step and is not presented as live until an anonymous listing
check is recorded.

## Supported databases

| Database | Status |
| --- | --- |
| PostgreSQL | Query + schema inspector + custom-archive backup + content-detected restore + service controls |
| MySQL / MariaDB | Query + schema inspector + single-database SQL backup + content-detected restore + service controls |
| SQLite | Query + schema inspector + consistent snapshot backup + guarded staged snapshot/SQL restore |
| Turso (LibSQL) | Cloud SQLite-compatible querying + schema inspector + transaction-backed logical SQL backup |
| Cloudflare D1 | D1 API-backed SQL querying + schema inspector + Cloudflare-native SQL export |

For MySQL or PostgreSQL, the database name is optional: save the server login once, then choose from every database visible to that account. **Save & Connect** automatically opens the database browser when no default is set. From the Dashboard, highlight a server and press **A** to browse again; **Enter** opens any database with the same saved login, **D** makes it the optional default, and **N** saves it as a separate connection only when that is useful (for example, a scheduled backup). SQLite, Turso, and Cloudflare D1 use the same Dashboard shortcut to prefill their reusable local/cloud scope details.

dbterm keeps one connection profile for the signed-in OS user. Run the TUI normally; if it is accidentally launched as `sudo dbterm`, dbterm immediately hands control back to the invoking user before reading or writing connections, settings, backup plans, or state. Explicit system-service operations, updates, and uninstalls retain the requested elevation. If an older version already saved connections under root, dbterm reports that legacy profile; `sudo dbterm connections recover-sudo` merges its unique connections into the user profile, backs up an existing user file, restores user ownership, and leaves the root file unchanged. In **Services → Connect**, choose a saved local database login or enter a database username/password; the Linux sudo password is not a database password. Ubuntu's MySQL `root` account commonly uses socket-only authentication, so a TCP-capable MySQL user is needed for the interactive client.

Updating replaces only the dbterm executable. Saved connections, settings, query history, backup plans/run history, completed backup artifacts, and Change Profiler anchors remain in their per-user config/state locations. When `sudo dbterm --update` is needed for a system-installed binary, dbterm deliberately leaves the invoking user's data and running backup agent untouched instead of resolving a root-owned profile. Run `dbterm --info` without sudo before or after an update to see the exact connection, backup-catalog, and Change Profiler paths.

| `Ctrl + C` | Cancel an active query/import/export; otherwise quit |

## SQL autocomplete

Autocomplete runs entirely inside dbterm. Typing a prefix such as `sel` opens ranked SQL keywords; relation contexts such as `FROM` and `JOIN` prioritize live tables and views and tolerate small spelling mistakes; `alias.` and column contexts prioritize columns from referenced or selected tables. On an empty query, `Ctrl+Space` offers ready, read-only queries for the selected table—including preview, row count, named-column, newest-row, and useful grouped summaries when matching columns exist. After a complete table name it offers safe next clauses such as a row limit, recent-first ordering, and a non-NULL filter. The metadata catalog is refreshed off the typing path, so opening or accepting a suggestion never performs a network or database query. Use Up/Down to choose, `Tab` or `Enter` to insert, and `Esc` to dismiss. Enter executes the query when suggestions are closed.

The Tables sidebar reuses that local catalog as a searchable schema tree. Right expands a table and then enters its first column; Left returns to the parent and then collapses it. Only one table is expanded at a time. Column names appear immediately; key/nullability badges and types are loaded asynchronously for the expanded table. Sidebar type-ahead searches tables, views, and other database objects without mixing in columns; Up/Down cycles through matching objects and Enter opens the highlighted match. The command palette still searches collapsed columns, and choosing a palette column expands it in the sidebar, opens its table, and selects the corresponding Results header. On wide layouts, drag the Tables panel's right border to resize the sidebar.

## Change Profiler

Press `Alt+W`, then `N`, to create a named before/after anchor. The review screen estimates known table sizes, keeps risky tables excluded until explicitly selected, and lets `A` include the whole database in one step. Capture and scan loaders show the current phase, table position, rows, bytes, elapsed time, rate, approximate percentage, and table ETA when row estimates are available.

The portable engine works across every supported database without installing triggers or server objects. It streams rows, compares stable-key hashes, and adaptively compresses exact before-values in the private local profiler store. PostgreSQL/MySQL use a consistent repeatable-read snapshot, SQLite/Turso use a transaction, and Cloudflare D1 is reported as best-effort. Database-native WAL/binlog capture is intentionally not enabled automatically because it requires engine-specific privileges/configuration and can retain server logs when a consumer stops.

## Backup Center

Backup Center keeps recovery evidence and copy health visible beside its plans. `H` opens searchable combined Activity; `L` opens filterable, following agent logs. Creation forms start with the essentials, offer **Browse…** beside local folders, and group advanced options under `F4`, including configurable generation retries. See the [complete backup guide](https://dbterm.shreyam1008.com.np/backup.md).

For a one-off backup, press `Alt+B` from Tables, Query, or Results; use `F2` for the native folder chooser or type an absolute local/OS-mounted path. `F3` refreshes destination and private-staging capacity. For durable jobs, press `B` on Dashboard or `Alt+K` anywhere. `N` then chooses an existing saved database or lets you add one; `Ctrl+N` adds another database from the plan form. `Ctrl+B` on a highlighted Dashboard connection starts with it preselected.

A backup job creates a full engine-native database recovery point by default. dbterm does not silently configure database-native incremental backup, WAL/binlog archiving, or point-in-time recovery. Copy jobs can transfer only the completed artifacts that a destination is missing, which saves network work but does not turn those full snapshots into incremental database backups.

A backup plan binds one saved local or remote connection to:

- an absolute local or OS-mounted folder, with an optional native GUI folder chooser and local volume/free-space details;
- manual, interval, daily, or weekly timing with an IANA timezone, including multiple wall-clock times on one daily or weekly plan;
- a safe filename template using `{job}`, `{connection}`, `{database}`, `{engine}`, `{date}`, `{time}`, `{timestamp}`, and `{run}`;
- no compression, gzip, ZIP, or single-worker Zstandard with a chosen level;
- optional interoperable age X25519 encryption (the job stores only the public `age1…` recipient);
- latest-count, maximum-age, and maximum-total-size retention;
- optional Gmail-ready or custom SMTP notifications on failure, success, or both;
- zero or more required/optional application-folder file sets with include/exclude patterns; and
- a timeout, enabled state, next run, live byte/phase progress, last result, SHA-256, notification outcome, and artifact history.

Database-only plans keep the existing native artifact. Adding file sets creates a self-contained dbterm bundle with the native database artifact and relative file trees. Roots stay private in the producer catalog; symlinks, reparse points, path escapes, and non-regular files are refused. Live folders are captured with best-effort consistency and change detection, not as an atomic application or filesystem snapshot. A required set fails the run if a safe capture cannot be completed, while an optional set is atomically omitted with a portable warning.

Artifacts are staged privately, validated, synced, and published without replacing an existing file. Each successful artifact gets an immutable `.dbterm.json` sidecar containing its stable identity, size, SHA-256, format, producer, creation time, and verification result without connection secrets. Retention only removes successful artifacts recorded for that exact job and still contained by its destination; it keeps the newest success and rechecks identity, size, and checksum before deletion. Use `P` in Backup Center or `backup prune --yes` to enforce a changed policy immediately. Removing dbterm, the agent, or a job never removes unrelated or surviving backup files.

### Independent recovery copies

Backup Center's **Copies** view and `dbterm backup copy` keep generation health separate from transfer health. A valid local backup remains valid when an off-machine copy fails. Every transfer is driven by a completed portable manifest, compares artifact identity and checksum rather than filenames, processes missing recovery points oldest-first, stages privately, verifies SHA-256 and format, and publishes without replacing a completed destination.

- **Local copy:** copy between two absolute local or OS-mounted locations.
- **Push:** the producer sends a local published artifact to a local destination or pinned SFTP endpoint; a job-bound push may run immediately after backup success.
- **Pull:** the vault scans a local folder, pinned SFTP source, or `rclone://remote/path`, then stores verified copies locally. This is useful when the producer must not hold vault credentials.

SFTP uses a dedicated unencrypted private identity plus an explicitly pinned `SHA256:...` host-key fingerprint. `ssh://` is accepted only as an alias for the SFTP subsystem; dbterm does not execute SCP or a remote shell. rclone is supported as a pull source, but rclone push is intentionally disabled because generic rclone finalization cannot prove create-only publication across every backend.

```bash
dbterm backup copy create --name vault-pull --mode pull \
  --source sftp://backup@producer/archives --destination /mnt/vault \
  --identity /etc/dbterm/vault-ed25519 --host-key SHA256:... \
  --trigger timed --at 02:30 --at 14:30 --timezone Asia/Kolkata
dbterm backup copy test vault-pull
dbterm backup copy run vault-pull
dbterm backup copy enable vault-pull
```

Copy jobs have their own retries, run history, throughput, freshness, retention, email policy, and leases. Backup Center progressively exposes Gmail-ready or custom SMTP/TLS fields and a mail-only delivery test; saved app passwords stay masked and no CLI password flag is provided. Copy jobs are disabled by default so `dbterm backup copy test <copy>` can check the endpoint first; the read-only test does not modify backup files. Automatic triggers remain blocked until a manual `copy run` has transferred and verified a real artifact under the current transport settings. Use `copy prune` without `--yes` for a dry-run, and `copy inspect` to download a remote recovery point into private temporary storage, verify it against its manifest/catalog record, inspect it, and remove the temporary stage.

Local copy destinations can optionally require a volume sentinel with `--volume-mode already-mounted|os-managed`. Linux deployments may opt into `managed-linux-block-device` with an exact filesystem UUID/type and sentinel. Managed mode never formats or repairs a disk, and its mount, unmount, sync, and optional power-off operations require deployment-specific, narrowly scoped host privileges and hardware setup. `copy test` proves only the currently mounted identity; exercise the lifecycle with a supervised manual run before enabling it.

“Catch up missed run” executes one overdue occurrence after sleep/restart; it does not replay every missed interval. When catch-up is off, an occurrence more than two minutes late is skipped and the cadence advances to the next future time.

The headless agent has two explicit scopes. Desktop/user mode is the no-admin default:

| OS | Desktop/user registration | Lifetime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | `systemd --user` | User manager; enable lingering explicitly for post-logout operation |
| macOS | `launchd` LaunchAgent | Logged-in user session |
| Windows | Task Scheduler logon task | Logged-in user session |

Server/system mode is an explicit elevated installation. It starts at boot, preserves the chosen dbterm config/state/log paths, and never silently falls back to desktop mode:

| OS | Server/system registration | Runs as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | system `systemd` unit | Selected non-root user |
| macOS | `/Library/LaunchDaemons` LaunchDaemon | Selected non-root user |
| Windows | Task Scheduler boot task | LocalSystem; paths must be local and accessible to SYSTEM |

dbterm keeps control data in native per-user locations (run `dbterm backup paths` for the exact paths on the current machine):

| OS | Config | State / catalog | Logs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/dbterm` | `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/dbterm` | state directory + `/logs` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/dbterm` | `~/Library/Application Support/dbterm` | `~/Library/Logs/dbterm` |
| Windows | `%AppData%\dbterm` | `%LocalAppData%\dbterm` | `%LocalAppData%\dbterm\logs` |

Routine scheduler activity is written to the rolling `<logs>/dbterm-backup-agent.log`; its active file and one archive are each capped at 5 MiB. Backup Center can show/copy its tail and `dbterm backup logs` prints it over SSH. Linux/macOS also keep exceptional native-manager stdout/stderr files there. The user registrations are `dbterm-backup.service`, `io.github.shreyam1008.dbterm.backup`, and `dbterm Backup Agent`; system scope uses the machine manager (and a distinct Windows system task).

Saved connections/settings are atomic private JSON files; jobs, leases, run history, checksums, and heartbeats live in `backup/backups.db`. Before wrapping a backup, dbterm keeps the raw native dump and temporary credential file under the private state path `backup/staging`; crash remnants older than 48 hours are removed on a later run. The completed artifact is written only to the destination you selected. Allow enough free space in private state for one uncompressed native dump and enough destination space for one in-progress wrapped artifact.

Unattended jobs reuse the credentials in the saved connection. Those credentials are kept in dbterm's per-user `connections.json` with private-file creation; they are not stored in an OS keyring or encrypted by the backup's age recipient. SMTP app passwords likewise remain plaintext in the private `backups.db` catalog so the agent can authenticate. They are redacted from CLI JSON, UI diagnostics, logs, and SMTP errors. Protect the OS account and dbterm directories, and use dedicated revocable app passwords.

Install it from Backup Center with `A`, or run:

```bash
dbterm backup service install
dbterm backup service status
dbterm backup service status --all
```

Start/stop controls only the current runtime. `backup service enable` and `disable` control boot/login startup independently. Server installation requires explicit existing paths and elevation; on Linux, Backup Center prints a copyable command such as:

```bash
sudo dbterm backup service install --system --run-as "$USER" \
  --config-dir "$HOME/.config/dbterm" \
  --state-dir "$HOME/.local/state/dbterm" \
  --log-dir "$HOME/.local/state/dbterm/logs"
```

Resolve the paths with `dbterm backup paths` before elevation. ACL-only Unix grants may require manual review; Windows server mode cannot rely on a user's mapped drive.

The native manager records the exact dbterm executable path. Service installation therefore rejects disposable `go run` executables: use an installed release or run `make build`, launch `./dbterm`, and install the agent from that stable binary.

The TUI and agent share a transactional SQLite catalog with expiring per-job leases, so manual and scheduled runs cannot overlap. The foreground fallback `dbterm backup agent` is useful in containers or systems without a supported native user manager.

Live progress is deliberately honest: wrapping reports a determinate byte bar and ETA; native clients that do not expose a trustworthy total report live file growth, elapsed time, and activity instead of a fabricated percentage. Agent status separates registration, startup policy, manager runtime, heartbeat, process lock, PID, uptime, resident memory, and any active scheduled phase.

### Encryption

Generate an age identity once:

```bash
dbterm backup keygen
dbterm backup keycheck --identity ./age-identity.txt --recipient age1...
```

Copy the printed public recipient into a job. Keep the private identity separately from off-site backups; it is needed only to inspect or restore encrypted artifacts. `keycheck` encrypts and decrypts a disposable in-memory challenge so you can test that recovery key before depending on it. dbterm does not store backup passphrases in unattended job configuration.

By default, `keygen` writes the private identity under dbterm's config directory. As a recovery safeguard, `--uninstall --purge` refuses to delete a discovered private age identity or backup-like file. Move the identity somewhere safe—or explicitly remove it yourself—before retrying a purge.

### Inspect and restore

Backup Center → `I` identifies gzip, Zstandard, single-entry ZIP, age, and dbterm bundle layers recursively, then detects PostgreSQL custom/tar/plain SQL, MySQL SQL, SQLite databases, or SQLite SQL from bytes—not the filename. Bundle inspection also reports each included application file set. Misleading extensions produce a warning. Locked age files stay “encrypted” until an identity is selected; ambiguous generic SQL is reported but deliberately blocked from restore rather than guessed.

Inspection supports at most three nested wrappers. Each decoded layer defaults to a 1 GiB safety cap and is materialized in the OS temporary directory rather than held in memory. Set **Max Decoded GiB** in the TUI or pass `--max-decoded-gib N` to `inspect` and `restore` for a larger trusted backup; ensure the temporary directory has enough free space for the decoded layers.

The same guarded flow is scriptable. Consent is never implied:

```bash
dbterm backup inspect --identity ./age-identity.txt ./prod.dump.zst.age
dbterm backup restore --connection production --identity ./age-identity.txt --yes ./prod.dump.zst.age
dbterm backup copy inspect vault-copy --identity ./age-identity.txt
```

Clean mode additionally requires `--confirm-clean` with the exact database name (or normalized SQLite path).

Restore is preview-first. The detected database engine must match the chosen saved connection. Merge is the default; PostgreSQL clean restore is opt-in and shown as destructive. PostgreSQL restores use transactional official clients where supported. MySQL warns that earlier statements may remain after a failure. SQLite snapshots and SQL dumps restore through a verified staging database while keeping a pre-restore copy; SQL is streamed through the `sqlite3` client after filesystem-escape checks.

Bundle file trees are opt-in during restore: repeat `--restore-files LABEL=ABSOLUTE_FOLDER` for the sets you want. Database-only restore remains the default. Existing files are not replaced unless `--overwrite-files` is supplied; file count/byte limits and containment checks apply independently of the database restore.

Restore only files from a source you trust. Content detection, checksum revalidation, engine matching, and client-command guards reduce accidental and client-side escape risk; the SQL itself is still allowed to change the selected database and can invoke server-side behavior permitted to that database account.

PostgreSQL/MySQL backup and restore use their official clients; bounded-memory SQLite SQL restore uses `sqlite3` (SQLite snapshot backup/restore remains built in). Install matching tools and keep them in the service PATH:

- Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install postgresql-client mysql-client sqlite3`
- macOS: `brew install libpq mysql-client sqlite`
- Windows: install PostgreSQL/MySQL clients as needed and `sqlite3` from the [official SQLite downloads](https://sqlite.org/download.html)

Remote database sources work through saved connections, including reachable cloud databases. Backup generation publishes only to absolute local or OS-mounted folders, so local-to-local and remote-to-local/mounted backups use the verified pipeline. Independent copy jobs can push those completed artifacts to local or pinned-SFTP destinations, or pull them from local, pinned-SFTP, or rclone sources into a local vault. New `rclone://...` generation and rclone-push jobs remain rejected because generic rclone moves cannot provide a portable atomic create-if-absent guarantee.

Turso logical exports keep schema and data reads on one source transaction. Virtual/FTS tables are rejected before publication because exporting their shadow tables independently can produce an unrestorable dump. Cloudflare D1 uses Cloudflare's native export API and streams its short-lived signed HTTPS result into dbterm's private staging area; Cloudflare can temporarily make the database unavailable while that export runs. Restore in this release targets PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, and local SQLite; Turso/D1 SQL backups remain inspectable artifacts.

## Settings + keymap config

- Open settings with `G` from Dashboard or `Alt + ,` / `Alt + G` in workspace.
- Settings use OS-native per-user config directories. Run `dbterm backup paths` to print config, state, logs, catalog, and private-staging locations.
- Key bindings are validated before save (duplicate/invalid mappings are blocked).
- `Ctrl+Space` is reserved for contextual SQL autocomplete in the Query panel.
- Query history remains enabled per connection; saved-query snippet library is intentionally not included.

## Performance footprint

`dbterm` is tuned for small binary/runtime overhead while staying feature-complete:

- Build strips debug and VCS metadata (`-trimpath -buildvcs=false -ldflags="-s -w -buildid="`).
- The current stripped Linux amd64 build is about 16.0 MiB; `age`, Zstandard, timezone data, and SQLite remain compiled in rather than becoming runtime services.
- The backup catalog opens only when needed; a cold Dashboard is roughly 13 MiB idle RSS in the isolated Linux amd64 smoke test.
- DB pool is intentionally small (`max open=2`, `max idle=1`) for lower idle memory.
- Read-query previews respect the active preview limit (default `100` rows).
- Result rendering is safety-capped by row count, cell count, and estimated display budget.
- `Alt + 0` switches preview to the largest safe page for the current result shape.
- Scheduled work is serialized per agent/job; Zstandard uses one encoder worker and the agent sleeps between catalog checks.

## Repository layout

The project stays intentionally shallow:

| Path | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `cmd/dbterm/` | Executable entry point, CLI commands, update/uninstall, and release metadata |
| `internal/` | All application-only Go modules, including backup, config, database access, and TUI |
| `docs/` | Feature guides, maintainer reference, and README screenshots |
| `site/` | Astro website, isolated from the Go application |
| `packaging/` | AUR, Homebrew, Scoop, and WinGet definitions |
| `scripts/` | Debian and APT release helpers |

See [docs/project-reference.md](docs/project-reference.md#file-map) for the module-by-module map.

## Build locally

Run the current checkout directly:

```bash
go run ./cmd/dbterm
```

Or build the same optimized local binary used by the release setup, then launch it:

```bash
make build
./dbterm
```

Run tests:

```bash
make test
```

Build website:

```bash
cd site
bun install
bun run verify
```

For a local preview, run `bun run dev` and open the URL Astro prints.

## Release automation

GitHub Actions release workflow reads the first non-comment line in `cmd/dbterm/releases.txt`:

```text
<version>|<release name>|<short description>
```

On push to `main`, it builds artifacts, publishes release assets/checksums, and updates install targets.
