## Architecture
<p align="left">
<img src="img/vela-architecture-background.png" alt="Vela Architecture">
</p>
Vela is built on open-source components, combining Postgres and modern infrastructure automation to provide a complete, self-hostable platform.

- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a proven, object-relational database system known for reliability, feature depth, and performance.  
- [Realtime](https://github.com/supabase/realtime) provides WebSocket-based subscriptions to Postgres inserts, updates, and deletes.  
- [PostgREST](http://postgrest.org/) turns your PostgreSQL database directly into a RESTful API.  
- [Keycloak](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak) centralized authentication and identity provider, shared globally across all organizations and projects
- [Storage](https://github.com/simplyblock/sbcli) distributed copy-on-write high-performance block storage layer.
- [pg_graphql](https://github.com/supabase/pg_graphql) exposes a GraphQL API directly from your Postgres schema.  
- [postgres-meta](https://github.com/supabase/postgres-meta) provides administrative APIs to manage Postgres objects such as tables and roles.  
- [Kong](https://github.com/Kong/kong) serves as a cloud-native API gateway for routing and access control.  

### Vela Components

Vela consists of a number of Simplyblock-managed open-source components:

- [Vela Studio](https://github.com/simplyblock/vela): The web interface for managing organizations, projects, branches.
- [Vela Controller](https://github.com/simplyblock/vela-controller): The orchestrator component which manages the lifecycle of databases and functions.
- [Vela OS](https://github.com/simplyblock/vela-os): The operating system component which is used in the branch virtual machines, running the branch services.
- [Vela Documentation](https://github.com/simplyblock/vela-docs): The Vela documentation, featured at [https://docs.vela.run](https://docs.vela.run).
- [Autoscaling](https://github.com/simplyblock/autoscaling): The Vela fork of Neon's autoscaling component which managed Qemu virtual machines in Kubernetes.
