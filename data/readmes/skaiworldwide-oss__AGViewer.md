# AGViewer

Web-based user interface that provides visualization of graph data stored in an AgensGraph database. It can render complex nodes, relationships, and properties in a clear and dynamic way. AGViewer helps developers, data analysts, and researchers gain deeper insights into graph data.

## Features

- **Web-Based Interface:** Accessible through any web browser.
- **Graph Visualization:** Provides interactive visualization tools for graph data.
- **User-Friendly:** Intuitive interface designed for ease of use.
- **Real-Time Interaction:** Allows for real-time data updates and interaction with graph data.

This is a sub-project of [AgensGraph](https://github.com/skaiworldwide-oss/agensgraph)

## AGViewer via Docker image

- Pulling the image:

```bash
docker pull skaiworldwide/agviewer
```

- Run the container:

```bash
docker run --name agviewer -p 3000:3000 -d skaiworldwide/agviewer
```

Then open the URL [127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) on your browser.

> Tip: if your AgensGraph server is running on your host machine or difference container, the URL to connect to it should be "host.docker.internal".

> [pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) is an NPM module to run the project in production mode.
