# DBChat - Talk to Your Database using AI

Transform your database into an intelligent conversational partner. Ask questions in plain English, get instant answers, and create beautiful visualizations - all through Claude Desktop or any other MCP Client.

## 🌟 What is DBChat?

DBChat is a bridge that connects any MCP client like Claude Desktop, Gemini-CLI, etc to your database, enabling natural language database interactions. Instead of writing SQL queries, simply ask the chatbot questions about your data and get instant, intelligent responses.

If you want a guided product tour, see [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md). But if you only want to see the results of a sample TUTORIAL run then see [TUTORIAL-DEMO.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/skanga/DBchat/blob/main/TUTORIAL-DEMO.html).

If you want to focus on charts and visual output, see [VISUALIZATION.md](VISUALIZATION.md).

**Before DBChat:**
```sql
SELECT c.name, COUNT(o.id) as order_count, SUM(o.total) as revenue 
FROM customers c 
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id 
WHERE o.created_at >= '2024-01-01' 
GROUP BY c.id, c.name 
ORDER BY revenue DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

**With DBChat:**
```
"Show me our top 10 customers by revenue this year"
```

IMPORTANT: Make sure that you are properly LICENSED to use any JDBC driver you install. The DBChat license does not cover any third party code or binaries.

### Step 2: Install Claude Desktop (similar setup for any other MCP client)

1. Download [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) (free)
2. Sign in with your Claude account
3. **Important**: The Claude website does not support MCP. For MCP with Anthropic models you need to use Claude Desktop or Claude Code.

### Step 2 (alternate): 

If you are not using Claude Desktop but want to use another MCP client like Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, Continue, etc then please refer to the [MCP Setup](MCP-SETUP.md) document for more details

### Step 3: Set Up Your Database Connection 

Create a configuration file `dbchat.conf`:

```properties
# Basic database connection
DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_DRIVER=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

# Optional: Enable web interface (not needed for Claude desktop)
HTTP_MODE=false
HTTP_PORT=8080
```

**Examples for Common/Popular Databases:**

**MySQL:**
```properties
DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_DRIVER=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
```

**PostgreSQL:**
```properties
DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_DRIVER=org.postgresql.Driver
```

**SQLite:**
```properties
DB_URL=jdbc:sqlite:/path/to/your/database.db
DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_DRIVER=org.sqlite.JDBC
```

**H2 database (in memory - no database setup required):**
```properties
DB_URL=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
DB_USER=sa
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_DRIVER=org.h2.Driver
```

**Oracle:**
```properties
DB_URL=jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe
DB_USER=system
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_DRIVER=oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
```

**Redis:**
```properties
DB_URL=jdbc:redis://localhost:6379
DB_USER=

# Bind to specific interface
java -jar dbchat-4.2.1-<variant>.jar --http_mode=true --bind_address=192.168.1.100 --http_port=8080
```

## 🔧 Configuration Methods and Priority

For maximum flexibility, DBChat supports multiple configuration methods like CLI arguments, config file, Environment vars,
System Properties and Built-in Defaults. Understanding the priority order is crucial for troubleshooting and advanced setups.

### Configuration Priority Order (Highest to Lowest)

1. **Command Line Arguments** (Highest Priority)
2. **Configuration File**
3. **Environment Variables**
4. **System Properties**
5. **Built-in Defaults** (Lowest Priority)

This means command line arguments will always override config files, which override environment variables, and so on.

### Method 1: Command Line Arguments
**Format**: `--parameter_name=value`
**Use case**: Quick overrides, testing, one-time configurations

```bash
java -jar dbchat-4.2.1-<variant>.jar \
  --db_url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb" \
  --db_user="username" \
  --db_password="password" \
  --db_driver="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver" \
  --http_mode=true \
  --http_port=8080 \
  --select_only=true
```

**Available parameters:**
- `--config_file=/path/to/config.conf`
- `--db_url="jdbc:..."`
- `--db_user="username"`
- `--db_password="password"`
- `--db_driver="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"`
- `--http_mode=true`
- `--http_port=8080`
- `--max_connections=20`
- `--connection_timeout_ms=30000`
- `--query_timeout_seconds=60`
- `--select_only=true`
- `--max_sql_length=50000`
- `--max_rows_limit=10000`

### Method 2: Configuration Files
**Format**: `KEY=VALUE` (one per line)
**Use case**: Production environments, complex configurations, version control

Create a file (e.g., `dbchat.conf`):
```properties
# Database Connection
DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/myapp
DB_USER=dbuser
DB_PASSWORD=my secure password with spaces
DB_DRIVER=org.postgresql.Driver

# Connection Pool Settings
MAX_CONNECTIONS=20
CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS=60000
IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS=300000
MAX_LIFETIME_MS=1800000
LEAK_DETECTION_THRESHOLD_MS=60000

# Query Settings
QUERY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=45
SELECT_ONLY=false
MAX_SQL_LENGTH=50000
MAX_ROWS_LIMIT=50000

# Server Settings
HTTP_MODE=true
HTTP_PORT=8080
```

**Usage:**
```bash
java -jar dbchat-4.2.1-<variant>.jar --config_file=dbchat.conf
```

**Config file features:**
- Comments start with `#`
- Empty lines are ignored
- Values can be quoted: `DB_PASSWORD="password with spaces"`
- Keys are case-insensitive
- Supports all the same parameters as command line

### Method 3: Environment Variables
**Format**: `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`
**Use case**: Docker, cloud deployment, CI/CD, secure credential management

```bash
export DB_URL="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb"
export DB_USER="username"
export DB_PASSWORD="password"
export DB_DRIVER="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"
export HTTP_MODE="true"
export HTTP_PORT="8080"
export SELECT_ONLY="true"

java -jar dbchat-4.2.1-<variant>.jar
```

**All environment variables:**
- `CONFIG_FILE` - Path to configuration file
- `DB_URL` - Database connection URL
- `DB_USER` - Database username
- `DB_PASSWORD` - Database password
- `DB_DRIVER` - JDBC driver class
- `HTTP_MODE` - Enable HTTP mode (true/false)
- `HTTP_PORT` - HTTP server port
- `MAX_CONNECTIONS` - Connection pool size
- `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS` - Connection timeout
- `QUERY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` - Query timeout
- `SELECT_ONLY` - Read-only mode (true/false)
- `MAX_SQL_LENGTH` - Maximum query length
- `MAX_ROWS_LIMIT` - Maximum result rows
- `IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` - Connection idle timeout
- `MAX_LIFETIME_MS` - Connection max lifetime
- `LEAK_DETECTION_THRESHOLD_MS` - Leak detection threshold

### Method 4: System Properties
**Format**: `-Dparameter.name=value` (underscores become dots)
**Use case**: JVM-specific configuration, IDE run configurations

```bash
java -Ddb.url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb" \
     -Ddb.user="username" \
     -Ddb.password="password" \
     -Ddb.driver="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver" \
     -Dhttp.mode="true" \
     -Dhttp.port="8080" \
     -jar dbchat-4.2.1-<variant>.jar
```

**Property naming**: Environment variable `DB_URL` becomes system property `db.url`

### Method 5: Built-in Defaults
**When**: No configuration provided
**Values**: Safe defaults for development

```properties
DB_URL=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
DB_USER=sa
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_DRIVER=org.h2.Driver
HTTP_MODE=false
HTTP_PORT=8080
MAX_CONNECTIONS=10
CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS=30000
QUERY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30
SELECT_ONLY=true
MAX_SQL_LENGTH=10000
MAX_ROWS_LIMIT=10000
```

### Configuration Examples

#### Example 1: Priority Override
```bash
# Config file has HTTP_PORT=8080
echo "HTTP_PORT=8080" > config.conf

# Environment variable sets different port
export HTTP_PORT=9090

# Command line overrides both
java -jar dbchat-4.2.1-<variant>.jar --config_file=config.conf --http_port=7070

# Result: Uses port 7070 (command line wins)
```

#### Example 2: Mixed Configuration
```bash
# Use config file for database settings
echo "DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb" > prod.conf
echo "DB_USER=produser" >> prod.conf
echo "SELECT_ONLY=true" >> prod.conf

# Override password via environment (more secure)
export DB_PASSWORD="secure_password"

# Override port via command line (for this run only)
java -jar dbchat-4.2.1-<variant>.jar --config_file=prod.conf --http_port=9090
```

#### Example 3: Claude Desktop Configuration
Note that most MCP clients use a similar configuration, but you'll need to refer to your MCP
client docs for details on how it can be configured. It is safest not to assume any PATH settings
and provide absolute paths for java, the dbchat jar and (optionally) the dbchat config file.
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "database": {
      "command": "java",
      "args": [
        "-jar", "/path/to/dbchat-4.2.1-<variant>.jar",
        "--config_file=/path/to/production.conf",
        "--select_only=true"
      ],
      "env": {
        "DB_PASSWORD": "secure_password_from_env"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

java -jar dbchat-4.2.1-<variant>.jar --db_password="visible_password"
```

#### Configuration File Security
```bash
# Create secure config file
umask 077
cat > secure.conf << EOF
DB_PASSWORD=secure_password
EOF

# Verify permissions
ls -la secure.conf
# Should show: -rw------- (owner read/write only)
```

### Troubleshooting Configuration

#### Check Effective Configuration
Enable debug logging to see which values are being used:
```bash
java -Dlogging.level.root=DEBUG -jar dbchat-4.2.1-<variant>.jar --config_file=myconfig.conf
```

#### Common Issues
1. **Config file not found**: Use absolute paths
2. **Permission denied**: Check file permissions
3. **Wrong values used**: Check priority order
4. **Environment variables not set**: Use `env | grep DB_` to verify

#### Validation Commands
```bash
# Test database connection with current config
java -jar dbchat-4.2.1-<variant>.jar --help

# Verify config file syntax
grep -v "^#" myconfig.conf | grep -v "^$"

# Check environment variables
env | grep -E "(DB_|HTTP_|MAX_|SELECT_)"
```

- Check Claude Desktop configuration syntax
- Verify Java is accessible in PATH
- Review Claude Desktop logs

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Getting Started
1. **Start with read-only**: Use `SELECT_ONLY=true` initially
2. **Test with sample data**: Try the H2 database first
3. **Begin with simple questions**: Start with basic table exploration
4. **Build complexity gradually**: Move to advanced analytics over time

### Security
1. **Use dedicated database users**: Create read-only users for DBChat
2. **Limit access**: Only grant necessary table permissions
3. **Monitor usage**: Review query logs regularly
4. **Backup data**: Always maintain database backups

### Performance
1. **Set reasonable limits**: Use `MAX_ROWS_LIMIT` and timeouts
2. **Index important columns**: Ensure queries can run efficiently
3. **Monitor resources**: Watch CPU and memory usage
4. **Optimize queries**: Let Claude suggest query improvements
