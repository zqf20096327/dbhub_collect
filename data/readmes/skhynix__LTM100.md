# LTM100

LTM100 is an end-to-end multi-user **load benchmark** for Long-Term Memory
(LTM) systems. It drives virtual users through realistic and focused memory
workloads and reports client-observable throughput, latency, rejection, and
error metrics.

LTM100 measures **load, concurrency, and scalability behavior**, not retrieval
or answer quality. It does not compute precision, recall, or MRR.

Current release: **v0.4.3**

## Highlights

- Closed and open load models for fixed-concurrency and arrival-driven tests.
- Four scenarios: `chat-replay`, `add-load`, `search-load`, and `mixed`.
- Weighted chat workload profiles with group-specific recall, timing, and
  closed/open session controls.
- Bounded admission and rejection accounting for overload experiments.
- Multi-process load generation so the benchmark client can scale beyond one
  event-loop core.
- Optional pre-ingest, ramp-up, raw request records, and server-side latency
  metrics.
- Repeated memory-growth sweeps with fixed query workloads and isolated corpus
  points.
- Pluggable datasets and backend adapters.
- JSON and CSV reports with successful, error, and rejected traffic separated.

## Install

```sh
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Install optional dependencies when needed:

```sh
pip install -e ".[dev,datasets]"      # LongMemEval via Hugging Face
pip install -e ".[dev,datasets,mcp]"  # LongMemEval + MCP transport
```

LTM100 requires Python 3.10 or later. The `ltm100` command is the primary
entry point; `python -m ltm100.cli` is equivalent when the console script is
not on `PATH`.

## Quick start

Point an example YAML at a running LTM endpoint, then choose a scenario and a
termination condition:

```sh
ltm100 run --config examples/synthetic.yaml \
    --scenario add-load --users 20 --duration 30 --seed 0 \
    --output out/add-load
```

For a chatbot-style workload using LongMemEval:

```sh
ltm100 run --config examples/memmachine.yaml \
    --scenario chat-replay --users 10 --duration 60 --seed 0 \
    --output out/chat-replay
```

See the [running guide](docs/running.md) for configuration, workload commands,
load controls, backend limitations, reports, and cleanup. The
[example matrix](examples/README.md) shows the intended use of each YAML file.

## Workloads

| Scenario | Purpose | Dataset requirement |
|---|---|---|
| `chat-replay` | Replay chatbot recall and conversation ingestion | Structured `turn_stream` such as LongMemEval |
| `add-load` | Measure pure memory-ingest throughput | Any dataset |
| `search-load` | Measure search throughput and latency | Any dataset; pre-ingest recommended |
| `mixed` | Generate a configurable add/search mixture | Any dataset; pre-ingest recommended |

Every scenario runs under both load models:

- `closed`: a fixed number of users repeatedly execute their plans.
- `open`: sessions arrive through a Poisson process and exercise the bounded
  queue and rejection policy.

LongMemEval supports all four scenarios. The bundled synthetic dataset supports
the three scenarios that do not require structured dialogue turns.

## Adapters

Datasets:

- **LongMemEval** — local JSON or Hugging Face loading, with structured
  user/assistant turns for `chat-replay`.
- **Synthetic** — deterministic, download-free data for load probes.

Backends:

- **MemMachine REST**
- **MemMachine MCP** with REST lifecycle management
- **Mem0 OSS REST**

Backend-specific options and unsupported feature combinations are documented
in the [running guide](docs/running.md).

## Reports

With `--output DIR`, a run writes `summary.json` and `summary.csv`. Use `--raw`
for per-request `raw.ndjson`, and `--server-metrics` for backend-provided
server latency breakdowns when the selected adapter supports them.

Successful throughput and latency are reported separately from backend errors
and queue rejections, so overload cannot inflate QPS or lower service-latency
percentiles. See [Reports](docs/running.md#reports) for the output contract.

## Development

```sh
pytest -q
ruff check .
```

## Versioning

Releases use `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tags. During 0.x, a minor bump marks a
meaningful tested milestone; breaking changes bump the minor version.

```sh
git tag v0.4.3
git push origin v0.4.3
```
