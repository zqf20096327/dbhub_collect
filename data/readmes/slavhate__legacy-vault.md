# Legacy Vault

A self-hosted, encrypted personal data vault designed for estate planning and family continuity. Store your financial accounts, legal documents, insurance policies, and final wishes in one secure place -- and ensure your family can access it when the time comes.

## Why Legacy Vault?

When someone passes away unexpectedly, their family often faces a painful scavenger hunt: which banks had accounts? Where are the insurance policies? What are the login credentials? Who is the lawyer?

Legacy Vault solves this by providing a single, encrypted store for all critical personal and financial information, with three secure mechanisms for your family to access it when needed.

## Features

### Vault Storage (15 Sections)
- **Personal Identity** -- IDs, passport, tax numbers
- **Bank Accounts** -- account numbers, branches, nominees
- **Investments** -- stocks, mutual funds, crypto, PPF
- **Retirement** -- EPF, NPS, pension accounts
- **Insurance** -- life, health, auto, property policies
- **Real Estate** -- property details, mortgages, deeds
- **Debts & Liabilities** -- loans, credit cards, informal debts
- **Digital Accounts** -- emails, social media, subscriptions, 2FA details
- **Vehicles** -- registration, VIN, insurance, loans
- **Valuables** -- jewelry, art, safe deposit boxes
- **Important Contacts** -- lawyer, CA, doctor, financial advisor
- **Legal Documents** -- will, power of attorney, certificates
- **Final Wishes** -- funeral, organ donation, messages to family
- **Secure Notes** -- WiFi passwords, alarm codes, anything else
- **Pet Care** -- vet details, dietary needs, rehoming plans

### Three Handover Mechanisms

1. **Dead Man's Switch** -- Set a check-in interval (e.g., 30 days). If you fail to check in within the interval plus a grace period, all beneficiaries are automatically granted access.

2. **Emergency Access Request** -- A beneficiary can request emergency access using their token. The vault owner has a configurable waiting period (1-90 days) to deny the request. If not denied, access is automatically granted.

3. **Direct Token Handover** -- Give a beneficiary their access token directly (e.g., sealed envelope with a lawyer). They can view the vault immediately if you grant access manually.

### Security
- **AES-256-GCM** encryption for all vault data at rest
- **bcrypt** (cost 12) password hashing
- **JWT** authentication with 24-hour expiry
- **Rate limiting** on auth and sensitive endpoints
- **Helmet.js** security headers with strict CSP
- **Audit logging** for all security-relevant actions
- Beneficiary tokens are SHA-256 hashed before storage
- Token expiration (2-year lifetime)
- Transaction-based auto-grant to prevent race conditions

### User Experience
- Dark and light theme with toggle
- Global search across all encrypted entries
- Export vault as printable HTML document
- Backup and restore vault data as JSON
- Toast notifications and loading states
- Onboarding guide for new users
- Responsive design for mobile

## Quick Start

### Using Docker Hub image (fastest)

Pull the pre-built image and run -- no cloning needed:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name legacy-vault \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v legacy-vault-data:/app/data \
  shri32msi/legacy-vault:latest
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

> **Available tags:** `latest`, `1.0.0`
> **Docker Hub:** [shri32msi/legacy-vault](https://hub.docker.com/r/shri32msi/legacy-vault)

### Build from source with Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/slavhate/legacy-vault.git
cd legacy-vault
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

### Without Docker

Requires Node.js 20+ and a C/C++ compiler for `better-sqlite3` native bindings.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/slavhate/legacy-vault.git
cd legacy-vault
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm start
```

### Configuration

Edit `.env` to customize:

```env
PORT=3000

# Leave as 'auto' to generate and persist secrets automatically on first run.
# Or set your own values (JWT_SECRET: any string 32+ chars, ENCRYPTION_KEY: 64-char hex).
JWT_SECRET=auto
ENCRYPTION_KEY=auto
```

On first startup, if set to `auto`, the server generates cryptographically secure secrets and persists them to `data/.secrets`. These keys encrypt your vault data -- **back them up** and **never expose them**.

## Demo Data

Seed the vault with fictional sample data to explore all features:

```bash
# 1. Register a user
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Demo User","email":"demo@example.com","password":"DemoPass123!"}'

# 2. Copy the token from the response, then run:
./seed.sh <paste-token-here>
```

> All data in `seed.sh` is entirely fictional. See the disclaimer at the top of the file.

## Backups

### Automated Database Backup

```bash
# Run manually
./backup.sh

# Or schedule via cron (daily at 2 AM, keep 30 backups)
0 2 * * * /path/to/legacy-vault/backup.sh /path/to/backups 30
```

The script uses SQLite's `.backup` command for safe, consistent copies even with WAL mode active, verifies integrity, and prunes old backups beyond the retention count.

### Application-Level Backup

From the UI: **Account Settings > Download Backup** creates a JSON file with all decrypted vault entries, beneficiary list, and dead switch config. Use **Restore from Backup** to import.

> Database backups preserve encrypted data. Application backups contain decrypted data -- handle them with the same care as the vault itself.

## Built With Claude

This project was vibe coded entirely with [Claude](https://claude.ai/) by Anthropic -- from architecture and backend logic to frontend UI and Docker setup. Every line of code, the database schema, encryption layer, and even this README were generated through natural language conversation with Claude.
