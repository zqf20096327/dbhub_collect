# Hermes Local Memory

**Local-first, inspectable, agent-controlled memory for Hermes Agent.**

Hermes Local Memory is an open-source SQLite memory provider for [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent). It is built for people who want the useful parts of agent memory — profiles, aliases, raw history, facts, cards, search, context injection, migration, and consolidation — without running a separate memory server or trusting an opaque background "dream" system.

The core idea is simple:

> Memory should be a first-class part of the Hermes Agent runtime: a local, auditable substrate that the agent can inspect, reason over, maintain, and update through explicit tools — not an opaque appendix bolted onto the side of the agent.

This project is inspired by the good ideas in Honcho, especially peers/cards/consolidation, but deliberately chooses boring engineering: one local SQLite DB, explicit identity mapping, deterministic retrieval, source-labeled context, conservative maintenance dry-runs before writes, and agent-generated patches instead of hidden backend mutation.

> Status: **alpha**. The store, provider, plugin shim, CLI inspection/repair tools, Hermes markdown import, Honcho API import, identity maps, peer/candidate/card review, reflection, and deterministic consolidation are implemented and tested. Do not switch a production Hermes setup without doing a trial import and inspection first.

---

## Why this is different

Most memory systems are either too small — a few strings in a prompt — or too magical: server processes, queues, vector stores, hidden summaries, model-specific workers, and unclear identity rules.

Hermes Local Memory is opinionated in the other direction:

- **Local-first** — default storage is `~/.hermes/memory/local_memory.sqlite`.
- **No memory server** — no FastAPI, Docker, Redis, Postgres, or daemon required.
- **Agent-controlled** — Hermes is expected to inspect, curate, and maintain memory through normal tools like `memory_context`, `memory_search`, `memory_conclude`, and `memory_consolidate`.
- **Memory is first-class** — context, peers, aliases, cards, facts, summaries, and maintenance packets are part of the agent workflow, not a passive appendix.
- **Inspectable by design** — humans and agents can list peers, aliases, sessions, cards, messages, facts, and rendered context.
- **Identity is data** — aliases like `telegram:1001`, `honcho:Alice`, and `user` point to canonical peers such as `alice`.
- **Peers are agent-maintained** — scheduled peer review lets the agent map new platform identities to canonical peers or escalate ambiguous identities for human help.
- **Raw history is preserved** — imports copy raw messages; identity repair does not rewrite historical rows unless an explicit tool says so.
- **Consolidation is explicit and conservative** — deterministic dry-runs produce bounded plans; imported candidates are not bulk-promoted; compact cards are curated/replaced rather than grown by blindly appending every active fact.
- **Migration-safe** — Honcho import is additive/idempotent, supports identity maps, and never mutates Honcho.
- **Usable by agents** — CLI JSON output, clear docs, tests, and `AGENTS.md` are first-class.

## What it offers today

### Hermes provider tools

`LocalMemoryProvider` exposes:

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `memory_get_card` / `memory_set_card` | Read compact peer cards, or explicitly replace full cards with diffs; empty writes require `allow_empty=true`. |
| `memory_search` | Search active durable facts through SQLite FTS5. |
| `memory_context` | Show exactly what local memory would inject into the prompt. |
| `memory_conclude` | Add durable facts with evidence links to the most recent synced user turn. |
| `memory_consolidate` | Preview/apply deterministic fact lifecycle maintenance for one peer. It can promote safe candidates, supersede duplicates, and bootstrap empty cards from safe active facts; it does not append every active fact into existing cards. |
| `memory_maintenance` | Preview/apply deterministic fact lifecycle maintenance across all subject/observer pairs; provider results are compact summaries suitable for scheduled jobs. |
| `memory_build_peer_review_packet` / `memory_apply_peer_review_patch` | Build and apply peer-review patches so the agent can maintain aliases and escalate ambiguous identities. |
| `memory_build_reflection_packets` / `memory_apply_reflection_patch` | Build reflection packets for stale sessions and apply evidence-linked candidate facts plus summaries. |
| `memory_build_candidate_review_packet` / `memory_apply_candidate_review_patch` | Review noisy candidate facts safely without broad promotion. |
| `memory_build_card_review_packet` / `memory_apply_card_review_patch` | Review compact cards and apply full-card replacement patches. |
| `memory_build_honcho_migration_review_packet` / `memory_apply_honcho_migration_review_patch` | Review first-migration Honcho candidates and compact card rebuilds together. |

## Quick install for humans

### Recommended: install the published package

For normal use, install the published PyPI package as a CLI tool:

```bash
uv tool install hermes-local-memory
# or
pipx install hermes-local-memory
```

If you are already inside a virtualenv:

```bash
pip install hermes-local-memory
```

Verify:

```bash
hermes-local-memory --help
```

### Development path: clone from GitHub

Use a checkout only if you want to develop, test unreleased changes, or run directly from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smarzola/hermes-local-memory.git
cd hermes-local-memory
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'
PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q
ruff check .
```

Run the CLI from a checkout with:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m hermes_local_memory.cli --help
```

### Install the Hermes plugin shim

If installed from PyPI/pipx/uv:

```bash
hermes-local-memory install-shim --hermes-home ~/.hermes
```

If running from a GitHub checkout:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m hermes_local_memory.cli install-shim --hermes-home ~/.hermes
```

This writes:

```text
~/.hermes/plugins/local_memory/__init__.py
```

It does **not** modify `~/.hermes/config.yaml` and does **not** switch your live memory provider. It registers the package-versioned maintenance skill as `local_memory:maintenance`; prefer that namespaced plugin skill for scheduled maintenance so updates come from the installed package. `install-shim` also removes managed legacy copied skill installs to prevent stale runbooks.

### Configure Hermes

After validating the shim and trial DB, configure Hermes:

```yaml
memory:
  provider: local_memory
```

Then restart Hermes or start a fresh session.

> Recommended: keep your existing provider active until you have imported/inspected data in a separate trial DB.

## Basic CLI examples

Global `--db` goes before the subcommand:

```bash
hermes-local-memory --db ~/.hermes/memory/local_memory.sqlite peers --json
```

Inspect memory:

```bash
hermes-local-memory --db memory.sqlite peers --json
hermes-local-memory --db memory.sqlite aliases --json
hermes-local-memory --db memory.sqlite cards --peer alice --observer bob --json
hermes-local-memory --db memory.sqlite facts --peer alice --observer bob --json
hermes-local-memory --db memory.sqlite context \
  --peer alice \
  --observer bob \
  --query "what should I remember?"
```

Add explicit memory:

```bash
hermes-local-memory --db memory.sqlite fact add \
  "Alice prefers local-first memory systems." \
  --peer alice \
  --observer bob \
  --kind preference \
  --json
```

Repair an alias:

```bash
hermes-local-memory --db memory.sqlite alias add telegram:1001 \
  --peer alice \
  --source telegram \
  --verified \
  --json
```

Preview consolidation:

```bash
hermes-local-memory --db memory.sqlite consolidate \
  --peer alice \
  --observer bob \
  --promote-candidates \
  --dry-run \
  --json
```

Apply only after review:

```bash
hermes-local-memory --db memory.sqlite consolidate \
  --peer alice \
  --observer bob \
  --promote-candidates \
  --apply \
  --json
```

Build an agent review packet and apply a validated patch:

```bash
hermes-local-memory --db memory.sqlite consolidation-packet \
  --peer alice \
  --observer bob \
  --json > /tmp/alice-packet.json

hermes-local-memory --db memory.sqlite apply-patch /tmp/alice-patch.json --dry-run --json
hermes-local-memory --db memory.sqlite apply-patch /tmp/alice-patch.json --apply --json
```

Run conservative deterministic maintenance across all subject/observer pairs:

```bash
hermes-local-memory --db memory.sqlite maintenance \
  --promote-candidates \
  --dry-run \
  --json
```

## Migrating from Hermes built-in markdown memory

For users who only used Hermes' standard built-in markdown memory, migration is simpler than Honcho: import the local `USER.md` and `MEMORY.md` files from `~/.hermes/memories`.

Dry-run into a trial DB first:

```bash
hermes-local-memory --db ~/.hermes/memory/local_memory_trial.sqlite import hermes-markdown \
  --source-dir ~/.hermes/memories \
  --user-peer alice \
  --assistant-peer bob \
  --dry-run \
  --json
```

Apply only after reviewing the plan:

```bash
hermes-local-memory --db ~/.hermes/memory/local_memory_trial.sqlite import hermes-markdown \
  --source-dir ~/.hermes/memories \
  --user-peer alice \
  --assistant-peer bob \
  --apply \
  --json
```

Import behavior:

- `USER.md` entries become active user facts for `alice` observed by `bob`.
- `USER.md` entries also become Alice's compact card for Bob.
- `MEMORY.md` entries become active agent/self facts for `bob` observed by `bob`.
- `MEMORY.md` entries also become Bob's self-card.
- entries are split using Hermes' standard `§` delimiter.
- the import is additive and idempotent; existing facts are skipped on repeated apply.
- an existing target DB is backed up automatically unless `--no-backup` is passed.

Because markdown memory is already curated, imported facts are active by default. You can still run card review or consolidation afterward if you want a cleaner compact card before switching providers.

---

## Migrating from Honcho

Preferred path: use the Honcho HTTP API, not direct database reads.

Dry-run:

```bash
hermes-local-memory --db ~/.hermes/memory/local_memory_trial.sqlite import honcho-api \
  --base-url http://localhost:8000/v3 \
  --workspace hermes \
  --api-key "$HONCHO_API_KEY" \
  --dry-run \
  --json
```

Apply to a **trial DB**:

```bash
hermes-local-memory --db ~/.hermes/memory/local_memory_trial.sqlite import honcho-api \
  --base-url http://localhost:8000/v3 \
  --workspace hermes \
  --api-key "$HONCHO_API_KEY" \
  --apply \
  --json
```

Use identity maps to collapse fragmented Honcho identities into canonical local peers:

```json
{
  "peers": {
    "honcho:1001": "alice",
    "honcho:Alice": "alice",
    "honcho:1002": "carol",
    "honcho:Bob": "bob"
  },
  "patterns": {
    "honcho:user-default*": "alice"
  },
  "display_names": {
    "alice": "Alice",
    "carol": "Carol",
    "bob": "Bob"
  },
  "kinds": {
    "alice": "human",
    "carol": "human",
    "bob": "ai"
  }
}
```

Then pass:

```bash
--identity-map ~/.hermes/local-memory-identity-map.json
```

After import, treat Honcho candidate facts and imported cards as first-migration review material, not as disposable noise. Honcho-derived conclusions are intentionally imported as candidates and deterministic maintenance will not bulk-promote them, but the first migration should actively review high-signal memories and use selected ones to rebuild compact cards:

1. in an agent session, use `memory_build_honcho_migration_review_packet` / `memory_apply_honcho_migration_review_patch` to promote selected high-signal Honcho candidates and apply a compact card rebuild in one validated review flow;
2. outside Hermes Agent, use CLI `honcho-migration-review-packet` / `apply-honcho-migration-review-patch` for the same combined candidate/card review;
3. use ordinary candidate/card review later for remaining noisy candidates or card cleanup.

Example combined Honcho migration review packet:

```bash
hermes-local-memory --db ~/.hermes/memory/local_memory_trial.sqlite \
  honcho-migration-review-packet \
  --peer alice \
  --observer bob \
  --json
```

Example card cleanup packet:

```bash
hermes-local-memory --db ~/.hermes/memory/local_memory_trial.sqlite card-review-packet \
  --peer alice \
  --observer bob \
  --json > /tmp/alice-card-packet.json
```

Example full-card replacement patch:

```json
{
  "schema": "hermes-local-memory.card-review-patch.v1",
  "subject_peer_id": "alice",
  "observer_peer_id": "bob",
  "card_replace": [
    "Name: Alice",
    "PREFERENCE: Prefers local-first, auditable memory systems"
  ]
}
```

Apply only after a dry-run validation:

```bash
hermes-local-memory --db ~/.hermes/memory/local_memory_trial.sqlite apply-card-review-patch \
  /tmp/alice-card-patch.json \
  --dry-run \
  --json
```

See [CLI docs](docs/cli.md) for full importer and migration-review behavior.

## How the memory flow works

Local Memory separates **raw history**, **peers**, **reflection**, **durable facts**, **compact cards**, and **agent decisions**. The agent is not merely reading a memory appendix; it is responsible for operating this memory substrate through explicit tools and auditable maintenance jobs.

```text
Normal conversation turn
  -> Hermes injects a compact source-labeled context block
  -> user/assistant messages are stored immutably as raw history
  -> explicit facts can be added immediately with evidence

Scheduled peer review
  -> new or unverified platform identities become peer review packets
  -> Hermes Agent maps obvious aliases to canonical peers
  -> ambiguous identities are escalated as human prompts instead of guessed
  -> Local Memory validates and applies explicit alias moves

Scheduled reflection / distillation
  -> stale raw-message windows become reflection packets
  -> Hermes Agent reviews the packets
  -> Local Memory validates reflection patches
  -> candidate facts and session summaries are written with evidence

Scheduled consolidation / maintenance
  -> candidates, active facts, cards, aliases, and summaries are reviewed across all subject/observer pairs
  -> deterministic maintenance handles only safe fact lifecycle changes
  -> Hermes Agent uses review packets/patches for card synthesis or ambiguous candidate promotion
  -> Local Memory validates and applies structured changes

Next prompt injection
  -> compact card + durable facts + session summary + relevant retrieval are injected
```

The important split is:

- **Local Memory** stores, retrieves, validates, and applies auditable changes.
- **Hermes Agent** owns memory decisions: peer mapping, reflection review, candidate promotion, card synthesis/cleanup, and ambiguous consolidation choices.
- **Humans** are asked only when the agent cannot safely infer a peer or when policy requires approval.
- **Hermes cron/scheduler** runs recurring peer review, reflection, and consolidation.

The profile/card is **not** the only thing injected. Context Builder v2 composes ordinary prompt context from:

1. identity/session information,
2. aliases for the current subject peer,
3. the compact subject/observer card,
4. active durable facts,
5. the current session summary when available,
6. relevant retrieved active facts for the current query.

Candidate facts and raw message windows are usually **not** injected into ordinary conversations. They are primarily used during maintenance/review jobs unless explicitly requested.

### Reflection, consolidation, and cards

Reflection is the distillation step: stale raw-message windows become evidence-backed candidate facts and session summaries. Consolidation/maintenance is the fact-lifecycle step: duplicate candidates can be superseded and high-confidence local candidates can be promoted. **Cards are compact synthesized views**, not append-only mirrors of the fact table.

That means ordinary maintenance deliberately does **not** append every active fact into a card. If a card needs cleanup or synthesis, use `card-review-packet` / `apply-card-review-patch` or a validated consolidation patch with `card_replace`. This keeps prompt context small, auditable, and human/agent-readable.

Imported Honcho conclusions are mixed-quality rather than worthless. They remain candidates so deterministic maintenance cannot blindly bulk-promote them, but first migration should explicitly review high-signal Honcho memories and use selected ones to rebuild cards. Large candidate-promotion counts in ordinary maintenance dry-runs should still be treated as a tooling or policy regression, not something to blindly apply.

Why maintenance is needed:

- ordinary conversations create useful memories that are not explicitly saved during the turn
- conversations also create duplicate or overlapping memories
- imported systems can contain stale identities or noisy derived facts
- candidate facts need promotion, superseding, or retraction
- compact cards should stay useful instead of growing into transcripts; ordinary maintenance must not append every active fact into cards
- raw history should remain intact while derived layers improve over time

This is why the project supports both reflection/distillation and deterministic all-pairs maintenance, orchestrated by Hermes scheduled jobs rather than hidden backend workers. Reflection creates evidence-backed candidate facts and session summaries; card synthesis remains an explicit review/patch step so cards stay compact.

## Setup checklist for agents

If a human asks an agent to install or migrate Local Memory, use the published package by default. Clone GitHub only for development or unreleased debugging.

1. **Install the published CLI**

   ```bash
   uv tool install hermes-local-memory
   # or
   pipx install hermes-local-memory
   hermes-local-memory --help
   ```

2. **Install the Hermes shim without switching providers**

   ```bash
   hermes-local-memory install-shim --hermes-home ~/.hermes
   ```

3. **Create or choose a trial DB**

   ```bash
   export LOCAL_MEMORY_DB=~/.hermes/memory/local_memory_trial.sqlite
   ```

4. **Import external memory only into the trial DB first**

   ```bash
   hermes-local-memory --db "$LOCAL_MEMORY_DB" import honcho-api \
     --base-url http://localhost:8000/v3 \
     --workspace hermes \
     --identity-map ~/.hermes/local-memory-identity-map.json \
     --dry-run \
     --json
   ```

5. **Review imported candidates and cards before judging context quality**

   ```bash
   hermes-local-memory --db "$LOCAL_MEMORY_DB" candidate-review-packet \
     --peer alice \
     --observer bob \
     --source honcho-api-conclusion \
     --limit 100 \
     --json > /tmp/alice-candidates.json

   hermes-local-memory --db "$LOCAL_MEMORY_DB" card-review-packet \
     --peer alice \
     --observer bob \
     --json > /tmp/alice-card.json
   ```

   Have Hermes Agent produce validated patches, dry-run them first, and apply only narrow, reviewed changes to the trial DB.

6. **Inspect identity and context**

   ```bash
   hermes-local-memory --db "$LOCAL_MEMORY_DB" peers --json
   hermes-local-memory --db "$LOCAL_MEMORY_DB" aliases --json
   hermes-local-memory --db "$LOCAL_MEMORY_DB" context \
     --peer alice \
     --observer bob \
     --query "memory quality"
   ```

7. **Set up scheduled maintenance in Hermes, not in this package**

   Use the cron prompt in [Scheduled maintenance with Hermes cron](#scheduled-maintenance-with-hermes-cron). Start with the trial DB. Only move to a live DB once import, identity mapping, context, and rollback expectations are clear.

8. **Only switch Hermes after validation**

   ```yaml
   memory:
     provider: local_memory
   ```

Development agents working from a checkout should run `PYTHONPATH=src python -m hermes_local_memory.cli ...` instead of `hermes-local-memory ...`.

Full command reference: [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md).

---

## Agent workflow

Agents should treat Local Memory as an auditable system of record.

Before repairs or migration:

```bash
hermes-local-memory --db memory.sqlite peers --json
hermes-local-memory --db memory.sqlite aliases --json
hermes-local-memory --db memory.sqlite cards --peer <peer> --observer <assistant> --json
hermes-local-memory --db memory.sqlite facts --peer <peer> --observer <assistant> --json
hermes-local-memory --db memory.sqlite messages --peer <peer> --json
hermes-local-memory --db memory.sqlite context --peer <peer> --observer <assistant> --query "current task"
```

When consolidating, prefer an autonomous-but-auditable agent loop:

1. generate a consolidation packet or plan with enough evidence and constraints
2. let Hermes Agent reason over it and choose the action
3. have Hermes produce a structured patch or call the appropriate memory tool
4. validate/diff/apply through Local Memory
5. inspect rendered context after apply
6. never mutate raw messages as part of consolidation

Agent-assisted consolidation should follow this pattern:

```text
SQLite packet -> Hermes Agent reasoning -> structured patch/tool call -> validation/diff -> explicit or policy-approved apply
```

The memory package should not own model calls. Hermes should.

---

## Scheduled peer review, reflection, and consolidation with Hermes cron

Regular memory maintenance is a first-class use case. The recommended path is to let Hermes schedule an autonomous job that has enough context, clear constraints, and permission boundaries to make routine memory-quality decisions itself.

The package should stay simple and local; Hermes should own scheduling, model calls, and judgment.

Recommended autonomous cadence:

- run nightly for most users, or every 6 hours for high-volume agents
- first run **peer review** so new platform identities can be mapped before downstream reflection/consolidation
- then run **reflection/distillation** over stale sessions so ordinary conversation can become candidate facts and summaries
- then run **all-pairs maintenance** across every subject/observer pair with cards or facts
- inspect each pair's current card, active facts, candidate facts, aliases, summaries, and rendered context
- apply narrow, validated fact-lifecycle changes only when the plan is clearly safe
- use card-review or consolidation patches with full `card_replace` when a compact card needs synthesis/cleanup
- deliver a concise report of reflected sessions, changed pairs, skipped pairs, and escalations
- escalate individual sessions/pairs when plans are large, noisy, ambiguous, identity-confused, or would rewrite cards heavily

Peer review should generally run before reflection and consolidation:

```text
new platform identities -> peer review packets -> alias moves or human prompts
raw messages -> reflection packets -> candidate facts + session summaries
candidate facts + active facts + cards -> maintenance -> safe fact lifecycle changes
card-review / consolidation patches -> compact card synthesis when needed
compact cards + durable facts + summaries + retrieval -> prompt injection
```

When the Local Memory plugin shim is installed and enabled, prefer the plugin-bundled skill `local_memory:maintenance` for scheduled jobs. Keep the cron prompt short because the full flow lives in the package-versioned skill; package updates plus `install-shim` keep the shim current while managed copied legacy skills are removed to avoid stale runbooks.

```text
Load and follow the plugin-provided `local_memory:maintenance` skill to run Hermes Local Memory maintenance.

Policy:
- phases/recipe: full maintenance except first Honcho migration unless explicitly requested or newly actionable
- apply: bounded, policy-safe changes after dry-run validation; skip/escalate ambiguous or large plans
- reporting: always report audit fields; for quiet deployments use on_error or silent instead
Database: ~/.hermes/memory/local_memory.sqlite
Runtime identity: use the current Hermes memory tool context. If provider tools are unavailable, instantiate LocalMemoryProvider from the installed hermes-local-memory package with the target database and realistic platform/user/agent identity.

Follow the loaded skill's maintenance cycle and report format. Do not duplicate the flow here. Never mutate raw messages. Never switch the live Hermes provider config.
```

Compatibility path only: older Hermes installations that cannot load plugin-provided skills may explicitly run `hermes-local-memory sync-skills --hermes-home ~/.hermes` after install/update and attach/load the copied `local-memory-maintenance` skill.

A more prudent/report-only variant is also useful for new deployments or risky imports:

```text
Run the same peer review + reflection + all-pairs maintenance job, but do not apply changes. Produce only a dry-run report with unresolved peer counts, proposed alias moves, human identity questions, stale session counts, proposed candidate facts/summaries, pair counts, candidate promotions/supersedes, card-review needs, skipped items, and recommendations.
```

This gives both modes:

- **autonomous by default** for well-scoped, well-validated maintenance
- **report-only** when a human wants extra caution

Recommended starting schedule: nightly. High-volume deployments can move to every 6 hours after the dry-run reports look clean. Users who want quieter background operation can keep the same plugin skill but set reporting policy to `on_error` or `silent` in the cron prompt.
