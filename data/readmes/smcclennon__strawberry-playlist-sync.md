## How It Works

### M3U8 File Format
The daemon parses M3U8 playlist files with the following format:
```
#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:265,Artist - Title
music/Artist/Artist - Title.flac
#EXTINF:244,Imagine Dragons - Wrecked
music/Imagine Dragons/Imagine Dragons - Wrecked.flac
```

**Relative Path Support**: The daemon supports both standard relative paths (relative to the playlist directory) and playlist-relative paths:

```
#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:244,Standard relative path
music/Artist/Song.flac
#EXTINF:265,Playlist-relative path
../OtherFolder/Song.mp3
#EXTINF:180,Current directory relative
./Song.wav
```

- **Standard paths** (e.g., `music/Artist/Song.flac`) are resolved relative to the configured playlist directory
- **Playlist-relative paths** (e.g., `../Artist/Song.mp3`) are resolved relative to the playlist file's location
- **Current directory paths** (e.g., `./Song.wav`) are resolved relative to the playlist file's directory

### Database Integration
- **Songs Table**: Matches file paths from M3U8 to songs in Strawberry's database using the `url` field
- **Playlists Table**: Creates or updates playlists by name (M3U8 filename without extension)
- **Playlist Items Table**: Links songs to playlists using `collection_id` references

### Synchronisation Process
1. **File Monitoring**: Uses `watchdog` to detect changes to `.m3u8` files
2. **Parsing**: Extracts relative file paths from M3U8 format with retry logic
3. **Database Lookup**: Finds corresponding songs in Strawberry's database
4. **Playlist Update**: Clears existing playlist items and adds new ones
5. **Caching**: Updates modification time cache to avoid redundant syncing
6. **Logging**: Records all operations for debugging

### Sync Direction and Safety

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This daemon provides **unidirectional sync only** - from M3U8 files to Strawberry database.

- **✅ M3U8 → Strawberry**: Automatically syncs changes from `.m3u8` files to Strawberry playlists
- **❌ Strawberry → M3U8**: Does NOT automatically export Strawberry playlists back to M3U8 files
- **🛡️ Read-Only M3U8**: The daemon never writes to M3U8 files, eliminating any risk of M3U8 corruption

**To export Strawberry playlists back to M3U8 format:**
1. Open the saved playlist in Strawberry Music Player
2. Press `Ctrl+S` (or File → Save Playlist)
3. Choose "M3U format" and save with `.m3u8` file extension
4. The exported M3U8 file will then be monitored for future changes

This design ensures your M3U8 files remain safe from any potential corruption whilst providing seamless one-way synchronisation from your mobile device edits to your desktop music player.

### Smart Caching System
- **Initial Sync**: Only syncs playlists that have changed since last run
- **Modification Tracking**: Stores last modified times in JSON cache
- **Performance**: Dramatically reduces startup time for large playlist collections

### Automatic Database Backup
- **Startup Protection**: Automatically creates a database backup on every daemon startup
- **Special First Backup**: The very first backup is named `strawberry_before_first_use.db` and is never deleted
- **Regular Startup Backups**: Subsequent startups create timestamped backups: `strawberry_backup_startup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.db`
- **Automatic Retention**: Keeps only the configured number of startup backups (default: 3), automatically removing older ones
- **Backup Location**: Stored in the configured backup directory (script directory) with timestamps
- **Safety First**: Ensures you always have recent backups before any sync operations

## Usage with Poweramp and Syncthing

1. **Android Setup**:
   - Install Poweramp on your Android device
   - Configure Syncthing to sync your playlist directory
   - **Important**: Playlists created directly in Poweramp remain in Poweramp's internal database and are NOT written to `.m3u8` files on disk
   - **Workaround**: Create initial `.m3u8` playlist files using another application (such as via Strawberry Music Player playlist export to `.m3u8`) first
   - Once `.m3u8` files exist on disk, Poweramp will automatically synchronise its internal database with these files when you edit playlists
   - Edit existing playlists in Poweramp (changes are written to the corresponding `.m3u8` files)

2. **Linux Setup**:
   - Configure the daemon with your playlist directory path
   - Run the daemon on your Linux machine
   - Changes sync via Syncthing and are automatically applied to Strawberry

3. **Workflow (Android → Linux)**:
   - **Prerequisites**: Ensure `.m3u8` playlist files already exist on disk (create them in Strawberry and export to `.m3u8` first if needed)
   - Edit playlists on Android → Poweramp updates `.m3u8` files
   - Syncthing syncs changes to Linux
   - Daemon detects file changes and updates Strawberry database
   - Strawberry shows updated playlists when double-clicking the playlist in the sidebar (if playlist is already open in a tab, you will need to close and re-open it to see the changes)

4. **Reverse Workflow (Linux → Android)**:
   - Create/edit playlists in Strawberry Music Player
   - Export to M3U8: Open playlist → `Ctrl+S` → Save as M3U format with `.m3u8` extension
   - Syncthing syncs the M3U8 file to Android
   - Poweramp detects file change and shows the updated playlist

**Note**: The daemon only handles the Android → Linux direction automatically. Linux → Android requires manual export from Strawberry to maintain M3U8 file safety.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Songs not found in database**:
   - Ensure Strawberry has scanned your music library
   - Check that file paths in M3U8 match actual file locations
   - Verify file permissions
   - Test with: `python3 test.py --song "path/to/song.flac"`

2. **Database locked errors**:
   - Close Strawberry before running initial sync
   - The daemon handles concurrent access during normal operation

3. **Configuration issues**:
   - Test configuration: `python3 test.py --config`
   - Check paths exist and are accessible
   - Verify JSON syntax in config file

4. **Playlist sync failures**:
   - Test specific playlist: `python3 test.py --sync playlist.m3u8`
   - Check M3U8 file format and encoding
   - Review logs for detailed error messages

### Log Files

- **Application logs**: Located in the script directory as specified in config
- **Test logs**: Displayed on console during test runs

### Manual Testing

Test individual components:
```bash
# Test configuration loading
python3 test.py --config

# Test database connectivity
python3 test.py --database

# Test M3U8 parsing
python3 test.py --parser

# Test complete workflow
python3 test.py --all
```

### Development

1. Fork the repository
2. Make your changes
3. Run the test suite: `python3 test.py --all`
4. Submit a pull request

### Database Schema Compatibility

The daemon includes automatic database schema version checking to ensure compatibility with your Strawberry database:

- **Supported Schema Version**: Currently supports Strawberry database schema version **20**
- **Automatic Checking**: The daemon checks the schema version on startup and exits if incompatible
- **Bypass Option**: Use `--ignore-database-schema-version` to bypass the check (**⚠️ WARNING: may cause data corruption or loss!**)

**Schema Version Errors**: If you encounter a schema version error, it means your Strawberry database uses a different schema version than what this daemon supports. This could happen if:
- You're using a newer version of Strawberry with schema changes
- You're using an older version of Strawberry
- The database is corrupted or incompatible

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Check your Strawberry version and update if necessary
2. **Always backup your database before proceeding**
3. Only use `--ignore-database-schema-version` if you understand the risks of potential data corruption or loss
4. Test thoroughly with a backup database first
