# Skemium

Generate and Compare [Debezium] Change Data Capture ([CDC]) [Avro] Schema.

Leveraging [Debezium] and [Schema Registry] own codebases, each Table of a Database is mapped to 3 components:

* _Key_ [Avro] schema: describes the `PRIMARY KEY` of the Table - `NULL` if not set
* _Value_ [Avro] schema: describes each Row of the Table
* _Envelope_ [Avro] schema: wrapper for the _Value_, used by Debezium to realize [CDC] when Producing to a Topic

[Debezium CDC Source Connector] uses the _Key_ and the _Envelope_ schemas when producing to a Topic:
the former is used for the [Message _Key_][Kafka Message Key], the latter for the Message _Payload_.

**Skemium** leverages those schemas to compare between evolutions of the originating Database Schema,
and identifies compatibility issues executing the comparison logic implemented by [Schema Registry].

**If you make changes to your Database Schema, and want to know if it's going to break your Debezium CDC production,
`skemium` is the tool for you.**

# Background

In our experience, the way [Debezium] works can catch users off guard in 2 major ways:

1. Making changes to the _source_ Database Schema in ways that break [Schema Compatibility]
2. Non-zero amount of time between making changes to the _source_ Database Schema, and that change being _captured_
   by Debezium and published to [Schema Registry]

**Avoiding the first is made much harder by the second!**

## Delayed schema publishing

There is sometimes confusion between “making a DB Schema” vs “making a [Schema Registry] Schema” change:

* the former happen when developers apply changes to their RDBMS: usually, before their application code start relying on the new schema
* the latter happens when data is actually updated into one of the changed tables:
  1. Debezium detects it (reading the [RDBMS WAL] and the `DESCRIBE TABLE` command)
  2. Debezium's `Producer` attempts to create a new Schema version for the associated [schema subject]
     1. _either_ fails if the change violates the configured [Schema Compatibility]
     2. _or_ succeeds in publishing a new version for the [schema subject] creation was successful
  3. Debezium's `Producer` resumes producing to the related Kafka Topic

When 2.1. above happens, Debezium stops producing and in turns stops consuming the [RDBMS WAL]:

1. Traffic from the RDBMS to Kafka halts (bad!)
2. RDBMS storage fills up, as the WAL is not getting flushed (worse!)

![Debezium "delayed schema publishing"](./images/debezium_delayed_schema_publishing.jpg)

## The role of `skemium`

Skemium's primary objective is to target this issue and empower developers to instrument their CI process
to detect a _breakage_ of a [CDC] [schema subject] **as early as possible**.

Ideally, when a PR is submitted and before any RDBMS schema has been changed in production, it should be possible to:

* spin up a local instance of the RDBMS
* apply the latest _desired_ DB Schema
* execute `skemium generate` to obtain the corresponding Avro Schemas
  (i.e. what would eventually land in [Schema Registry])
* execute `skemium compare` to compare an existing copy of the Avro Schemas,
  with the new one, applying the desired [Schema Compatibility]

![Example CI that would detect "schema breakage" sooner](./images/skemium_schema_breakage_CI_detection.jpg)

## What if a **_Breaking Schema Change_** is necessary?

Sometimes is going to be inevitable: you _need_ to make a change in your Database Schema,
and a new version of the [schema subject] must be released - a version that breaks [Schema Compatibility].

This is beyond the scope of Skemium (for now?), but in those situations
what you _can_ do is something along the lines of:

* Make a coordinated plan with Consumer Services of the [CDC] Topic
* Temporarily disable [Schema Compatibility] in [Schema Registry]
* Let [Debezium] publish a new [schema subject] version
* Restore [Schema Compatibility]

The details will depend on your specific circumstances, and your mileage may vary `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`.

## Generating the _correct_ Avro Schema

Skemium **does not** implement its own schema extraction or serialization logic: it relies instead on the source code
of [Debezium] and [Schema Registry]. Specifically, the following 2 packages do the bulk of the work:

```xml
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.debezium/debezium-core -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.debezium</groupId>
  <artifactId>debezium-core</artifactId>
  <version>${ver.debezium}</version>
</dependency>
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.confluent/kafka-connect-avro-converter -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.confluent</groupId>
  <artifactId>kafka-connect-avro-converter</artifactId>
  <version>${ver.kafka-connect-avro-converter}</version>
</dependency>
```

To dig deeper, please look at the [`pom.xml`](./pom.xml).

### Key classes "borrowed"

Skemium design brings together [Debezium][Debezium source code] and
[Schema Registry][Schema Registry source code] codebases, using the Apache [Avro] codebase as _lingua franca_:

* `TableSchemaFetcher` extracts a `List<io.debezium.relational.TableSchema>`, using the Debezium's
  RDBMS-specific connector source code to connect and query the DB schema
* A `TableAvroSchemas` is created for each `io.debezium.relational.TableSchema`, invoking the provided methods
  that extract _Key_, _Value_ and _Envelope_ as `org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Schema`
* Each `org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Schema` is converted to `io.confluent.kafka.schemaregistry.avro.AvroSchema` via
  the provided constructor
* `io.confluent.kafka.schemaregistry.CompatibilityChecker` is used to compare current and next
  versions of `io.confluent.kafka.schemaregistry.avro.AvroSchema`,
  applying the desired `io.confluent.kafka.schemaregistry.CompatibilityLevel`

This gives us confidence that the generation of the Avro Schema, as well as the compatibility check, are the exact
same that Debezium will apply in production.

# Usage

## Binaries

Skemium can be [compiled from source](#development), but for convenience we
[release binaries](https://github.com/snyk/skemium/releases):

* `skemium-${VER}-jar-with-dependencies`:
  an [_uber jar_](https://support.sonatype.com/hc/en-us/articles/28958118202131-What-is-an-uber-jar),
  easy to use in an environment where a JRE is present
* `skemium-${VER}-${OS}-${ARCH}`: native binary, generated via [GraalVM] (see [below](#package-native-binary))

All binaries are generated when a new _tag_ is pushed to the `main` branch.

## `generate` command

The `generate` command connects to a Database, reads its _Database Schema_ and coverts it to a [CDC] _Avro Schema_,
using [Debezium Avro Serialization].

The output is saved in a user given _output directory_. The directory will contain:

* For each Table, a set of files following the naming structure `DB_NAME.DB_SCHEMA.DB_TABLE.EXTENSION`
  * _Table Key_ schema file (`EXTENSION = .key.avsc`)
  * _Table Value_ schema file (`EXTENSION = .val.avsc`)
  * _Table Envelope_ schema file (`EXTENSION = .env.avsc`)
  * The checksum of all 3 schema files above (`EXTENSION = .sha256`)
* A metadata file named `.skemium.meta.json` ([schema](#generated-avro-schemas-metadata-file))

For example, if the database `example` contains 2 tables `user` and `address` in the database schema `public`, the output
directory will look like:

```shell
$ tree example_schma_dir/

example_schma_dir/
├── .skemium.meta.json
├── example.public.address.env.avsc
├── example.public.address.key.avsc
├── example.public.address.sha256
├── example.public.address.val.avsc
├── example.public.user.env.avsc
├── example.public.user.key.avsc
├── example.public.user.sha256
└── example.public.user.val.avsc
```

```
</details>

### Filtering parts of the Database Schema

`generate` offers options to filter parts of the Database Schema:

* `-s | --schema`: only include selected schema(s) in the output
  * Format: `-s DB_SCHEMA`
  * Cardinality: `1..*`, either repeat option OR use comma (`,`) separator
* `-t | --table`: only include selected table(s) in the output
  * Format: `-t DB_TABLE` or `-t DB_SCHEMA.DB_TABLE`
  * Cardinality: `1..*`, either repeat option OR use comma (`,`) separator
  * Specificity:
    * `DB_TABLE`: includes all tables of that name, across all selected schemas
    * `DB_SCHEMA.DB_TABLE` includes only a table of that name, in the specific schema
* `-x | --exclude-column`: exclude selected column(s) from the output
  * Format: `-x DB_SCHEMA.DB_TABLE.DB_COLUMN`
  * Cardinality: `1..*`, either repeat option OR use comma (`,`) separator

Where:

* `DB_SCHEMA` is the name of a schema defined in the database (e.g. `public`)
* `DB_TABLE` is the name of a table in the database
* `DB_COLUMN` is the name of a column in the database

## `compare` command

The `compare` command takes 2 directories (created via `generate`) containing the [CDC] _Avro Schema_ of a Database,
and compares them applying the given [Schema Compatibility] type.
The directories are identified as _`CURRENT`_ and _`NEXT`_:

* `CURRENT`: [CDC] Avro Schema of a Database, generated at time `T`
* `NEXT`: [CDC] Avro Schema of the Database, generated at time `T+1`

`compare` executes a table-by-table [Schema Compatibility] check, and reports on the result.
Exit Code will be `0` in case of success, `1` otherwise.

### Schema changes and CI mode

The `compare` command reports (via `WARN` logging) if discrepancies are detected between `CURRENT` and `NEXT`:

1. **Table additions/removals**: When tables are added or removed between the two schema directories
2. **Schema modifications**: When existing table schemas are modified (even if the changes are compatible)

The flag `--ci-mode` can be used to _force_ a failure in case of **any** schema changes:

* **Table discrepancies**: Additions or removals of tables
* **Schema changes**: Modifications to existing table schemas (key, value, or envelope schemas)

**This enhanced CI mode is ideally used in CI/CD automations** to ensure that:

* Engineers are forced to acknowledge schema changes by updating their schema copies
* All schema modifications are tracked and reviewed, even if they are compatible
* Schema drift is prevented by requiring explicit acknowledgment of changes

#### CI Mode Behavior

| Scenario                    | Normal Mode                | CI Mode    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------- |
| No changes                  | ✅ Success                 | ✅ Success |
| Compatible schema changes   | ✅ Success (with warnings) | ❌ Failure |
| Incompatible schema changes | ❌ Failure                 | ❌ Failure |
| Table additions/removals    | ✅ Success (with warnings) | ❌ Failure |

### JSON output

If necessary, the output of `compare` can be stored in a output JSON file, using the `--output` option ([schema](#avro-schemas-comparison-result)).

Compares Avro Schemas generated from Tables in a Database

skemium compare [-iv] [-c=<compatibilityLevel>] [-o=<output>] CURR_SCHEMAS_DIR NEXT_SCHEMAS_DIR

Description:

Given 2 directories (CURRENT / NEXT) containing Avro Schemas of Database Tables,
compares them according to Compatibility Level.

Parameters:
      CURR_SCHEMAS_DIR    Directory with the CURRENT Database Table schemas
      NEXT_SCHEMAS_DIR    Directory with the NEXT Database Table schemas

Options:
  -c, --compatibility=<compatibilityLevel>
                          Compatibility Level (env: COMPATIBILITY - optional)
                          See: https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/fundamentals/schema-evolution.html
                            Values: NONE, BACKWARD, BACKWARD_TRANSITIVE, FORWARD, FORWARD_TRANSITIVE, FULL, FULL_TRANSITIVE
                            Default: BACKWARD
  -i, --ci, --ci-mode     CI mode - Fail when schema changes are detected (table additions/removals or schema modifications) (env: CI_MODE - optional)

  -v, --verbose           Logging Verbosity - use multiple -v to increase (default: ERROR)
```
</details>

## `compare-files` command

The `compare-files` command compares two individual Avro Schema files (`.avsc`) directly, without requiring them to be part of a database-generated schema directory. This is useful for comparing bespoke or custom Avro schemas.

The command takes 2 Avro schema files and compares them applying the given [Schema Compatibility] type:

* `CURR_SCHEMA_FILE`: The current version of the Avro schema file
* `NEXT_SCHEMA_FILE`: The next version of the Avro schema file

`compare-files` executes a [Schema Compatibility] check and reports on the result.
Exit Code will be `0` in case of success, `1` otherwise.

### Including external type definitions

When your schema references types defined in separate files, the Avro parser needs those type definitions to be available. Use the `--include-schema` / `-s` option to include additional schema files for type resolution.

For example, if your main schema references an `Issue` type defined in another file:

```json
{
  "name": "issues",
  "type": {
    "type": "array",
    "items": "io.snyk.events.issue.Issue"
  }
}
```

You can include the `Issue` type definition:

```shell
skemium compare-files \
  --include-schema issue-type.avsc \
  base/main-schema.avsc \
  current/main-schema.avsc
```

Multiple type definitions can be included by repeating the option:

```shell
skemium compare-files \
  -s types/issue.avsc \
  -s types/project.avsc \
  base/event-schema.avsc \
  current/event-schema.avsc
```

### CI mode for file comparison

Similar to the `compare` command, `compare-files` supports a `--ci-mode` flag that will force a failure when any schema changes are detected, even if they are compatible. This ensures that all schema modifications are explicitly acknowledged.

### JSON output

The output of `compare-files` can be stored in a JSON file using the `--output` option ([schema](#schema-file-comparison-result)).

Compares two Avro Schema (.avsc) files

skemium compare-files [-iv] [-c=<compatibilityLevel>] [-o=<output>]
                      [-s=<includeSchemas>]... CURR_SCHEMA_FILE NEXT_SCHEMA_FILE

Description:

Given 2 Avro Schema files (.avsc), compares them according to the specified Compatibility Level.
This command is designed for comparing bespoke/custom Avro schemas that are not generated from database tables.

Parameters:
      CURR_SCHEMA_FILE    Path to the CURRENT Avro schema file (.avsc)
      NEXT_SCHEMA_FILE    Path to the NEXT Avro schema file (.avsc)

Options:
  -c, --compatibility=<compatibilityLevel>
                          Compatibility Level (env: COMPATIBILITY - optional)
                          See: https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/fundamentals/schema-evolution.html
                            Values: NONE, BACKWARD, BACKWARD_TRANSITIVE, FORWARD, FORWARD_TRANSITIVE, FULL, FULL_TRANSITIVE
                            Default: BACKWARD
  -i, --ci, --ci-mode     CI mode - Fail when schema changes are detected (env: CI_MODE - optional)
                            Default: false
  -o, --output=<output>   Output file (JSON); overridden if exists (env: OUTPUT_FILE - optional)
  -s, --include-schema=<includeSchemas>
                          Additional schema files to include for type resolution.
                          These schemas are parsed before the main schema files,
                          populating the parser's type registry to enable resolution
                          of referenced types. Can be specified multiple times.
  -v, --verbose           Logging Verbosity - use multiple -v to increase (default: ERROR)
```
</details>

## Logging verbosity

The option `-v | --verbose` (availabel for all commands) controls the logging verbosity.
By default, the logging level is `ERROR`.
But it can be increased by passing one or more `-v` options, to a maximum level of `TRACE`. The mapping is:

```
<none>    -> ERROR
-v        -> WARN
-vv       -> INFO
-vvv      -> DEBUG
-vvvv     -> TRACE
-vvvvv... -> TRACE
```

## Skemium's schemas

In a _kinda_ meta twist, Skemium command outputs _also_ have their own schemas.

### Generated Avro Schemas metadata file

The output of the command `generate` includes the _metadata_ file `.skemium.meta.json`.
This summarises the output of the command, information about the moment in time, the local repository, and more.

The schema for this file is at [<prj_root>/schemas/skemium.generate.meta.avsc](./schemas/skemium.generate.meta.avsc).

### Avro Schemas comparison result

The `compare` command can optionally save the result to an `--output` file.
This summarises what was compared, what [Schema Compatibility] was applied,
and what issues (if any) were identified by the comparison.

The schema for this file is at [<prj_root>/schemas/skemium.compare.result.avsc](./schemas/skemium.compare.result.avsc).

### Schema file comparison result

The `compare-files` command can optionally save the result to an `--output` file.
This summarises the two schema files that were compared, what [Schema Compatibility] was applied,
and what incompatibilities (if any) were identified.

The schema for this file is at [<prj_root>/schemas/skemium.compare-files.result.avsc](./schemas/skemium.compare-files.result.avsc).

# Interested in contributing?

Here are some major features that we haven't had time to tackle yet:

* [ ] Support for additional Databases (MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, Oracle, SQL Server, ...): currently only PostgreSQL is supported
* [ ] Support connecting to GCP CloudSQL databases via
  [dedicated `SocketFactory`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-sql-jdbc-socket-factory)
* [ ] Support custom key definition for a table, similar to what
  [`message.key.columns`](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/postgresql.html#postgresql-property-message-key-columns)
  allows when configuring Debezium. This is useful when an arbitrary key is desired or the table is missing a primary key.
* [ ] Support for _generating_ and _comparing_ [JSON Schema]
* [ ] Support for _generating_ and _comparing_ [Protobuf] schemas

Of course, small contributions and bugfixes are also _very_ welcome.

# Development

## Requirements

* Maven 3.9+
* JDK 21+

We recommend using [asdf] to setup your local development, as it makes it very easy to get set up:

```shell
asdf install
```

## Build & Test

```shell
$ mvn clean package
```

### Package Uber-JAR

```shell
$ mvn clean package assembly:single -DskipTests
```

### Package Native Binary

> [!NOTE]
> For this option, you need to use [GraalVM]. If you are using [asdf], edit the `.tools-versions` file and uncomment
> the line to switch on `oracle-graalvm`; then, `asdf install`.

```shell
$ mvn clean package native:compile-no-fork -DskipTests
```

#### GraalVM `native-image` and choosing a machine type

[`native-image`][native-image] is what [GraalVM] uses to compiles Java code into native executables.
The default options used by `native-image` are OK, but one determines the exact set of CPU features the compilation
happens against: `-march`
(documented in the [`native-image` build options](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/overview/Options/#build-options)).

<details>
<summary>Output of `-march=list` on `x86_64`</summary>

'native'
  CPU features: FP + ASIMD + EVTSTRM + AES + PMULL + SHA1 + SHA2 + CRC32 + LSE + DCPOP + SHA3 + SHA512 + SVE + PACA + SVEBITPERM + SVE2


The option also supports one or more feature modifiers via the form '-march=arch{+[no]feature}*'. Example: 'armv8.1-a+lse' enables Large System Extension instructions.
The following feature modifiers are available: 'aes', 'lse', 'fp', 'simd'.
```
</details>

After a bit of experimentation, we determined that `-march=compatibility` was the best choice.

## Taskfile (optional)

If you have taken advantage of the [asdf] setup (i.e. `asdf install`), you have already installed https://taskfile.dev/.
Most frequently used _tasks_ are already configured in the [Taskfile](./Taskfile.yml). Give it a go!

## Cutting a new release

The CI is setup to create a new release when a new tag in the format `vX.Y.Z` is pushed to the repository.
We use [gh-release] to handle most of the process (see [.github/workflows/release-*.yaml](./.github/workflows) for details),
and the only manual step is to:

1. ensure all PRs we aim to merge and release are merged
2. figure out what the next version should be, by following [Semantic Versioning] principles: e.g. `$NEXT_VERSION`
3. tag `main` and update `pom.xml` with the new version: `task tag-version -- $NEXT_VERSION`
4. push the new tag to the `main` branch of the repo: `git push origin main --follow-tags --tags`
5. Go to https://github.com/snyk/skemium/actions and confirm the release process has started

# Credits

As any open source tool, this builds on the shoulders of the great work of others (see the [pom.xml](./pom.xml)).

But I want to especially thank 2 projects for the _core_ of the functionality:
  * [Debezium], providing logic to extract database table schemas
  * Confluent [Schema Registry], providing logic to convert to/from Avro Schemas
