# Meridian - policy, business & markets

**A daily intelligence brief for India.** Meridian ingests ~95 government,
regulator and newsroom feeds three times a day, sorts every story into eight
sections and twenty-five sectors, and presents the result as something you read
rather than something you monitor - a scored lead, a machine-written wrap of the
last 24 hours, per-sector coverage momentum, and six "reader desks" that re-rank
the same archive for whoever is looking at it.

---

A dashboard that pulls together, on a schedule, what's happening in India across:
policy & regulation, subsidies & schemes, business & startups, tech & innovation
pushes, the economy & markets, investment/FDI, trade (import/export), and
geopolitics - from ~35 official government and business-news RSS feeds, a dated
news-archive crawl that backfills months of history, and (optionally) the
NewsData.io API.

## How it works

- **`lib/ingestion/`** - one module per source type. RSS sources (`rss.ts`) are
  fetched and normalized from the feed list in `sources.ts` (PIB, RBI, SEBI, PM
  India, plus the Economic Times / Business Standard / Mint / BusinessLine /
  The Hindu / Indian Express / Moneycontrol / Inc42 desks); `googleNews.ts`
  queries a dated news archive; the optional NewsData.io source (`newsdata.ts`)
  only runs if `NEWSDATA_API_KEY` is set. `run.ts` orchestrates all of them.
- **Historical backfill (`lib/ingestion/backfill.ts`, `npm run backfill`)** - RSS
  only ever exposes a publisher's latest few dozen items, which is why a fresh
  install starts out showing "the last few days" and nothing else. The backfill
  walks the Google News archive month by month with `after:`/`before:` date
  operators, running eight India-scoped topical queries per month, and
  attributes each story to its actual publisher rather than to the aggregator.
  A single crawl of two years pulls in thousands of stories.
- **The job board (`lib/ingestion/jobBoards.ts`, `npm run jobs`)** - `/jobs`
  aggregates openings from eleven public sources, each of which asks for
  attribution and a link back, so every card names its source and opens the
  original posting. Five are global remote boards (Himalayas, Remotive, Jobicy,
  Arbeitnow, Remote OK). The rest exist because India barely registers on
  those: `lib/ingestion/jobSourcesIndia.ts` reads The Muse city by city, the
  live Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby boards of ~30 companies with a real India desk,
  the public Workday career sites of eleven large employers - which is where
  the Gujarat roles are, Micron's Sanand fab most of all - and Amazon's own
  India board, the largest single source here and the one carrying the most
  first jobs. Postings age out after 60 days; nothing is hosted here and
  nothing is applied to here.
- **Reaching the entry rungs** - a plain recency walk over any of these returns
  the senior ladder and never gets to the bottom of it, so the entry rungs are
  asked for by name: The Muse is queried again per city with its `Entry Level`
  and `Internship` facets, Workday with `Graduate` / `Trainee` / `Apprentice` /
  `Intern`, and Amazon with the grades it actually advertises first jobs under
  (`Specialist I`, `Associate`, `Engineer I`). The experience rail on `/jobs` is
  drawn as a ladder rather than by size, so the board reads from internships at
  one end to executive posts at the other.
- **Reading a posting (`lib/jobClassify.ts`, `lib/places.ts`)** - keyword rule
  sets put each posting on three axes: the discipline the work sits in, the
  employer's industry, and how much experience it asks for - the last read from
  the board's own seniority band first, the title second (including the Indian
  first-job vocabulary: graduate engineer trainee, management trainee, officer
  trainee, the trailing roman `I`), and the posting's stated requirements third,
  where `statedMinYears` pulls the employer's own "0-5 years" or "4+ years"
  straight out of the text. A gazetteer turns
  the board's free-text location ("Sanand - 303A - AT/SSD/MOD, India") into a
  country, the state inside it and a city, which is what makes the board
  drillable - India, then Gujarat, then Sanand. India is covered far more finely
  than anywhere else, and Gujarat most finely of all.
- **Deferred filtering (`lib/deferredFilter.ts`)** - every filter on the site is
  a link, because a filtered view is a place and a place needs a URL. Where
  JavaScript is available, a multiple-choice chip no longer navigates on click:
  it lights up, waits ~1.2s for the next click, and one navigation carries
  everything picked. No filter link scrolls the page.
- **`lib/categorize.ts`** - a keyword-based rule set assigns each article to one
  of the 8 categories, independent of which source it came from, plus a
  cross-cutting sub-domain tag (25 curated sectors - renewable energy, ports &
  shipping, fintech, MSME, etc). If nothing matches, the card falls back to
  showing its category as the tag, so every card always has at least one.
- **Dedup** - every article is upserted on its `url` (unique). Because wire copy
  is republished under many URLs, ingestion *also* compares a normalized
  headline (`lib/ingestion/dedupe.ts`) against everything already stored in the
  window being processed, so five outlets carrying the same PTI story produce
  one entry.
- **Filters** - every feed supports a time-range filter (24h/7d/1m/3m/1y/all,
  `?range=`), a browse-by-month picker covering a rolling 24 months (`?month=`),
  multi-select section (`?cats=`) and sector (`?tags=`) pickers, a sort
  (`?sort=new|old|section`) and pagination (`?page=`) - all combinable,
  all shareable as URLs, and all preserved across paging.
- **Page size follows the device** - forty stories is a page on a laptop and
  roughly twenty screens of thumb on a phone, so `lib/viewport.ts` reads the
  User-Agent for the `Mobi` token and phones get ten. Tablets deliberately do
  not match it: Android tablets drop the token and iPadOS reports as a Mac.
- **"By section" is a board, not a sort** - `?sort=section` drops the flat feed
  for one box per section, each showing two rows and paging in place, so the
  busiest two sections cannot eat the page (`lib/sectionBoard.ts`).
- **The sector desk (`/opportunities`)** - 25 sectors ranked by coverage
  momentum, state support and visible capital, computed in cached raw-SQL passes
  over `unnest(tags)` (`lib/opportunity.ts`), with hand-rolled inline-SVG charts
  and no chart library. Momentum is each sector's *share* of all coverage rather
  than its story count - the archive's own volume grows as it backfills, and
  measured absolutely every sector looks like it is accelerating.
- **Reader desks (`/for`)** - the same archive re-ranked for six jobs: citizen,
  student, founder, business owner, investor and public sector. A desk is a
  weighted set of sections and sectors (`lib/personas.ts`), not a stored tag, so
  one lives or dies in a single file and every figure on it is the same measured
  figure as everywhere else. Each carries a ranked front page, its tracked
  sectors with their signals and latest stories, and the archive scoped to it.
- **Reading order** - the page opens on a scored lead rather than whatever is
  newest (`lib/leadStory.ts`): a story with a real deck, from a curated feed,
  and not a routine auction result or numbered circular. The feed below is
  grouped by IST day, each day opening with a feature and dropping into
  scannable rows.
- **"The wrap" - an AI-written daily summary** - the same 24-hour headlines
  that fill the brief are sent to Gemini, which writes a short standfirst plus
  3-5 category-tagged takeaways (`lib/summarize.ts`). Stored on the day's
  `DailyBrief` row and rendered at the top of the home page. Needs
  `GEMINI_API_KEY`; without it the brief still generates, just without the
  written summary.
- **"Ask AI" per article (off by default)** - an "Ask" button on every story
  that calls Gemini (via `/api/ask`, `lib/gemini.ts`) with just that article's
  headline/excerpt/metadata to answer a free-text question about it, in an
  overlay with a few starter prompts. **Disabled unless `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ASK`
  is exactly `"true"`** - it is the one Gemini feature whose cost scales with
  traffic instead of with content, so a public deployment leaving it on is an
  open tap on your API key. The flag gates the button *and* the route: with it
  unset, `/api/ask` returns 404 no matter who posts to it. See
  `lib/features.ts`.
- **The market desk (`/markets`)** - the same archive read for who it names and
  what it changes, in four surfaces. `/company` gives every one of ~300 curated
  Indian businesses its own timeline, matched by dictionary rather than by an
  NER model (`lib/entities.ts`) and stored on `Article.entities` at ingest.
  `/issuance` recovers the primary-issuance pipeline - IPO, QIP, rights, OFS,
  buyback, block deal - from headlines, split by instrument and by stage.
  `/regulators` separates what 24 regulators actually issued into circulars,
  master directions, penalties and consultation papers, and marks which of them
  bind anyone. `/calendar` generates the fiscal, tax, results and derivatives
  dates from rules rather than from a typed list, and flags anything it cannot
  confirm. The desk also carries the bridge from each sector to the index that
  tracks it - including the four that nothing on either exchange tracks, and the
  nine more where the only mapping is a loose proxy.
  **There are no prices anywhere on it:** exchange data is licensed, this
  project holds no licence, and every figure is a count of coverage.
- **`/api/cron/ingest`** - pulls all sources and stores new articles.
- **`/api/cron/brief`** - builds the "In brief" panel from the last 24h of
  articles, a handful of highlights per category, which the front page
  interleaves so one busy category can't fill the whole list.
- Both cron routes are protected by `CRON_SECRET` (see below). Neither is on a
  timer any more - see "The schedule" below for why, and for what runs them.

We deliberately store only a **headline, short excerpt, and link back to the
source** - never full article text - both to stay on solid fair-use footing for
the news sources and to keep this an aggregator, not a republisher. See the
`/sources` page in the running app for exactly what's being pulled from where.

## Local setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in DATABASE_URL at minimum
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`. With no data ingested yet you'll see empty
states. Populate them:

```bash
# Two years of history from the news archive (a few minutes; safe to re-run).
npm run backfill -- --months=23

# Attribute the stored archive to companies. The entities column is created
# empty by its migration, so the market desk is blank until this has run.
npm run entities -- --apply

# Then the live feeds, and the daily brief.
curl http://localhost:3000/api/cron/ingest
curl http://localhost:3000/api/cron/brief
```

`npm run backfill` also accepts `--queries=policy,subsidy,tech,startups,`
`investment,economy,trade,geopolitics` to crawl only some topics.

## Getting a database (Neon, free tier)

1. Create a project at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech).
2. Copy the **pooled** connection string (hostname contains `-pooler`) - this
   matters for serverless (Vercel) so connections don't exhaust the DB's limit.
3. Put it in `.env` as `DATABASE_URL`, then run `npx prisma migrate dev --name init`
   to create the tables.

## Getting a NewsData.io key (optional, free tier)

1. Sign up at [newsdata.io](https://newsdata.io) (free tier: 200 credits/day,
   allows commercial use, has India + business/politics filters).
2. Copy the API key into `.env` as `NEWSDATA_API_KEY`.
3. Ingestion picks it up automatically on the next run - no code changes.

## Getting a Gemini API key (optional, for "The wrap" and "Ask AI")

1. Create a key at [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
2. Copy it into `.env` as `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
3. Both features pick it up on the next request - no code changes. `lib/gemini.ts`
   is the shared client (hand-rolled `fetch`, not the SDK - see its file
   comment for why): `/api/cron/brief` makes one call/day to `gemini-3.5-flash`
   (override with `GEMINI_MODEL`) over the day's ~32 headlines; `/api/ask`
   makes one call per question, capped at 1024 output tokens (and is disabled
   unless `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ASK="true"`). There's no
   per-user rate limiting on `/api/ask` since the app has no auth layer - fine
   for personal/local use, worth adding a limiter before a public deploy.
   Summarisation failures are logged and swallowed (brief keeps its headline
   list, previous day's wrap stays in place); `/api/ask` failures surface as a
   clear error in the overlay instead.

## Deploying to Vercel

1. Push this repo to GitHub (or another git provider Vercel supports).
2. In Vercel: **New Project** → import the repo.
3. Add environment variables in the Vercel project settings: `DATABASE_URL`
   (and `NEWSDATA_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY` if you have them).
4. Generate a random string and set it as `CRON_SECRET` in Vercel's env vars -
   Vercel Cron then automatically sends it as a bearer token on scheduled
   requests, so nobody else can trigger your ingestion/brief routes.
5. Deploy.
6. Run `npx prisma migrate deploy` once against the production `DATABASE_URL`
   (from your machine, with `DATABASE_URL` pointed at prod) to create the
   tables before the first ingestion run.

## The schedule

Ingestion runs **three times a day, at 09:00, 15:00 and 21:00 IST**, from
`.github/workflows/ingest.yml`. It runs `npm run ingest`, then `npm run jobs`,
then `npm run brief` on a GitHub runner, talking to the database directly.

It is not a Vercel cron, and `vercel.json` no longer exists. A full sweep is
~95 feeds and takes minutes; a Vercel function is capped at 60 seconds, so the
cron that used to live there was killed part-way through every run and the
archive quietly stopped growing. Vercel's Hobby plan also caps crons at
once/day, which cannot express "three times". A runner has neither limit, needs no
deployment to exist, and is what `scripts/ingest.ts` was written for in the
first place.

To set it up, add three **repository** secrets under Settings → Secrets and
variables → Actions: `DATABASE_URL`, `NEWSDATA_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
`CRON_SECRET` is not needed - the runner never goes through HTTP. Then use
Actions → Ingest → **Run workflow** to fire the first run without waiting.

Two things to know about GitHub's scheduler: it queues rather than firing on
the second, so runs land a few minutes late (occasionally 15-20 under load);
and it disables scheduled workflows in a repository with no activity for 60
days, which any commit or manual run re-arms.

To change the times, edit the `cron:` line in the workflow. It is in **UTC**,
so subtract 5:30 from the IST time you want - `30 3,9,15 * * *` is 09:00,
15:00 and 21:00 IST.

## What's next (Phase 2)

- PRS India (legislative tracker), Startup India schemes feed, DGFT/TRADESTAT
  trade-data scraping, MEA geopolitics - all HTML-scrape-only sources, each
  needs its own bespoke, more fragile scraper.
- Optional LLM-based re-categorization / "why this matters" enrichment.
- Optional Google Trends widget (no reliable free API exists today - `pytrends`
  is unmaintained/rate-limited; SerpApi is a paid alternative).
