# DefraDB.rs

Rust implementation of [DefraDB](https://github.com/sourcenetwork/defradb) — a peer-to-peer document database with content-addressed CRDTs, access control, and GraphQL.

Targets embedded, edge, browser (WASM), and server deployments with **full Go DefraDB network interoperability**.

Storage is [Regolith](https://github.com/sourcenetwork/regolith), an ACID,
pure-Rust embedded LSM-tree engine built for edge systems. It is the only
backend, and the same engine runs on a server, on an embedded device, and in a
browser tab: no C toolchain, no linker surprises, and nothing to select between.
Reads and scans stream rather than materialize, so memory is bounded by the page
being held and not by the size of the data.

## Status

Compatible with Go DefraDB v1.0.0-rc1. Full feature parity across CLI, HTTP API, GraphQL query engine, and P2P replication. Go and Rust nodes can connect and replicate data.

## Features

- **GraphQL query engine** — queries, mutations, subscriptions, aggregates, explain - full coverage of the defradb test suite
- **P2P replication** — `libp2p` (primary, go compatable) and [`iroh`](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh) (optional) transports
- **Access control** — local Zanzibar engine, on-chain via [Vera](https://github.com/sourcenetwork/vera) (Cosmos/EVM) and [`vera.rs`](https://github.com/sourcenetwork/vera.rs) (Commonware/EVM)
- **Full-text search** — (rust only) BM25 ranking with language-aware tokenization
- **Schema migration** — non-destructive evolution via WASM transforms (Lens)
- **Searchable encryption** — encrypted indexes with ACP integration
- **[Regolith](https://github.com/sourcenetwork/regolith) storage engine**: one ACID, pure-Rust LSM-tree store on every target, on disk or in memory
- **Postgres compatibility** — connect with `psql` or any Postgres client/ORM (experimental!)
- **WASM client** — full database client compiled to WebAssembly for browsers
- **FFI bindings** — C-compatible static library for embedding in Go and other languages
- **Docker** — multi-arch images at `ghcr.io/sourcenetwork/defradb-rs`

## Building

Install [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just), then let it install everything else:

```bash
cargo install just    # one time, if you already have a Rust toolchain
just setup            # Rust, protoc, Go, a JDK, Lean/lake, the TLC jar, wasm tooling
```

Without Rust yet, install a prebuilt `just` first, since `just setup` is what
installs the toolchain:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh \
  | bash -s -- --to ~/.local/bin      # or grab a binary from the just releases page
```

`just setup` needs no root and no package manager: every tool is fetched from its
official release into a git-ignored `.tooling/` inside the repo and put on `PATH`.
It is written for Linux and macOS on x86_64 and arm64, and is currently verified
on Linux x86_64. Downloads are pinned by version and checked against a SHA-256
before use. The host needs `bash`, `curl`, `tar`, `unzip` and `git`.

`just doctor` reports what resolved and what is missing.

```bash
just build             # Build all crates
just build-release     # Release binary
just test              # Unit tests
just lint              # Lint (every lint and feature check CI runs)
just check-node-graph  # Feature-graph contracts for defra-node
just fmt               # Format
just gate              # fmt + lint + docs + tests, before asking for a review
just ci                # Reproduce the CI pipeline locally
```

### FFI release variants

Every release ships three FFI families: **full** (`defra-ffi_*`), carrying the
libp2p transport, Lens migrations, and Vera ACP; **iroh**
(`defra-ffi-iroh_*`), an iOS XCFramework that adds the iroh transport on top of
libp2p; and **lean** (`defra-ffi-lean_*`), libp2p-only with no Lens migrations
and no Vera ACP. Iroh ships in that XCFramework alone, so no single
artifact carries every capability. All of them expose the same `defra.h`
and the same mobile JSON schema, so the choice is a size tradeoff and not an API
one: configuring a capability the build does not carry fails with an explicit
error naming the missing feature. The per-release capability matrix is in the
release notes on the
[releases page](https://github.com/sourcenetwork/defradb.rs/releases).

## Configuration

The CLI exposes GraphQL query guardrails on `defradb start`:

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `--query-max-depth` | `20` | Max GraphQL selection nesting depth (`0` = unlimited). |
| `--query-max-width` | `100` | Max fields at any GraphQL selection level (`0` = unlimited). |
| `--query-max-filter-depth` | `50` | Max recursive filter nesting depth (`0` = unlimited). |

## Telemetry (OpenTelemetry)

Opt in at compile time with `--features otel`:

```bash
cargo build --release -p cli --features otel
```

Mirrors Go DefraDB's `//go:build telemetry` tag — when not compiled in, zero OTel dependencies and zero runtime cost. When compiled in, **traces** export to `http://localhost:4318` (OTLP/HTTP) by default, same endpoint as Go.

Metrics export is planned alongside the first application metric.

| Flag / env var | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--no-telemetry` / `DEFRA_NO_TELEMETRY=true` | Disable exporters at runtime. |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | Override collector URL (standard OTel env var). |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` | Add headers, e.g. for auth. |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` / `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` | Override service name / extra attributes. |
| `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER` | Configure sampling (default: parent-based always-on, matching Go). |

When no collector is reachable, the OTel SDK's repeated export errors are suppressed and a single actionable hint — `OpenTelemetry export failed, ensure your OTLP collector is running and reachable` — is emitted once per process. This ports Go's `otel.SetErrorHandler + sync.Once` behavior (issue #977); genuine non-connectivity OTel errors still log normally.

### Embedded usage

Library consumers (via `defra-node`) own the OTel lifecycle and hand the resulting handle to the node. The node flushes it via `Drop` or via an explicit `shutdown()` — explicit is preferred because `Drop` blocks for up to ~5 s on the SDK's trace batch-thread join.

Add `telemetry` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
defra-node = { version = "0.5", features = ["otel"] }
telemetry  = { version = "0.5", features = ["otlp"] }
```

```rust
use defra_node::EmbeddedNode;
use telemetry::TelemetryConfig;
use tracing_subscriber::{layer::SubscriberExt, util::SubscriberInitExt};

let (handle, tracer) = telemetry::init(
    TelemetryConfig::new("my-service", env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"))
)?;

// Compose the OTel bridge onto your tracing subscriber so spans flow
// to the collector. `try_init()` returns Err if a global subscriber is
// already installed — preferred over `.init()` (which panics).
tracing_subscriber::registry()
    .with(tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer())
    .with(telemetry::otel_layer(tracer))
    .try_init()?;

let node = EmbeddedNode::builder()
    .with_telemetry(handle)
    .build()
    .await?;

// ... use the node ...

// Explicit shutdown flushes the buffered batch. Drop is a safety net,
// but blocks the calling thread on the SDK batch-thread join (~5 s);
// call shutdown() explicitly from an async-aware path when possible.
// Note that the node should not be used after shutdown — subsequent spans
// go to a no-op tracer.
node.shutdown().await;
```

If the host process already runs its own OTel stack and you don't want `telemetry::init` to clobber your globals, use `.without_global()`:

```rust
let (handle, _tracer) = telemetry::init(
    TelemetryConfig::new("my-service", "1.0.0").without_global()
)?;
// You'd compose `_tracer` into a layer of your own choosing instead of
// installing it as the process-wide global tracer.
```

## HTTP transactions

`GET /api/v0/collections` returns the full definitions of the selected versions.
Document creation returns an array of document IDs. Supply `x-defradb-tx` to bind
REST document reads, writes and ID listings to an existing transaction, including
uncommitted schemas. Committing publishes those writes; discarding removes them.
Read-only and finalized transactions reject mutations. Transaction handles belong
to the identity that opened them; other callers receive the same not-found
response as an unknown handle. Renewed tokens for the same identity retain access.

## Testing

### Integration Tests

Rust-native tests that exercise the full node via CLI + HTTP API. Primary validation method.

```bash
cargo test -p integration-test                              # All areas
cargo test -p integration-test --test basic                  # Specific area
cargo test -p integration-test --test acp -- negative::      # Specific module
```

Areas: `basic`, `query`, `acp`, `nac`, `p2p`, `fts`, `encryption`, `identity`, `backup`, `vera`, `verars`

Vera integration uses the `vera` crate, Cargo feature, and test suite. Select it
with `--document-acp-type vera` and configure endpoints with `--vera-*` flags,
`DEFRA_VERA_*` environment variables, or `vera_*` configuration fields. Older
`--source-hub-*` flags, `DEFRA_SOURCE_HUB_*` environment variables,
`sourcehub_*` configuration fields, and the `source-hub` ACP selector remain
accepted. Mobile JSON uses `vera` (`sourcehub` is an alias). The `sourcehub`
Cargo feature remains an alias for `vera`.

### Go Compatibility Tests

FFI-based tests that build the Rust implementation as a C library and run Go's integration test suite against it. Validates behavioral compatibility between implementations.

```bash
cargo install --path tools/ffi-test
ffi-test run query/simple              # Run specific package
ffi-test status                        # Show pass rates
```

See `tools/ffi-test/README.md` for full usage.

## Performance

Every push to `main` measures the suite across Linux, macOS and a browser, and
publishes the run to the dashboard:

**https://sourcenetwork.github.io/defradb.rs/**

The run documents under `runs/` are the artifact; the page is a reader over
them, so any metric can be plotted across every run ever recorded. A family the
collector did not receive is drawn as an explicit gap and never as a zero, and a
timing taken on a runner that was not quiet is marked contaminated rather than
presumed comparable.

Every pull request gets a quick check commented back onto it: a few families on
Linux, measured against that PR's own merge base on the same runner with the
same build profile. Run the whole matrix on a branch with the **Performance**
workflow's `Run workflow` button.

```bash
just perf                     # measure this machine, build the dashboard locally
just perf-serve               # then read it at http://127.0.0.1:8099/
just perf-compare a.json b.json
cargo bench -p benches --bench document_write
```

## P2P Replication

### Protected writes with Vera ACP

For a policy-protected document, inbound updates and deletes require the
**verified signer of each composite block** to hold the corresponding Vera
`update` or `delete` permission. This also applies to ancestors, batch merges,
and explicit-replicator replay. An unsigned update is rejected. The receiving
node's read access is a separate check, not permission for the sender to write.
If document registration is not yet visible, strict-mode updates wait for a
retry rather than treating the document as public.

HTTP/JWT authentication and block signing are different identities: the JWT
identifies the caller for the local mutation, but the serving node signs the
replicated blocks. To edit an existing protected document through another node,
the owner must **grant that node's DID** a relation whose policy expression
permits `update` and/or `delete`, before issuing the mutation. For example, with
a policy where `writer` grants both permissions, add a `writer` relationship
for the serving node's DID on that document. `client node-identity` reports the
DID; do not substitute its transport peer ID. Grant read access as needed for
replication, but a `reader` relationship alone cannot authorize writes.

Only grant write access to trusted nodes: it authorizes their signatures, not
just requests made by a particular user. Without the grant, a local HTTP edit
can succeed while its replication is rejected and quarantined. Granting access
later does not automatically replay a quarantined update. This inbound write
gate intentionally differs from Go's serve-side-read-only replication checks.
Local ACP retains its existing node-owner shortcut and unregistered-replica
semantics; genesis handling is unchanged.

### Filtered replication

A replicator can carry an optional per-collection predicate so a source node only **pushes** documents whose field matches:

```bash
defradb client p2p replicator add -c MyCollection \
  --filter-field agent_did --filter-value did:key:alice <peer-multiaddr>
```

The filter field must be a scalar, `@immutable` LWW field on the collection.

**Filtered replication is a push-path selectivity optimization, not an access-control boundary.** A peer that also subscribes to the collection (`p2p collection add`) joins the collection's gossip topic and receives every document, bypassing the filter. Use ACP and encryption for confidentiality. The `--filter-value` is matched as a JSON string, so only string-valued fields can be filtered today.
