**Open-source LLM observability you can turn on in one line.** Point your OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini client at Spanlens and every call is logged with cost, tokens, latency, and full agent traces. No SDK rewrite, no platform migration. Eleven providers supported, plus native Vercel AI SDK, LangChain, and LlamaIndex integrations, and you can query it all from Cursor or Claude Desktop through the bundled [MCP server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spanlens/mcp-server). Self-hostable in one Docker command. MIT.

**Why it exists.** I shipped an LLM app on OpenAI and Gemini and hit a wall. The provider dashboards showed total spend and nothing else. I could not tell which feature burned the most tokens, which model was cheapest per task, or what each endpoint actually cost. Spanlens is the layer I wanted. It turns on in one line, stays off the critical path, and is open source so you can self-host the exact code we run.

## Why Spanlens?

- **Helicone** was acquired and its roadmap is uncertain.
- **Langfuse** is powerful but complex to set up and expensive to scale.
- **Spanlens** ships the 20% of features that cover 80% of real production needs. You get request log, cost tracking, agent tracing, anomaly detection, PII scanning, and prompt versioning with a clean UI, a two-minute setup, and pricing that doesn't punish growth.

| | Spanlens | Langfuse Pro | Helicone |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open source | ✅ MIT | ✅ MIT | ✅ MIT |
| Self-hostable | ✅ Docker one-liner | ✅ | ✅ |
| Free tier | 50K req/mo | 50K events/mo | 10K req/mo |
| Team plan (1M req/mo) | **$149/mo** | $271/mo | ~$200/mo |
| Agent tracing | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ limited |
| LLM-as-judge evals | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| PII + injection scan | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Model recommendations | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Prompt A/B experiments | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

![Spanlens Team $149/mo vs Langfuse Pro $271/mo at 1M requests per month](.github/assets/pricing-vs-langfuse.png)

**Predictable bills, no quota cliff.** Free hits a hard `429` at 50K requests so a runaway loop in dev can't cost you money. Paid plans use a soft limit with authorized overage (Pro: +$8 / 100K, Team: +$5 / 100K) up to a hard cap you control, so a traffic spike charges you fairly instead of dropping requests.

**Seats**: Free 1 · Pro 3 · Team 10 · Enterprise unlimited. Unlimited projects on every paid tier.

## ⚡ Quick start in 30 seconds

### TypeScript / JavaScript (Next.js)

```bash
npx @spanlens/cli init
```

The wizard:

1. Installs `@spanlens/sdk` with your package manager (npm / pnpm / yarn / bun)
2. Writes `SPANLENS_API_KEY` to `.env.local`
3. Rewrites every `new OpenAI({ apiKey, baseURL })` into `createOpenAI()`

Paste your Spanlens API key once, confirm two prompts, done. Your LLM calls are now flowing through the Spanlens proxy and visible in [www.spanlens.io/requests](https://www.spanlens.io/requests).

#### Manual TypeScript setup

```ts
import { createOpenAI } from '@spanlens/sdk/openai'
const openai = createOpenAI()  // reads SPANLENS_API_KEY, uses Spanlens proxy baseURL
```

### Python

```bash
pip install "spanlens[openai]"
```

```python
from spanlens.integrations.openai import create_openai

client = create_openai()  # reads SPANLENS_API_KEY from env
res = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
)
```

For agent tracing in Python (multi-step, async, tool calls) see the [Python SDK README](./packages/sdk-python/README.md).

### Framework integrations

Already using an orchestration framework? Plug Spanlens in as a callback. No code rewrites.

**Vercel AI SDK** (Next.js / edge friendly)

```ts
import { SpanlensClient } from '@spanlens/sdk'
import { createSpanlensTracker } from '@spanlens/sdk/vercel-ai'

const tracker = createSpanlensTracker({
  client: new SpanlensClient({ apiKey: process.env.SPANLENS_API_KEY! }),
  modelName: 'gpt-4o',
})

await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  messages,
  onStepFinish: tracker.onStepFinish,
  onFinish: tracker.onFinish,
})
```

**LangChain JS / LangGraph**

```ts
import { createSpanlensCallbackHandler } from '@spanlens/sdk/langchain'

const handler = createSpanlensCallbackHandler({ client })
await chain.invoke({ input }, { callbacks: [handler] })   // LangChain
await graph.invoke({ input }, { callbacks: [handler] })   // LangGraph
```

**LlamaIndex TS**

```ts
import { Settings } from 'llamaindex'
import { registerSpanlensCallbacks } from '@spanlens/sdk/llamaindex'

const unregister = registerSpanlensCallbacks(Settings, { client })
// ... run queries ... unregister() on shutdown
```

**Python: LangChain**: `from spanlens.integrations.langchain import SpanlensCallbackHandler`. Same `BaseCallbackHandler` contract, works with chains, LCEL, and LangGraph.

**More integrations**: AWS Bedrock, CrewAI, Flowise, Instructor, LlamaIndex, OpenAI Assistants, MCP server. Full setup walkthroughs at [spanlens.io/docs/integrations](https://www.spanlens.io/docs/integrations).

**Ollama (local LLMs)**: Ollama runs on your machine, so it does not go through the hosted proxy. Get a ready client with `createOllama()` and wrap each call with `observeOllama()` so the span is logged and tagged as Ollama.

```ts
import { SpanlensClient } from '@spanlens/sdk'
import { createOllama, observeOllama } from '@spanlens/sdk/ollama'

const spanlens = new SpanlensClient({ apiKey: process.env.SPANLENS_API_KEY! })
const ollama = createOllama() // points at http://localhost:11434/v1

const trace = spanlens.startTrace({ name: 'chat' })
const res = await observeOllama(trace, 'chat', (headers) =>
  ollama.chat.completions.create(
    { model: 'llama3.1', messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }] },
    { headers },
  ),
)
await trace.end({ status: 'completed' })
```

## What you see

![Spanlens request log showing every LLM call with latency, cost, tokens and status](.github/assets/dashboard-requests.png)

Every request logged with model, provider, latency, tokens, cost, and full prompt + response body. Filter, search, export. Streaming responses reconstructed automatically.

---

## What you get

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Request log** | Every LLM call logged with model, tokens, cost, latency, and full request/response body (streaming reconstructed too) |
| **Agent tracing** | Multi-step workflows as Gantt waterfall span trees with **Critical Path** highlighted (the longest dependency chain across a fan-out, not just the slowest single span), plus a node-and-edge **graph topology view** for LangChain / LangGraph callback traces |
| **Cost tracking** | Per-request cost breakdown with daily rollups and budget alerts. Prompt-cache tokens (`cache_read` / `cache_creation` on Anthropic, `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` on OpenAI) are parsed separately and billed at the discounted rate so you can see actual cache savings, not just sticker price |
| **Per-end-user analytics** | Tag calls with `x-spanlens-user` (SDK: `withUser()` / `with_user()`) and the /users page shows per-user cost, tokens, errors, models, last seen |
| **Anomaly detection** | 3σ deviations in latency, cost, or error rate vs. your 7-day baseline, with root-cause hints (token delta, HTTP status breakdown) |
| **Alerts** | Threshold rules on budget, error rate, and p95 latency. Delivered via Email (Resend), Slack, or Discord webhooks. Evaluated on a 15-minute cron with at-least-once delivery |
| **PII + prompt-injection scan** | Regex-based detection on request **and response** bodies; optional per-project blocking (422) for injections; instant alert emails to workspace owner |
| **Savings (model recommendations)** | The `/savings` dashboard surfaces calls that match a cheaper model's profile ("Your gpt-4o calls look like classification. Try gpt-4o-mini") with estimated monthly savings. A month-to-date **prompt-caching savings** card shows the USD you did not pay thanks to discounted cache-read tokens |
| **Response caching** | Opt in per request with `x-spanlens-cache: true` (or a TTL in seconds, capped at 24h; SDK: `withCache()`). An exact-match hit on the same request body returns the stored response without calling the provider, logs the row at zero cost, and is scoped per API key so nothing leaks across keys. Non-streaming, 200-only |
| **Email digests & health alerts** | A **weekly workspace digest** (requests, cost with week-over-week change, top models, anomalies) lands every Monday, and a **data-silence alert** emails admins when a workspace that was sending traffic suddenly goes quiet for 24 hours, so a broken key or dropped env var is caught before it becomes silent churn |
| **Prompt versioning + A/B** | Register prompt templates, run traffic-split experiments, compare versions side by side on latency / cost / error rate, reported with **Welch's t-test** on latency and cost plus a z-test on error rate, so you get statistical significance rather than just averages |
| **Prompts Playground** | Execute any prompt version with variable injection directly in the dashboard to see real cost and response before shipping |
| **Datasets** | Reusable (input, expected_output) test sets you can rerun against any prompt version or model. Upload CSV / JSONL files directly from the dashboard or POST programmatically. Powers offline evals and regression checks |
| **Evals & Experiments** | Build LLM-as-judge evaluators (judge with OpenAI, Anthropic, **or Gemini**, whichever is cheapest or best for the criterion) with rubric anchors and confidence intervals on pass rates. Supports pairwise A vs B mode for head-to-head prompt comparison, agent trajectory mode for scoring whole traces (not just final text), and judge-result caching keyed by `(evaluator, response)` to skip duplicate LLM calls on re-runs. Human annotation is queued for sampling, with **Pearson r** (numeric) or **Cohen's κ** (categorical) measuring judge-human agreement |
| **OpenAPI 3.0 spec + Swagger UI** | Machine-readable spec at `GET /api/v1/openapi.json` and interactive explorer at `GET /api/v1/docs`. A drift test enforces that every router stays documented |
| **Saved filters** | Pin frequently used request-log queries (model, status, cost range, tags) and share them across the workspace |
| **Outbound webhooks** | Subscribe to `request.created` / `trace.completed` / `alert.triggered` events. Payloads are HMAC-signed via `X-Spanlens-Signature: sha256=…` so receivers can verify origin |
| **OpenTelemetry / OTLP ingest** | `POST /v1/traces` accepts OTLP/HTTP JSON exports using the `gen_ai.*` semantic conventions, so you can drop in any OTel SDK without writing Spanlens-specific code |
| **Provider-key security** | Weekly digest emails for stale (unused 90d+) provider keys + daily GitGuardian leak scan against your active keys, with per-key scan history |
| **Privacy controls** | Per-request `x-spanlens-log-body: full \| meta \| none` header lets customers shrink what Spanlens stores (drop bodies, drop end-user IDs) without dropping the request itself |
| **Data export** | CSV or JSON download for requests, traces, anomalies, and flagged security events (`GET /api/v1/exports/{requests,traces,anomalies,security}?format=csv`). Streamed server-side for 100K+ row pulls so big exports don't OOM |

---

## Team & workspaces

Spanlens is multi-user out of the box. Invite teammates, hand out roles, and spin up a separate workspace per client.

- **Roles** are `admin` (members + billing), `editor` (data + settings), and `viewer` (read-only). The last admin is protected against demotion / removal.
- **Email invitations** have a 7-day expiry with sha256-hashed tokens. Sent via [Resend](https://resend.com) when `RESEND_API_KEY` is set; falls back to console-logging the accept URL for local dev.
- The **pending-invitation banner** surfaces unaccepted invites at the top of the dashboard, even if the recipient never opened the email. Accept joins and auto-switches the active workspace; Decline removes the row.
- **Multi-workspace** lets you switch between workspaces from the sidebar (`sb-ws` cookie + hard reload so middleware re-resolves scope). Useful for consultants juggling multiple clients or one team running prod / staging as separate workspaces.
- **Two-step onboarding** sends new signups to `/onboarding`: name your workspace, answer two optional survey questions, done. Invitees get a short-circuited variant where Accept skips workspace creation entirely.
- The **audit log** (Settings → Audit log) records every membership / role / invitation event with actor + timestamp.

```

### Where the data lives

Everything is in Supabase Postgres. Organizations, projects, members, API and provider keys, prompts, datasets, alerts, billing, and the audit log are ordinary RLS-gated tables.

The `requests` table (one row per LLM call) is partitioned by month on `created_at`, so expiring old logs drops a partition instead of running a bulk `DELETE`. Reads go through [`apps/server/src/lib/requests-query.ts`](./apps/server/src/lib/requests-query.ts), which injects the `organization_id` filter and the per-plan retention window (free=14d / pro=90d / team=365d). If a log write fails, the row is parked as JSON in a `requests_fallback` queue and a cron replays it every 5 minutes. Replay is idempotent (`ON CONFLICT (created_at, id) DO NOTHING`), so a retry cannot double-count a request against your quota.

### Projects, unified keys, and headers

- A workspace can hold **multiple projects** (e.g. `dev` / `staging` / `prod`, or one per app). Each project gets its own quota slice, provider keys, and prompt namespace.
- **Unified API keys** give you one `sl_live_*` key per project that is provider-agnostic. Spanlens infers the provider from the request path (`/proxy/openai/*`, `/proxy/anthropic/*`, `/proxy/gemini/*`, `/proxy/mistral/*`, `/proxy/openrouter/*`, `/proxy/groq/*`, `/proxy/deepseek/*`, `/proxy/xai/*`, `/proxy/cohere/*`, `/proxy/azure/*`), so you only need one Spanlens key even if you call multiple model vendors.
- **`X-Spanlens-*` headers** (set automatically by the SDK helpers `withUser()`, `withSession()`, `withPromptVersion()`, `withLogBody()`): tag a request with end-user / session IDs, link it to a prompt-version experiment, or limit how much body Spanlens stores. Full list in [`/docs/proxy`](https://www.spanlens.io/docs/proxy).
- **Streaming safety** ensures proxy responses are gracefully closed at 290s with a `truncated=true` flag in the log, so long streams never silently disappear.

## Local development

Prerequisites: Node 20+, pnpm 10.33.0+, Docker (for local Supabase), [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) optional.

```bash
# 1. Clone + install
git clone https://github.com/spanlens/Spanlens.git
cd Spanlens
pnpm install

# 2. Start local Supabase (requires Docker)
supabase start
supabase db push        # apply Postgres migrations
supabase gen types --lang typescript --local > supabase/types.ts

# 3. Env vars (see apps/server/.env.example)
cp apps/server/.env.example apps/server/.env

# 4. Run everything (web on :3000, server on :3001)
pnpm dev
```

### Running tests + lint

```bash
pnpm typecheck          # TS across all packages
pnpm lint               # ESLint
pnpm test               # Vitest: server + sdk + cli suites
pnpm build              # production build smoke test
```

See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for architecture rules and Known Gotchas (streaming, RLS, Paddle billing, Vercel Edge runtime, npm publish).

## Self-hosting

The easiest way to self-host is with the included `docker-compose.yml`. Two containers, the **dashboard (web)** and the **proxy/API server**, both pulled pre-built from GHCR. Your Supabase project is the only other piece, and it can be Supabase Cloud or your own self-hosted Supabase.

![Run Spanlens in your own VPC with one Docker command](.github/assets/self-host.png)

### 1. Apply the Supabase schema (one-time)

Open your Supabase project → **SQL Editor → New query**, paste the contents of [`supabase/init.sql`](./supabase/init.sql), and click **Run**. That's it. No CLI needed.

> **Alternative (psql):**
> ```bash
> psql "postgresql://postgres:<password>@db.<ref>.supabase.co:5432/postgres" \
>   -f supabase/init.sql
> ```

### 2. Create a `.env` file

```bash
# Supabase (cloud or self-hosted)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxx.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...

# Encryption key (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32-byte base64>

# Random secret for cron endpoint
CRON_SECRET=<random string>

# Pooled Postgres connection for the `requests` table (required).
# Supabase Dashboard: Connect > Direct > Transaction pooler, with
# "Use IPv4 connection" switched on. Port 6543, not 5432.
# The dedicated pooler shown by default is IPv6-only, so anything without
# outbound IPv6 (Vercel functions included) fails at DNS. Copy the host from
# that dialog rather than assembling it: the shared pooler hostname carries a
# numbered prefix that the region does not tell you.
# This is a full database credential, so keep it out of logs.
SUPABASE_DB_POOLER_URL=postgresql://postgres.<ref>:<password>@<pooler-host>:6543/postgres

# Optional (for invite emails)
# WEB_URL=https://your-domain.com
# RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
# RESEND_FROM=Spanlens <no-reply@your-domain.com>

# Optional (Paddle billing, only if you sell paid plans on your instance)
# PADDLE_API_KEY=...
# PADDLE_NOTIFICATION_SECRET=...
# PADDLE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox  # or production
```

### 3. Start

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- Dashboard: `http://localhost:3000`
- API / proxy: `http://localhost:3001`
- Health: `GET /health` (liveness) and `GET /health/deep` (database pool, fallback queue depth, cron freshness)

> **Upgrading from an older release?** Request logs live in Postgres now. Re-apply [`supabase/init.sql`](./supabase/init.sql) so the `requests` table exists, add `SUPABASE_DB_POOLER_URL` to your `.env`, then drop the ClickHouse container and its four `CLICKHOUSE_*` variables. Rows already in ClickHouse are not copied across, so export anything you still need before tearing it down.

The web container passes `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars as **build arguments** (Next.js bakes them into the client bundle), so they must be present before `docker compose build`.

### Server-only (no dashboard)

If you only need the proxy/API and run the dashboard separately:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/spanlens/spanlens-server:latest
docker run -p 3001:3001 \
  -e SUPABASE_URL=... \
  -e SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=... \
  -e SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... \
  -e SUPABASE_DB_POOLER_URL=... \
  -e ENCRYPTION_KEY=... \
  ghcr.io/spanlens/spanlens-server:latest
```

### Point your SDK at your self-hosted URL

```ts
const openai = createOpenAI({
  baseURL: 'https://your-spanlens.example.com/proxy/openai/v1',
})
```

Your Spanlens instance talks to your Supabase. We never see your data.

### Background jobs (Vercel Cron / your scheduler)

The hosted instance ships with the following cron tasks (see [`apps/server/vercel.json`](./apps/server/vercel.json)). On self-host, point any scheduler at the same paths with the `CRON_SECRET` bearer:

| Path | Schedule | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/cron/evaluate-alerts` | every 15m | Evaluate threshold + anomaly alerts, fire notifications |
| `/cron/snapshot-anomalies` | daily 01:00 | Materialize daily anomaly baselines |
| `/cron/replay-fallback` | every 5m | Replay the `requests_fallback` queue into the `requests` table |
| `/cron/stale-key-reminders` | weekly Mon 09:00 | Email digest of idle provider keys |
| `/cron/leak-detect-keys` | daily 04:00 | GitGuardian scan of active provider keys |
| `/cron/recommend-savings-alerts` | daily 09:00 | Email model-swap savings opportunities |
| `/cron/check-past-due-downgrades` | daily 10:00 | D-3 / D-1 warnings + auto-downgrade past-due subs |
| `/cron/execute-pending-deletions` | every 6h | Hard-delete accounts past their 30-day soft-delete grace |
| `/cron/run-background-migrations` | every 5m | Drain background-migration queue (data backfills) |
| `/cron/detect-missing-model-prices` | hourly | Catch new model IDs in the request log that have no row in `model_prices` |
| `/cron/self-monitor` | hourly :31 | Spanlens dogfoods itself: heartbeat eval into the internal workspace |
| `/cron/detect-orphan-spans` | hourly :17 | Flag spans whose parent trace never arrived |
| `/cron/prune-judge-cache` | daily 03:00 | TTL-evict stale `(evaluator, response)` judge cache entries |
| `/cron/purge-proxy-cache` | daily 03:15 | Reclaim expired `proxy_response_cache` rows for keys that went quiet |
| `/cron/weekly-digest` | weekly Mon 09:00 | Email each workspace a weekly summary (requests, cost trend, top models, anomalies) |
| `/cron/detect-data-silence` | every 6h | Alert admins when a previously-active workspace stops sending data for 24h |
| `/cron/keep-warm` | every 5m | Lightweight ping that keeps the Vercel function warm (skip on always-on platforms like Fly.io / Railway) |
