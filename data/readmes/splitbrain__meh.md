## Overview

Meh is a commenting system with a client-server architecture:

- **Server Component**: A PHP backend that handles comment storage (in SQLite), moderation, and API endpoints. It can be
  installed on your own server and supports multiple sites from a single installation.

- **Client Components**: A set of web components (custom HTML elements) that can be embedded in any website to display
  and submit comments. These components communicate with the server via a REST API.

## Quick Start

A quick and dirty way to get started is to use the built-in PHP server on your local machine.

```bash
cd backend
composer install
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env
./meh migrate
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

You can now browse this documentation at `http://localhost:8000`. It will also serve the Meh components and the API.

In your blog, add the following to your HTML:

```html
<!-- Add a comment form -->
<script type="module" src="http://localhost:8000/meh/meh.esm.js"></script>

<meh-form>
    <meh-mastodon></meh-mastodon>
    <meh-login></meh-login>
</meh-form>
<meh-comments></meh-comments>
```

This should give you a rough idea how Meh works. For a production setup, you should point your web server at the `public` directory.

More details on how to set up the server can be found in the [Server Setup](doc/server.md) section.
