Your coding agent loses the plan between sessions. You come back tomorrow and it has no idea which
of the five things you agreed on are done, which one is blocked on which, or why you rejected the
second approach — because the plan lived in the context window, or in a `TODO.md` nobody updates.

saga-mcp gives the agent a real tracker instead: a SQLite file in your project holding projects,
epics, tasks, subtasks, dependencies, comments, notes and decisions, exposed as 41 MCP tools. The
agent writes to it as it works and reads it back when it returns. No accounts, no external service,
no network calls — the database is a file you own.

---

## Install

Add saga-mcp to your MCP client. The same block works for Claude Code (`.mcp.json` in your
project), Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`), and any other MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "saga": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "saga-mcp"],
      "env": { "DB_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/your/project/.tracker.db" }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart the client. `DB_PATH` is the only required setting; the file and its schema are created on
first use. Prefer a global install? `npm install -g saga-mcp`, then use `saga-mcp` as the command
instead of `npx`.

Tested on Node 20, 22 and 24, on Linux, macOS and Windows.

### Settings

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `DB_PATH` | Yes | Path to the `.tracker.db` SQLite file. Created on first use. |
| `SAGA_PROJECT` | No | Scope every tool to one project, by id or name. Set this per repo when several repos [share one database](#one-database-many-projects). |
| `SAGA_DESCRIPTION_LOCK` | No | `on_progress` locks a task's description the moment work starts on it. Off by default. See [keeping agents on the rails](#keeping-agents-on-the-rails). |
| `SAGA_TOOLS` | No | `full` (default) lists all 41 tools. `core` lists only the 13 an ordinary tracking session needs, saving ~4,300 tokens per session. See [token cost](#token-cost). |

No API keys, no accounts, no external services.

---

## Your first session

**You:** "Set up tracking for the e-commerce API and plan out auth."

```js
tracker_init({ project_name: "E-Commerce API" })
epic_create({ project_id: 1, name: "Authentication", priority: "high" })
task_create({ epic_id: 1, title: "Design auth schema", priority: "critical" })
task_create({ epic_id: 1, title: "Implement JWT auth", depends_on: [1] })
task_create({ epic_id: 1, title: "Add OAuth2 Google login", depends_on: [2] })
```

Tasks 2 and 3 come back **blocked** — their dependencies aren't done. Finish task 1 and task 2
unblocks itself.

**Next session, you:** "Where were we?"

```js
tracker_next({})
  -> Work on #1 'Design auth schema' — critical priority, in the active epic
     'Authentication'. 2 other task(s) are blocked.
```

One recommendation with the reason. For the whole picture instead, `tracker_dashboard({})` returns
stats, epics, blocked and overdue tasks, recent activity and notes, with a summary on top.

And when you would rather look than ask, `saga-web` puts the same database in a browser:

## What you get

- **[The next thing to do](#asking-what-to-do-next)** — one recommendation with its reason, at a
  third the cost of the dashboard
- **[Real sequencing](#ordering-and-dependencies)** — dependencies that auto-block and auto-unblock,
  a manual order the tools respect, and cycles refused rather than deadlocked
- **[Guards against agent drift](#keeping-agents-on-the-rails)** — a lockable description, and
  prerequisites enforced on write rather than merely reported
- **[A web UI](#web-ui)** — `saga-web` serves the same database in a browser, read *and* write
- **[Templates](#templates)** — reusable task sets with `{variable}` substitution, editable in place
- **[Archiving and soft delete](#getting-old-work-out-of-the-way)** — get finished work out of the
  context you pay for, reversibly
- **[Forgiving input](#forgiving-input)** — a smaller model sending an array as a JSON string
  doesn't silently collapse your batch into one record
- **[One file, many projects](#one-database-many-projects)** — per-repo databases or one shared file
- **A full audit trail** — every mutation logged with old and new values, and nothing an agent
  removes is unrecoverable
- **41 tools** with MCP safety annotations on every one, and a [tiered surface](#token-cost) when
  you want a smaller context bill

---

## Asking what to do next

`tracker_dashboard` hands an agent everything and leaves it to reason. `tracker_next` answers the
question:

```
tracker_next()
  -> Work on #12 'Write the adapter' — already in progress, high priority, in the
     active epic 'Provider swap'. Next step: implement. Also overdue: #18 'Renew cert'.
     3 other task(s) are blocked.
```

One recommendation with the reason, the next unfinished subtask inside it, a couple of
alternatives, and anything overdue or blocked. About a third the size of the dashboard.

The ordering rule worth knowing: **continuing beats starting.** A task already in progress outranks
an untouched one that is overdue or higher priority, because abandoning work in flight just leaves
two things unfinished — the overdue work is named in the summary instead. Blocked tasks are never
recommended, archived epics and removed tasks are skipped, and subtask dependencies decide which
step comes next inside the chosen task.

When nothing is actionable it says what to unblock rather than returning an empty answer:

```
Nothing is actionable: all 4 remaining task(s) are blocked.
Unblocking #7 'the keystone' would release 3 of them.
```

---

## Ordering and dependencies

**A deliberate order wins over a guess.** `task_list` sorts by priority until someone arranges an
epic, and from then on it follows the arrangement:

```js
task_reorder({ epic_id: 2, ordered_ids: [8, 5, 6] })
task_list({ epic_id: 2 })                        // 8, 5, 6 — the plan, in order
task_list({ epic_id: 2, sort_by: "priority" })   // priority, if that is what you want
```

Priority is a reasonable guess about what matters; a sequence someone wrote down is not a guess.
An agent handed a plan should start at the beginning of it, not at whichever step happens to be
marked critical.

Nothing changes for epics nobody has arranged — those sort by priority exactly as before, and an
explicit `sort_by` is always obeyed literally.

Anything omitted from `ordered_ids` keeps its relative position at the end. `sort_order` runs
ascending — lower sorts first — and a task created *after* an arrangement has no place in it, so it
lands at the end rather than the front. In the web UI you can drag tasks into place inside an epic.

Task dependencies auto-block and auto-unblock:

```js
task_update({ id: 9, depends_on: [8] })   // 9 becomes blocked while 8 is open
```

Re-evaluation runs whenever a blocker's *doneness* changes in either direction, so reopening a
finished blocker blocks its dependents again, and clearing the last dependency releases them.
Circular dependencies are refused with the loop named, for tasks and subtasks alike — anything
in a cycle would be blocked forever. The web UI shows a banner at the top of a blocked task naming
what it waits on, with a picker to add or remove dependencies.

---

## Keeping agents on the rails

Two guards for the ways an agent goes wrong on a long task.

**A locked description.** Agents sometimes rewrite a task's description to record progress, when
they meant to add a comment — and the spec you agreed on is gone. Lock it and `task_update` refuses:

```js
task_lock_description({ id: 12 })
task_update({ id: 12, description: "..." })
  -> Task 12's description is locked and was not changed. Record progress with
     comment_add instead, or unlock it in the web UI if the description is genuinely wrong.
```

Everything else about the task stays editable — the point is to protect the spec, not freeze the
task. The lock cannot be cleared as a side effect of an ordinary `task_update`; it takes a
deliberate `task_lock_description` call or the lock toggle in the web UI, and both are logged.

This is a guard against confusion, not an adversarial control: an agent that is told to unlock
still can. It turns a silent overwrite into a visible, reversible decision.

Locking each task by hand does not scale across a plan, so `SAGA_DESCRIPTION_LOCK=on_progress`
does it for you: a task locks as work starts on it — when it moves to `in_progress`, `review` or
`done`, or is created there. It is off unless you set it, since it changes what an agent is
allowed to do.

```json
"env": { "DB_PATH": "…", "SAGA_DESCRIPTION_LOCK": "on_progress" }
```

It sets the same flag `task_lock_description` sets, rather than second-guessing every write. So
one mechanism governs the field: unlock a task and it stays unlocked, whatever its status does
next. `blocked` is not "started" — a task waiting on a dependency has not been worked on, and
dependencies move tasks in and out of that status on their own.

**Subtask order and dependencies.** New subtasks are appended in order rather than all landing at
position 0, `subtask_reorder` sets the order in one call (or drag them in the UI), and a subtask
can wait on its siblings:

```js
subtask_update({ id: 8, depends_on: [5, 6] })    // 8 waits for 5 and 6
subtask_update({ id: 4, blocks: [5, 6, 7, 8] })  // a bug that holds up the rest
```

Reads carry `depends_on` and `blocked`, and the block is **enforced on write**: starting or
finishing a subtask whose prerequisites are unmet is refused, and so is completing a task whose
checklist is still open.

```js
subtask_update({ id: 8, status: "in_progress" })
  -> Subtask 8 cannot be started — it waits on #5 'write the parser' (todo).
     Finish those first, or pass force: true to override deliberately (the override is logged).
```

`force: true` is the way past, for when a person has decided the blocker no longer applies. It
works on `subtask_update`, `task_update` and `task_batch_update`, and every override is written to
the activity log naming what was skipped. The web UI asks for confirmation and then sends it.

The distinction that matters is between an agent quietly ignoring a blocker and someone choosing to
override one. Dependencies stay within one task — a checklist item waiting on something under a
*different* task is a task-level dependency, and `task_update depends_on` already models that.

---

## Comments as a decision trail

```js
comment_add({ task_id: 5, content: "Investigated root cause: CORS headers missing on preflight" })
comment_add({ task_id: 5, content: "Fixed by adding OPTIONS handler. Tested with curl." })
task_update({ id: 5, status: "done" })
```

Comments persist across sessions — next time an agent calls `task_get(5)`, it sees the full thread.

If a comment turns out to be wrong, retract it without losing the trail:

```js
comment_delete({ id: 12, reason: "Root cause was wrong — it was a proxy timeout", deleted_by: "pranab" })
```

The row stays in the database and in the activity log. `comment_list` and `task_get` skip it,
`comment_list({ task_id: 5, include_deleted: true })` shows it with its reason, and
`comment_restore({ id: 12 })` brings it back. Nothing an agent removes is unrecoverable.

---

## Templates

A reusable set of tasks with `{variable}` placeholders, filled in when applied:

```js
template_create({
  name: "feature_workflow",
  tasks: [
    { title: "Design {feature} API",       priority: "critical", estimated_hours: 2 },
    { title: "Implement {feature}",        priority: "high",     estimated_hours: 8 },
    { title: "Write tests for {feature}",  priority: "high",     estimated_hours: 4 }
  ]
})

template_apply({ template_id: 1, epic_id: 2, variables: { feature: "user auth" } })
// -> "Design user auth API", "Implement user auth", "Write tests for user auth"
```

Templates are **editable in place**, which matters because the id is what `template_apply` refers
to — recreating one breaks anything holding it:

```js
template_update({ id: 1, name: "Feature rollout" })                  // tasks untouched
template_update({ id: 1, tasks: [{ title: "Design {feature}" }] })   // name untouched
template_list({ include_tasks: true })                               // see what one creates
```

Task definitions are checked when written rather than when applied, so a bad priority or a missing
title is refused up front instead of failing later against an epic you have already chosen.
Templates live in the database as a whole, not inside one project.

The Templates tab shows what each one creates, and the `{placeholders}` it will ask for:

</picture>


---

## Getting old work out of the way

An epic list that is mostly finished work, and tasks an agent created that should have been
subtasks, are context you pay for on every call.

```js
epic_archive({ id: 4 })            // the epic and its tasks drop out of listings
task_delete({ id: 12, reason: "should have been a subtask" })
```

Archiving is deliberately **not** the `cancelled` status: `cancelled` means "we decided not to do
this", while most of what you want to archive is *completed*. Archived epics and their tasks
disappear from `epic_list`, `tracker_dashboard`, `task_list` and `tracker_search` — including the
statistics, not just the lists — and come back with `include_archived`. In the web UI both the
Overview and the Epics tab archive an epic, hide archived ones by default, and share one
show-archived switch.

Nothing vanishes silently. The dashboard says what it left out:

```
Hidden: 2 archived epic(s) and 1 removed task(s) — pass include_archived to include them.
```

`task_delete` is the same soft delete comments have, restricted to tasks still in `todo`: anything
further along has comments, time tracking and an activity log that removing it would strand, and a
task other tasks depend on is refused outright so nothing is left blocked forever. The row is kept,
`task_restore` brings it back, and `tracker_export` includes archived and removed rows because a
backup that omits things is not a backup.

---

## Forgiving input

Smaller models routinely send an array parameter as a *string* containing JSON. Every array-taking
tool accepts that, so a batch does not silently collapse into one record:

```js
subtask_create({ task_id: 3, titles: '["Write it","Test it"]' })   // 2 subtasks
subtask_create({ task_id: 3, titles: "- Write it\n- Test it" })    // 2 subtasks
task_batch_update({ ids: "[4,5]", status: "done" })                // both tasks
task_create({ epic_id: 1, title: "x", tags: "billing, urgent" })   // 2 tags
```

Coercion stops where intent becomes ambiguous. A comma inside a *title* is left alone —
`"Design the API, then implement it"` is one subtask, not two — while a comma in a tag or an id
list is a separator, because neither can contain one. Anything genuinely unusable is refused with a
message naming what arrived and what was wanted, rather than a leaked `ids.map is not a function`.

What comes back matches what went in. `tags`, `metadata` and `source_ref` live in JSON text
columns, and every response decodes them at the boundary, so a tag list reads as `["billing",
"urgent"]` rather than the escaped string `"[\"billing\",\"urgent\"]"` an agent cannot use.

---

## One database, many projects

saga-mcp works either way: a `.tracker.db` per repo (portable, keeps unrelated work apart), or one
shared database that every repo points at.

The shared setup needs one extra thing. `projects` is the top-level table, so a shared file holds
several projects — but `task_list`, `note_list`, `activity_log` and `tracker_search` read across the
whole file unless told otherwise. An agent in repo B would see repo A's tasks. Set `SAGA_PROJECT`
per repo and each agent sees only its own:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "saga": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "saga-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DB_PATH": "/Users/you/saga/central.tracker.db",
        "SAGA_PROJECT": "Payments platform"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`SAGA_PROJECT` takes a project id or a project name (case-insensitive), and fails on startup with
the list of real projects if it matches neither. Every scoped tool also accepts an explicit
`project_id` argument, which wins over the environment variable.

| Setup | What to set | Result |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| One database per repo | `DB_PATH` | Nothing to scope — one project per file |
| Shared database, per-repo agents | `DB_PATH` + `SAGA_PROJECT` | Each agent sees only its project |
| Shared database, one agent over everything | `DB_PATH` | Tools read across all projects |

With neither `SAGA_PROJECT` nor a `project_id`, `tracker_dashboard` falls back to the first project
in the file and says so — the response carries `other_projects` and the summary explains that the
project was a guess, rather than silently reporting on the wrong repo.

The web UI is unaffected either way: its project switcher lists every project in the database, and
each tab is scoped to the selected one.

---

## Web UI

Everything above is agent-facing. `saga-web` puts the same database in a browser — for the times
when reviewing a spec an agent just wrote, or fixing one field by hand, is faster than another
prompt.

```bash
npx -p saga-mcp saga-web ./.tracker.db --open
```

Or against a database you already point your MCP server at:

```bash
saga-web --db ~/saga/central.tracker.db --port 8080
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--db <path>` | `$DB_PATH` | Database to open. A positional path works too. |
| `--port <n>` | first free from `4319` | Omit it and saga-web takes the first free port, so one instance per project just works. `--port N` binds exactly N and fails if taken; `--port 0` lets the OS choose. Also `SAGA_WEB_PORT`. |
| `--host <addr>` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address. Local-only by default. |
| `--read-only` | off | Serve the UI with every editing control removed. |
| `--open` | off | Open the UI in your default browser. |

Six tabs:

- **Overview** — stats, per-epic progress, blocked and overdue tasks
- **Board** — kanban across the five task statuses; drag a card to change its status

  <img alt="The board: five columns, one per task status" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spranab/saga-mcp/master/docs/screenshots/board-light.png">
</picture>

- **Epics** — the full Epic → Task → Subtask tree, which is the fastest way to review a spec an
  agent just wrote. Blocked tasks carry a ⛔ naming what they wait on, finished ones are struck
  through, and tasks drag into order. Epics read the same way — bold while in progress, struck
  through once completed or cancelled — and each one archives from here as well as the Overview

  <img alt="The epic tree, with epics and tasks struck through once finished and blocked tasks marked" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spranab/saga-mcp/master/docs/screenshots/epics-light.png">
</picture>

- **Notes** — decisions, context and blockers
- **Templates** — every template with the tasks it creates and the `{placeholders}` it uses; edit
  the details, edit the task list, apply it to an epic, or delete it
- **Activity** — the complete change history

And throughout:

- **Task drawer** — edit any field, comment, remove or restore a comment, lock the description,
  drag subtasks into order, and set which subtasks wait on which. Each subtask has one control
  carrying its whole state (todo / in progress / done, or blocked), and the drawer resizes by
  dragging its edge. Its Refresh/Edit/Close row stays pinned to the top however far you scroll,
  as a long form keeps its Save button in view

  <img alt="The task drawer: subtasks with their state, dependencies both ways, and the comment thread" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spranab/saga-mcp/master/docs/screenshots/task-light.png">
</picture>

- **Markdown** — descriptions, comments and notes render headings, tables, lists, code and links.
  Agent-written content is escaped before any markdown rule runs, so raw HTML can never reach the
  page, and only http/https/mailto links are followed
- **Project switcher** — every project in the database, so one central `.tracker.db` covers all
  your repos; every tab, including Activity, is scoped to the selected project
- **Shareable, refreshable URLs** — the open project, tab and task live in the address bar, so a
  browser refresh puts you back where you were and back/forward move between tasks. A ⟳ button in
  the task drawer re-reads that task without a page reload, for picking up what an agent just wrote

Writes from the UI call the *same handlers* the MCP tools do, so edits you make by hand are
validated identically and land in the same activity log as the agent's — an agent calling
`tracker_dashboard` after you fix something sees the fix and how it happened.

A few deliberate limits: it binds to `127.0.0.1` unless you ask otherwise, it has no authentication
(don't put it on a shared network), and it will not create a database — point it at one your MCP
server already uses. Separate `.tracker.db` files are not yet aggregated into one view; a single
database with multiple projects is.

---

## Token cost

The tool list is context every session pays before any work happens, and list responses are context
it pays again on every call. Both are kept deliberately small:

- Responses are compact JSON — no pretty-print indentation, which measured 20-27% of every response
- `task_list` rows omit nulls and `metadata`, and truncate descriptions to 120 characters
  (call `task_get` for a task's full text) — 19-39% smaller depending on how long your descriptions run
- `activity_log` omits null columns and the row id (no tool takes one) — about 27% smaller
- `tracker_search` returns previews rather than whole records — about 47% smaller; follow up with
  `task_get` or `note_list` for the full text
- `SAGA_TOOLS=core` drops the listed surface from ~7,200 tokens to ~2,900

`note_list` deliberately keeps full note content — it is the retrieval tool, not a preview.

Set `SAGA_TOOLS=core` when an agent only tracks work; leave it unset when you want templates,
import/export, session diffs and the rest discoverable. **Tools left off the list still work when
called by name** — `core` shrinks what is advertised, not what exists.

The core thirteen: `tracker_init`, `tracker_next`, `tracker_dashboard`, `project_list`,
`epic_create`, `epic_list`, `task_create`, `task_list`, `task_get`, `task_update`, `subtask_create`,
`note_save`, `comment_add`.

Every tool description is held to a byte budget in the test suite, so the surface cannot grow by
accretion: adding a tool means trimming prose elsewhere or justifying the increase.

## How it works

Everything lives in a single SQLite file. The schema is created on first use, and existing
databases are migrated in place when you upgrade — there is no migration step to run.

```
Project
  └── Epic (feature/workstream)
        └── Task (unit of work)
              ├── Subtask (checklist item)
              ├── Comment (discussion thread)
              └── Dependencies (blocked by other tasks)
```

### Note types

Notes replace scattered markdown files. Each note has a type:

| Type | Use case |
|------|----------|
| `general` | Free-form notes |
| `decision` | Architecture/design decisions |
| `context` | Conversation context for future sessions |
| `meeting` | Meeting notes |
| `technical` | Technical details, specs |
| `blocker` | Blockers and issues |
| `progress` | Progress updates |
| `release` | Release notes |

### Activity log

Every create, update and delete is recorded, with the old and new value:

```json
{
  "summary": "Task 'Fix CORS issue' status: blocked -> done",
  "action": "status_changed",
  "entity_type": "task",
  "entity_id": 15,
  "field_name": "status",
  "old_value": "blocked",
  "new_value": "done",
  "created_at": "2026-02-21T18:30:00"
}
```

That log is what makes the soft deletes safe and the time tracking automatic — hours are computed
from it rather than entered by hand.

## Privacy

saga-mcp is a fully local, offline tool. It does **not** collect user data, send anything to
external servers, require internet access after installation, or use analytics or telemetry of any
kind.

All data is stored exclusively in the local SQLite file specified by `DB_PATH`. Uninstalling
saga-mcp and deleting the `.tracker.db` file removes all traces.

---

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spranab/saga-mcp.git
cd saga-mcp
npm install
npm run build
DB_PATH=./test.db npm start

# the web UI against the same database
node dist/web/index.js ./test.db --open

npm test     # 359 unit and integration tests, no network
npm run e2e  # release gate: packs a tarball, installs it, drives the real binaries
```

`npm test` runs against the built output. `npm run e2e` is the gate that matters before a release:
it packs the tarball that would actually be published, installs it somewhere else, and drives both
binaries over real stdio — 106 checks, including an upgrade from an older database.

### Releasing

Publishing to npm is irreversible — a version number can never be reused — so it is the *last*
step, and it is triggered by publishing a GitHub release, not by pushing a tag.

```bash
# 1. bump the version in package.json, manifest.json and server.json, then merge
# 2. tag it. Nothing is published yet.
git tag -a v1.17.1 -m "v1.17.1 — ..." && git push origin v1.17.1

# 3. verify the tagged build: this packs the tarball that would be published
#    and drives it end to end, including an upgrade from an older database.
npm run e2e

# 4. publish the release. This fires the publish workflow.
gh release create v1.17.1 --notes-file notes.md
```

The workflow re-runs the suite against the tagged commit, refuses a tag that does not match
`package.json`, refuses a version already on npm, and sends a GitHub *pre-release* to the `next`
dist-tag so it never becomes what `npm install saga-mcp` gives people. A failed publish can be
retried against the same tag with `gh workflow run "Publish to npm" -f tag=v1.17.1`.
