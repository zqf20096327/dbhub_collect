# pg-licht

A read-only PostgreSQL MCP (Model Context Protocol) server: it lets an AI assistant read a
database's schema, statistics, plans, locks, replication and PgBouncer pools from the
catalog. It never writes, and never returns rows from your tables.

Why another PostgreSQL MCP:

- It reads the catalog and the statistics views, not your data, so there is far less to
  leak: the model sees structure, sizes, plans and counters.
- Read-only is enforced, not promised: every call runs in its own `READ ONLY` transaction
  with a statement timeout, and no SQL is built from arguments.
- One process serves the whole fleet. Any number of connections live in one file, and a
  question can be put to every database of an instance, a replication group or a label at
  once.
- It answers what an operator asks — why is this slow, what is blocked, is the replica
  keeping up, does the pool keep up — and returns the evidence as PostgreSQL reports it.

## Safety

Every catalog query is parameterized — no schema, table, or search-term argument is ever
concatenated into SQL text. Every call to a database runs inside its own `READ ONLY`
transaction, so even a bug that let a query attempt a write would fail rather than succeed
silently. The pooler tools send a PgBouncer console only fixed `SHOW` commands, as the user
you configure — one from its `stats_users`, which PgBouncer allows to run `SHOW` and nothing
else.
That guard is transaction-scoped rather than session-scoped, which is what makes it hold
behind a connection pooler in transaction mode.

The same transaction sets `statement_timeout`, so no call can occupy a backend
indefinitely. It defaults to two minutes and is per connection:

```ini
[billing_prod]
service              = billing-prod
statement_timeout_ms = 600000      ; 0 removes the ceiling
```

Most operations are catalog reads that never approach it. The ones that can are
those whose cost scales with the server rather than with the query —
`tableBloat` with `exact: true`, `indexBloat` on a btree or hash index,
`bufferCacheContents`, and `listTableSizes` on a wide schema — so raise it for a
connection where such a scan is the point of the call. Reaching it is reported as the ceiling being reached, naming
the value and the key to change, rather than as an error.

pg_licht never writes and never returns rows from your tables. Values from your data can
still reach the caller in a few named places: live and recorded statement text
(`currentActivity`, `currentLocks`, `statementStats`), column statistics (`tableStats`,
`columnHistogram`), plans that repeat a statement's literals, definitions as written, and
settings such as a standby's `primary_conninfo`. No password pg_licht itself holds is ever
returned. Connect as the narrowest role that answers the question; `checkPrivileges`
reports what it can reach.

Full rationale, including the guarded exception for `explainQuery` and the complete list of
what reaches the caller, is in the SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS section of `man pg_licht_mcp`;
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) summarises it and says how to report a vulnerability.

## Quick start

```bash
brew tap sqlambda/pg-licht && brew install pg-licht

claude mcp add --transport stdio pg-licht \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host/dbname" \
  -- /usr/local/bin/pg_licht_mcp

man pg_licht_mcp
```

Other install channels — deb, rpm, tarball, source — are in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Remote databases

A tool call opens no connection of its own beyond the first: connections are
held between calls and closed after 60 seconds idle, one per configured
connection and at most 32 at a time. Startup opens none at all — the registry is
validated without touching the network, so one unreachable database no longer
prevents the server from starting.

The ceiling matters only above 32 configured databases, where the least recently
used connection is dropped to make room and the next call to that database
reconnects. It exists so a single wide sweep cannot hold one socket per member
for a minute and exhaust a file-descriptor limit — macOS defaults to 256.

Fan-out sweeps visit up to 16 members concurrently, one connection per server.
A thirteen-member replication group that took 449 ms sequentially takes 91 ms.
The payload stays in configuration order regardless of which member answers
first.

For databases across a WAN, a connection pooler in front of pg_licht is still
worth running — it amortises the TLS handshake across restarts, and
`server_idle_timeout` gives you the same idle policy at the pooler. Point every
`connections.ini` entry at the local pooler and let its `[databases]` section
carry the real hosts. Note that PgBouncer reads neither `.pgpass` nor
`service=`, so that section has to be generated rather than shared, and in
transaction mode it does not run `server_reset_query` at all by default.

## Output format

A client that negotiates MCP revision `2025-06-18` or later receives
`structuredContent`; every client receives the text block as well.

Both are sent by default, because a client can advertise a revision it does not
fully implement and this server cannot tell. Set `PG_LICHT_STRUCTURED_ONLY=1`
to send only the structured payload once you have confirmed your client reads
it, or `PG_LICHT_MAX_PROTOCOL=2025-03-26` to refuse to negotiate anything
newer.

Every tool declares an `outputSchema` to clients that can use it. The schemas
describe but never reject: payloads here are version-conditional, and any tool
may answer `{error, hint}` when an extension is absent.

Results that the protocol marks cacheable carry `ttlMs` and `cacheScope`.
`tools/list` is about 93 kB and entirely static, so it is hinted at one hour
and scoped `private` — it varies by negotiated revision and names the
configured default connection, so it must not be served to another caller from
a shared cache. Catalog-derived results are hinted at one minute.

List operations accept an opaque `cursor` and return `nextCursor`. The page
size is larger than anything this server lists today, so a client that ignores
cursors still sees every tool; `resources/list` is the one that grows, being
connections × schemas.

## Resources and prompts

Structure is also served as **resources** — documents a client can browse and
pin into context without a tool call:

```
pglicht://{conn}/schemas
pglicht://{conn}/schema/{schema}
pglicht://{conn}/schema/{schema}/table/{table}
pglicht://{conn}/schema/{schema}/{functions,enums,types}
pglicht://{conn}/server/{roles,extensions,settings}
```

Readings stay tools, because the model has to decide *when* to take them.
`resources/list` enumerates connections and schemas and reaches tables through
a template, so a 10 000-table database does not produce a 10 000-entry
response.

Twelve **prompts** encode an order of investigation that is easy to get wrong:
`diagnose-slow-query`, `triage-lock-contention`, `diagnose-deadlock`,
`triage-active-sessions`, `triage-disk-space`, `bloat-and-vacuum-review`,
`buffer-cache-review`, `capacity-check`, `replication-slot-review`,
`plan-schema-change`, `check-role-access` and `explain-and-fix`. The `triage-`
ones are written for a page rather than an investigation: they establish how
long there is before they propose anything. They are static text and touch no
database until the model acts on them, and each one whose tools are
privilege-gated opens by calling `checkPrivileges`.

`triage-disk-space` is the one that arrives at night, and `diskUsage` is what
makes it answerable without a shell on the server: WAL size, the archive
backlog, temp files on disk now, the log directory, and sizes per tablespace and
per database. Only the headroom is unreachable — PostgreSQL exposes no function
for free space. The prompt leads with what makes the obvious response wrong:
`VACUUM FULL` needs free space equal to the table and its indexes *before* it
releases any, so it is not a disk-full action.

Counts: 59 of 72 database operations for a bare login role, 67 with `pg_monitor` — the
`pg_ls_*` directory reads `diskUsage` uses are part of what that role grants.

`triage-active-sessions` is for a server running more sessions at once than it
has cores. Its first move is to stop trusting the word *active*: a backend
waiting on a lock or a disk read is executing a statement, so only the ones with
no wait event are competing for CPU, and parallel workers collapse into their
leaders before anything is counted. Its second is that concurrency is arrival
rate times duration — so it rises when statements get slower even though the
load did not change, and more cores treat the symptom.

`check-role-access` answers whether a role can use a table, view, function or
procedure — walking the gates in order, since the one people forget is `USAGE`
on the schema and the resulting error names the table. It treats row-level
security as a second gate that opens after the grants already said yes: RLS
enabled with no applicable permissive policy is deny-all, so every grant checks
out and the table returns nothing.

`diagnose-slow-query` is the hub — a slow statement can end in a plan fix, a
vacuum change, an index, or a schema change, and it routes to the others
accordingly. `plan-schema-change` answers "how should I apply this DDL
here?" by measuring the table rather than prescribing a method — it carries no
DDL recipes, because the same statement that is instant on an empty table is an
outage at a billion rows, and only the row count, measured size, existing
indexes and current lock waits can tell the two apart. **Completions** are offered for the `conn`,
`schema` and `table` variables.

## Tools

75 read-only operations, grouped as schema exploration, catalog search, cluster-wide
objects, extensibility and text search, foreign data and replication, monitoring and
statistics, diagnostics and query planning, topology, connections, and connection poolers. Highlights include
`tableDetails` (columns, indexes, constraints, foreign keys in both directions, triggers,
policies), `searchTables` (full-text search across names, descriptions, and enum values),
and `explainQuery` (recover a slow statement from `pg_stat_statements` by `queryid` and get
its `EXPLAIN` plan).

Two arguments narrow an answer by a string, and they match differently:

| argument | how it matches | taken by |
|---|---|---|
| `pattern` | a literal, case-insensitive substring of a name — `_` and `%` match themselves, nothing is stemmed, so `user_` finds `user_x` and not `users` | `listSchemas`, `listTables`, `listTableStats`, `listTableSizes`, `listFunctions`, `listSequences`, `listRoles`, `serverSettings`, `poolerConfig`, `listConnections`, `listTopology` |
| `web_search` | full-text search (`websearch_to_tsquery`, English) — words are stemmed, names are split into words at `_` and capitals, `"a phrase"`, `or` and `-word` work, and a fragment of a word matches nothing | `searchTables`, `searchFunctions`, `searchEnums` |

To find part of a name, use a listing's `pattern`; to find a word anywhere in names, comments
or source, use a search.

`checkPrivileges` reports which of them the current role can actually use on a given
connection. Most work for any role that can connect, since the catalog is world-readable:
measured on PostgreSQL 18 with every extension present, a bare login role runs 59 of the 72
database operations at full fidelity, the monitoring role 67. What remains for the monitoring role reads row data or
plans against it, apart from replication origin progress, which only the superuser can read. Worth calling first
against an unfamiliar connection — a privilege-filtered answer is easy to mistake for an
empty one, since `tableStats` on a role without `SELECT` returns columns with null
statistics, exactly like a table that was never analyzed.

`evaluateIndex` plans a statement as if the indexes were different, using
[hypopg](https://github.com/HypoPG/hypopg): `create` tests a candidate index without
building it, `hide` plans without an existing one — which is how to ask whether an index is
safe to drop. Nothing is built, nothing is locked, and the statement is never executed. It
reports whether the planner actually *used* each index, which is the answer a cost figure
hides.

Three tools read PgBouncer, the pooler in front of the database, rather than the database
behind it. `poolerStatus` answers whether the pools can keep up — clients waiting for a
server, the longest wait, servers in use against each database's `pool_size` —
`poolerConnections` lists the clients and server connections, and `poolerConfig` the
settings that differ from PgBouncer's defaults. They connect to PgBouncer's admin console,
declared as its own section:

```ini
[pooler_prod]
kind  = pgbouncer
host  = pooler01
port  = 6432
user  = pglicht_stats   ; in PgBouncer's stats_users
group = poolers
```

The console refuses transactions, so these send only fixed `SHOW` commands, and the user
should be one from `stats_users`, which PgBouncer allows to run `SHOW` and nothing else —
pg_licht cannot check which list a user is in, so that second guard is yours to set up.
`statement_timeout_ms` in the section bounds each `SHOW`, cancelled from this side, and a
command an older PgBouncer does not know is named under `unavailable` while the rest is
answered. Database tools refuse a pooler section and pooler tools refuse a database; a group
holding both is swept by each kind of tool over its own members. A database tool called
with no connection goes to the first section that is not a pooler; a pooler tool, to the
only console configured, and with several it must be told which.

A database reached through a console says so with `pooler = <section>`, since nothing else
can: through PgBouncer the server's address is the pooler's own hop. `verifyTopology` then
checks it against the console's routing and names the direct connection that is the same
database; the pooler tools accept the database's name and answer about its pool; and a
per-database sweep answers that database once, skipping the pooled twin only when the
console confirms it is the same database, reached as the same user.

```ini
[orders_pooled]
host   = pooler01
port   = 6432
dbname = orders
pooler = pooler_prod
```

Editing the connections file (or the `budgets.ini` in use at startup) needs no restart: the
change is picked up at the next request, and `SIGHUP` forces it. A budgets file created after
startup is read at the next start. A file that fails to load leaves the running
configuration in place and says so under `reload_error` in `listConnections`; the client is
sent `list_changed` notifications, since the tool and resource lists name connections.

A section that does not validate — an unknown `kind`, a console given an `instance` — is
skipped with a warning instead of stopping the server: the other connections keep working,
`listConnections` and `verifyTopology` list it under `invalid` with the reason, and a call
naming it gets the reason back. A skipped `[default]` stays the default, so a call naming no
connection gets its reason instead of going to another database. What still stops startup is
what is not one section's: an unreadable or group-accessible file, a malformed line, a
duplicate header, a name used on two topology axes, an unclaimed `[instance:…]` section, or a
file with no usable section.

**Citus.** On a Citus worker the shards are ordinary tables that Citus hides from any client
whose `application_name` does not match `citus.show_shards_for_app_name_prefixes`, so
pg_licht sees only the empty distributed shells there, and the size and statistics tools
report a worker holding gigabytes as holding nothing. pg_licht cannot set this for itself: it
is a superuser setting. On the workers, for the role pg_licht connects as:

```sql
ALTER ROLE pglicht_ro SET citus.show_shards_for_app_name_prefixes = 'pg-licht';
```

Three optional extensions that keep their counters in shared memory, all keyed by the same
`query_id` as `statementStats`, each get a tool. `waitEventProfile` reads
[pg_wait_sampling](https://github.com/postgrespro/pg_wait_sampling): what the instance has
spent its time waiting on, which a single `currentActivity` sample cannot say.
`statementKernelStats` reads [pg_stat_kcache](https://github.com/powa-team/pg_stat_kcache):
the CPU time and the bytes actually read from storage per statement, which is how a page
cache hit and a device read stop looking alike. `predicateStats` and `suggestIndexes` read
[pg_qualstats](https://github.com/powa-team/pg_qualstats): which predicates filter the most
rows, and the extension's own index advisor, whose `CREATE INDEX` suggestions go straight into
`evaluateIndex`. pg_qualstats records the literal of every predicate it samples; neither tool
ever returns one. All three need `shared_preload_libraries`, and the tools say so rather than
answer empty when a library is installed without it.

Tables are covered by three tools rather than one, split by what the answer costs and how
fast it goes stale:

| | tools | reads |
|---|---|---|
| **structure** — changes only on DDL | `tableDetails`, `listTables`, `searchTables` | catalog |
| **statistics** — changes continuously, free to ask | `tableStats`, `listTableStats` | catalog and the statistics collector |
| **measured size** — changes continuously, costs a lock | `tableSize`, `listTableSizes` | `stat()` per segment, under `AccessShareLock` |

The structure tools return no sample column values and no counters, so the payload an agent
reads most often to understand a schema carries neither row data nor anything that moves
under it. `tableStats` carries the `pg_stats` histograms — including `most_common_vals`,
which is literal values sampled from the column — and a free `size_estimate` from
`relpages`, dated by `estimated_from` so its staleness is visible. Reach for `tableSize`
only when that estimate is too stale to act on: it opens each relation with
`AccessShareLock`, so during a rewrite it waits behind the `ALTER TABLE`.

For operational triage there are `wraparoundStatus` (XID and multixact headroom, per
database and per table, TOAST tables included), `checkpointStats` (timed against requested
checkpoints, backend-written buffers, WAL volume — normalized across the PostgreSQL 17
`pg_stat_checkpointer` split), `progressStats` (every running VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, COPY…
with a completion percentage), `ioStats` (`pg_stat_io` per backend type and context, 16+),
`tableIOStats` (cache hit ratio per table and per index), `duplicateIndexes` (identical and
prefix-redundant indexes, compared by column expression, opclass, collation and sort order),
`indexBloat` (per-index physical statistics, dispatched on the access method — btree leaf
density and fragmentation, GIN pending list against the `fastupdate` settings that bound it,
hash bucket and overflow pages), and `hostCapacity` (memory settings against the host's
actual RAM and vCPU count — see below).

`bufferCacheSummary` and `bufferCacheContents` read `pg_buffercache`. The summary needs
extension version 1.4, which ships with PostgreSQL 16; on 14 and 15 it says so and points
at `bufferCacheContents`, which reads the view and works everywhere. `tableIOStats` counts
only what `shared_buffers` served, so a miss there may still have come from the OS page
cache at RAM speed; these are the only in-core view of that split. Read the usage-count
histogram rather than a hit ratio: mass at 2–5 is a stable working set, everything at 0–1
with no unused buffers is clock-sweep churn, and those are the same ratio with opposite
diagnoses. `bufferCacheContents` aggregates per relation and fork, never raw per-buffer
rows.

`listTopology` and `verifyTopology` cover the connection topology — see below.

The monitoring tools take optional `pid` and `query_id` filters, so a symptom can be
followed to its cause rather than read out of a full dump:

```
statementStats → query_id → currentActivity(query_id) → pid → currentLocks(pid)
                                                            → progressStats(pid)
                                                            → ioStats(pid)
                                                            → explainQuery(query_id)
```

`currentLocks(pid)` resolves the transitive blocking chain and tags each row with
`chain_depth`, so the backend at the root of a pile-up is the one with the highest depth.

Each one is documented, with its arguments, in `man pg_licht_mcp` under OPERATIONS. Every
operation also accepts an optional `connection` argument to select one of several
configured databases, and most accept `instance`, `replication_group` or `group` to run
across several at once — see below.

## Topology

With more than one database configured, three labels say how they relate. They are
deliberately separate, because only the first two license a conclusion:

```ini
[billing_prod]
service           = billing-prod
instance          = pg-prod-01      # one postmaster
replication_group = billing-ha      # a primary and its replicas
group             = prod, billing   # an operator label

[billing_ro]
service           = billing-replica
instance          = pg-prod-02
replication_group = billing-ha
group             = prod, billing, reporting
```

- **`instance`** — one postmaster. Its databases share `shared_buffers`, WAL, autovacuum
  workers, `max_connections` and disk, so one database's checkpoint storm really is
  another's latency. PostgreSQL's own glossary calls this a *database cluster*.
- **`replication_group`** — a primary and its replicas: the same data on different
  servers, each keeping its own statistics counters.
- **`group`** — an arbitrary label. Implies nothing, which is the point: it is how an
  agent asks about "dev" without knowing any connection name.

There is no `cluster` key. PostgreSQL uses that word for the first sense and RDS/Aurora
for the second, so it means opposite things to the two people most likely to read the
file. There is no `role` key either: primary or replica is observed on every connection
via `pg_is_in_recovery()` and never cached, because failover swaps it and failover is
exactly when this server gets used.

An `instance` is inferred when two connections share a host **and** port, and reported as
`inferred` rather than `declared` — behind a pooler one endpoint can front several
instances, so it groups output without licensing a contention claim. `verifyTopology`
settles it, by connecting to each server and reading its system identifier: same
identifier on the same endpoint is one instance, the same identifier on different hosts is
a replication lineage, and a disagreement means the config is wrong.

Passing `instance`, `replication_group` or `group` instead of `connection` runs the tool
once per member and returns one result per member, in config file order. A member that
cannot be reached is reported in place rather than failing the sweep. Which of the three a
tool accepts depends on where its answer actually varies, and its input schema says which:

| | varies across the databases of one instance | varies across members of a replication group |
|---|---|---|
| catalogs, `tableBloat`, the structure and size tools | yes | no — a physical replica is byte-identical |
| `duplicateIndexes`, `indexBloat`, `tableIOStats`, `tableStats`, `listTableStats`, `partitionDetails`, `subscriptionStats`, `predicateStats`, `suggestIndexes` | yes | **yes** — they carry `idx_scan`, vacuum counters, a worker of their own, or predicates each server sampled from its own queries |
| `currentActivity`, `currentLocks`, `statementStats`, `statementKernelStats`, `waitEventProfile`, `replicationStats`, buffer cache | no — instance-wide | yes |

That middle row is the one worth knowing: an index that reads as unused on the primary may
be carrying a replica's entire reporting workload, and only that replica's `idx_scan`
shows it. `role: "primary"` or `role: "replica"` narrows a sweep to one side.

Sweeps are sequential — the server is a single-threaded loop — so width costs wall clock.
Call `listTopology` first; it reads the config file and opens no connection.

A worked example covering all of this is in
[cpp/test/connections.example.ini](cpp/test/connections.example.ini).

## Host capacity

Total RAM and vCPU count live outside the catalog, so `hostCapacity` cannot read them and
will not guess. Inject them per connection in the connections file:

```ini
[prod]
service      = db01_ro
host_ram_mb  = 65536
host_vcpus   = 16
```

With several databases on one postmaster, declare it once for the instance instead and the
members inherit it; an explicit per-connection value still wins:

```ini
[instance:pg-prod-01]
host_ram_mb  = 65536
host_vcpus   = 16
```

Inheritance follows `instance` only, never `replication_group`: replicas routinely run on
smaller machines, and inheriting the primary's RAM would give every replica a confidently
wrong `shared_buffers` ratio.

Or, with a single `DATABASE_URL`, via `PG_LICHT_HOST_RAM_MB` and `PG_LICHT_HOST_VCPUS`. An
agent that inspects the host at run time can instead pass `ram_mb` and `vcpus` straight to
the tool, which takes precedence over both.

The declared figures also bound one thing that executes. `explainQuery` with `analyze` and
explicit `settings` runs the statement under those settings only if the plan's worst-case
memory fits in a tenth of `host_ram_mb` and it uses at most one parallel worker per four
`host_vcpus`. With no declared capacity it runs under no settings change at all and returns
the plan unexecuted. Both ratios can be changed in a `budgets.ini`:

```ini
[analyze]
memory_percent   = 10   ; worst-case plan memory, % of host_ram_mb
vcpus_per_worker = 4    ; one parallel worker per this many host_vcpus
```

It is read from `$PG_LICHT_BUDGETS`, from beside the connections file, or from
`~/.config/pg_licht/budgets.ini`, in that order, and must not be writable by other users.
An example is in [cpp/test/budgets.example.ini](cpp/test/budgets.example.ini). The read-only guard and the timeout do not bound memory, and one
out-of-memory kill restarts every connection on the instance. The per-call `ram_mb` and
`vcpus` arguments do not count here: a caller cannot raise its own limit.

The same file can cap how large one answer may be. It is off by default. With `max_kb` set,
an answer past it is refused with a hint naming the arguments that make that tool's answer
smaller. It is a ceiling you choose, not protection against loss: Claude Code moves a tool
result over its own limit (`MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS`, 25,000 tokens by default) into a file
the model reads back. The limit is in bytes, and how many bytes of these answers make a token
has not been measured, so set it from what your client is observed to accept.

```ini
[payload]
max_kb = 0   ; the default: off
```

Independently of the cap, the tools known to answer at hundreds of kilobytes narrow themselves now: `searchFunctions` leaves out
PostgreSQL's own functions unless `include_system` is set, `partitionDetails` returns at most
100 partitions — ranked with `order_by`, and always keeping the `DEFAULT` one — with
`partition_count` and `partitions_truncated` beside them, and `listSchemas`, `listTables`,
`listTableStats`, `listTableSizes`, `listSequences` and `listFunctions` take a `pattern`.
What it cannot help with is one object that is simply large — a very wide table, a huge
function body, a very large plan: with a cap set, that is refused with a hint pointing at `max_kb`.

## PostgreSQL version support

PostgreSQL 14 and newer, verified in CI on 14–18. Every operation returns its full result
on every supported version, apart from `ioStats`, which needs the PostgreSQL 16
`pg_stat_io` view and says so on older servers. Individual fields are omitted where the
underlying column does not exist, and views that changed shape upstream —
`pg_stat_checkpointer` in 17, the `pg_stat_wal` and `pg_stat_progress_vacuum` columns in
17 and 18 — are normalized to one set of field names. The COMPATIBILITY section of
`man pg_licht_mcp` lists every gated field by version.
