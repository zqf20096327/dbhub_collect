# SQLite Extension Installation Guide

This repository provides detailed, cross-platform documentation for installing and using SQLite extensions in different environments.

Whether you're working with Python, C, Node.js, or on iOS/Android, this guide walks you through building, loading, and troubleshooting SQLite extensions.

## What Are SQLite Extensions?

SQLite extensions allow developers to extend SQLite’s capabilities by adding:

* New scalar or aggregate functions
* Custom collation sequences
* Virtual tables
* User-defined data types
* Enhanced I/O or full-text indexing

The official SQLite extension guide is available at [https://sqlite.org/loadext.html](https://sqlite.org/loadext.html)

## Extension Formats

Depending on the platform, compiled extensions will have different formats:

| Platform | File Extension         |
| -------- | -----------------------|
| Linux    | `.so`                  |
| Android  | `.so, .aar`            |
| macOS    | `.dylib, .xcframework` |
| iOS      | `.dylib, .xcframework` |
| Windows  | `.dll`                 |

### Notes:

* **.dylib** is used for iOS/macOS, for Intel and ARM processors. Apple (macOS/iOS) also provides a mechanism to embed different processor architectures (known as “fat” or “universal” binaries) into the same library. This is **not supported** on Linux and Windows.
* **.xcframework** is used for iOS/macOS to package multiple versions of the same framework (different platforms, OS versions, and architectures) into a single distributable bundle. It replaces the older “fat binary” approach and makes it easier to ship libraries that work seamlessly across devices and simulators.
* **.so** is used for Linux and Android.
* **.aar** (Android Archive) is an Android-specific package format that bundles compiled code, resources, and native libraries (`.so` files) for distribution via Maven Central or JitPack. When you add an `.aar` dependency to your Android project, the native `.so` libraries are automatically extracted to the device's `nativeLibraryDir` at installation time, where they can be loaded as SQLite extensions. This is the standard way to distribute SQLite extensions for Android apps.
* **.dll** is used for Windows.

On **iOS**, Apple heavily restricts loading arbitrary dynamic code for security reasons. You cannot just download and load a .dylib at runtime. The only dynamic code allowed must be signed, shipped with the app, and declared properly.
A **.xcframework** is just a packaging format for distributing precompiled frameworks across platforms and architectures. It doesn’t give you new dynamic loading capabilities—it just makes it easier to bundle and ship libraries. When you include an .xcframework in your app, Xcode links the correct slice (device vs. simulator, arm64 vs. x86_64, etc.), and the framework becomes part of your app bundle. At runtime, iOS loads it like any other embedded framework, but you cannot load an arbitrary new .xcframework after your app is shipped.
So, .xcframework is the standard and recommended way to distribute binary iOS frameworks, but it’s not the only way to load dynamic code—you can still use traditional .framework bundles (though .xcframework replaces the old “fat binary” approach).

### Example: Linux Architecture Selection

On Windows and Linux, since universal binaries are not supported, you must explicitly load the extension that matches your system architecture. For example:

```c
if (is_linux_arm) {
    load_extension("sqlite-vector_linux_arm");
} else {
    load_extension("sqlite-vector_linux_x86");
}
```

Note that **you can skip the file extension when loading**. Only the extension name (with full path) is required.

## Typical Use Cases

In the examples and sample code throughout this document, we’ll reference specific extensions that we’ve built (such as [sqlite-vector](https://github.com/sqliteai/sqlite-vector), [sqlite-ai](https://github.com/sqliteai/sqlite-ai), [sqlite-js](https://github.com/sqliteai/sqlite-js), and [sqlite-sync](https://github.com/sqliteai/sqlite-sync)). These are concrete illustrations of what’s possible, but the same code patterns and explanations apply to any SQLite extension you might want to develop or integrate. Whether you’re extending SQLite with your own custom functionality or adopting third-party extensions, the techniques remain consistent.
* Add vector similarity search to SQLite (e.g., `sqlite-vector`)
* Implement AI/ML inference at the edge (e.g., `sqlite-ai`)
* Enable JavaScript inside SQLite (e.g., `sqlite-js`)
* Sync data to the cloud (e.g., `sqlite-sync`)

## Loading Extensions

Extensions can be loaded dynamically at runtime via:

* Programmatic APIs (`sqlite3_load_extension`)
* SQL command (`SELECT load_extension(...)`)
* Automatic loading (when supported)

Refer to the platform-specific **loading instructions** below:

* [Loading extension on Linux](platforms/linux.md)
* [Loading extension on macOS](platforms/macos.md)
* [Loading extension on Windows](platforms/windows.md)
* [Loading extension on iOS](platforms/ios.md)
* [Loading extension on Android](platforms/android.md)
* [Loading extension in Flutter/Dart](platforms/flutter.md)
* [Loading extension on Web/WASM](https://github.com/sqliteai/sqlite-extensions-guide/tree/main/examples/browser-wasm)
* [Loading extension on Expo/React Native](platforms/react-native-expo.md)

You can find practical **code samples** for loading SQLite extensions in various programming languages in the [examples](examples) directory.

## Security Considerations

By default, some SQLite builds (especially in Python or mobile platforms) **disable extension loading** due to security risks. You'll need to explicitly enable it in most environments.
