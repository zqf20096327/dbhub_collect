# SQLite Vector

**SQLite Vector** is a cross-platform, ultra-efficient SQLite extension that brings vector search capabilities to your embedded database. It works seamlessly on **iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, and macOS**, using just **30MB of memory** by default. With support for **Float32, Float16, BFloat16, Int8, UInt8, 1Bit, and TurboQuant 2/3/4-bit quantization**, plus **highly optimized distance functions**, it's the ideal solution for **Edge AI** applications.

SQLite-Vector includes **TurboQuant**, a compact data-oblivious vector quantizer inspired by the Google Research paper [TurboQuant: Online Vector Quantization with Near-Optimal Distortion Rate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19874). It stores each vector as low-bit scalar codes plus one scale value, then scores directly from SIMD lookup-table kernels without reconstructing full vectors.

## Highlights

* **No virtual tables required** – store vectors directly as `BLOB`s in ordinary tables
* **Blazing fast** – optimized C implementation with SIMD acceleration
* **TurboQuant support** – SIMD 2-, 3-, and 4-bit quantization scans with `qtype=TURBO`
* **Low memory footprint** – defaults to just 30MB of RAM usage
* **Zero preindexing needed** – no long preprocessing or index-building phases
* **Works offline** – perfect for on-device, privacy-preserving AI workloads
* **Plug-and-play** – drop into existing SQLite workflows with minimal effort
* **Cross-platform** – works out of the box on all major OSes

Unlike other vector databases or extensions that require complex setup, SQLite-Vector **just works** with your existing database schema and tools.


## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries

Download the appropriate pre-built binary for your platform from the official [Releases](https://github.com/sqliteai/sqlite-vector/releases) page:

- Linux: x86 and ARM
- macOS: x86 and ARM
- Windows: x86
- Android
- iOS

### Loading the Extension

```sql
-- In SQLite CLI
.load ./vector

-- In SQL
SELECT load_extension('./vector');
```

Or embed it directly into your application.

### WASM Version

You can download the WebAssembly (WASM) version of SQLite with the SQLite Vector extension enabled from: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sqliteai/sqlite-wasm

## Example Usage

```sql
-- Create a regular SQLite table
CREATE TABLE images (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  embedding BLOB, -- store Float32/UInt8/etc.
  label TEXT
);

-- Insert a BLOB vector (Float32, 384 dimensions) using bindings
INSERT INTO images (embedding, label) VALUES (?, 'cat');

-- Insert a JSON vector (Float32, 384 dimensions)
INSERT INTO images (embedding, label) VALUES (vector_as_f32('[0.3, 1.0, 0.9, 3.2, 1.4,...]'), 'dog');

-- Initialize the vector. By default, the distance function is L2.
-- To use a different metric, specify one of the following options:
-- distance=L1, distance=COSINE, distance=DOT, distance=SQUARED_L2, or distance=HAMMING.
SELECT vector_init('images', 'embedding', 'type=FLOAT32,dimension=384');

-- If your embeddings are already unit length, say so: FLOAT32 cosine scans then compute
-- 1 - dot instead of the full cosine, with the same results.
-- SELECT vector_init('images', 'embedding', 'type=FLOAT32,dimension=384,distance=COSINE,normalized=1');

-- Quantize vector
SELECT vector_quantize('images', 'embedding');

-- Or use TurboQuant for compact 2/3/4-bit quantization
SELECT vector_quantize('images', 'embedding', 'qtype=TURBO,qbits=4');

-- Optional preload quantized version in memory (for a 4x/5x speedup) 
SELECT vector_quantize_preload('images', 'embedding');

-- Run a nearest neighbor query on the quantized version (returns top 20 closest vectors)
SELECT e.id, v.distance FROM images AS e
   JOIN vector_quantize_scan('images', 'embedding', ?, 20) AS v
   ON e.id = v.rowid;

-- Streaming mode: omit k to get rows progressively, use SQL to filter and limit
SELECT e.id, v.distance FROM images AS e
   JOIN vector_quantize_scan('images', 'embedding', ?) AS v
   ON e.id = v.rowid
   WHERE e.label = 'cat'
   LIMIT 10;
```

## Benchmark

To add your machine to the table, one command — pass the CPU name and nothing else:

```bash
make benchmark HARDWARE="Apple M5 Pro"
```

It builds `test/benchmark.c` at `-O3` with the same per-translation-unit SIMD flags the
shipped extension uses, runs **k=20 over 1,000,000 vectors of dimension 768** with cosine
distance and 20 queries reporting the best, and prints two rows ready to paste, unedited,
into the table below.

Two things it does so a pasted row cannot be wrong. The backend is **appended by the
binary** from what the build actually selected, not typed by hand, so a row cannot claim
`AVX512` on a build that fell back to `SSE2`. And a run whose parameters differ from the
ones the table is built on **prints an explanation instead of rows**, because a row
measured on a different workload would sit in that table looking comparable without being
comparable.

That second guard exists because the parameters *are* adjustable, just not for this table:

```bash
make benchmark NVECS=100000 DIM=384 K=10 DISTANCE=l2
```

That run prints the mode table for whatever you asked for, and no paste-ready rows.

Common to every row: the database is **a file, never `:memory:`** — an in-memory database
puts the whole index in the process no matter how it is configured, which makes any memory
figure meaningless. Vectors are uniform random with a fixed seed, so two machines measure
the same data. The `INT8` index is **740 MB** on disk against 2930 MB of raw `FLOAT32`.
Recall is the overlap with the exact `FLOAT32` scan, the baseline everything is compared
against, 100% by definition; on the reference machine that scan takes **484 ms/query**,
because it reads 3 GB per query.

The two rows per machine are the two ways the same index gets deployed. *Preloaded* holds
it in the process after `vector_quantize_preload()`. *Streamed* walks it through a bounded
buffer set by `max_memory=30MB`, the default, and what a device with less RAM than the
index actually does. **Max memory** is measured, not the parameter echoed back: it is the
peak the extension and SQLite had allocated during the scan.

### Hardware

| Hardware | Vectors | Index | Max memory | ms/query | Mvec/s | Recall@20 |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Apple M5 Pro - NEON | 1,000,000 | `INT8` preloaded | 740 MB | 37.6 | 26.6 | 99.5% |
| Apple M5 Pro - NEON | 1,000,000 | `INT8` streamed | 30 MB | 114.4 | 8.7 | 99.5% |

*Results from other CPUs welcome — run the command above and open a PR adding the two rows
it prints.*

The trade is **25x less memory for 3x the latency**, with recall untouched: both rows read
the same index, only how much of it is resident differs.

Two things the timings do not show. They are best-of-20, so the file is in the operating
system's page cache by then — that cache lives outside the process and is evicted under
pressure, so it is not in the memory column, but it is why the streamed row is not paying
for storage reads. On a device where the index genuinely does not fit in RAM, add
`index size / storage bandwidth` to the streamed number. And the preloaded row is almost
unaffected by where the database lives, because after the one-time preload the scan reads
the extension's own buffer and never goes back to SQLite.

Recall is repeated on every row on purpose: it depends on the data, not the hardware, so a
row that disagrees with the others is a sign that machine selected a different SIMD
backend than it should have.

### Choosing a mode

`INT8` is in the table above because it is the mode to reach for first. The others, same
machine, same data, all preloaded:

| Mode | Index | ms/query | vs exact | Recall@20 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `FLOAT32` exact | 2930 MB | 484.4 | 1.0x | 100.0% |
| `UINT8` | 740 MB | 37.3 | 13.0x | 33.8% |
| `INT8` | 740 MB | 37.6 | 12.9x | 99.5% |
| `1BIT` | 99 MB | 2.5 | 195x | 10.0% |
| `TURBO2` | 195 MB | 48.0 | 10.1x | 45.2% |
| `TURBO4` | 378 MB | 151.5 | 3.2x | 81.8% |

**The data is uniform random**, the worst case for every quantizer: real embeddings have
structure quantization exploits, so recall on your own vectors will be higher, often much
higher. Read that column as a floor and a way to rank the modes, not as a prediction.

Three things are worth knowing before choosing.

**For cosine, use `INT8`, not `UINT8`.** Same size, same speed, 33.8% recall against 99.5%.
Unsigned quantization subtracts the dataset minimum before scaling, and cosine measures
angle, which that shift destroys. `UINT8` is right for L2, where a common translation
cancels. If you omit `qtype` the extension picks `UINT8` for non-negative data — correct
for L2, wrong for cosine — so set it explicitly when you use cosine.

**`1BIT` is a filter, not an answer.** 195x faster than exact and 30x smaller, at 10%
recall here. It earns its place as a first pass whose survivors you re-rank at full
precision.

**TurboQuant buys memory against `INT8`, not speed.** `TURBO4` is 3.2x faster than the
exact scan, so it is a real win over brute force — but `INT8` is 4x faster again at twice
the size, and `TURBO2` is both smaller and faster than `TURBO4` if 45% recall is enough.
TurboQuant's lookup scan is one table gather per row: at dimension 768 that is 384 gathers
into a 384 KB table per vector, already about one lookup per cycle, so its current storage
layout has no headroom left ([#57](https://github.com/sqliteai/sqlite-vector/issues/57)).
Reach for it when the memory budget is what binds.

## TurboQuant Benchmark and Recall

TurboQuant can be selected with `qtype=TURBO,qbits=N`, where `N` is `2`, `3`, or `4`. Shorthand aliases are also available: `TURBO2`, `TURBO3`, and `TURBO4`.

```sql
-- Highest recall TurboQuant mode currently recommended as the default
SELECT vector_quantize('images', 'embedding', 'qtype=TURBO,qbits=4');

-- Smaller edge-oriented representation
SELECT vector_quantize('images', 'embedding', 'qtype=TURBO2');
```

An earlier synthetic benchmark on this dataset reported speedups of 15x for 4-bit and 38x
for 2-bit against `vector_full_scan()`, with DOT distance and k=10. The [Benchmark](#benchmark)
section above measures the same shape with cosine and k=20 and lands lower — 3.2x for
4-bit, 10.2x for 2-bit — mostly because the distance kernels have since been rewritten,
which made the full-precision baseline it is compared against substantially faster. The
direction is the same: TurboQuant beats brute force, and `INT8` beats TurboQuant on speed
while costing twice the memory.

For comparison, the raw `FLOAT32` vectors alone are about **3.07 GB** for 1M x 768 before SQLite row/page overhead. TurboQuant 4-bit reduces the scan representation to about **13%** of that raw vector payload, TurboQuant 3-bit to about **10%**, and TurboQuant 2-bit to about **7%**. Actual resident memory depends on whether the database is in-memory or file-backed, SQLite cache settings, preloading, page cache behavior, and the host allocator.

The TurboQuant scan backend can be checked separately from the regular distance backend:

```sql
SELECT vector_backend(), vector_turboquant_backend();
```

For edge deployments, `vector_quantize_memory(table, column)` estimates the quantized scan representation. TurboQuant stores each row as `rowid + scale + packed_codes`, roughly `rows * (8 + 4 + ceil(dim * qbits / 8))` bytes before allocator and SQLite cache overhead. The synthetic benchmark in `test/benchmark_turboquant.c` also supports `PRELOAD=0` to compare the lower-RAM, non-preloaded path.

Real-dataset recall can be reproduced with `test/recall_turboquant_real.py`, which downloads Fashion-MNIST in the ANN-Benchmarks HDF5 format and compares TurboQuant against `vector_full_scan()` using L2 distance. Example run on macOS ARM64/NEON with 10,000 base vectors, 50 queries, and k=10:

| Mode | Quantized storage | Full scan / query | TurboQuant / query | Speedup | Recall@10 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| TurboQuant 4-bit | 4.04 MB | 16.32 ms | 4.80 ms | 3.40x | 0.948 |
| TurboQuant 3-bit | 3.06 MB | 16.32 ms | 8.28 ms | 1.97x | 0.868 |
| TurboQuant 2-bit | 2.08 MB | 16.32 ms | 1.86 ms | 8.78x | 0.596 |

`qbits=4` is the recommended starting point when recall matters. `qbits=2` is useful for tighter edge memory budgets, but should be validated on the target embeddings because recall can drop significantly depending on the dataset.

### Swift Package

You can [add this repository as a package dependency to your Swift project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app#Add-a-package-dependency). After adding the package, you'll need to set up SQLite with extension loading by following steps 4 and 5 of [this guide](https://github.com/sqliteai/sqlite-extensions-guide/blob/main/platforms/ios.md#4-set-up-sqlite-with-extension-loading).

Here's an example of how to use the package:
```swift
import vector

...

var db: OpaquePointer?
sqlite3_open(":memory:", &db)
sqlite3_enable_load_extension(db, 1)
var errMsg: UnsafeMutablePointer<Int8>? = nil
sqlite3_load_extension(db, vector.path, nil, &errMsg)
var stmt: OpaquePointer?
sqlite3_prepare_v2(db, "SELECT vector_version()", -1, &stmt, nil)
defer { sqlite3_finalize(stmt) }
sqlite3_step(stmt)
log("vector_version(): \(String(cString: sqlite3_column_text(stmt, 0)))")
sqlite3_close(db)
```

### Android Package

Add the [following](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/ai.sqlite/vector) to your Gradle dependencies:

```gradle
implementation 'ai.sqlite:vector:0.9.80'
```

Here's an example of how to use the package:
```java
SQLiteCustomExtension vectorExtension = new SQLiteCustomExtension(getApplicationInfo().nativeLibraryDir + "/vector", null);
SQLiteDatabaseConfiguration config = new SQLiteDatabaseConfiguration(
    getCacheDir().getPath() + "/vector_test.db",
    SQLiteDatabase.CREATE_IF_NECESSARY | SQLiteDatabase.OPEN_READWRITE,
    Collections.emptyList(),
    Collections.emptyList(),
    Collections.singletonList(vectorExtension)
);
SQLiteDatabase db = SQLiteDatabase.openDatabase(config, null, null);
```

**Note:** Additional settings and configuration are required for a complete setup. For full implementation details, see the [complete Android example](https://github.com/sqliteai/sqlite-extensions-guide/blob/main/examples/android/README.md).

### Python Package

Python developers can quickly get started using the ready-to-use `sqlite-vector` package available on PyPI:

```bash
pip install sqliteai-vector
```

For usage details and examples, see the [Python package documentation](./packages/python/README.md).

### Flutter Package

Add the [sqlite_vector](https://pub.dev/packages/sqlite_vector) package to your project:

```bash
flutter pub add sqlite_vector  # Flutter projects
dart pub add sqlite_vector     # Dart projects
```

Usage with `sqlite3` package:
```dart
import 'package:sqlite3/sqlite3.dart';
import 'package:sqlite_vector/sqlite_vector.dart';

sqlite3.loadSqliteVectorExtension();
final db = sqlite3.openInMemory();
print(db.select('SELECT vector_version()'));
```

For a complete example, see the [Flutter example](https://github.com/sqliteai/sqlite-extensions-guide/blob/main/examples/flutter/README.md).

## Documentation

Extensive API documentation can be found in the [API page](https://github.com/sqliteai/sqlite-vector/blob/main/API.md).

More information about the quantization process can be found in the [QUANTIZATION document](https://github.com/sqliteai/sqlite-vector/blob/main/QUANTIZATION.md).

## Features

### Instant Vector Search – No Preindexing Required

Unlike other SQLite vector extensions that rely on complex indexing algorithms such as DiskANN, HNSW, or IVF, which often require **preprocessing steps that can take hours or even days**, `sqlite-vector` works out of the box with your existing data. There’s **no need to preindex your vectors**—you can start performing fast, approximate or exact vector searches **immediately**.

This means:

* **No waiting time** before your app or service is usable
* **Zero-cost updates** – you can add, remove, or modify vectors on the fly without rebuilding any index
* **Works directly with BLOB columns** in ordinary SQLite tables – no special schema or virtual table required
* **Ideal for edge and mobile use cases**, where preprocessing large datasets is not practical or possible

By eliminating the need for heavyweight indexing, `sqlite-vector` offers a **simpler, faster, and more developer-friendly** approach to embedding vector search in your applications.

### Supported Vector Types

You can store your vectors as `BLOB` columns in ordinary tables. Supported formats include:

* `float32` (4 bytes per element)
* `float16` (2 bytes per element)
* `bfloat16` (2 bytes per element)
* `int8` (1 byte per element)
* `uint8` (1 byte per element)
* `1bit` (1 bit per element)

Simply insert a vector as a binary blob into your table. No special table types or schemas are required.

A stored column is quantized separately with `vector_quantize(table, column, 'qtype=...')`,
which builds a compact index the scan reads instead of the raw vectors:

| `qtype` | Bytes per dimension | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `UINT8` | 1 | Asymmetric. Correct for L2; see the [benchmark](#benchmark) before using it with cosine |
| `INT8` | 1 | Symmetric. The default choice for cosine |
| `1BIT` | 1/8 | Hamming only. A pre-filter to re-rank, not a final ranking |
| `TURBO2` / `TURBO3` / `TURBO4` | 1/4, 3/8, 1/2 | Lookup-table scan; smallest indexes, see [TurboQuant](#turboquant-benchmark-and-recall) |

Omitting `qtype` picks `UINT8` for non-negative data and `INT8` otherwise. `BIT` columns
are already binary, so `1BIT` is the only quantization they accept.


### Supported Distance Metrics

Optimized implementations available:

* **L2 Distance (Euclidean)**
* **Squared L2**
* **L1 Distance (Manhattan)**
* **Cosine Distance**
* **Dot Product**
* **Hamming Distance** (available only with 1bit vectors — `vector_init()` rejects it for any other type)

These are implemented in pure C and optimized for SIMD when available, ensuring maximum performance on modern CPUs and mobile devices.

If your embeddings are already unit length, say so with `normalized=1`: cosine on a
`FLOAT32` column then reduces to `1 - dot`, dropping two thirds of the arithmetic from the
inner loop for the same results. It is an assertion about your data, not a request — see
[API.md](API.md#vector_inittable-column-options).

# What Is Vector Search?

Vector search is the process of finding the closest match(es) to a given vector (a point in high-dimensional space) based on a similarity or distance metric. It is essential for AI and machine learning applications where data is often encoded into vector embeddings.

### Common Use Cases

* **Semantic Search**: find documents, emails, or messages similar to a query
* **Image Retrieval**: search for visually similar images
* **Recommendation Systems**: match users with products, videos, or music
* **Voice and Audio Search**: match voice queries or environmental sounds
* **Anomaly Detection**: find outliers in real-time sensor data
* **Robotics**: localize spatial features or behaviors using embedded observations

In the AI era, embeddings are everywhere – from language models like GPT to vision transformers. Storing and searching them efficiently is the foundation of intelligent applications.

## Perfect for Edge AI

SQLite-Vector is designed with the **Edge AI** use case in mind:

* Runs offline – no internet required
* Works on mobile devices – iOS/Android friendly
* Keeps data local – ideal for privacy-focused apps
* Extremely fast – real-time performance on device

You can deploy powerful similarity search capabilities right inside your app or embedded system – **no cloud needed**.
