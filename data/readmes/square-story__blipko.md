### Know where your salary goes. Just chat.

**Blipko is a conversational personal-budget tracker on Telegram.** Log what you spend in plain language —
by text or voice, in English, Hindi, Hinglish, Malayalam, or Manglish — and Blipko sorts it into a 50/30/20
budget, tells you what's left, and answers questions about your money. No app to install. No forms. Just a chat.

## Why Blipko

Most months, the salary just… disappears. Traditional budgeting apps ask you to install something, open it,
tap through forms, and pick categories — so most people quit by week two.

Blipko removes every bit of that friction. You already have Telegram open. Type `chai 30` and it's logged,
categorized, and counted against your budget in under a second. The discipline of budgeting, with the effort
of texting a friend.

## How it works

```
You:   chai 30
Blipko: ✅ ₹30 → Wants · Food
        Wants left this cycle: ₹14,770 / ₹15,000

You:   🎤 (voice note) "auto eighty to office"
Blipko: ✅ ₹80 → Needs · Transport

You:   /status
Blipko: 📊 This cycle — Day 15 of 30
        🏠 Needs   ▓▓▓░░░░░░░  ₹12,500 / ₹25,000  (50%)
        🎯 Wants   ▓▓▓▓░░░░░░  ₹9,200 / ₹15,000   (61%)
        💰 Savings ▓░░░░░░░░░  ₹2,000 / ₹10,000   (20%)
        Safe daily spend left:  Needs ₹833/day · Wants ₹420/day

You:   can I afford a 4000 pair of shoes?
Blipko: You've got ₹5,800 left in Wants with 15 days to go, so ₹4,000 fits —
        but it leaves you ~₹120/day. Doable if you go easy on eating out.

You:   set aside 2000 for the Goa trip
Blipko: Ready to move ₹2,000 into your Goa trip box.

        ➡️ Add ₹2,000 to Goa trip
        [ ✅ Confirm ]  [ ✖️ Cancel ]
```

## Features

### 💬 Conversational capture
Log a spend the way you'd say it — `chai 30`, `auto 80 office`, `petrol 500 koduthu`, `netflix 199`. The AI
reads informal, code-mixed Indian languages (English / Hindi / Hinglish / Malayalam / Manglish), extracts the
amount, picks the category, and assigns a bucket. Send a **voice note** and it's transcribed and logged too.

### 🪣 Automatic 50/30/20 budgeting
Every spend lands in **Needs (50%)**, **Wants (30%)**, or **Savings (20%)** — the proven rule, fully
adjustable. Budgets run on a **payday-aware cycle** (set your payday; day 1 = calendar month), and your
effective income is `max(expected salary, income logged this cycle)` so salaried and variable-income users
both work.

### 🧭 Guided onboarding
A short wizard on the dashboard, not a form: enter your take-home income → tap the spending groups you
actually have (common ones pre-ticked) → Blipko auto-creates their subcategories with **income-based budget
suggestions** → choose how hard it should nudge you. Then tap **Connect Telegram** to link your chat, and
you're tracking.

### 🗂️ Category taxonomy with per-category limits
Seven parent groups (Essentials, Food & Drinks, Transportation, Entertainment & Leisure, Health & Wellness,
Miscellaneous, Savings) break down into leaf categories (Rent, Groceries, Eating Out, Fuel…). Each leaf can
carry a **monthly limit**, editable on the web or via chat.

### 🏦 Boxes — named savings goals
Set money aside in named funds — a trip, an emergency fund — and track progress toward a target. `add 5000 to
Goa trip`, or manage them on the dashboard. Savings stop being whatever's left over and become a thing with a
name and a finish line.

### 🤖 Ask anything
Beyond logging, Blipko answers free-form questions grounded in *your* real data via a tool-calling agent:

> "how much did I spend on food this month?" · "what's my biggest expense?" · "am I spending more than last month?"
> · "can I afford a 5000 phone?" · "what can you do?"

**The numbers aren't the model's.** Every amount is formatted and every comparison decided in code before the
AI ever sees it — affordability returns a yes/tight/no verdict, cycle comparisons return the delta and
direction, budget health returns a status. The AI picks which figures to look up; it doesn't do the arithmetic.
Empty results say *nothing was logged*, never "you spent ₹0", and anything the assistant states that didn't
come from a lookup is flagged in the logs.

It can also make changes — edit or delete a spend, set up a recurring rule, move money into a box — but it
only ever *proposes*. You get a one-line summary built from the actual rows it would touch, plus Confirm and
Cancel buttons. Nothing is written until you tap.

### 🔔 Reminders you control
Proactive nudges before you blow a bucket — but **opt-in by intensity**, default off:

| Dosage | What you get |
|---|---|
| **Off** | Nothing (default) |
| **Gentle** | 80% and over-budget warnings, once per cycle |
| **Aggressive** | + a 50% heads-up and a daily check-in |
| **Relentless** | Daily check-in and repeated over-budget alerts |

### 🔁 Recurring income & expenses
`rent 8000 on 1st every month` sets up a rule that auto-posts each cycle. Salary, subscriptions, EMIs — set
once, tracked forever.

### 📊 Web dashboard
Sign in with Google at **[blipko.lol](https://blipko.lol)** for the full picture: animated overview KPIs,
income-vs-spending and per-bucket trends, category breakdowns, a filterable transaction list (expenses +
income tabs, CSV export), category & per-category-limit editing, recurring management, and all your settings.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| Backend | Node.js + Express, TypeScript (strict, Clean Architecture) |
| Database | PostgreSQL via Prisma (hosted on Railway) |
| AI parsing | OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini` (primary) → Gemini 2.0 Flash (fallback), structured output |
| Assistant | Claude Sonnet 5 tool-calling loop over pre-computed data tools, opt-in via env; OpenAI function-calling otherwise |
| Voice | Sarvam AI transcription |
| Messaging | Telegram Bot API (webhook) |
| Scheduler | node-cron (recurring auto-post, nudges, pruning) |
| Web | Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19, NextAuth v5 (Google), Server Actions |
| Tests | Vitest (unit) + Playwright (API/E2E) |

---

## Architecture

Two runtimes share one `prisma/schema.prisma`. The backend follows Clean Architecture; the web app talks to
the DB directly through Server Actions (no REST layer between them).

```
blipko/                  ← Backend: Express + Prisma (TypeScript, CommonJS)
  src/
    domain/              ← Entities, repository & service interfaces (no outer imports)
    application/         ← Use cases + message processors (the business logic)
    data/                ← Prisma repositories, AI parsers, Telegram + Sarvam services
    presentation/        ← Express routes + Telegram webhook controller
  prisma/                ← Shared schema, migrations, seed
└── web/                 ← Frontend: Next.js dashboard (Server Actions)
```

**Message flow**

```
Telegram → TelegramWebhookController → ProcessIncomingMessageUseCase
  1. ensureUserExists (+ link Telegram ↔ web account)
  2. load recent conversation history
  3. pre-parse processors (no AI): button callbacks, /status, /report, /boxes,
     /recurring, /settings, /help, undo
  4. AI parse → ParsedData { intent, amount, category, bucket, confidence, … }
  5. a clear spend or income is logged on the fast path; anything else —
     a question, a correction, ambiguity — escalates to the assistant
```

Two lanes, on purpose. Logging `chai 30` should cost one cheap call and land in about a second, so it never
waits on a reasoning model. Everything conversational goes to the assistant, which has the user's real data in
front of it. With the assistant lane switched off, the deterministic intent processors handle those cases as
before.

Low-confidence parses ask you to confirm the bucket with inline buttons; assistant-proposed changes ask you to
confirm the change itself. Every Telegram message ID is recorded so duplicate deliveries are dropped.

## Local development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ and **pnpm**
- A PostgreSQL database URL
- Telegram bot token (from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))
- OpenAI and Gemini API keys (both required at boot)
- Optional: Sarvam key for voice notes, Anthropic key for the assistant lane

### 1 · Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/square-story/blipko.git
cd blipko
pnpm install
```

### 2 · Configure
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Required: DATABASE_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY,
#           TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET
# Optional: SARVAM_API_KEY (voice), WEB_APP_URL, PORT, CRON_SECRET
```

The bot exits at boot if a required key is blank — better than discovering it on the first message.

To turn on the **assistant lane** (Claude answers questions and can propose changes), set
`ASSISTANT_ENABLED=true` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Leave either unset and questions fall back to the OpenAI
agent, so a missing key degrades rather than breaking anything.

### 3 · Database
```bash
pnpm prisma:migrate     # apply migrations
pnpm prisma:generate    # generate the client
pnpm db:seed            # seed the system category taxonomy
```

### 4 · Run
```bash
pnpm dev                # backend (ts-node-dev) on $PORT
cd web && pnpm dev      # dashboard on :3000
```

### 5 · Point Telegram at your local bot
```bash
ngrok http <PORT>
WEBHOOK_URL=https://<your-ngrok>.ngrok.app pnpm webhook:set
# registers https://<ngrok>/api/webhooks/telegram with your secret token
```

The dashboard needs its own env — copy `web/.env.example` → `web/.env.local` and fill in `AUTH_SECRET`,
`AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`, and `DATABASE_URL`.

---

## Testing

```bash
pnpm test:unit          # Vitest unit tests (processors, budget math, agents)
pnpm test               # Playwright API/E2E suite (auto-starts the server)
pnpm lint               # ESLint
```

---

## Deployment

Deployed on **Railway** as two services (backend + Next.js web) plus a managed PostgreSQL instance, all on one
schema. The backend's pre-deploy step runs `prisma migrate deploy`; the web build syncs the shared schema
before generating its Prisma client. Live at **[blipko.lol](https://blipko.lol)**.

---

## Roadmap

- **Weekly habit tracking** — weekly budgets and urgency nudges for high-frequency habits (coffee, eating out)
  to break the "small daily dose" spend pattern.
