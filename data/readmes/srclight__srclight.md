**Deep code indexing for AI agents.** SQLite FTS5 + tree-sitter + embeddings + MCP.

Srclight builds a rich, searchable index of your codebase that AI coding agents can query instantly — replacing dozens of grep/glob calls with precise, structured lookups. It is the most comprehensive code intelligence MCP server available: 42 tools covering symbol search, relationship graphs, community detection, impact analysis, git change intelligence, semantic search, build system awareness, and document extraction — capabilities no other single MCP server combines. Fully local and private: your code never leaves your machine.

## Why?

AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) spend **40-60% of their tokens on orientation** — searching for files, reading code to understand structure, hunting for callers and callees. Srclight eliminates this waste.

| Without Srclight | With Srclight |
|---|---|
| 8-12 grep rounds to find callers | `get_callers("lookup")` — one call |
| Read 5 files to understand module | `codebase_map()` — instant overview |
| "Find code that does X" → 20 greps | `semantic_search("dictionary lookup")` — one call |
| Edit a function, break 47 callers | `detect_changes()` — shows blast radius before you commit |
| 15-25 tool calls per bug fix | 5-8 tool calls per bug fix |

## Features

- **Minimal dependencies** — single SQLite file per repo, no Docker/Redis/vector DB
- **Fully offline** — no API calls, works air-gapped (Ollama local embeddings)
- **Incremental** — only re-indexes changed files (content hash detection)
- **19 languages** — Python, C, C++, C#, Java, Kotlin, Swift, Dart, Go, Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Lua, Bash, SQL, Groovy, CMake, Markdown — include fragments (`.inc`, `.inl`, `.ipp`, `.tcc`) included, plus any extension you declare with `--ext`
- **Says what it skipped** — `index_status` names the extensions a run walked past, so an incomplete answer never reads as a complete one
- **10 document formats** — PDF, DOCX, XLSX, HTML, CSV/TSV, email (.eml), images (PNG/JPG/SVG/etc.), plain text, RST, Markdown
- **Optional OCR** — PaddleOCR for scanned/image-only PDF pages; pytesseract for images
- **4 search modes** — symbol names, source code (trigram), documentation (stemmed), semantic (embeddings)
- **Hybrid search** — RRF fusion of keyword + semantic results for best accuracy
- **Multi-repo workspaces** — search across all your repos simultaneously via SQLite ATTACH+UNION
- **MCP server** — works with Claude Code, Cursor, and any MCP client
- **CLI** — index, search, and inspect from the terminal
- **Auto-reindex** — git post-commit/post-checkout hooks keep indexes fresh

## MCP argument validation

Srclight's MCP server **refuses unknown tool arguments** instead of silently dropping them — a
mistyped filter like `projects=` (for `project=`) is rejected with an error, never answered as if
the constraint were applied. Every tool advertises `additionalProperties: false`. The guard is the
shared [`mcpkit`](https://github.com/srclight/mcpkit) policy, vendored as one hash-verified file
(`src/srclight/_mcpkit.py`).

**AI agents:** if a call returns `unknown argument(s): … running older code than you think …
reconnect`, the running server predates the argument you sent (a long-lived daemon serves the code
it launched with). Nothing ran — check the reported revision and reconnect the MCP; don't retry the
same call.

## Index freshness

Every symbol/graph result carries `index_freshness`: the short string
`"verified-fresh"` when the files behind the answer are byte-identical to what
was indexed, or a bounded object naming which files are `stale`, missing, or
not indexed. `check_freshness(paths?)` probes any paths — or the whole index —
on demand (unchanged files cost one `stat` each; never writes), and
`index_status` reports whole-index `checked`/`stale_count`.

**AI agents:** a result stamped stale describes the code **as indexed**, not as
it is now — reindex (`srclight index`) or read the live file before acting on
line numbers or bodies from it. `"verified-fresh"` is the affirmative signal;
its absence on a workspace-mode result means freshness was not checkable for
that result, never that it is fresh.

## Index coverage

`index_status` reports both sides of what an index holds: `indexed_extensions`,
every suffix it reads, and `unindexed_extensions`, the `{extension: file count}`
this repo holds that the last run walked past, plus `oversize_skipped` for files
refused on size and `failed_files` for files that could not be read or parsed. `list_projects` carries the same per
project, and `find_pattern` attaches the tally plus a note whenever it is
non-empty.

A gap means code that was never read, so the tally deliberately leaves out
what is skipped on purpose: ignored paths (binaries, vendored trees, `.git`)
in both the `git ls-files` and directory-walk modes, and inert suffixes —
config, data and manifests (`.json`, `.toml`, `.yml`, `.lock`, …) along with
suffixless files like `LICENSE` or `Dockerfile`. Every repo carries some of
those; counting them would leave the tally non-empty everywhere, put the
warning on every result and bury the extensions that genuinely hold unread
code. A document format this install cannot read for want of an extra
(`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.html`) IS counted — it is unread, and one
`pip install` away from being read. So is a source extension the ignore list
blocks anyway (`*.cmake` sits next to the build artefacts while cmake is a
language srclight parses), and a language whose tree-sitter grammar is not
installed — indexing those files would record them as read while they hold no
searchable symbol.

`truncated` on a `find_pattern` result means the page was cut short, and
nothing else. It has never described scan coverage: the search runs over
indexed symbols, so files the indexer never read cannot appear whatever it
says. A gap is now readable from the index instead of being discoverable only
by comparing a result to a `grep`.

Include fragments (`.inc`, `.inl`, `.ipp`, `.tcc`) — the files a project uses
to split an oversized translation unit, included at file scope and holding real
definitions — are indexed as source. `.inc` names an include convention rather
than a language, so its content decides: PHP, C++, else C.

For a house extension srclight does not know, declare it once:

```bash
srclight index --ext .zz=cpp          # repeatable; --ext none clears
srclight index --ext .inc=skip        # or: leave an extension unread
```

`skip` is the way out of the `.inc` sniff for a project that uses it for
Makefile or SQL fragments: those files then count as a declared gap rather than
being parsed as C.

The declaration is stored in the index, not the command line, so the git hooks'
flag-less reindexes keep reading those files.

**AI agents:** a non-empty `unindexed_extensions` means the answer you are
holding is not a whole-tree answer, whatever `truncated` says — cross-check
with `grep`, or have the extension declared. An empty one is the affirmative
signal.

## Graph resolution labels

Reference edges are built by name matching plus ranked evidence, and every
caller/callee edge carries a `resolution` label saying how its target was
chosen: `same_file` (the caller's own file defines the name), `unique_file`
(all same-named candidates live in one file), `import` (the caller's imports
single out one file), `same_dir`, or `name_only`. Names appearing only in
comments or strings never become edges.

**AI agents:** `name_only` means a **ranked candidate list** across same-named
symbols — read it as "one of these", not a confirmed link; verify with
`get_symbol` or a reference search before acting on it. The stronger labels
are safe to treat as resolved.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Git** (for change intelligence and auto-reindex hooks)
- **Ollama** (optional, for semantic search / embeddings) — [ollama.com](https://ollama.com)
- **NVIDIA GPU + cupy** (optional, for GPU-accelerated vector search)
- **Poppler** (optional, for PaddleOCR scanned-PDF support) — `apt install poppler-utils` / `brew install poppler`

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install srclight

# Install from source
git clone https://github.com/srclight/srclight.git
cd srclight
pip install -e .

# Optional: document format support (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, HTML, images)
pip install 'srclight[docs,pdf]'

# Optional: OCR for scanned PDFs (also needs poppler-utils on your system)
pip install 'srclight[pdf,paddleocr]'

# Optional: OCR for images (needs tesseract on your system)
pip install 'srclight[docs,ocr]'

# Optional: GPU-accelerated vector search (requires CUDA 12.x)
pip install 'srclight[gpu]'

# Everything (docs + pdf + ocr + paddleocr + gpu)
pip install 'srclight[all]'

# Index your project
cd /path/to/your/project
srclight index

# Index with embeddings (requires Ollama running)
srclight index --embed qwen3-embedding

# Read an extra extension as a known language (recorded in the index)
srclight index --ext .inc=cpp

# Search
srclight search "lookup"
srclight search --kind function "parse"
srclight symbols src/main.py

# Start MCP server (for Claude Code / Cursor)
srclight serve
```

> **Note:** `srclight index` keeps `.srclight/` out of git through the repo's local `.git/info/exclude` (it never edits your tracked `.gitignore`). Index databases and embedding files can be large and should never be committed.

### Running tools from the shell

Every MCP tool is reachable from the CLI, which is how an agent with a
sandbox can query the index without the answer ever entering its context:

```bash
srclight tool --list                    # every tool and what it does
srclight tool find_pattern --help       # arguments, from the tool's own schema
srclight tool find_pattern --pattern 'this->timer' --kind function --limit 80
```

Output is the tool's JSON on stdout and nothing else, so it pipes. Exit codes
are 0 on success, 1 when the tool reports an error, 2 on a usage error — a
usage error writes nothing to stdout and says why on stderr.

The command reads the server's own tool registry, so it always matches the
tools your MCP client sees — and a tool renamed on the MCP side is renamed
here too.

## Semantic Search (Embeddings)

Srclight supports embedding-based semantic search for natural language queries like "find code that handles authentication" or "where is the database connection pool".

### Setup

```bash
# Install Ollama (https://ollama.com)
# Pull an embedding model
ollama pull qwen3-embedding       # Best quality (8B params, needs ~6GB VRAM)
ollama pull nomic-embed-text      # Lighter alternative (137M params)

# Index with embeddings
srclight index --embed qwen3-embedding

# Or index workspace with embeddings
srclight workspace index -w myworkspace --embed qwen3-embedding
```

### Choosing the Model Once

`--embed` only has to be passed once per index. The index records the model
and every later run reuses it — including the flag-less `srclight index .`
the git hooks run on each commit, and the MCP `reindex` tool. Without that,
every symbol added after the first run stays unembedded until someone
remembers the flag.

```bash
srclight index --embed qwen3-embedding   # first run: records the model
srclight index                           # later runs: reuse it, no flag
```

The recorded name is provider-qualified, so the second run reports
`Embedding model: ollama:qwen3-embedding (from the existing index)`.

For indexes that have **no** model recorded yet, `SRCLIGHT_EMBED_MODEL`
supplies one:

```bash
export SRCLIGHT_EMBED_MODEL=qwen3-embedding
srclight index                           # a fresh index embeds with it
```

Resolution order is `--embed` > the model recorded in the index >
`SRCLIGHT_EMBED_MODEL`. The variable comes last on purpose: it is a default
for new indexes, never an override. Ahead of the recorded model, exporting
it once would make the next commit in an unrelated repo re-embed every
symbol it holds, silently, from a background hook. Switching an existing
index stays an explicit `--embed`.

Two escape hatches:

```bash
srclight index --no-embed             # skip embedding for this run only
srclight index --forget-embed-model   # stop embedding this index for good
```

`--forget-embed-model` is the off switch for the hooks, whose command line
is fixed: after it, commits index without ever calling the embedding model,
until you pass `--embed` again. Over MCP, `reindex(embed=False)` is the
per-call equivalent of `--no-embed`.

Note that skipping is not free. Reindexing a changed file drops the
embeddings of the symbols it replaces, and a skipped pass does not put them
back — semantic coverage decays on exactly the files being edited. Ask
`embedding_status()` what an index will do: `configured_model` is the model
the next flag-less run resolves to — the whole chain, environment variable
included — and null means it will not embed. Single-repo mode only: in a
workspace each project records its own, so the field is not reported.

### How It Works

1. Each symbol's name + signature + docstring + content is embedded as a float vector
2. Vectors are stored as BLOBs in `symbol_embeddings` table (SQLite)
3. After indexing, a `.npy` sidecar snapshot is built and loaded to **GPU VRAM** (cupy) or CPU RAM (numpy) for fast search
4. `semantic_search(query)` embeds the query and runs cosine similarity against the GPU-resident matrix (~3ms for 27K vectors on a modern GPU)
5. `hybrid_search(query)` combines FTS5 keyword results + embedding results via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)

### Embedding Providers

| Provider | Model | Quality | Local? | Notes |
|----------|-------|---------|--------|-------|
| **Ollama** (default) | `qwen3-embedding` | Best local | Yes | Needs ~6GB VRAM |
| Ollama | `nomic-embed-text` | Good | Yes | Lighter, works on 8GB VRAM |
| **Voyage AI** (API) | `voyage-code-3` | Best overall | No | Requires `VOYAGE_API_KEY` |

```bash
# Use Voyage Code 3 (API, highest quality)
VOYAGE_API_KEY=your-key srclight index --embed voyage-code-3
```

### Storage

Embeddings are stored in `symbol_embeddings` table in `.srclight/index.db`. After indexing, a `.npy` sidecar snapshot is built for fast GPU loading:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.db` | Write path — per-symbol CRUD during indexing |
| `embeddings.npy` | Read path — contiguous float32 matrix for GPU/CPU search |
| `embeddings_norms.npy` | Pre-computed row norms (avoids recomputation per query) |
| `embeddings_meta.json` | Symbol ID mapping, model info, version for cache invalidation |

For ~27K symbols at 4096 dims (qwen3-embedding), that's ~428 MB on disk, ~450 MB in VRAM. Incremental: only re-embeds symbols whose content changed; sidecar rebuilt after each indexing run.

## Multi-Repo Workspaces

Search across multiple repos simultaneously. Each repo keeps its own `.srclight/index.db`; at query time, srclight ATTACHes them all and UNIONs across schemas.

```bash
# Create a workspace
srclight workspace init myworkspace

# Add repos
srclight workspace add /path/to/repo1 -w myworkspace
srclight workspace add /path/to/repo2 -w myworkspace -n custom-name

# Index all repos (with optional embeddings)
srclight workspace index -w myworkspace
srclight workspace index -w myworkspace --embed qwen3-embedding

# Search across all repos
srclight workspace search "Dictionary" -w myworkspace
srclight workspace search "Dictionary" -w myworkspace --project repo1

# Status
srclight workspace status -w myworkspace
srclight workspace list

# Start MCP server in workspace mode
srclight serve --workspace myworkspace
```

**Git submodules** are not indexed automatically — `git ls-files` does not recurse into them. To index a submodule, clone it separately and add it as its own workspace project. See [docs/usage-guide.md](docs/usage-guide.md#git-submodules) for details.

## MCP Integration

Srclight supports two transport modes: **stdio** (one server per session) and **SSE** (persistent server, multiple sessions). SSE is recommended for workspaces.

### Claude Code

**Stdio (simplest — one server per session):**
```bash
# Single repo
claude mcp add srclight -- srclight serve

# Workspace mode
claude mcp add srclight -- srclight serve --workspace myworkspace

# Make it available in all projects (user scope)
claude mcp add --scope user srclight -- srclight serve --workspace myworkspace
```

**SSE (persistent server — recommended for workspaces):**

Run srclight as a long-lived server, then point Claude Code at it:

```bash
# Start the server (default: http://127.0.0.1:8742/sse)
srclight serve --workspace myworkspace &

# Or install as a systemd user service (Linux/WSL)
# See docs/usage-guide.md for the service file

# Connect Claude Code to the running server
claude mcp add --transport sse srclight http://127.0.0.1:8742/sse
```

SSE mode supports multiple concurrent sessions and survives Claude Code restarts.

### Cursor

**SSE (recommended):** Run srclight once, then connect Cursor to it. Best for responsiveness and no cold-start per session.

Start the server: `srclight serve --workspace myworkspace` (default SSE on port 8742).

- **UI:** Settings → Tools & MCP → Add new MCP server → Type: `streamableHttp`, URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8742/sse`.
- **JSON** (project `.cursor/mcp.json` or global `~/.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
"srclight": {
  "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8742/sse"
}
```

**Stdio (alternative):** One server process per Cursor session.

- **UI:** Type: `command`, Command: `srclight`, Args: `serve --workspace myworkspace` (or `serve` for single-repo).
- **JSON:**

```json
"srclight": {
  "command": "srclight",
  "args": ["serve", "--workspace", "myworkspace"]
}
```

For single-repo: `"args": ["serve"]`. Restart Cursor completely after adding the server.

**Verify:** In Cursor chat, ask "What projects are in the srclight workspace?" or "List srclight tools" — the agent should call `list_projects()` or show srclight tools.

### OpenClaw

OpenClaw connects to srclight via [mcporter](https://mcporter.dev), its built-in MCP tool server CLI.

```bash
# 1. Add srclight to mcporter's home config
mcporter config add srclight http://127.0.0.1:8742/sse \
  --transport sse --scope home \
  --description "Srclight deep code indexing"

# 2. Verify the connection
mcporter call srclight.list_projects

# 3. Restart the OpenClaw gateway to pick up the new server
systemctl --user restart openclaw-gateway  # if using systemd
# or: openclaw daemon restart
```

The OpenClaw agent can then use srclight tools via the `mcporter` skill:
```
mcporter call srclight.search_symbols query="my_function"
mcporter call srclight.get_callers symbol_name="MyClass" project="my-repo"
mcporter call srclight.hybrid_search query="authentication logic"
```

> **Prerequisite:** Srclight must be running as an SSE server (see above). OpenClaw's mcporter connects over HTTP — stdio mode is not supported.

### Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "srclight": {
      "command": "srclight",
      "args": ["serve", "--workspace", "myworkspace"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Any MCP Client (SSE)

Any MCP-compatible client can connect to the SSE endpoint:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8742/sse
```

## MCP Tools (43)

Srclight exposes 43 MCP tools organized in eight tiers. The MCP server includes built-in instructions that guide AI agents on which tool to use and when — agents receive a session protocol, tool selection guide, and `project` parameter documentation automatically on connection.

### Tier 1: Instant Orientation
| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `codebase_map()` | Full project overview — call first every session |
| `search_symbols(query)` | Search across symbol names, code, and docs |
| `get_symbol(name)` | Full source code + metadata for a symbol |
| `get_signature(name)` | Just the signature (lightweight) |
| `symbols_in_file(path)` | Table of contents for a file |
| `find_pattern(pattern, limit, offset)` | Regex search inside symbol bodies; says when it truncated |
| `list_projects()` | All projects in workspace with stats |

### Tier 2: Relationship Graph
| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `get_callers(name)` | Who calls this symbol? |
| `get_callees(name)` | What does this symbol call? |
| `get_dependents(name, transitive)` | Blast radius — what breaks if I change this? |
| `get_implementors(interface)` | All classes implementing an interface |
| `get_tests_for(name)` | Test functions covering a symbol |
| `get_type_hierarchy(name)` | Inheritance tree (base classes + subclasses) |
| `find_imports(path)` | Import statements in a file, resolved to indexed files |
| `find_dead_code(kind)` | Symbols nothing calls or references |

### Tier 2b: Community & Impact Analysis
| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `get_communities(project)` | Auto-detected functional module clusters (Louvain algorithm) |
| `get_community(name, project)` | Which community a symbol belongs to, with all co-members |
| `get_execution_flows(project)` | Traced execution paths from entry points through the call graph |
| `get_impact(name, project)` | Blast radius + risk level (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL) |
| `detect_changes(project, ref?)` | Map git diff to affected symbols — aggregate blast radius of your edits |

### Tier 3: Git Change Intelligence
| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `blame_symbol(name)` | Who changed this, when, and why |
| `recent_changes(n)` | Commit feed (cross-project in workspace) |
| `git_hotspots(n, since)` | Most frequently changed files (bug magnets) |
| `whats_changed()` | Uncommitted work in progress |
| `changes_to(name)` | Commit history for a symbol's file |

### Tier 4: Build & Config
| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `get_build_targets()` | CMake/.csproj/npm targets with dependencies |
| `get_platform_variants(name)` | #ifdef platform guards around a symbol |
| `platform_conditionals()` | All platform-conditional code blocks |

### Tier 5: Semantic Search (Embeddings)
| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `semantic_search(query)` | Find code by meaning (natural language) |
| `hybrid_search(query)` | Best of both: keyword + semantic with RRF fusion |
| `embedding_status()` | Embedding coverage and model info |

### Tier 6: Meta & Server
| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `index_status()` | Index freshness and stats |
| `check_freshness(paths)` | Is the index current for these files, or for all of them? |
| `show_status(message)` | Show the srclight dashboard window and return current status |
| `reindex(embed=True)` | Trigger incremental re-index; `embed=False` skips the embedding pass (and lets semantic coverage decay) |
| `embedding_health()` | Check if the embedding provider (Ollama, etc.) is reachable |
| `setup_guide()` | Structured setup instructions for agents and users |
| `server_stats()` | Server uptime and process info |
| `restart_server()` | Request server restart (SSE only) |

### Tier 7: Learnings & Session Memory
| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `record_learning(kind, content)` | Record a decision, correction, discovery, pattern, blocker or convention |
| `relevant_learnings(query)` | Find recorded learnings by keyword + semantic search |
| `learning_stats(days)` | Counts by kind over time |
| `conversation_summary(session_id, task_summary)` | Record what a session did, with token and cost figures |

In workspace mode, `search_symbols`, `get_symbol`, `codebase_map`, and `hybrid_search` accept an optional `project` filter. Graph/git/build/community tools require `project` in workspace mode.

## Strict Argument Validation

**Since v0.20.2, srclight refuses unknown tool arguments instead of silently discarding them.**
This is a deliberate behaviour change and it can break callers that were previously sending extra
keys without noticing.

### Why

The MCP Python SDK's FastMCP drops arguments that are not in a tool's signature, and it does so
*before* the tool function runs. Combined with an `inputSchema` that omitted
`additionalProperties: false`, a mistyped argument produced a confident wrong answer rather than an
error. Measured on this server:

```
search_symbols(query="main", project="project-a")    ->  20 hits, all from project-a
search_symbols(query="main", projects="project-a")   ->  20 hits, ZERO from project-a
                                                         (19 from "project-b", 1 from "project-c")
```

One added letter. No error, identical hit count, identical result shape, real symbols — from repos
the caller never asked about. That is not a lossy call, it is a wrong one, and the caller has no
way to learn their filter was ignored.

### What changed

- **Unknown arguments now return an error** naming the offending key, the accepted set, and stating
  that nothing was executed. The tool body is never entered.
- **Every tool advertises `additionalProperties: false`** in `tools/list`, so the catalog matches
  what the runtime enforces. Previously the runtime and the advertised schema disagreed.
- **Zero-parameter tools are closed too** (`index_status`, `codebase_map`, and three others). An
  empty property set means "this tool takes no arguments", not "anything goes".

### Scope: top-level arguments

This validates the **top-level** argument object. An argument that is itself a structured object is
validated by its own model, which this layer does not descend into. No srclight tool currently takes
an object argument, so the distinction is not reachable here today — but the guarantee is
"top-level", and a future tool taking a typed nested model would need `extra="forbid"` on that model
to get the same protection.

### If this breaks your caller

The error names exactly what it received and what the tool accepts:

```
unknown argument(s): projects. Tool 'search_symbols' accepts: kind, limit, project, query.
Nothing was executed and no result was computed.
```

Fix the argument name. If you believe the argument *should* exist, the server may be running older
code than you expect — check its reported revision and reconnect.

**If you cannot update your caller right now**, pin the previous behaviour and update when you can:

```
pip install "srclight<0.20.2"
```

That is a deliberate escape hatch, not an endorsement — the older versions still return wrong
answers for mistyped filters, silently. Prefer fixing the argument name.

### For contributors

The policy lives in `src/srclight/_mcpkit.py`, a **generated single-file build** of
[mcpkit](https://github.com/srclight/mcpkit), shared across this estate's MCP servers so one policy
is not reimplemented per repo. **Do not hand-edit it** — it carries a `sha256` of its own body and
a verifier will reject a modified copy.

```bash
python -m mcpkit.vendor --out src/srclight/_mcpkit.py    # regenerate from upstream
python -m mcpkit.vendor --check src/srclight/_mcpkit.py  # verify it is unmodified
```

It adds **no runtime dependency** — the file is vendored, not installed, so `pip install srclight`
is unaffected. mcpkit is only needed to regenerate it.

`tests/test_strict_args.py` is a smoke test asserting that `srclight.server.mcp` *itself* enforces
the policy — not a freshly constructed lookalike. If `server.py` were reverted to a bare `FastMCP`
while `_mcpkit.py` sat unused in the tree, that test is the only one that would fail.

## Deployment Guide

See **[docs/usage-guide.md](docs/usage-guide.md)** for the full deployment and usage guide, including:
- Setting up srclight as a global MCP server for Claude Code
- Adding/removing repos from workspaces
- What happens on commits and branch switches
- Re-embedding workflows
- Troubleshooting

## Auto-Reindex (Git Hook)

Keep indexes fresh automatically:

```bash
# Install post-commit + post-checkout hooks in current repo
srclight hook install

# Install across all repos in a workspace
srclight hook install --workspace myworkspace

# Remove hooks
srclight hook uninstall
```

The hooks run `srclight index` in the background after each commit and branch switch. On a repo whose index has a recorded embedding model, that refreshes embeddings too — see [Choosing the Model Once](#choosing-the-model-once) for the off switch.

## How It Works

1. **tree-sitter** parses every source file into an AST
2. **Document extractors** handle non-code files (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, HTML, CSV, images, email, text) — extracting headings, tables, pages, and metadata as searchable symbols. Scanned PDF pages are optionally OCR'd via PaddleOCR.
3. Symbols (functions, classes, methods, structs, etc.) are extracted with full metadata
4. Three **SQLite FTS5** indexes are built with different tokenization strategies:
   - **Names**: code-aware tokenization (splits `camelCase`, handles `::`, `->`)
   - **Content**: trigram index for substring matching
   - **Docs**: Porter stemming for natural language in docstrings
5. **Community detection** clusters symbols into functional modules via Louvain algorithm on call-graph edges, with TF-IDF auto-labeling
6. **Execution flows** are traced via BFS from entry points, and **impact analysis** scores each symbol's blast radius (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)
7. Optional: **embedding vectors** are generated via Ollama or Voyage API and stored as BLOBs
8. A `.npy` **sidecar snapshot** is built and loaded to **GPU VRAM** (cupy) or CPU RAM (numpy) for fast search
9. The **MCP server** exposes structured query tools that AI agents call instead of grep
10. **Hybrid search** merges keyword (FTS5) and semantic (embedding) results via RRF

### Architecture (Workspace Mode)

```
repo1/.srclight/index.db  ──┐
repo2/.srclight/index.db  ──┼── ATTACH ──→ :memory: ──→ UNION ALL queries
repo3/.srclight/index.db  ──┘
```

Each repo is indexed independently. At query time, SQLite's ATTACH mechanism joins them into a single searchable namespace. Handles >10 repos via automatic batching (SQLite's ATTACH limit).

## How Srclight Compares

A survey of 50+ MCP code intelligence servers across all major registries (Official MCP Registry, Smithery, Glama, mcp.so, awesome-mcp-servers) found that no other single server combines srclight's full capabilities:

| Capability | srclight | grep/glob (default) | CodeMCP (SCIP) | Claude Context (Zilliz) |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Symbol search (FTS5) | 3 indexes (name, content, docs) | None | SCIP-based | BM25 |
| Semantic search (embeddings) | GPU-accelerated, ~3ms | None | None | OpenAI API + Milvus |
| Hybrid search (keyword + semantic) | RRF fusion | None | None | BM25 + vector |
| Relationship graph (callers, callees) | tree-sitter edges | None | SCIP edges | None |
| Community detection (module clusters) | Louvain on call graph | None | None | None |
| Impact analysis (blast radius + risk) | Per-symbol + diff-level | None | None | None |
| Git change intelligence | blame, hotspots, WIP, detect_changes | None | None | None |
| Build system awareness | CMake, .csproj, #ifdef | None | None | None |
| Multi-repo workspace | ATTACH+UNION | None | None | None |
| Infrastructure required | `pip install`, SQLite | None | SCIP indexer | Docker, Milvus, OpenAI API |
| Fully local / private | Yes, zero API calls | Yes | Yes | No (needs OpenAI) |
| Languages | 19 | Any (regex) | 5 (SCIP) | Any (chunking) |
| MCP tools | 43 | 2 (grep, glob) | 80+ | ~10 |

Unlike grep-based tools, srclight builds a persistent index with structured lookups. Unlike cloud-based solutions, everything runs locally — your code never leaves your machine. Unlike IDE plugins, srclight works with any MCP client.

## Roadmap

### Done
- [x] Symbol intelligence + 3x FTS5 search
- [x] Relationship graph: callers, callees, hierarchy
- [x] Blast radius, test discovery, implementors
- [x] Git change intelligence: blame, hotspots, recent changes
- [x] Build system awareness: CMake, .csproj, platform conditionals
- [x] Semantic search: embeddings via Ollama/Voyage, hybrid RRF
- [x] GPU-accelerated vector search: `.npy` sidecar, cupy/numpy vectorized math
- [x] Multi-repo workspaces (ATTACH+UNION)
- [x] Auto-reindex git hooks (post-commit + post-checkout)
- [x] Document extraction: PDF, DOCX, XLSX, HTML, CSV, email, images, text (heading detection, tables, metadata)
- [x] Optional OCR: PaddleOCR for scanned PDFs, pytesseract for images
- [x] MCP agent guidance: comprehensive instructions, tool selection guide, session protocol
- [x] Workspace config hot-reload (no server restart needed to add repos)
- [x] VectorCache sidecar re-discovery (no restart needed after embedding)
- [x] Project name suggestions in error messages
- [x] Community detection: Louvain clustering on call-graph edges with TF-IDF auto-labeling
- [x] Execution flow tracing: BFS from entry points across community boundaries
- [x] Impact analysis: per-symbol blast radius with risk scoring (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)
- [x] `detect_changes`: map git diff to affected symbols and aggregate blast radius

### Next
- [ ] Cross-language concept mapping (explicit edges between equivalent symbols across languages)
- [ ] Pattern intelligence (convention detection, coding pattern extraction)
- [ ] AI pre-computation (symbol summaries via cheap LLM)
