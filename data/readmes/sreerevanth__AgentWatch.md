**AI agents are prone to silent failures, hallucinated tool parameters, and unintended side effects.**
**AgentWatch acts as an active, pre-execution guardrail — auditing reasoning and blocking risky actions before they hit your production stack.**

> **Branch `architecture/v3`: AgentWatch v3.** This branch rebuilds AgentWatch as a *passive instrument*. It reconstructs, compares, replays and explains the behaviour of AI-native systems from immutable runtime evidence, and it does not block or control them.

> ```bash
> agentwatch observe python examples/research_system.py   # record a program
> agentwatch inspect latest                                 # reconstructed execution
> agentwatch provenance report.md --run latest              # evidence lineage
> agentwatch compare latest~1 latest                        # earliest divergence

Most analysis features are EXPERIMENTAL; `agentwatch status` shows each capability's maturity. The v0.2 guardrail features described below remain available during migration.

## The Problem Nobody Is Solving

```
Agent runs.
Output looks correct.
Database is corrupted.
You find out 3 hours later when a customer complains.
```

**1 in 20 AI agent requests fail silently in production.**

Current observability tools — Langfuse, Phoenix, Datadog — tell you *what happened* **after** it happened. By then the damage is done.

The real problem: **an agent that confidently fails is indistinguishable from an agent that correctly succeeds** — unless you have a layer watching the *reasoning*, not just the output.

That layer didn't exist. **Until now.**

| The cost of silent failure | |
|---|---|
| **1 in 20** | agent requests fail silently |
| **40%** | of enterprise AI projects cancelled by 2027 *(Gartner)* |
| **76%** | of agent deployments fail within 90 days |

---

## 💡 How It Works

AgentWatch sits **between your agent and the world**, intercepting every action *before* it executes.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["🤖 Your Agent"] --> AW

    subgraph AW["🛡️ AgentWatch"]
        direction TB

        S3["3 . Block<br/>dangerous actions pre-execution"]
        S1 --> S2 --> S3
    end

    AW -->|"✅ allowed"| W["🌍 The World<br/>tools · APIs · databases"]

    style W fill:#1e293b,stroke:#3ecf8e,color:#fff
    style X fill:#3b1212,stroke:#ef4444,color:#fff
```

**The key insight:** an agent scoring its own reasoning is structurally biased toward overconfidence. It almost always thinks it did well — even when it didn't.

AgentWatch deploys a **second model**, architecturally separate, with no access to the agent's own reasoning trace. Its only job: **find failure before the next action fires.**

## 🏗️ Architecture

AgentWatch is built as a layered system — adapters feed a normalized event stream into the core engine, which fans out to safety, reasoning, rollback, and observability subsystems.

### CLI Architecture
* All shell commands executed by the CLI are routed through a secure, validated wrapper located in `agentwatch/cli/_utils` to prevent injection vulnerabilities.

## 🔐 Security Pipeline

Every `TOOL_CALL` event runs the full gauntlet before it is ever allowed to touch the outside world. Blocking happens **pre-execution** — not as a post-hoc log entry.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    EV["📥 TOOL_CALL event"] --> CHK{"event is<br/>a tool call?"}
    CHK -->|no| PASS["↩️ pass through unchanged"]
    CHK -->|yes| AUDIT["🧠 Reasoning audit<br/>confidence score 0.0 – 1.0"]

    AUDIT --> MATCH["🔍 Pattern match<br/>40+ risk patterns"]
    MATCH --> NORM["🧹 Intent normalizers<br/>rm · disk · perms · RCE pipe"]
    NORM --> BLAST["💥 Blast-radius estimate"]

    BLAST --> DECIDE{"policy<br/>decision"}
    DECIDE -->|block| BLOCK["⛔ BLOCKED<br/>status set · alert fired"]
    DECIDE -->|approval| HITL{"human<br/>approves?"}
    DECIDE -->|allow| ALLOW["✅ ALLOWED<br/>action proceeds"]

    HITL -->|yes| ALLOW
    HITL -->|no / no callback| BLOCK

    style EV fill:#1e293b,stroke:#3ecf8e,color:#fff
    style BLOCK fill:#3b1212,stroke:#ef4444,color:#fff
    style ALLOW fill:#0f2a18,stroke:#3ecf8e,color:#fff
    style HITL fill:#2a230f,stroke:#eab308,color:#fff
```

**Blocked by default:** `rm -rf /` · `curl | bash` · disk formatting · credential exfiltration · `DROP TABLE` · mass deletion · privilege escalation · **40+ additional critical patterns.**

The intent normalizers are what make this robust — they catch bypass attempts the naive regex misses: split flags (`rm -r -f /`), long-form flags (`rm --recursive --force /`), and reordered fetch-then-interpret RCE chains.

---

## 🔄 Reasoning Audit Sequence

The independent auditor scores each step *before* the action runs. A drop below threshold holds the next action and fires an alert — it is never logged after the fact.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent
    participant AgentWatch
    participant Auditor as Independent Auditor
    participant World as Tools / APIs / DB

    Agent->>AgentWatch: emit reasoning step + tool call
    AgentWatch->>Auditor: score_step(step)
    Auditor-->>AgentWatch: confidence · hallucination risk · goal drift

    alt confidence below threshold
        AgentWatch--xAgent: HOLD action + fire alert
        Note over AgentWatch: human decides next move
    else confidence ok
        AgentWatch->>World: action proceeds
        World-->>Agent: result
        AgentWatch->>AgentWatch: checkpoint for rollback
    end
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install agentwatch-ai

# Configure environment variables (optional)
# Copy the template and edit it to set custom DB passwords, API keys, etc.
cp .env.example .env

# Start the dashboard
docker compose up -d

# Wrap your agent
agentwatch watch "Build me a REST API"
```

**Dashboard** → http://localhost:3000
**API Docs** → http://localhost:8000/docs

That's it. Zero config for default settings, or customize via the [.env.example](.env.example) file. Real data immediately.

## 🔌 Supported Frameworks

AgentWatch wraps your existing agent. **You change nothing.** Detailed guides for each framework live in the [`docs/adapters/`](docs/adapters/) directory.

| Framework | Adapter | Framework | Adapter |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🦜 **LangChain** | ✅ | 🔗 **LangGraph** | ✅ |
| 👥 **CrewAI** | ✅ | 🤖 **AutoGen** | ✅ |
| ⚡ **AutoGPT** | ✅ | 🧩 **smolagents** | ✅ |
| 🖥️ **Claude Code** | ✅ | 🌐 **Universal one-liner** | ✅ |

---

## ✨ Core Features

### 🧠 Reasoning Auditor
*The feature nobody else has built.*

```python
from agentwatch.reasoning.auditor import ReasoningAuditor

auditor = ReasoningAuditor()
audit = await auditor.audit_step(step.step_number, step)

print(audit.score)        # 0.0 – 1.0 confidence in the step
print(audit.rationale)    # why the auditor scored it this way
```

When the score drops below your threshold, the next action is **held — not logged after the fact.** An alert fires. You decide what happens next.

### 🛡️ Safety Engine

```python
from agentwatch.core.safety import SafetyEngine
from agentwatch.core.schema import ExecutionStatus

engine = SafetyEngine()
checked = await engine.check_event(event)

if checked.status == ExecutionStatus.BLOCKED:
    print(f"Blocked: {checked.safety.reasons}")
    print(f"Risk level: {checked.safety.risk_level.value}")
```

Blocks **40+ dangerous patterns pre-execution**, not post-hoc logging.

### 🔒 Secure Subprocess Wrapper

To prevent command-injection risks when invoking external utilities in CLI extensions or scripts, use the central secure command execution utility:

```python
from agentwatch.cli._utils import run, CommandError

try:
    # Runs securely (shell=False) with strict argument character whitelisting
    result = run(["echo", "hello world"])
    print(result.stdout)
except CommandError as exc:
    print(f"Command execution failed: {exc}")
```


### ⏪ One-Click Rollback

```bash
agentwatch rollback <session-id> --to-step 12
```

Every step is a **git-backed filesystem snapshot.** Irreversible actions become reversible. Click rollback in the dashboard or use the CLI.

### 📊 Live Dashboard
Real-time WebSocket stream of every action your agent takes. Confidence meter updating per step. Colour-coded by span type. No polling. No refresh.

### 💾 Persistent Memory
Cross-session episodic, semantic, and procedural memory backed by a causal graph. Your agent remembers what it decided and *why* — across restarts, across sessions.

### 💰 Cost Intelligence
Per-session token budget with hard stop. Real-time spend tracking. Alerts at 80%. Blocks at 100%. Prevents runaway agents from bankrupting you overnight.

### 🔔 Alerting
Slack + PagerDuty when confidence drops or actions are blocked. Every alert contains full context — not just "something failed."

## 🤝 How AgentWatch Fits Into Your Stack

AgentWatch is designed to run alongside and complement your existing tracing and observability tools rather than replace them. 

While platforms like **Langfuse**, **Phoenix**, and **Datadog** are excellent at post-hoc tracing, logging, and performance metrics, AgentWatch focuses specifically on **pre-execution guardrails and runtime safety interventions**.

Here is how AgentWatch complements your monitoring stack:

| Capability | AgentWatch (Pre-Execution Safety) | Langfuse / Phoenix (Post-Hoc Tracing) | Datadog (APM & Metrics) |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Primary Goal** | **Prevent damage** (Block/Hold/Veto) | **Debug & Optimize** (Trace/Analyze) | **System Health** (Metrics/Logs) |
| Pre-execution blocking | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Independent reasoning auditor | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Git-backed state rollback | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Inter-agent causal DAG | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Cross-session memory | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Goal drift & Hallucination veto | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Detailed execution traces | ⚠️ *(Minimal)* | ✅ *(Deep & Comprehensive)* | ⚠️ *(Generic Logs)* |
| User feedback & evaluation loops | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Infrastructure & APM metrics | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

---

## 🧱 Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| **Backend** | FastAPI · PostgreSQL · Redis · Celery |
| **Frontend** | Next.js · Tailwind · Recharts · WebSockets |
| **Infra** | Docker Compose · GitHub Actions CI |

### Local Backend Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sreerevanth/AgentWatch
cd AgentWatch
docker compose up -d
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/
```

### Local Frontend Dashboard Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dashboard will be live at `http://localhost:3000`.

Every PR to `main` is automatically tested by the **test-on-pr** workflow, which runs the suite with coverage and posts the results as a PR comment.

---

## 📦 Release Process

Releases publish to PyPI automatically via the **publish-pypi** workflow whenever a version tag is pushed:

```bash
# Bump [project].version in pyproject.toml to match the tag first, then:
git tag v0.X.Y
git push origin v0.X.Y
# PyPI publishes automatically.
```

On a `v*` tag the workflow verifies the tag matches `pyproject.toml` (failing fast on a mismatch), builds the wheel + sdist, runs `twine check`, uploads with `twine`, and creates a GitHub Release titled **AgentWatch v0.X.Y** — notes pulled from `CHANGELOG.md`, with the `.whl` and `.tar.gz` attached.

### One-time setup — add the PyPI token

The upload step authenticates with a PyPI API token stored as a GitHub secret named `PYPI_TOKEN`:

1. Create a token at pypi.org → Account settings → API tokens (scope it to this project).
2. In the repo: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret.
3. Name it `PYPI_TOKEN` and paste your `pypi-...` token as the value.
