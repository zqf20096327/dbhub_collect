# TiDB Cloud Self-Service PoV Kit

A fully automated Proof of Value toolkit for TiDB Cloud. Spin up a cluster,
edit one config file, and run a single command - the kit handles the rest and
produces a professional PDF report with:
- a buyer-facing decision summary
- exact test scope and environment context
- module evidence charts for executed modules only
- SQL compatibility fix index
- KPI appendix and 3-year TCO comparison

---

## What it tests

| Module | What it proves |
|--------|---------------|
| M0 - Customer Query Validation | Your SQL queries run on TiDB without changes |
| M1 - Baseline OLTP Performance | Raw throughput and latency under concurrent load, including pre-warm, warm steady-state, and dedicated point-get lookup phase |
| M2 - Elastic Auto-Scaling | TiDB Cloud adds capacity automatically; p99 stays flat |
| M3 - High Availability | Sub-30s RTO after a node failure with zero manual intervention |
| M3b - Write Contention | AUTO_RANDOM eliminates hot-region bottlenecks vs AUTO_INCREMENT |
| M4 - HTAP Concurrent | Analytics run on TiFlash without degrading OLTP on TiKV |
| M5 - Online DDL | Schema changes complete with zero application downtime |
| M6 - SQL Compatibility | TiDB SQL compatibility checks + source unsupported-feature inventory (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server) |
| M7 - Data Import | Bulk load throughput: IMPORT INTO vs LOAD DATA vs INSERT |
| M8 - Vector Search *(optional)* | ANN search with HNSW index (TiDB AI track) |

M6 also writes source feature inventory output to:
- `results/compat_source_unsupported_summary.json`

If a module is not selected in the run, it is shown in coverage tables but
omitted from the chart section to keep the report concise.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A TiDB Cloud account (free at [tidbcloud.com](https://tidbcloud.com))
- Network access to your TiDB cluster

## How This Kit Works (For Report Readers)

If you received a PoV report and want to understand the methodology, here is a plain-English summary:

**What generates the workload?**
An EC2 instance (`c7i.2xlarge` by default) in the customer's own AWS account runs a purpose-built OLTP load generator against TiDB Cloud. This is *not* a replay of the customer's production queries - it is a synthetic benchmark calibrated to the chosen industry profile (banking, healthcare, gaming, retail, etc.). The EC2 instance and load generator are spun up automatically by the kit and torn down when the run completes.

**Where does the test data come from?**
Industry-specific seed datasets (~3 GB each, covering OLTP transactions and OLAP aggregation tables) are pre-staged in a PingCAP S3 bucket. TiDB Cloud's `IMPORT INTO` command pulls the data directly from S3 into the cluster before tests begin. No data leaves TiDB Cloud; the import is a one-way inbound load.

**Is the kit "pre-tuned" to inflate results?**
Each test module applies the same TiDB best practices that any production deployment should use: `AUTO_RANDOM` primary keys (eliminating hot-region write bottlenecks), column-store `TiFlash` replicas for analytics, and schema settings matched to the workload pattern. These are not artificial optimizations - they are the recommended production configuration. The goal is to show what TiDB actually achieves when set up correctly.

**How does this compare to a traditional PoC?**
A traditional PoC typically requires the customer to provision infrastructure, load their own data, write benchmark scripts, and interpret raw results - a process that can take weeks. This kit compresses that to hours: infrastructure is automated, data loads from S3, modules run sequentially, and the report is generated automatically. The output is a decision-ready PDF, not a spreadsheet of raw numbers.

**Report reading order:**
1. **Prospect Decision Summary** - clear decision + recommended next step
2. **What Was Tested** - exact executed scope and environment
3. **Executive Summary** - headline KPIs (warm latency, throughput, SQL compatibility)
4. **Module charts** - evidence for each executed module
5. **SQL Compatibility Index** - checks that passed/failed + fix directions
6. **KPI appendix** - full threshold evaluation table for technical review

---

## Getting Started from CLI

Follow every step below exactly. Each step tells you which website to visit, what to click, and what to paste. No assumptions.

---

### Step 1 - Create a TiDB Cloud account and cluster

**1a. Create your account**

1. Open your browser and go to: **https://tidbcloud.com**
2. Click **Sign Up** (top right corner).
3. Fill in your email and create a password, then click **Create Account**.
4. Check your email for a verification link and click it.
5. Log in with your new account.

**1b. Create a Serverless cluster (free)**

1. After logging in you should see the **Clusters** page. Click **Create Cluster**.
2. Select **Serverless** (it is free - no credit card required).
3. Pick any region (e.g. **US East (N. Virginia)**).
4. Give your cluster any name (e.g. `pov-test`).
5. Click **Create** at the bottom right. The cluster will be ready in about 30 seconds.

**1c. Get your connection credentials**

1. Once the cluster status shows **Active**, click on the cluster name to open it.
2. Click **Connect** in the top right area of the cluster page.
3. A panel opens. Make sure the **General** tab is selected.
4. You will see three values - copy each one to a text file right now:
   - **Host** - looks like `gateway01.us-east-1.prod.aws.tidbcloud.com`
   - **Username** - looks like `AbCdEfGhIj1K2.root` (copy this exactly, including the prefix before the dot)
   - **Password** - click **Generate Password** if you haven't already, then copy it

> Keep that text file open. You will paste these values in Step 4.

---

### Step 2 - Install prerequisites on your machine

**2a. Check if you have Python 3.10+**

Open your terminal (on Mac: press `Cmd+Space`, type `Terminal`, press Enter) and run:

```bash
python3 --version
```

You need version 3.10 or higher. If you see `command not found` or a version below 3.10:
- **Mac:** Go to **https://www.python.org/downloads/**, download the latest 3.x installer, run it, follow the installer steps.
- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):** Run `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip`
- **Linux (Amazon Linux / RHEL):** Run `sudo yum install -y python3`

**2b. Check if you have Git**

```bash
git --version
```

If you see `command not found`:
- **Mac:** Run `xcode-select --install` and follow the popup.
- **Linux:** Run `sudo apt-get install -y git` or `sudo yum install -y git`

**2c. Check if you have the AWS CLI**

```bash
aws --version
```

If you see `command not found`, install it:
- **Mac / Linux (easiest):** Run this single command:
  ```bash
  curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip" && unzip awscliv2.zip && sudo ./aws/install
  ```
- **Mac alternative:** Go to **https://aws.amazon.com/cli/**, download the `.pkg` file, run it.
- After installing, close your terminal, open a new one, and run `aws --version` again to confirm.

---

### Step 3 - Set up AWS credentials

The kit uploads run results and imports test data from an S3 bucket. You need AWS credentials to do this. **Pick the option that matches your situation:**

---

#### Option A - You have AWS access keys (most common for first-time users)

1. Log in to the AWS console at **https://console.aws.amazon.com**
2. Click your name in the top-right corner → **Security credentials**
3. Scroll down to **Access keys** → click **Create access key**
4. Select **Command Line Interface (CLI)** → check the confirmation box → click **Next** → click **Create access key**
5. You will see an **Access key ID** and a **Secret access key**. Copy both.
6. Back in your terminal, paste and run these three lines (replace the placeholder values):
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...your-key-id-here...
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...your-secret-key-here...
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
   ```
7. Verify it works:
   ```bash
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   ```
   You should see your AWS account ID printed. If you see an error, double-check that you copied the keys correctly.

---

#### Option B - You use AWS SSO / IAM Identity Center (PingCAP employees or enterprise users)

1. In your terminal, run:
   ```bash
   aws sso login
   ```
2. A browser window will open asking you to approve the login. Click **Allow**.
3. Back in the terminal, run:
   ```bash
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   ```
   You should see your account ID. If the command says `Token has expired`, just run `aws sso login` again.

---

#### Option C - You are running on an EC2 instance with an IAM role attached

No action needed. The kit automatically uses the instance's IAM role. Skip to Step 4.

---

#### Verify S3 access before continuing

Run this to confirm your credentials can reach the PoV results bucket:

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://pingcap-tidb-pov-results-219248915861/tidb-pov/ --region us-east-1
```

You should see a list of folders. If you see `Access Denied`, ask your AWS admin to add S3 write permissions to your user or role.

---

### Step 4 - Download the kit and configure it

**4a. Clone the repository**

In your terminal, run these commands one at a time:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stephenlthorn/tidb-pov-kit-self-service.git tidb-pov-kit
```
```bash
cd tidb-pov-kit
```
```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap_cli.sh
```

The last command installs Python dependencies. It may take 1-2 minutes. When it finishes you should see no errors.

**4b. Create your config file**

```bash
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
```

**4c. Fill in your TiDB credentials**

Open `config.yaml` in any text editor. On Mac you can run:

```bash
open -e config.yaml
```

On Linux:
```bash
nano config.yaml
```

Find the section at the top that looks like this:

```yaml
tidb:
  host:     "gateway01.us-west-2.prod.aws.tidbcloud.com"
  port:     4000
  user:     "<prefix>.root"
  password: "YOUR_PASSWORD"
```

Replace those three values with the ones you copied in Step 1c:
- Replace the `host` value with your **Host**
- Replace the `user` value with your **Username** (copy it exactly - include the prefix before the dot)
- Replace the `password` value with your **Password**

Example of what it should look like after editing (your values will be different):

```yaml
tidb:
  host:     "gateway01.us-east-1.prod.aws.tidbcloud.com"
  user:     "AbCdEfGhIj1K2.root"
  password: "mySecretPassword123"
```

Save the file and close the editor.

**4d. (Optional) Set your industry**

If you want the test data to match a specific industry, find this section in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
industry:
  selected: "general_auto"
```

Change `general_auto` to one of: `banking`, `healthcare`, `gaming`, `retail_ecommerce`, `saas`, `iot_telemetry`, `adtech`, `logistics`

If you are not sure, leave it as `general_auto`.

---

### Step 5 - Run the PoV

**Paste this single command and press Enter:**

```bash
./run_all.sh config.yaml --no-menu --no-wizard
```

The kit will:
1. Connect to TiDB and verify credentials
2. Import ~3 GB of test data from S3 into your cluster
3. Run all test modules one by one (takes 20-40 minutes total)
4. Generate a PDF report

You will see live progress in the terminal. It is normal for steps to take several minutes each - do not close the terminal.

**If you prefer a browser-based UI instead:**

```bash
./run_all.sh --web-ui
```

Then open **http://localhost:8787** in your browser and click through the wizard.

---

### Step 6 - Get your report

When the run finishes, your report is here:

```bash
open results/tidb_pov_report.pdf
```

(On Linux, use `xdg-open results/tidb_pov_report.pdf` or just navigate to the `results/` folder in your file manager.)

A copy is also automatically uploaded to S3:
```
s3://pingcap-tidb-pov-results-219248915861/tidb-pov/default/runs/<run-tag>/
```

---

### Something went wrong? Check this table first.

| Error message | What to do |
|--------------|------------|
| `Connection refused` or `Access denied for user` | Open `config.yaml` and double-check `host`, `user`, and `password`. Make sure there are no extra spaces or quote marks. |
| `Unable to locate credentials` | Run `aws sts get-caller-identity` - if it fails, re-do Step 3. |
| `Token has expired and refresh failed` | Run `aws sso login` again (Option B users only). |
| `AccessDenied: kms:GenerateDataKey` | Your AWS user is missing KMS permissions. Ask your AWS admin to add `kms:GenerateDataKey`, `kms:Decrypt`, `kms:DescribeKey` to your role. |
| `Run blocked: S3 archival is required` | Your AWS credentials don't have S3 write access. Re-do Step 3 and re-run the S3 verify command. |
| IMPORT INTO fails with CPU error | Open `config.yaml`, find `dataset_bootstrap:`, and change `import_threads: 0` to `import_threads: 1`. Then re-run. |
| Run appears stuck at `[5/10] M1` | Normal - M1 has multiple timed phases. Let it run for 10-15 minutes before worrying. |
| `git: command not found` | Re-do Step 2b. |
| `python3: command not found` | Re-do Step 2a. |

### Useful shortcuts

```bash
./run_all.sh --menu              # interactive module picker (choose which tests to run)
./run_all.sh --report-only       # regenerate PDF from existing results without re-running tests
./run_all.sh --report-json-only  # regenerate JSON summary only
```

## Data Scales

| Scale  | Schema A rows | Schema B events | Schema C tenants | Approx. size |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------|
| small  | 50K users, 5M txns | 5M events | 1K tenants | multi-GB |
| medium | 500K users, 50M txns | 50M events | 10K tenants | tens of GB |
| large  | 2M users, 200M txns | 200M events | 50K tenants | 100GB+ |

## PoC Sizing Guidance (EC2)

Use these as practical starting points for load generators.

| Profile | EC2 instance type | Runner count | Throughput target envelope | Recommended starting knobs |
|--------|--------------------|--------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Small  | `c7i.2xlarge`      | 1            | up to ~50k QPS             | `data_scale=small`, `concurrency_levels=[8,16,32]`, `duration_seconds=120` |
| Medium | `c7i.4xlarge`      | 1-2          | up to ~200k QPS            | `data_scale=medium`, `concurrency_levels=[16,64,128]`, `duration_seconds=180-300` |
| Large  | `c7i.8xlarge`      | 2-4          | up to ~1M QPS              | `data_scale=large`, `concurrency_levels=[64,128,256]`, longer warm phase + Workload Generator |

Notes:
1. These are targets, not guarantees. Final QPS depends on query shape, latency, network path, and cluster tier.
2. For 500k+ QPS, use multi-loadgen Workload Generator mode (`rawsql`) and keep load generators in the same region/VPC path as TiDB.
3. Keep `POV_ENFORCE_S3_UPLOAD=true` so runs fail closed if S3 write/read is not available.
4. To highlight low-latency API lookups, keep `point_get_phase_enabled=true` and run from EC2 in the same region/path as TiDB Cloud.

## Running Individual Modules

Each module can be run standalone for debugging:

```bash
python tests/01_baseline_perf/run.py config.yaml
python tests/04_htap_concurrent/run.py config.yaml
python report/generate_report.py config.yaml
```

## Side-by-Side Comparison Targets

Set `comparison_db.target` to one of:
- `aurora_mysql`
- `mysql`
- `rds_mysql`
- `postgres`
- `rds_postgres`
- `aurora_postgres`
- `microsoft_sql_server`
- `singlestore`

Automated side-by-side execution is currently supported for:
- **MySQL family** (`aurora_mysql`, `mysql`, `rds_mysql`, `singlestore`): every module
- **PostgreSQL family** (`postgres`, `rds_postgres`, `aurora_postgres`): M0-M5 (see matrix below)

Microsoft SQL Server is configurable but not yet executed by the runner.

### Per-module compatibility matrix

| Module | TiDB | MySQL family | Postgres family | Notes |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|
| M0 Customer queries | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Customer SQL replayed verbatim; may fail if it uses MySQL-only syntax. |
| M1 Baseline perf | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Dialect-translated workload. |
| M2 Elastic scale | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Same workload as M1. |
| M3 HA | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Connection resilience. |
| M3b Write contention | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | AUTO_RANDOM is the differentiator; PG result is the contrast. |
| **M4 HTAP** | ✅ | - | ✅ row store | PG runs the analytic workload on its row store - no TiFlash equivalent, used to show degradation. |
| **M5 Online DDL** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | PG uses blocking CREATE INDEX (TiDB online add-index is the differentiator). |
| M6 MySQL compat | ✅ | ✅ | **skipped** | Module purpose is MySQL syntax compatibility. |
| M7 Data import | ✅ | ✅ | **skipped** | LOAD DATA / IMPORT INTO are MySQL/TiDB; PG uses COPY (different test). |
| M8 Vector search | ✅ | - | **skipped** | Requires pgvector extension; deferred. |

### Driver requirements

- MySQL/Aurora MySQL/RDS MySQL/SingleStore: `mysql-connector-python>=8.0.0`
- PostgreSQL/RDS PostgreSQL/Aurora PostgreSQL: `psycopg[binary]>=3.2.0`

Both drivers are listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Seeding the comparison database

The comparison DB needs the same schemas as TiDB. For RDS/Aurora targets you
will normally point at a pre-populated customer database. For local
validation, the kit ships `setup/seed_comparison.py`, which dispatches on
`comparison_db.target` family and creates schemas + a small synthetic data
set with `INSERT IGNORE` / `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` so it's idempotent:

```bash
python setup/seed_comparison.py --config config.yaml \
    --users 50000 --accounts 75000 --transactions 5000000
```

### Local two-engine smoke test

A `docker-compose.pov-comparison.yml` is included for local validation:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.pov-comparison.yml up -d
# Edit config.local-smoke.yaml if needed (MySQL on 23306, Postgres on 15432)
python setup/seed_comparison.py --config config.local-smoke.yaml --users 2000
python setup/seed_comparison.py --config config.local-smoke-mysql.yaml --users 2000
python tests/01_baseline_perf/run.py config.local-smoke.yaml
```

## Observability During the Run

Open **TiDB Dashboard** and **Grafana** in your browser while the kit runs.
See **`setup/02_observability_guide.md`** for the exact panels to watch for
each module - with descriptions of what to screenshot for customer slides.

## Troubleshooting

**Connection refused / authentication error**
→ Double-check `host`, `port`, `user`, `password` in `config.yaml`.
→ Ensure your IP is whitelisted under Security → Network Access.
→ `run_all.sh` will now prompt to update connection values and retry when this check fails in an interactive terminal.
→ `pov_safe_small_e2e.sh` hard-fails early if TiDB Cloud username prefix format is invalid.

**`Missing user name prefix`**
→ Use the exact TiDB Cloud username from Connect (example: `<prefix>.root` for Starter/Essential/Premium/Serverless).
→ Dedicated/BYOC may not require prefix in the same format.

**Checklist returns HOLD before tests start**
→ Open `results/pre_poc_checklist.md` and resolve blocking items.
→ Use `--allow-blocked` only for dry-runs where risk is explicitly accepted.

**Module skipped / `not_run` in report**
→ The module is disabled in `config.yaml` under `modules:`, or it was skipped
  because a prerequisite (e.g. TiFlash) isn't available on your cluster tier.

**TiFlash-related errors (M4, M8)**
→ TiFlash requires TiFlash nodes to be provisioned and replicated.
  Intake enables M4 by default only for Dedicated/BYOC tiers.
  Add at least 2 TiFlash nodes in the TiDB Cloud console and wait for
  replication to complete before running M4/M8.

**High Availability expectations on Serverless/Starter**
→ Full node-stop HA validation is a Dedicated/BYOC exercise.
  For lower tiers, keep M3 disabled or run only simulated HA mode.

**IMPORT INTO fails (M7)**
→ `IMPORT INTO` with `file://` URI requires TiDB >= 7.2 and the file to be
  accessible from the TiDB server. For TiDB Cloud, use an S3 URI instead.

**Dataset bootstrap from S3 fails (Step 4)**
→ Verify `dataset_bootstrap.enabled=true`, valid manifest path
  (`manifest_uri` or `s3_bucket + s3_prefix`), AWS credentials, and TiDB Cloud
  `IMPORT INTO` access to the S3 objects.
  The module falls back to LOAD DATA and INSERT automatically.

**`Token has expired and refresh failed` / SSO token errors**
→ Re-authenticate AWS SSO before running:
```bash
aws sso login --profile <your-profile> --no-browser
```
→ `pov_safe_small_e2e.sh` now attempts SSO re-auth automatically when it detects an SSO profile in an interactive terminal.

**`--no-wizard: command not found` when using `POV_ENV_FILE`**
→ Your env file contains non `KEY=VALUE` lines.
→ `scripts/pov_pull_run_upload.sh` now safely loads only valid env assignments and ignores other lines.

**Out of memory during large data generation**
→ Reduce `data_scale` to `small` or `medium` in `config.yaml`.
