## Why warehouse-native analytics?

**Your events are already in your warehouse. Stop sending them somewhere else.** Every SaaS analytics platform makes you re-pipe your data into their system — creating vendor lock-in, duplicating data, and adding cost. stratif.io connects directly to your existing DuckDB, Postgres, Snowflake, or ClickHouse. No ingestion. No pipelines. No data ever leaves your infrastructure.

**Open source and self-hosted.** No vendor lock-in, no surprise invoices. One install script and you own your analytics stack completely.

**Learn product analytics hands-on.** stratif.io ships with ~5,000 realistic sample events. Explore funnels, retention, and user journeys without needing your own data — no account, no credit card.

### What is warehouse-native analytics?

Warehouse-native analytics is a category of tools that run product analysis — funnels, retention, paths — directly on the events already in your data warehouse (DuckDB, Snowflake, ClickHouse, Databricks, Postgres). No ingestion pipeline. No SDK. No duplicate copy of your data in a third-party SaaS.

### Who is stratif.io for — and who is it not for?

**stratif.io is for you if** your product events are already in a SQL warehouse, you want self-hosted funnels, retention, and path analysis on that data, and you don't want to pay per event or hand your data to a SaaS vendor.

**stratif.io is _not_ a full-stack replacement for Mixpanel or Amplitude.** It does not ship SDKs, experimentation, session replay, or push notifications. If you need those, pair stratif.io with a platform that does event collection, or keep using your current tool for those specific capabilities.
