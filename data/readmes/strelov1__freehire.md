## Why freehire?

- **Straight from the source.** Every listing is crawled directly from a company's
  own ATS — Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, iCIMS and a long tail of others — and
  links to the original posting. No recruiter reposts, no aggregator middlemen, no
  dead links.
- **One schema, deduplicated.** The same role posted to three boards collapses into
  one entry: every posting is normalized into a single shape and deduplicated on a
  stable key.
- **Search that understands jobs.** Faceted full-text search over region, work mode,
  seniority, skills and salary — derived from curated dictionaries, never guessed.
- **Actually open.** MIT-licensed and self-hostable, pipeline and data both in the
  open. Adding a company is one line of YAML.
- **Yours to build on.** A clean HTTP API, a CLI, Telegram digests, and a whole
  workspace on top of the catalogue — see [Beyond the catalogue](#beyond-the-catalogue).
  Use the hosted site, run your own, or build on top.

Aggregating **3.3M+ live postings** from **294,000+ companies** across **92 ATS
platforms** and a long tail of aggregators and direct feeds — **225 live sources**
in all, see [Sources](#sources) for the full breakdown.

> If freehire saves you time — or you just like the idea of jobs straight from the
> source — a ⭐ helps other people find it.

## Beyond the catalogue

Finding the posting is half the problem. The other half — writing the CV,
sending it, and knowing what happened to it — is built on the same data, in the
same repository, under the same licence.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Find** | Faceted search, curated collections, saved searches with email/Telegram digests, shared boards, market analytics, the ghost-job signal |
| **Apply** | CV builder with ATS-safe PDF templates, deterministic CV↔vacancy scoring, AI fit analysis, CV tailoring that invents nothing, tracer links, referrals |
| **Track** | An application board with stages, a mail inbox that links recruiter replies to the application they answer, an append-only event ledger, reminders |
| **Ask** | An in-process agent with five presets — chat, browse, profile, CV tailoring, interview rehearsal — with no shell and no minted credential |
| **Build on** | A keyless public API, a [CLI](https://github.com/strelov1/freehire-cli), an [MCP server](https://github.com/strelov1/freehire-mcp) for Claude Desktop and Claude Code, a form-filling browser extension, ChatGPT Actions |

**[Full feature reference → `docs/features.md`](docs/features.md)** — what each one
does, where it lives in the tree, which need an LLM endpoint configured, and
which draw on AI credits.

## Stack

- **Go** + [Fiber v2](https://gofiber.io/) — HTTP server
- **PostgreSQL** + [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) — storage, filtering, semantic embeddings
- **[sqlc](https://sqlc.dev/)** — type-safe DB access from SQL (no ORM)
- **[Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/)** — full-text and faceted job search
- **[langchaingo](https://github.com/tmc/langchaingo)** — LLM access over any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (no vendor baked in)
- **[Bifrost](https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost)** — LLM gateway: per-user virtual keys, cross-provider fallback, spend tracking
- **[Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/)** — LLM call tracing and observability
- **[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) 2** (Svelte 5 runes) + **Tailwind 4** — the server-rendered frontend under `web/`
- **Redis** — rate limiting and realtime fan-out · **S3-compatible object storage** — CVs, headshots, previews
- **[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)** (via the node_exporter textfile collector) + **[Grafana](https://grafana.com/)** — metrics and dashboards for the ingest/LLM infrastructure
- **Docker Compose** — local development

## Quick start

```bash
make up        # build + start the whole stack in Docker:
               # api, web, postgres, meilisearch, redis, s3
curl localhost:8080/health
curl localhost:8080/api/v1/jobs
```

Migrations are applied automatically on first Postgres volume init
(the `migrations/` folder is mounted into `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`).
Changing a migration does not re-apply to an existing volume — recreate it with
`docker compose down -v && make up`, or apply pending files manually with
`make migrate`.

If port 8080 is already taken, pick another host port:

```bash
HIRE_HOST_PORT=8090 make up
```

## Local development

```bash
docker compose up -d db   # database only
make run                  # server on host, reads DATABASE_URL
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust as needed. `JWT_SECRET` is required for
the server to start; OAuth and LLM credentials are optional (the features they
gate stay disabled when unset).

## Commands

```bash
make help      # list all commands
make sqlc      # regenerate code from SQL (via Docker, no local sqlc needed)
make tidy      # go mod tidy
make psql      # psql inside the DB container
make reindex   # rebuild the Meilisearch index from Postgres
make migrate   # apply migrations manually to an existing DB volume
```

## Workers

The server only serves the API. Everything else — crawling, enrichment, indexing,
notifications — is a standalone, run-once worker meant for cron: it crawls or
drains its queue and exits. `ls cmd/` for the full list; the ones you are most
likely to run:

```bash
go run ./cmd/migrate       # apply pending migrations (run before deploying code that reads new schema)
go run ./cmd/ingest greenhouse  # crawl one provider's catalog boards and upsert jobs (also via INGEST_PROVIDER)
go run ./cmd/enrich        # drain the enrichment queue (LLM); needs LLM_* config
go run ./cmd/embed         # drain the semantic queue into pgvector chunks
go run ./cmd/search-drain  # push queued job writes into the live search index (run every 1-2 min)
go run ./cmd/reindex       # rebuild the Meilisearch index from Postgres (full swap)
go run ./cmd/tg-ingest     # crawl the active channels in telegram_channels
go run ./cmd/tg-extract    # LLM-extract vacancies from crawled Telegram posts
go run ./cmd/capture-apply-form  # fetch queued postings' ATS application forms
go run ./cmd/backfill-derive     # re-derive every deterministic column — facets, fingerprints,
                                 # slugs — in one keyset pass (follow with make reindex)
```

Every worker needs `DATABASE_URL` and exits non-zero on failure. `prune` is the
only hard-delete path in the system, and it is dry-run by default.

  embed/             semantic chunk embeddings into pgvector
  location/ classify/ skilltag/  the curated facet dictionaries — never guess, emit nothing
  ghost/             the posting-reality signal behind "is this job real?"
  jobview/           the single public wire shape of a job
  cv/ cvedit/        structured CVs + PDF rendering; cvedit is their only writer
  experience/        durable employments + evidence atoms behind every CV claim
  cvmatch/ matchanalysis/  deterministic CV↔vacancy score; the LLM fit analysis on top
  applyform/         captured ATS application forms, in the platform's own vocabulary
  userjob/ appevent/ per-user tracking (view / apply / save / stages) + the event ledger
  inbox/             recruiter mail → classify → link to an application
  assistant/         the in-process agent: turn loop, tools, transcripts
  browsertools/      relays tool frames between the agent and the browser extension
  referral/ collections/  employee referrals; curated company tags
  llm/ llmkey/       provider-agnostic LLM client + per-user spend attribution
```

## Architecture

How the pieces fit together — the crawl-to-search topology, what each directory
above is for, and walkthroughs of the three main flows (finding a job, tailoring a
CV, the in-app assistant), plus the auth model, notifications and the job
lifecycle: **[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)**.

It is the map; the per-package `AGENTS.md` files it links to are the territory.

## API

The catalogue is served over a public, keyless HTTP API — `GET
https://freehire.me/api/v1/jobs` needs no credential. All responses use
`{"data": ...}` (single), `{"data": ..., "meta": {...}}` (lists), or
`{"error": msg}`; jobs and companies are addressed by their public slug.

**Full reference — every endpoint, its parameters, auth mode and the whole
search-filter vocabulary: [freehire.me/docs/api](https://freehire.me/docs/api).**

## Sources

Live catalogue snapshot — **3,300,615 open postings** across **294,282 companies**,
crawled from **225 live sources**. Counts are open postings unless noted; a
company crawled from two sources is counted under each. Every source is one of
three kinds:

- **ATS platforms** — one adapter per multi-tenant applicant-tracking system,
  each serving many companies (Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, iCIMS…).
  **92 platforms · 157,399 companies · 2,644,796 open postings.**
- **Aggregators & job boards** — third-party feeds that republish many
  companies' postings (Adzuna, trudvsem, himalayas, Telegram channels…).
  **100 sources · 172,884 companies · 629,571 open postings.**
- **Company career sites** — direct single-company feeds crawled from a
  company's own careers page (Amazon, Apple, Google, Yandex, Sber…).
  **30 feeds · 59 companies · 26,222 open postings.**

A source's kind is not configuration but a property of the adapter's own Go type,
so `internal/ingest/sources` classifies every provider without a network call.

Full per-source breakdown — every source with its own companies/open-jobs
count — lives on its own page: [docs/sources.md](docs/sources.md).

## Adding a source

Adding a company is one row in the `boards` catalog — `company` + `provider` +
`board` — added through the "contribute a board" form on the site, or by a curator
with `go run ./cmd/add-board --provider=… --board=… --company=… --apply`. Adding an
ATS platform is a new adapter in `internal/ingest/sources` plus one line in
`sources.All` — every adapter speaks the same `Source` interface, and a board is
validated against the registry when it enters the catalog, before any crawl.

For most companies the platform is already supported, so adding them is just one
catalog row. Only when a company runs on an ATS we don't cover yet does it need a
new provider (a new adapter). Either way, if you want a source added,
**start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/strelov1/freehire/issues)** — name
the company and its careers URL, and we'll confirm whether it's a one-line add or a
new provider before any code.

## Frontend

A server-rendered SvelteKit 2 app (Svelte 5 runes, Tailwind 4, `adapter-node`)
lives under `web/` and consumes the API same-origin; a dev Vite proxy forwards
`/api` to the backend. Shared tokens and components come from the sibling
`design-system/` package — install it before building `web/` or `extension/`,
since it is symlinked, not copied. See [web/AGENTS.md](web/AGENTS.md).

## Browser extension

A Chrome extension puts the job-application agent in a side panel next to
whatever posting you're on: it reads the page when you ask it something, shows
a deterministic skill-coverage match against your freehire profile, and can
fill the application form for you. Source lives under `extension/`
([extension/AGENTS.md](extension/AGENTS.md)).

## Contributing

**Contributions are welcome, and issues and PRs are open to everyone.** No
allowlist, no approval step — open one.

The easiest way to help is to **add a source**: submit a board through the
"contribute a board" form on the site, or send a new adapter in
`internal/ingest/sources`. Missing a company you would apply to? Contributing its
board takes a URL, and it is the single most useful thing you can send.

Questions and half-formed ideas are equally welcome in
[Discussions](https://github.com/strelov1/freehire/discussions) — no need to
polish them into an issue first. For anything large, an issue up front saves you
from building the wrong thing, but nothing stops you from just opening the PR.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the checks CI runs and
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the architecture and conventions.
