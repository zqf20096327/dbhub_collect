Your AI assistant forgets everything when you close the chat. This fixes that.

Learnings, decisions, people, projects — stored in a **single SQLite file** on your machine that never leaves your computer. Built-in Knowledge Graph, duplicate detection, FTS5 keyword search, and (new in v2) **hybrid retrieval** that fuses BM25 with on-device vector cosine via Reciprocal Rank Fusion. The embedding model is multilingual (DE / EN / ES / 100+ languages) and runs locally — no API keys, no cloud.

## A note from us

We have been building tools and systems for ourselves for the past two years. The fact that this repo is small and has few stars is not because it is new. It is because we only just decided to share what we have built. It is not a fresh experiment, it is a long story with a recent commit.

We love building things and sharing them. We do not love social media tactics, growth hacks, or chasing stars and followers. So this repo is small. The code is real, it gets used, issues get answered. Judge for yourself.

If it helps you, sharing, testing, and feedback help us. If it could be better, an issue is more useful. If you build something with it, tell us at hello@studiomeyer.io. That genuinely makes our day.

From a small studio in Palma de Mallorca.

## Quick Start

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add memory -- npx -y @studiomeyer/local-memory-mcp
```

### Claude Desktop

**Easiest: one-click MCPB bundle.** v2.0.0 ships pre-built `.mcpb` bundles for every major desktop platform — download the one for your OS from the [latest release](https://github.com/studiomeyer-io/local-memory-mcp/releases/latest) and double-click. Claude Desktop walks you through the install — no JSON editing, no `npm install`, no terminal.

| Platform | Bundle |
|---|---|
| Linux x64 | `local-memory-mcp-2.2.0-linux-x64.mcpb` |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `local-memory-mcp-2.2.0-darwin-arm64.mcpb` |
| macOS Intel | `local-memory-mcp-2.2.0-darwin-x64.mcpb` |
| Windows x64 | `local-memory-mcp-2.2.0-win32-x64.mcpb` |

Each bundle is platform-specific because `better-sqlite3` is a native module — the matching `.node` binary is shipped inside the bundle so you don't need a build toolchain.

**Manual config** (all platforms — add to `claude_desktop_config.json`, see [Settings > Developer > Edit Config](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@studiomeyer/local-memory-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor / VS Code

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` or `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@studiomeyer/local-memory-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Codex

```toml
# ~/.codex/config.toml
[mcp_servers.memory]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@studiomeyer/local-memory-mcp"]
```

## Automatic session tracking

You can make session tracking fully automatic so you never have to think about it.

**Claude Code (CLAUDE.md):** Add this line to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```
Always call memory_session_start at the beginning of each conversation and memory_session_end when done.
```

**Claude Code (Hook):** For a system-wide setup, add a SessionStart hook in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "echo '{\"hookSpecificOutput\":{\"hookEventName\":\"SessionStart\",\"additionalContext\":\"Call memory_session_start now.\"}}'",
        "timeout": 5
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

Both approaches make Claude call `memory_session_start` automatically. The CLAUDE.md way is simpler, the hook way works across all projects.

## What it does

When you start a conversation, the server loads context from your last sessions so the AI knows what you were working on.

During the conversation, the AI stores patterns, insights, and mistakes via `memory_learn`. It records facts about people, projects, and tools via `memory_entity_observe` — building a knowledge graph over time. Every stored row is also embedded into a local 384-dim vector via the multilingual-e5-small model.

When you search, the unified `memory_search` runs **hybrid retrieval**: FTS5 with BM25 ranking is fused with vector cosine via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF, k=60). That bridges vocabulary mismatches ("send" finds "publish"), works across DE / EN / ES / 100+ languages, and matches even when the query has no exact token overlap with the stored content. If the vector extension can't load on your machine, search transparently falls back to FTS5-only — nothing breaks, you just lose the semantic half.

The duplicate gatekeeper still prevents storing the same information twice.

## Hybrid Search (v2.0.0+)

```text
memory_search({ query: "...", mode: "hybrid" })   // default
memory_search({ query: "...", mode: "fts" })       // keyword only
memory_search({ query: "...", mode: "vector" })    // cosine only
```

**Architecture**

- `search_fts` (FTS5, BM25) — keyword recall, the v1 path.
- `embeddings` (`sqlite-vec` `vec0` virtual table, float[384]) — vector recall.
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion (k=60) combines the two when `mode: "hybrid"`.
- Embeddings come from `Xenova/multilingual-e5-small` (Apache-2.0) via Transformers.js, q8-quantized (~30 MB cache). Model loads lazily on the first embed call; runs entirely on CPU.
- Auto-embed-on-insert covers learnings, decisions, and entity observations. Entities themselves are not embedded — their attached observations carry the semantic surface.

**Multilingual.** The default model is trained on 100+ languages with strong DE/EN/ES retrieval. Mixing languages in your stored data is fine — query in one language and the cosine half still surfaces relevant results in another.

**Environment overrides**

- `MEMORY_EMBED_DISABLED=1` — force FTS5-only (e.g. air-gapped or corporate-proxy network).
- `MEMORY_EMBED_MODEL=...` — swap in a different Transformers.js feature-extraction model.
- `MEMORY_EMBED_CACHE_DIR=...` — override the Transformers.js cache location.
- `MEMORY_EMBED_DTYPE=fp32|fp16|q8|q4` — model quantization (default `q8`).

## Lifecycle + Reflection (v2.1.0+)

v2.1 closes the gap between "store a fact" and "manage a memory over time". The schema has carried `archived`, `lifecycle_state`, `valid_from`, and `valid_to` since v1, but no tool exposed them. Now four tools do.

### Bi-temporal asOf — "what did I know on date X?"

```text
memory_entity_open({ id: "...", asOf: "2026-04-15" })
```

Returns the entity plus the observation set whose validity window contained `2026-04-15`. The filter is `valid_from <= asOf AND (valid_to IS NULL OR valid_to > asOf)`. Accepts any format SQLite's `datetime()` recognizes: ISO 8601 (`2026-04-15T00:00:00Z`), SQLite-style (`2026-04-15 00:00:00`), or date-only (`2026-04-15`). Without `asOf` you get the legacy live-view (every observation with `valid_to IS NULL`).

**Design choice — valid-time only, not full bi-temporal.** SQL:2011, XTDB, Datomic offer two-axis bi-temporal (valid-time × transaction-time). We do valid-time only; transaction-time lives passively in `created_at` but isn't queryable as a separate axis. For a local AI-memory product the question is "what did the AI *know* about X on date Y" — that's valid-time. Full bi-temporal matters for regulated audit trails (insurance, banking) — if you need it, reach for XTDB.

**Scale note.** The asOf predicate wraps `valid_from` in SQLite's `datetime()` for format-robust comparisons, which means the planner can't use an index on the column directly. For corpora of <1000 observations per entity (typical) the scan is sub-millisecond. If you have an entity with 10k+ observations, add an expression index — `CREATE INDEX idx_obs_valid_from_dt ON entity_observations(datetime(valid_from))` — and the predicate becomes sargable again.

### Contradiction scanner — LLM-free

```text
memory_contradictions({ minCosine: 0.75, minConfidenceDrift: 0.2 })
memory_contradictions({ entityId: "...", limit: 20 })
```

Surfaces observation pairs that are semantically very close (cosine similarity above `minCosine`) but disagree on either:

- **negation marker XOR** — one side asserts, the other negates (regex covers EN / DE / ES / Catalan).
- **confidence drift** — same surface claim, very different `confidence` values.

LLM-free on purpose — the no-API-key promise holds. The heuristic is conservative; the AI client judges. Pure duplicates (no negation, no confidence drift) are not flagged. The cosine math runs in SQL via `vec_distance_cosine`, so the extension must be loaded; on platforms where it isn't, the tool returns `VECTOR_DISABLED` with a clear message instead of degrading silently.

**Calibration.** Default `minCosine = 0.75` follows 2026 retriever-tuning literature (SparseCL on Arguana; Milvus threshold-tuning guidance) which finds a sharp false-positive rise below 0.7. Lower to 0.6 for recall-heavy use, raise to 0.85 for precision-heavy. The negation regex covers EN / DE / ES / Catalan / Portuguese / Italian / French — the seven languages multilingual-e5-small handles strongest.

### Supersede — retire a stale fact (v2.2)

```text
memory_observation_supersede({ observationId: "..." })
memory_observation_supersede({ observationId: "...", supersededById: "..." })
```

The scanner *finds* a stale fact; `memory_observation_supersede` *acts* on it. It sets the older observation's `valid_to` (a tombstone) so the fact stops surfacing in live `memory_search` and `memory_entity_open` — but the row stays in the database, so an `asOf` query still returns it as the belief that was current before the cutoff. This is the Zep fact-supersession pattern: invalidate, never delete. Pass `supersededById` and the cutoff becomes the newer fact's `valid_from` (the old fact was true right up until the new one was recorded); pass `validTo` for an explicit instant, or neither for now. Same-entity and self-supersede guards keep the operation sane, and a second call is idempotent (`already_superseded`).

### Archive + update — lifecycle for learnings

```text
memory_learn_archive({ learningId: "...", reason: "wrong" })
memory_learn_update({ learningId: "...", content: "…", confidence: 0.9 })
```

`archive` is a soft delete: the row stays in `learnings` (with `archived = 1`, `archived_at`, and `lifecycle_state = 'archived' | 'archived:<reason>'`), the embedding stays in vec0 (so asOf-style cross-references can still resolve), but `recall` / `search` / the duplicate check all filter it out. Idempotent.

`update` edits a live (non-archived) learning. If `content` changes we re-embed in the F4 atomic pattern (compute outside the transaction, write inside one sync `db.transaction()`). If the embedding write fails or vec is disabled, the now-stale old embedding is purged so cosine search can't surface a vector that no longer represents the live text. Bumps `usage_count` and sets `last_used` so an edit counts as a touch.

**Trade-off — no audit trail.** `update` overwrites the previous content. The old text is not retained anywhere. This keeps the schema clean; a future version may add `memory_learn_history` plus an immutable `learnings_history` table for users who need point-in-time recovery. If you need an audit trail today, `memory_learn_archive(reason: "wrong")` the old learning and `memory_learn` the new one as a fresh row — the old text stays in the archived row.

### Reflection — what's important right now

```text
memory_reflect({ lookbackDays: 7, staleThresholdDays: 30 })
```

Aggregation pass over the recent memory stream — Stanford Generative Agents' reflection step, minus the LLM. Returns a structured payload PLUS a Markdown summary covering:

- **Most-used learnings** — top N by `usage_count` touched inside the lookback.
- **Stale learnings** — created longer than `staleThresholdDays` ago and never recalled. Archive candidates.
- **Hot entities** — top N by new observations inside the lookback.
- **Open decisions** — older than the lookback and `verified = 0`. Follow-up candidates.

The Markdown is for the LLM to read at session start; the structured fields are for downstream automation (Claude Code Hook, n8n workflow) that wants to react without reparsing. Pass `project` to scope to one project.

**Sleeptime via hooks.** Letta / Zep / Mem0 run reflection in a background "sleeptime" loop. We run on-demand because we're a stateless stdio daemon — but you get sleeptime semantics for free by wiring a Claude Code SessionStart or SessionEnd hook (or an n8n cron, or a `crontab` entry) that calls `memory_reflect`. The summary lands in the LLM's context at the same time as your `memory_session_start` snapshot. Zero new infrastructure.

## Tools (25)

### Sessions

**`memory_session_start`** -- Call this first in every conversation. Loads context from your last 3 sessions (summaries, recent learnings) so your AI knows what you were working on. Optional `project` parameter to scope sessions by project.

**`memory_session_end`** -- Call at the end to save a summary. Pass a `summary` string describing what was accomplished. The next session auto-loads this. Without arguments it closes the active session.

### Learnings

**`memory_learn`** -- The core tool. Stores a piece of knowledge with a category and content. Categories: `pattern` (recurring success), `mistake` (what went wrong), `insight` (strategic realization), `research` (external knowledge), `architecture`, `infrastructure`, `tool`, `workflow`, `performance`, `security`. The duplicate gatekeeper checks whether the identical content is already stored. If so, it bumps the usage counter instead of creating a duplicate. To extend an existing entry rather than add a new one, use `memory_learn_update` with its id. Optional: `tags`, `confidence` (0-1), `project`, `memoryType` (episodic or semantic, auto-classified if omitted).

**`memory_recall`** -- Quick search on learnings only. Pass a `query` string for keyword search, or omit it to get the most recent learnings. Good for "what did I learn about X" questions. Use `limit` to control how many results come back (default 10).

**`memory_search`** -- Unified search across everything: learnings, decisions, entities, and observations. Uses FTS5 with bm25 ranking. Multi-word queries match any of the words and rank by relevance. Use `types` array to filter (e.g. `["learning", "decision"]`). This is the broadest search tool.

**`memory_learn_archive`** *(v2.1+)* -- Soft-delete a learning. The row stays in the DB (so asOf queries that reference it still resolve) but never resurfaces in recall or search. Optional `reason` is stored on `lifecycle_state` as `archived:<reason>`. Idempotent — calling twice returns `already_archived`.

**`memory_learn_update`** *(v2.1+)* -- Edit a live learning (`content` / `confidence` / `tags`). At least one field is required. Bumps `usage_count` + `last_used` so an edit counts as a touch. Re-embeds atomically when `content` changes (F4 pattern: compute outside the transaction, write inside one sync `db.transaction()`). Rejects edits to archived learnings with `code: 'ARCHIVED'`.

**`memory_learn_bulk`** *(v2.2+)* -- Batch-insert up to 500 learnings in one atomic call. Each item takes the same fields as `memory_learn`. Exact-duplicate-only gatekeeper (no fuzzy merge) so the result is deterministic insert-or-skip; intra-batch duplicate contents collapse onto the first occurrence. Only the new contents are embedded, in one batched model forward pass. For restoring a backup, seeding a fresh DB, or migrating from another system.

**When to use recall vs search:** Use `recall` when you want learnings specifically. Use `search` when you want to find anything across all types, including entities and decisions.

### Decisions

**`memory_decide`** -- Records a decision with structured context. Parameters: `title` (what was decided), `decision` (the choice made), `reasoning` (why), `alternatives` (what else was considered). Optional: `confidence`, `project`, `tags`. This is useful for looking back at past decisions months later and understanding why you chose something.

### Knowledge Graph

**`memory_entity_observe`** -- Record a fact about a person, project, company, tool, or any other entity. If the entity does not exist yet it gets created automatically. Parameters: `entityName`, `entityType` (person, project, company, tool, concept, etc.), `content` (the fact). Observations are bi-temporal, meaning they can be superseded over time without losing history.

**`memory_entity_search`** -- Fuzzy search across entity names and their observations. Finds "Claude" even if you search for "claude ai". Optional `entityType` filter to narrow results.

**`memory_entity_open`** -- Load a full entity view: the entity itself, all its current observations, and all its relations to other entities. Search by `name` or `id`. *v2.1: optional `asOf` parameter for a bi-temporal point-in-time view — "what did I know about this entity on date X?"*

**`memory_entity_relate`** -- Create a typed, directed edge between two entities. Parameters: `fromEntityId`, `toEntityId`, `relationType` (e.g. "works_at", "uses", "created", "depends_on"). Optional `weight` (0-1). Build a graph of how things connect.

**`memory_contradictions`** *(v2.1+)* -- LLM-free scanner that surfaces observation pairs with high cosine similarity but disagreeing on negation markers or confidence. The AI client (Claude / Cursor) judges the candidates. Optional scope: `entityId` or `entityName + entityType`. Knobs: `minCosine` (default 0.75), `minConfidenceDrift` (default 0.2), `limit` (default 20). Requires `sqlite-vec` — returns `VECTOR_DISABLED` if not loaded.

**`memory_observation_supersede`** *(v2.2+)* -- The execution arm for `memory_contradictions`: retire a stale observation by setting `valid_to` (a tombstone). The row stays in the DB so an `asOf` query still surfaces it, but it drops out of live `memory_search` and `memory_entity_open`. Pass `supersededById` to set the cutoff to the newer fact's `valid_from` (Zep fact-supersession), `validTo` for an explicit instant, or neither for `now()`. Same-entity + self-supersede guards; idempotent.

**Recommended entity types:** `person`, `project`, `company`, `tool`, `concept`, `service`, `team`. Use whatever makes sense for your domain.

### Reflection

**`memory_reflect`** *(v2.1+)* -- Aggregation pass over the recent memory stream. Returns structured data plus a Markdown summary covering: most-used learnings (top N by usage_count touched in lookback), stale learnings (created > `staleThresholdDays` ago, never recalled), hot entities (top N by new observations in lookback), open decisions (`verified = 0`, older than lookback). LLM-free — Stanford Generative Agents' reflection step without the API call. Defaults: `lookbackDays: 7`, `staleThresholdDays: 30`, `limit: 5`. Optional `project` filter.

**`memory_insights`** -- Overview stats: how many days of memory, total sessions, learnings, decisions, entities. Category breakdown and entity type breakdown. Good for "what does Claude know about me" moments. Optional `project` filter.

**`memory_profile`** -- Store personal info locally. Use `set` to store fields (name, role, preferences, language, timezone), use `get` to retrieve them. Your AI can read this at session start to personalize its behavior.

**`memory_guide`** -- Built-in help. Topics: `quickstart` (how to get started), `session` (session workflow), `search` (how search works), `entities` (knowledge graph explained), `learn` (learning categories), `privacy` (where data lives, what is collected).

### Portability *(v2.2+)*

**`memory_export`** -- Dump the whole memory — learnings, decisions, entities, observations, relations, sessions, profile, goal — to a versioned, camelCase JSON envelope (`format: "studiomeyer-memory-export"`, `version: 1`). Embeddings are **not** exported; they're re-derived on import, so the file stays small and model-agnostic. Flags: `includeSessions` (default true), `includeArchived` (default true). You own your data — it's already a single SQLite file, and now it's a portable document too.

**`memory_import`** -- Ingest a `memory_export` envelope (`{ data: <envelope> }`). **Purely additive and idempotent**: every write is `INSERT OR IGNORE` on the source id, so re-importing the same file is a no-op and it never clobbers an existing row. FK-safe ordering with dangling-reference skips (a counted skip, never a throw). Re-embeds on the fly. There is no `replace` mode by design — to wipe a local store, delete `memory.sqlite`. The same envelope also imports into the hosted [StudioMeyer Memory](https://memory.studiomeyer.io) tier, so this is your on-ramp when you outgrow a single machine.

## Tips

- **Start with sessions and learnings.** Just calling `memory_session_start` at the beginning and `memory_learn` when something important comes up already gives you 80% of the value.
- **Use entities for people and projects.** When you mention a colleague, client, or project repeatedly, create an entity. Over time you build a knowledge graph that your AI can traverse.
- **Decisions are underrated.** Three months from now you will not remember why you chose Postgres over SQLite for that project. `memory_decide` captures the reasoning.
- **Let your AI drive.** Once the tools are available, your AI will naturally start using them. You do not need to call tools manually. Say "remember this" and it calls `memory_learn`. Say "what do you know about Sarah" and it calls `memory_entity_search`.
- **Back up your SQLite file.** It is a single file. Copy it to a USB drive, Dropbox, wherever. You can also open it with any SQLite browser to inspect what your AI has learned.

## Features

- **Knowledge Graph** -- not just flat text. Entities, bi-temporal observations, typed relations.
- **Duplicate Guard** -- FTS5 similarity check prevents storing the same thing twice. Usage counter instead.
- **Session Context** -- auto-loads last 3 sessions on start. Your AI picks up where you left off.
- **Decision Tracking** -- log decisions with reasoning and alternatives. Unique among memory servers.
- **Full-Text Search** -- FTS5 with bm25 ranking across learnings, decisions, entities, observations.
- **Single SQLite File** -- one file, portable, backupable, deletable. WAL mode for concurrent access.
- **Zero Config** -- `npx` and done. No Docker, no Postgres, no Redis, no API keys.

Start local. Upgrade when you need teams, multi-device sync, or cross-encoder rerank — `memory_export` produces an envelope that imports straight into the hosted tier, so you carry your whole memory across with you.

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the threat model, reporting process, and notes on known SAST scanner false positives. In particular: `db.exec(schema)` in `src/db/client.ts` is `better-sqlite3`'s SQL-string executor, not `child_process.exec` — some pattern-based scanners flag it without import resolution. The repo contains zero shell-execution code (verify with `grep -rn child_process src/`).
