## Why OpenTrip?

Group travel planning is usually a mess of group chats, spreadsheets, and half-updated maps. OpenTrip keeps the whole trip in one shared workspace:

- **See the route** — stops on a live map with day filters, weather, and place search
- **Own the day** — a schedule board per day so timing and transit stay clear
- **Spend fairly** — expenses, balances, and minimal settle-up transfers
- **Decide together** — votes, comments, and invites for the whole crew
- **Ask the agent** — a trip-aware AI companion when you need a second opinion

The seed demo is **Japan · Autumn** — Tokyo → Kyoto → Osaka, 5 days, 25 stops, and a full expense ledger ready to explore the moment you sign in.
