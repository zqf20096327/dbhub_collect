Keep a map of how your research develops: the questions you asked, the routes
you tried, what happened, and why you chose the next step. Your AI tools can
read and update the same record, so a new session can pick up where you left off.

## What you can do

- Organize questions, ideas, attempts and findings in a research tree.
- Record observations, evidence and decisions, including negative results
  and the conditions under which a conclusion holds.
- Connect related work across branches and inspect who changed what.
- Let external AI tools use the HTTP API or Python CLI, with revision checks
  that prevent one session from silently overwriting another.
- Run locally with Docker and keep your records in a persistent SQLite volume.
- Views and layouts (new): horizontal tree / vertical tree / outline list,
  with folds and viewport remembered per layout; one-click expand/collapse
  tools; zoom-driven density tiers (reading / compact / overview) and a
  low-interference mode; a resizable, collapsible detail panel; interface
  in Chinese or English.
- Write directly on the map (new): + route / + child open a draft card beside
  the parent; nothing is committed until you save, and a failed save keeps
  the draft for an idempotent retry.
- Markdown tables and managed images (new): insert GFM tables in node
  details; insert or paste images that upload as managed attachments and
  render inline with click-to-zoom. Images are served only through an
  authenticated endpoint (the token never appears in an image URL), and
  external image URLs are never fetched.
- Research versions and swimlanes (new): tag the plan with v1/v2/v3 phase
  labels (unrelated to the 记录 #N save counter); filtering by version keeps
  route ancestors visible as context, and the swimlane view lays versions ×
  top-level routes out as one progress grid.

The app displays the name **ResearchMap**.
Ideamify is the repository name; the CLI and `RESEARCHMAP_*` configuration
use the existing ResearchMap name. The app does not call a model or run
experiments for you. It is designed for one researcher and their trusted tools.

## Run it locally

You need Git and Docker with Compose. Run these commands in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sugarblock233/Ideamify.git
cd Ideamify
cp .env.example .env
```

The default `RESEARCHMAP_AUTH_MODE=local` needs no account or token. Compose
binds only to `127.0.0.1`; keep that binding for local mode. To serve remote
users, explicitly select `RESEARCHMAP_AUTH_MODE=token` and configure long,
random named tokens in `RESEARCHMAP_TOKENS` behind your protected network or
HTTPS proxy. Named AI tokens remain optional in local mode.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8000/** to see **My research projects** immediately.
Create a project, search by name/objective, or sort by latest update and open
any project card. Use **‹ ResearchMap** in a map to return to the manager. Choose **+ 一级路线** to add a route, then select a node and choose
**+ 子节点** to record an attempt or follow-up.

Follow [build your first research route map](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for a complete
walkthrough, including handing the research to an AI session.

Give a content-organizing AI the [research authoring guide](docs/RESEARCH_AUTHORING.md):
establish routes, divide them into questions, and explain the purpose and basis
of each step. Distinguish code, execution and conclusions. Top-level summaries
should be understandable without having run the experiments. This writing
method works with the current app.

## Keep using it

- **Save before leaving.** Node edits are saved explicitly. Reloading the page
  restores the current map without login in local mode. Unsaved drafts still
  need to be saved; returning to the manager warns before discarding them.
- **After an AI update**, use the in-app **刷新** button or **载入更新** to bring
  in new records. Review any conflicting fields before saving your draft.
- **Back up your data.** Restarting or rebuilding preserves the Compose
  volume. Follow [backup, restore and upgrades](docs/OPERATIONS.md) to protect
  it. Evidence links reference external files; those files need their own backup.

v0.1 is ready for personal use and feedback. The published `v0.1.0` tag is an
early release; `main` also includes subsequent fixes listed in the
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md). Future work will be driven by actual use.
