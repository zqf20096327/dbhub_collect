## Features

### Metadata Editing

- Edit **40+ metadata fields** inline — title, artist, album, year, genre, composer, BPM, lyrics, and more
- **Custom metadata** — add, edit, and remove your own custom tags beyond the standard fields
- **Album art** management — view, replace, and upload cover images directly
- **Star ratings** (1–5) with a visual widget
- Support for track/disc numbering, sort fields, catalog numbers, barcodes, and extended tags
- Read-only display of audio properties (codec, bitrate, sample rate, channels, bits per sample)

![Search and metadata editing](docs/basic-search.png)

### Change History

- **Full audit trail** of every metadata change with old and new values
- **Revert** individual changes or bulk-select and undo multiple edits at once
- Searchable history with shift+click and ctrl+click multi-selection
- Per-song and per-folder history views

![Song change history](docs/song-history.png)

### Music Player

- **Built-in audio player** with interactive waveform visualization (WaveSurfer.js)
- Play/pause, previous/next track navigation
- Click-to-seek on the waveform
- Auto-advance to next song
- Collapsible sidebar player with album art, title, and artist display
- **Listen history** — every play is recorded once you have heard half the track (or four minutes), and the
  *Recently played* view in the sidebar lists it back. Play counts and last played dates are kept per song.
- **ListenBrainz scrobbling** — optionally forward those listens to your ListenBrainz profile, including
  "playing now" while a track is running. See [Scrobbling](#scrobbling).

### Library Browsing

- **Three-panel layout** — folder tree, song list, and detail editor side by side
- **Folder tree** with hierarchical navigation and real-time search
- **Sorting** on any column — title, artist, album, year, duration, bitrate, date added, and dozens more
- **Advanced filtering** — text, numeric ranges, date ranges, and boolean filters across all fields
- **Customizable columns** — show/hide any of 40+ columns to match your workflow
- Virtual scrolling and infinite pagination for large libraries

</p>

### Users and Roles

- **Multiple users** — the admin account comes from `AUTH_USER` / `AUTH_PASSWORD`; every other user is created from
  the app itself, in **Settings → Users**
- **Roles** — a **Tagger** can browse, play, edit metadata and rescan the library; a **Listener** can only browse and
  play. The UI hides what a role cannot do, and the API enforces it on every request
- Create, rename, change the role of, or delete users at any time. Passwords are stored bcrypt-hashed
- **Per-user data** — listen history, play counts and the ListenBrainz connection all belong to the user who made them

## Quick Start with Docker

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suitux/Tagr/main/docker-compose.yml
```

### 2. Generate a secret key

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Copy the output — you'll use it as `AUTH_SECRET` in the next step.

### 3. Configure `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
services:
  tagr:
    image: ghcr.io/suitux/tagr:latest
    container_name: tagr
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - DATABASE_URL=file:/data/tagr.db
      - AUTH_SECRET=paste-your-generated-secret-here
      - AUTH_USER=admin
      - AUTH_PASSWORD=your-password-here
      - AUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
    volumes:
      - sqlite_data:/data
      # Mount your music folder into the container:
      - /path/to/your/music:/music

volumes:
  sqlite_data:
```

> **Multiple folders:** If your music is spread across different host paths, mount them as subdirectories under `/music`. Tagr scans `/music` recursively, so all subdirectories are included automatically:
>
> ```yaml
> volumes:
>   - /home/user/Music:/music/library
>   - /mnt/nas/Music:/music/nas
> ```
>
> Set `MUSIC_FOLDERS` only if you want to **restrict** scanning to specific subdirectories (e.g., scan `/music/library` but skip `/music/podcasts`).

### 4. Build and run

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Published images on GHCR are multi-arch and include `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

### 5. Open your browser

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), log in with your credentials, and hit the **scan** button to index your library.

## Manual Installation

Requirements: **Node.js 22+**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/suitux/Tagr.git
cd tagr
pnpm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
DATABASE_URL=file:./data/tagr.db
AUTH_SECRET="c5398a60cfd61607192d74ae8db237aaeaa07a98cd8ecdb8776c86eb87376ba3"

AUTH_USER="admin"
AUTH_PASSWORD="admin"

# Music folders (comma-separated paths)
# Example: /Users/youruser/Music,/Volumes/External/Music
MUSIC_FOLDERS="/Users/youruser/Music,/Volumes/External/Music"
```

Then start:

```bash
pnpm build && pnpm start # Production
# or
pnpm dev                 # Development mode
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | SQLite database path. Use `file:/data/tagr.db` in Docker or `file:./data/tagr.db` locally. |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Yes | Secret for signing JWT sessions. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| `AUTH_USER` | Yes | Username of the admin account. Additional users are created from **Settings → Users**. |
| `AUTH_PASSWORD` | Yes | Password of the admin account (plain text). |
| `MUSIC_FOLDERS` | No | Comma-separated list of paths to music directories. Defaults to `/music` if not set. |
| `PUID` | No | User ID for the container process. Defaults to `1000`. (Docker only) |
| `PGID` | No | Group ID for the container process. Defaults to `1000`. (Docker only) |

## Scrobbling

Tagr can send what you play to [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org). No environment variable is involved —
each user connects their own account:

1. Copy your user token from <https://listenbrainz.org/settings/>.
2. Open the menu next to the Tagr logo, choose **Settings → Third party integrations**, paste the token and hit
   **Verify and save**. Tagr checks the token against the service before storing it.
3. Leave *API root* empty unless you run your own ListenBrainz-compatible server.

![ListenBrainz settings](docs/settings-listenbrainz.png)

What gets sent:

- A `playing_now` update when a track starts.
- A listen once you have actually played half the track or four minutes, whichever comes first — the rule
  ListenBrainz itself defines. Tracks shorter than 30 seconds and tracks you skip early are never submitted.
- Title, artist, album, track number, duration and any MusicBrainz IDs stored in the file's tags.

Tokens are encrypted with a key derived from `AUTH_SECRET` before they touch the database and are never sent
back to the browser. Changing `AUTH_SECRET` invalidates stored tokens, so they have to be entered again.

If ListenBrainz is unreachable, listens are kept in a queue in the database and retried with an increasing
delay the next time you play something. The Settings dialog shows how many are still waiting. Listen history
and play counts inside Tagr are recorded regardless of whether scrobbling is configured.

## Docker Volumes

| Container Path | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `/data` | SQLite database. Persist with a named volume to avoid data loss. |
| `/music/*` | Mount points for your music libraries. |

## Architecture

```
Browser (React Query) --> Next.js API Routes --> Prisma --> SQLite
                                                   |
                                              audiotagr --> audio files on disk
```

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | React 19, TanStack Query, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS 4 |
| Backend | Next.js 16 App Router (route handlers) |
| Database | SQLite via Prisma 7 + LibSQL |
| Auth | NextAuth 5 (credentials provider, JWT sessions) |
| Tag read/write + library scanning | [audiotagr](https://github.com/suitux/audiotagr) |
| Audio Player | WaveSurfer.js |

### audiotagr

Every tag Tagr reads from or writes to your files goes through **[audiotagr](https://github.com/suitux/audiotagr)** ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/audiotagr)) — a standalone library extracted from this project and maintained in its own repo.

It is what actually talks to the audio files: scanning your folders, reading tags and audio properties, and writing your edits back to disk. It handles the per-format differences behind a single API — ID3v2 frames in MP3, Vorbis comments in FLAC and Ogg, iTunes atoms in M4A, ASF descriptors in WMA, APEv2 items — including the quirks that quietly corrupt tags otherwise, such as Style being folded into Genre or BPM landing in a field no reader looks at.

It is published under LGPL-3.0-only, so you can use it in your own projects whatever their license.
