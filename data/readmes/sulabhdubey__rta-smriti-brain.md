# Rta-Smriti Brain

**A sovereign, local project-memory and evidence layer for AI coding agents.**

Rta-Smriti gives every project a durable memory: repository structure, agent sessions,
decisions, evidence, and the exact state needed to continue work without retelling the story.

## v1.1B Governed Federation

**Current release: v1.1.0-alpha.4.** Trusted local operation now includes optional,
end-to-end encrypted collaboration over selected project memory.

> **Current maturity:** `v1.1.0-alpha.4` is an advanced early-adopter release for Windows,
> macOS, and Linux. It is useful for real projects, but it is not yet presented as a
> broadly supported production platform. Read the bounded
> [release verification record](docs/RELEASE_VERIFICATION.md).

## The Problem

Every new agent session begins with an expensive question: **what is true about this
project right now?** Repositories hold code, chats hold decisions, tools hold test
results, and people hold the constraints. Ordinary retrieval collapses them into text.

Rta-Smriti keeps them local, connected, time-aware, and evidence-labelled.

**Governed federation:** selected project memory is shared through explicit
scopes and device permissions. The screenshot deliberately includes an offline
relay and quarantined event to show recovery state rather than an all-green
marketing mock.

The [60-second v1 product demo](launch-assets/product-hunt/rta-smriti-v1.0.2-product-demo.mp4)
was captured from `v1.0.2`. It demonstrates the Project Reality foundation; the
`v1.1` Trusted Lifecycle Supervisor shown above was added later.

## How It Works

### 1. Build a local project brain

Rta-Smriti indexes the canonical Git checkout into project-scoped SQLite. It records
content hashes, symbols, imports, evidence, temporal state, and durable memories without
uploading the project to a hosted service.

### 2. Separate evidence from memory

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    O[Direct observation<br/>pratyaksha] --> T[Accepted project truth]
    S[Trusted instruction<br/>sabda] --> T
    I[Inference<br/>anumana] --> R[Review required]
    M[Prior memory<br/>smriti] --> R
    K[Hypothesis<br/>kalpana] --> R
    R -->|verified and promoted| T
```

A test result, a human instruction, an inference, and a brainstorm are not treated as
the same kind of fact. Claims retain their source, verification state, and valid time.

### 3. Compile only the context the next task needs

The context compiler selects direct evidence before low-trust history, obeys explicit
token budgets and privacy grants, and emits a selection receipt explaining what was
included and why.

Search results report task-anchor relevance. If a named project or product anchor is
missing, the quick context pack abstains and suppresses weakly overlapping evidence
until the operator selects or registers the intended project brain.

CLI and MCP context retrieval use validated query-only SQLite connections. Watcher,
capture, and continuity workers enter one FIFO writer queue per brain. Queue tickets
are atomically published and owner-private, stale tickets from terminated workers are
removed, and the active operating-system lease is released automatically after a crash.
Expired or cancelled waiters cannot enter the critical section. Repository and Codex
session discovery run before their workers join the write turn; shutdown drains use a
bounded final wait, while heartbeats remain responsive and oversized WALs are
checkpointed in bounded turns. Optional local-model continuity compaction also runs
outside the writer turn, then reacquires a bounded turn only to commit its unverified
derived result. Shutdown preserves the deterministic checkpoint without waiting on
optional model inference.
An active SQLite transaction remains atomic and is not preempted. This keeps retrieval
available during background learning without treating a read as a hidden database write.

Integrations can assert that boundary explicitly with `search --json --read-only`.
The JSON response includes `access.mode: read_only` and
`access.writes_performed: false` as a stable machine-readable contract.
When byte-identical sources exist in both current code and deployment/package
mirrors, retrieval selects the current source path and collapses the mirrors.
Query-only semantic retrieval loads Sentence Transformer models from the local cache
only, and CLI output is normalized to UTF-8 so indexed Unicode remains printable on
legacy Windows consoles.

### 4. Operate through one trustworthy boundary

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Inspect] --> B[Plan]
    B --> C[Review risks and backups]
    C --> D[Approve]
    D --> E[Apply]
    E --> F[Verify]
    F --> G[Immutable receipt]
    F -->|degraded| H[Repair or rollback]
    H --> F
```

Database, repository, capture, continuation, MCP, and federation health remain
independent. A running process alone never proves that continuation is ready.

### 5. Share only governed project memory

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Local owner brain] -->|signed encrypted events| R[Opaque relay]
    R -->|authorized scopes only| B[Local peer brain]
    A -->|encrypted invitation| B
    B -->|offline changes retain provenance| R
```

Federation is off by default. Operators explicitly create scopes, verify device
fingerprints, grant capabilities, preview mutations, and rotate keys after revocation.
Concurrent evidence and disagreement remain visible until an explicit decision.

## Ten-Minute Start

**Requirements:** Python 3.11 or newer and Git. Node.js is needed only to modify the
dashboard or website source.

The **v1 Project Reality CLI** is the shared entry point for onboarding, search,
continuation, lifecycle operation, MCP configuration, and the local console.

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/sulabhdubey/rta-smriti-brain.git
cd .\rta-smriti-brain
python -m venv .venv
& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install .
$RtaBrain = Join-Path $PWD ".venv\Scripts\rta-brain.exe"
$BrainDir = "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\Rta-Smriti\brains"
& $RtaBrain start C:\path\to\my-project --project my-project --brain-dir $BrainDir --write-agents
```

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS or Linux</strong></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sulabhdubey/rta-smriti-brain.git
cd rta-smriti-brain
python3 -m venv .venv
./.venv/bin/python -m pip install .
RtaBrain="$PWD/.venv/bin/rta-brain"
BrainDir="$HOME/.local/share/rta-smriti/brains"
"$RtaBrain" start /path/to/my-project --project my-project --brain-dir "$BrainDir" --write-agents
```

</details>

`start` detects the canonical Git root, creates or migrates the brain, indexes the
repository, starts managed sync, starts matching Codex continuity capture when local
sessions exist, and opens an authorized local console. Use `--no-continuity` on machines
without local Codex sessions.

Prefer a standalone binary? Download the Windows, macOS, or Linux artifact and its SBOM
from the [`v1.1.0-alpha.4` release](https://github.com/sulabhdubey/rta-smriti-brain/releases/tag/v1.1.0-alpha.4),
then verify it against `SHA256SUMS.txt`.

## Private By Default

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Machine[Your machine]
        P[Project checkout] --> R[Rta-Smriti]
        A[Authorized agent sessions] --> R
        R --> S[(Local SQLite brain)]
        R --> C[Loopback operator console]
        R --> M[Local MCP server]
    end
    R -. no telemetry .-> X[No Rta-Smriti cloud]
```

- Capture is opt-in, source-scoped, bounded, and redacted before durable queuing.
- Captured text remains untrusted evidence until verified or promoted.
- The console binds to loopback and uses short-lived session capabilities.
- Project names, paths, transcript content, databases, keys, and snapshots must not be
  published. Public diagnostics use bounded counts and fingerprints.
- Signed or encrypted snapshots are private backup artifacts, not publication formats.

Read the complete [security and privacy policy](SECURITY.md) before handling sensitive
repositories. Report vulnerabilities through the private process documented there.

```

Rta-Smriti is deliberately an evidence and continuity layer. It does **not** execute
project work, choose models, silently edit host configuration, or replace an agent
harness such as RTA-Net AI.

## Release Evidence

The current prerelease includes:

- cross-platform CI and native binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux;
- CycloneDX SBOMs and a signed workflow provenance trail;
- anonymous-download checksum verification;
- installed-package, CLI, dashboard, lifecycle, MCP, privacy, and security checks;
- encryption, signature, revocation, conflict, relay, recovery, and sustained-sync checks;
- an explicit record of host recipes versus hosts exercised live.

Green tests are not presented as proof of universal correctness. Exact scope, known
limits, and remaining external-host gates are recorded in
[Release Verification](docs/RELEASE_VERIFICATION.md).
