> [!NOTE]
> Supabase ETL is under active development. APIs and setup steps may change
> before the first stable release.

Supabase ETL is a high-performance Postgres replication engine written in Rust.
Embed it in your Rust application or run it as a standalone binary. For each
published table, it performs an initial sync of existing rows, then replicates
changes to a built-in or custom destination.

This repository contains the framework, destination modules, standalone
replicator, examples, and documentation. For the managed product in the
Supabase Dashboard—including availability, pricing, and operations—use the
[Supabase Pipelines documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/replication/pipelines).

## How It Works

```mermaid

    Postgres["Postgres publication"] --> Sync["Initial sync"]
    Sync --> Replication["Ongoing replication"]
    Replication --> Destination["Destination"]
```

Supabase ETL replicates each table in two phases:

1. **Initial sync:** Copy the existing rows selected by the publication, then
   catch up changes that occurred while the copy was running.
2. **Ongoing replication:** Capture subsequent inserts, updates, deletes, and
   truncates, then deliver those changes as ordered events.

Across both phases, a store persists checkpoints, schemas, destination
metadata, and table state so replication can recover safely after a restart.
Copy and change data capture (CDC) are replication paths, not customer-visible
phases. Initial sync uses the copy path followed by CDC catch-up; ongoing
replication uses the CDC path after the table is ready.

## Start Here

| Goal | Documentation |
| --- | --- |
| Build a working pipeline | [First Pipeline](https://supabase.github.io/etl/guides/first-pipeline/) |
| Run the standalone process | [Standalone Replicator](https://supabase.github.io/etl/guides/standalone-replicator/) |
| Prepare a source database | [Configure Postgres](https://supabase.github.io/etl/guides/configure-postgres/) |
| Implement a store or destination | [Custom Implementations](https://supabase.github.io/etl/guides/custom-implementations/) |
| Understand the runtime | [Architecture](https://supabase.github.io/etl/explanation/architecture/) |
| Browse runnable destinations | [`etl-examples`](crates/etl-examples/README.md) |

ETL is installed from Git while we prepare for a crates.io release:

```toml
[dependencies]
etl = { git = "https://github.com/supabase/etl" }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Why Supabase ETL?

- **Library or standalone binary:** Embed the engine in a Rust application or
  run the ready-made replicator.
- **High performance, small footprint:** Run one Rust process without Kafka,
  Flink, Debezium, or another coordination service.
- **Postgres-native selection:** Use publications to select tables, columns,
  rows, and operation types.
- **Flexible by design:** Implement custom destinations and durable stores with
  typed Rust APIs.
- **Recovery-aware:** Persist checkpoints and table state for safe restarts and
  at-least-once delivery.

## Independent Benchmark

**~33× lower tail latency. ~125× smaller measured runtime memory footprint.**
Compared with Debezium Server 3.1.3.Final in Hardbyte's
[independent CDC benchmark](https://github.com/hardbyte/postgresql-job-queue-benchmarking/blob/7b2919a0fd668a84efc68500ac94cfbfbd3b7356/results/cdc-sweep-long/REPORT.md#fanout_steady):
**26 ms vs. 848 ms** and **13 MB vs. 1,629 MB**, at 200 source changes/s
across four fast HTTP consumers.

Tested ETL `d206d66e` (July 2026) with a custom `HttpDestination` and
`MemoryStore`. Results compare specific configurations: versions, polling,
batching, destination, store, workload, and deployment all affect performance.
See [benchmark details](https://supabase.github.io/etl/reference/benchmarks/)
for versions, measurement methodology, and configuration differences.

## [Destinations](https://supabase.github.io/etl/reference/destinations/)

| Feature | Destination | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clickhouse` | ClickHouse | Private alpha |
| `bigquery` | Google BigQuery | Stable |
| `ducklake` | DuckLake | In progress |
| `snowflake` | Snowflake | In progress |
| `iceberg` | Apache Iceberg | Deprecated |

ClickHouse is the fastest way to start locally: `cargo x init` runs it, and
`cargo x setup replicator` configures it by default. BigQuery is the most
mature cloud destination. See the
[Destinations reference](https://supabase.github.io/etl/reference/destinations/)
for maturity and limitations, and the
[`etl-examples` guide](crates/etl-examples/README.md) for runnable examples.

## Requirements

Supabase ETL supports PostgreSQL 14 through 18. PostgreSQL 15 or newer is
recommended for column and row publication filters. PostgreSQL 16 or newer is
required when the replication connection points at a physical read replica.

The source must use `wal_level = logical`, and the replication user needs the
`REPLICATION` role. See [Configure Postgres](https://supabase.github.io/etl/guides/configure-postgres/)
for the complete setup and production guidance.

## Container images

The standalone replicator is publicly available; no private registry credentials
are required. Set `IMAGE_TAG` to a published full commit SHA or release tag:

```bash
docker pull "public.ecr.aws/supabase/etl-replicator:$IMAGE_TAG"
```

Each newly published tag contains Linux AMD64 and ARM64 images. Docker selects
the host architecture automatically; use `--platform linux/amd64` or
`--platform linux/arm64` to select it explicitly. Pin deployments to a commit,
release tag, or digest. `latest` follows the current `main` tip and is mutable.
Manual builds publish only `<full-commit-sha>-experimental`, even for commits on `main`.

The image includes the replicator, the DuckLake maintenance binary, and DuckDB
extensions. Supply configuration at runtime; see the
[replicator guide](crates/etl-replicator/README.md).

## Development

```bash
cargo x init              # Docker, databases, migrations
cargo x setup replicator && cargo x seed && cargo x run replicator
```

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) to start the replicator, pick a
destination, and run tests. The workspace uses Rust 1.95.0 from
`rust-toolchain.toml`.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Before proposing a new destination, start a
[discussion or issue](https://github.com/supabase/etl/issues) so maintainership
and long-term demand can be evaluated first.
