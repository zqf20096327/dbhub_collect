## Is This Vibe-Coded Slop?

Short answer: **no**.

Longer answer: most of the project was developed without any assistance. Around
Dec 2025, I started using coding agents, but — as Freud would put it — I'm
particularly anal when it comes to architecture and coding style, so it's very
difficult for me to just accept stock AI-generated code.

Currently (Feb 2026), my AI-assisted workflow (which you can see in PR commits)
is the following:

1. I ask Claude or Codex to implement small feature X. They open a draft PR.
2. I test that the feature "more or less works", and keep asking for changes
   until it does.
3. I comb through the generated files, changing names, simplifying loops,
   removing overly defensive code, adding missing automated tests, etc. I do
   this over and over (combined with manual testing) until I'm satisfied with
   the result, and I push a "fix vibed code" commit.
4. I ask AIs to review the PR, go through the comments, and address the
   meaningful ones.

It often happens that, around step 1 or step 2, I realize that, architecturally,
the coding agent's implementation is just wrong. So I bin the PR, draw up a
better prompt laying out the architecture I have in mind, and start over.

Does this speed me up? I feel like it, but it's hard to tell for sure. It
definitely makes me more productive, though, because it lowers the effort
required to get started on something.
