# crud-bench

The crud-bench benchmarking tool is an open-source benchmarking tool for testing and comparing the performance of a
number of different workloads on embedded, networked, and remote databases. It can be used to compare both SQL and NoSQL
platforms including key-value, embedded, relational, document, and multi-model databases. Importantly crud-bench focuses
on testing additional features which are not present in other benchmarking tools, but which are available in SurrealDB.

The primary purpose of crud-bench is to continually test and monitor the performance of features and functionality built
in to SurrealDB, enabling developers working on features in SurrealDB to assess the impact of their changes on database
queries and performance.

The crud-bench benchmarking tool is being actively developed with new features and functionality being added regularly.

## Contributing

The crud-bench benchmarking tool is open-source, and we encourage additions, modifications, and improvements to the
benchmark runtime, and the datastore implementations.

## How does it work?

When running simple, automated tests, the crud-bench benchmarking tool will automatically start a Docker container for
the datastore or database which is being benchmarked (when the datastore or database is networked). This configuration
can be modified so that an optimised, remote environment can be connected to, instead of running a Docker container
locally. This allows for running crud-bench against remote datastores, and distributed datastores on a local network
or remotely in the cloud.

In one table, the benchmark will operate 5 main tasks:

- Create: inserting N unique records, with the specified concurrency.
- Read: read N unique records, with the specified concurrency.
- Update: update N unique records, with the specified concurrency.
- Scans: perform a number of range and table scans, with the specified concurrency.
- Delete: delete N unique records, with the specified concurrency.

With crud-bench almost all aspects of the benchmark engine are configurable:

- The number of rows or records (samples).
- The number of concurrent clients or connections.
- The number of concurrent threads (concurrent messages per client).
- Whether rows or records are modified sequentially or randomly.
- The primary id or key type for the records.
- The row or record content including support for nested objects and arrays.
- The scan specifications for range or table queries.

### Comparing `result*.json` files in the browser

Open [`compare/index.html`](compare/index.html) locally (drag and drop benchmark JSON artefacts). Rows and labels match CLI/CSV ordering from [`src/result.rs`](src/result.rs). Nothing is uploaded; ApexCharts loads from jsDelivr (works offline only if that script is cached or vendored beside the HTML file).

Workload shape (document template, scan cases, and batch throughput tests) is defined in a single TOML file. Use
`--config <PATH>` or the environment variable `CRUD_BENCH_CONFIG` (default: `config/bench.toml`).

### Value

The `[value]` table in the benchmark TOML customizes the row, document, or record value used in the benchmark. It uses
the same JSON-oriented template rules as before, expressed as TOML keys and nested tables.

> [!NOTE]
> For tabular, or column-oriented databases (e.g. Postgres, MySQL, ScyllaDB), the first-level fields of the JSON
> structure are translated as columns, and any nested structures will be stored in a JSON column where possible.

Within the JSON structure, the following values are replaced by randomly generated data:

- Every occurrence of `string:X` will be replaced by a random string with `X` characters.
- Every occurrence of `text:X` will be replaced by a random string made of words of 2 to 10 characters, for a total of
  `X` characters.
- Every occurrence of `string:X..Y` will be replaced by a random string between `X` and `Y` characters.
- Every occurrence of `text:X..Y` will be replaced by a random string made of words of 2 to 10 characters, for a total
  between `X` and `Y` characters.
- Every `int` will be replaced by a random integer (i32).
- Every `int:X..Y` will be replaced by a random integer (i32) between `X` and `Y`.
- Every `float` will be replaced by a random float (f32).
- Every `float:X..Y` will be replaced by a random float (f32) between `X` and `Y`.
- Every `uuid` will be replaced by a random UUID (v4).
- Every `bool` will be replaced by a `true` or `false`.
- Every `string_enum:A,B,C` will be replaced by a string from `A` `B` or `C`.
- Every `int_enum:A,B,C` will be replaced by a i32 from `A` `B` or `C`.
- Every `float_enum:A,B,C` will be replaced by a f32 from `A` `B` or `C`.
- Every `datetime` will be replaced by a datetime (ISO 8601).
- Every `vector:X` will be replaced by an `X`-dimension vector with uniform components in `[-1, 1]`.
- Every `vector:X:LO..HI` will be replaced by an `X`-dimension vector with uniform components in `[LO, HI]`.
- Every `vector:X:clustered:N` will be replaced by an `X`-dimension unit vector drawn from a mixture
  of `N` clusters. Add `:SIGMA` (default `0.35`) to widen or tighten the clusters.

```json
{
  "text": "text:30",
  "text_range": "text:10..50",
  "bool": "bool",
  "string_enum": "enum:foo,bar",
  "datetime": "datetime",
  "float": "float",
  "float_range": "float:1..10",
  "float_enum": "float:1.1,2.2,3.3",
  "integer": "int",
  "integer_range": "int:1..5",
  "integer_enum": "int:1,2,3",
  "uuid": "uuid",
  "nested": {
    "text": "text:100",
    "array": [
      "string:10",
      "string:2..5"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Scans

Scan workloads are defined by `[[scans]]` entries in the benchmark TOML (see `config/bench.toml`). Each table describes
one logical benchmark (or multiple `[[scans.runs]]` variants). The JSON examples below remain valid documentation for the
fields on each scan object.

> [!NOTE]
> Not every database benchmark adapter supports scans or range queries. In such cases, the benchmark will not fail but
> the associated tests will indicate that the benchmark was `skipped`.

Unknown keys are rejected. A misplaced or misspelled key used to be dropped in silence, so a run would report a healthy-looking number for a configuration nobody had written — the same failure mode the vector-search measurement work exists to eliminate. Parsing now fails and names the offending key and the table it appeared in.

Each scan object can make use of the following values:

- `id` (**required**): Stable identifier for grouping in the CLI, result tables, CSV output, and for **index create/drop** when `with_index` is present and not skipped. Use a simple identifier (e.g. `where_field_integer_eq`); human-readable titles live in `name` / run `name` and may contain characters that are not valid in SurrealDB or Neo4j index names.
- `name`: A descriptive name for the test (use this **or** `runs`, not both).
- `runs`: An array of `{ "name", "iterations"?, "projection"?, "vector_query"? }` objects that share the same scan parameters (`condition`, `with_index`, and so on). Each run becomes a separate benchmark with its own display name. Per-run `iterations`, `projection` and `vector_query` override the entry-level value when both are set; if a run omits one, the entry-level value applies (`projection` defaulting to full-record scans like a single-object entry without `projection`). A per-run `iterations` matters when one array mixes leg kinds — a bruteforce KNN leg is a full table scan costing seconds per query at 100k rows, while the graph-index legs beside it answer in under a millisecond, and no single count suits both.
- `projection`: The projection type of the scan:
    - `"ID"`: only the ID is returned.
    - `"FULL"`: the whole record is returned.
    - `"COUNT"`: count the number of records.
- `start`: Skips the specified number of rows before starting to return rows.
- `limit`: Specifies the maximum number of rows to return.
- `expect`: (optional) Asserts the expected number of rows returned.
- `clients` / `threads`: (optional) Concurrency for this scan's timed legs, overriding `--clients`
  and `--threads`. `clients` is capped at the pool `--clients` created. Index DDL is unaffected — it
  always runs on a single client.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "paging_limit_100",
    "name": "limit100",
    "projection": "FULL",
    "start": 0,
    "limit": 100,
    "expect": 100
  },
  {
    "id": "paging_start_100",
    "name": "start100",
    "projection": "ID",
    "start": 100,
    "limit": 100,
    "expect": 100
  }
]
```

Multiple benchmarks that share the same filter, index, and write settings can use `runs` instead of duplicating the object:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "idx_x_eq_1",
    "runs": [
      { "name": "select(*) where(x = 1)", "projection": "FULL" },
      { "name": "count(*) where(x = 1)", "projection": "COUNT" }
    ],
    "iterations": 10000,
    "condition": { "sql": "x = 1", "mysql": "x = 1" },
    "with_index": { "fields": ["x"] }
  }
]
```

#### Index build time

An `[I]ndex · … · build` row is timed from the build call until the index **serves at index speed**,
which for some engines is long after the build call returns. The two moments coincide for an engine
whose build call does all the work, and can be minutes to hours apart for one that finishes the index
in the background; only the later one means the same thing for both. At 100k rows × 768-d, HNSW
`M 16` / `EFC 200` — one run per engine on a shared machine, so the absolute times are only
indicative; the split is the point:

| engine | build call returned | index queryable | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| pgvector | 2 m 19 s | 2 m 19 s | `CREATE INDEX` is synchronous |
| Redis | 4.5 ms | 12.1 s | `FT.CREATE` accepts the schema; documents are indexed afterwards |
| SurrealDB | 12.9 s | 2 m 50 s | `ready` follows row enumeration; the graph is built afterwards |

Timing the build call alone reported the first column. At 1M rows that made SurrealDB look ~28×
faster to build than pgvector — 56 s against 25 m 29 s — while its index was still being built an
hour later. So each engine's wait for its index to become queryable — pending entries drained,
materialisation finished, background indexing complete — is part of the timed build, and the CPU and
memory sampled for the build row cover it too.

The build call's own time is kept as a diagnostic, `build_returned` in the JSON and `Build_returned`
in the CSV. It is deliberately not in the summary table: it is the figure that does **not** mean the
same thing across engines. Result files written before this change lack `index_build_timing` in
their metadata, and the comparison viewer flags a mix of old and new files rather than setting one
definition's number beside the other's.

A search is only ever timed against an index that has finished. For SurrealDB that means waiting
until `INFO FOR INDEX` reports `ready`, no `pending` entries, **and** `compacting: false` — `ready`
alone arrives while a vector index is still being built from per-record pending entries, and a kNN
query in that state scores the remainder by hand. A server that does not report `compacting` cannot
say when that has finished, so crud-bench **skips** HNSW and DiskANN legs there, reporting `-`,
rather than time a scan wearing the index's name. SurrealDB 3.3.0 is the first release that reports
it, so both the crate embedded mode links (`-e memory`, `-e rocksdb:…`, `-e surrealkv:…`) and the
nightly Docker image server mode uses by default are covered; releases before 3.3.0 defer the same
work without reporting it, and get the skip.

The wait is bounded by `--operation-timeout`, like every timed operation. A build that used to fit
in the 30-minute default can stop fitting once its materialisation counts — a large vector index is
the usual case — and the error then says so; raise the timeout to allow for it. Readiness is polled
at a tenth of the time waited so far, between 10 ms and 250 ms, so a reported build is at most
`max(10 ms, min(10%, 250 ms))` late: a sub-second build is not rounded up to a whole poll interval.

### Vector search

Vector workloads live in [`config/vector.toml`](config/vector.toml). Each `[scans.runs.vector_query]`
block describes one KNN benchmark:

- `field` (**required**): the `vector:<dim>` column to search. The index, when the strategy needs
  one, is derived from this — do not also declare `with_index`.
- `top_k` (**required**): number of neighbours to return.
- `distance`: `cosine` (default), `euclidean`, `inner_product`, or `manhattan`.
- `index_strategy` (**required**): `{ kind = "bruteforce" }`, `{ kind = "hnsw", m, ef_construction,
  ef_search }`, or `{ kind = "diskann", degree, l_build, alpha, l_search }`. All knobs are required —
  results without explicit parameters cannot be interpreted. The search-time knob (`ef_search`,
  `l_search`) also accepts a **list**, which is swept: see below.
- `holdout`: `{ count, seed }` for the query set. Query vectors are generated from `seed` using the
  schema's own vector generator and are **never inserted**, so no query is its own nearest neighbour.
- `filters`: a list of predicates the KNN result is restricted to, one timed leg each plus an
  unfiltered baseline — see [Filtered KNN](#filtered-knn).
- `filter_index`: `true` to index each filter column before the legs (untimed) and drop it after —
  see [Indexed filter columns](#indexed-filter-columns). Default `false`.
- `tie_epsilon`: relative tolerance when deciding whether a returned neighbour counts as correct
  (default `0.0`, i.e. strict recall@k). Engines compute distances at different precisions, so rows
  straddling the k-th boundary can swap without any real quality difference; a small tolerance stops
  that reading as a recall gap.

#### Engine support

| engine | bruteforce | HNSW | DiskANN | filtered | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SurrealDB (3.x) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (HNSW + DiskANN) | `<\|k,ef\|>` operator; DiskANN needs a build that has the DDL; HNSW and DiskANN legs need a server that reports `building.compacting` (see [Index build time](#index-build-time)) |
| SurrealDB (2.x) | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | 2.6 has no DiskANN; filtered legs are declined, not answered unfiltered |
| PostgreSQL | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | pgvector; DiskANN would need pgvectorscale |
| Redis Stack | ✓ (FLAT) | ✓ | — | ✓ | no native L1/Manhattan metric |
| everything else | — | — | — | — | the run is skipped, not failed |

Engines without vector support skip these runs rather than failing, so a mixed run reports `-` for
them rather than aborting. A leg whose strategy needs an index it cannot build is skipped the same
way.

#### Vector data

Use `vector:<dim>:clustered:<n>` rather than `vector:<dim>` for anything whose recall you intend to
read. Uniform components leave a corpus with no neighbourhood structure — under distance
concentration every pair sits at roughly the same distance, so a query's true neighbours are
conspicuous and any index walks straight to them. Measured over 20k 128-d rows, the nearest neighbour
sits at 65% of a random pair's distance under `vector:128`, and at 8% under
`vector:128:clustered:200`. Recall only tells you anything on the second.

Clusters are drawn from the corpus seed, so two seeds give two genuinely different datasets rather
than one structure populated differently. Query vectors come from the same generator, so they follow
the corpus distribution by construction.

Corpus size matters more than dimension. Dimension scales cost linearly without making the search
harder; rows add candidates that can confuse a graph. Measured against embedded SurrealDB at 128
dimensions, neither graph index beats a linear scan below ~100k rows — at 200k, HNSW is 1.7x faster
than bruteforce and DiskANN 3.4x. Treat 100k as a floor, and 1M as the size worth quoting, which also
matches the scale of the standard ANN datasets.

#### Parameter sweeps

`ef_search` and `l_search` accept a list as well as a single value:

```toml
index_strategy = { kind = "hnsw", m = 16, ef_construction = 200, ef_search = [16, 32, 64, 128, 256] }
```

Each value becomes its own timed leg, all sharing a **single** index build, and each is reported as a
separate row labelled with the value it used. A lone `ef_search` is one arbitrary point on a curve —
the comparison worth making is the curve itself, what recall an index reaches at a given latency
budget — and tracing it this way costs one index build rather than one per point.

Values must be at least `top_k`: a search budget narrower than `k` cannot return `k` neighbours.

Engines apply the budget differently and crud-bench hides the difference. SurrealDB carries it in the
KNN operator, Redis passes `EF_RUNTIME` on the query rather than fixing it at `FT.CREATE`, and
pgvector takes it from the `hnsw.ef_search` session GUC, which is applied to every client before each
leg — a setting made only on the client that built the index would reach one session out of
`--clients`.

#### Filtered KNN

Filtered workloads live in [`config/vector-filtered.toml`](config/vector-filtered.toml). Where the
unfiltered config asks how fast and how accurately an index finds the nearest neighbours, this one
asks the question production asks: *among the rows that match this predicate*.

```toml
[scans.runs.vector_query]
field = "embedding"
top_k = 10
distance = "cosine"
index_strategy = { kind = "hnsw", m = 16, ef_construction = 200, ef_search = [16, 64, 128, 256] }
filters = [
    { name = "sel~1%", field = "number", op = "lte", value = 50 },
    { name = "sel~10%", field = "number", op = "lte", value = 500 },
    { name = "tag~33%", field = "status", op = "eq", value = "published" },
]
```

Each predicate becomes its own timed leg, and an **unfiltered leg runs first under the same index
build and the same warm index** — "what does filtering cost?" is not answerable against a baseline
measured somewhere else. Legs are the cross product of the search sweep and the filter list, all over
a single build, since the index does not depend on the predicate.

Why this is worth measuring separately: engines answer a filtered query in structurally different
ways, and the differences do not show up in latency.

| strategy | accuracy | latency | failure mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| pre-filter | exact | grows as the predicate widens | a wide predicate degenerates to a full scan |
| post-filter | drops as the predicate narrows | fast, and fastest when worst | a top-10 query at 1% selectivity can return nothing |
| filtered traversal | in between | in between | can stall when matching rows are scattered across the graph |

Post-filtering — search the index for `k`, then discard the hits that do not match — is the *fastest*
of the three and the least useful, because the `k` the index chose were chosen without knowing about
the predicate. A latency column rewards it. Recall is what exposes it, which is why every filtered
leg is scored against an answer key computed **per predicate**: exact top-k among the matching rows,
computed in the harness from the seeded corpus.

##### What this actually measures

Measured on 20k rows of 128-d clustered vectors, `top_k = 10`, HNSW `m = 16 / efc = 200 /
ef_search = 64`, one client — all three engines answering the identical questions against the
identical answer key:

| engine | exact leg | HNSW unfiltered | HNSW @ 10% | HNSW @ 33% | latency @ 10% vs unfiltered |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SurrealDB 3.x | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 3.6 ms → 16.8 ms (**4.6x**) |
| Redis Stack | 1.000 | 0.996 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0.50 ms → 0.54 ms (flat) |
| PostgreSQL (pgvector) | 1.000 | 1.000 | **0.656** (p5 **0.30**) | 0.998 | 0.83 ms → 0.70 ms (flat) |

Three structurally different answers to the same question, and **the latency columns rank pgvector
first**. It is the only one of the three that loses a third of the true neighbours at 10%
selectivity, and its worst 5% of queries lose 70% of theirs — while costing no more than the
unfiltered query, because it never looked at the rows it skipped. SurrealDB pays 4.6x in latency and
keeps every neighbour; Redis pays nothing measurable and keeps every neighbour.

That is the entire argument for scoring filtered legs against a filter-aware answer key rather than
timing them. No amount of latency measurement distinguishes the first row from the third.

The divergence is not only between engines. DiskANN on the same SurrealDB build, same corpus, same
predicates, sweeping `l_search`:

| `l_search` | unfiltered | @ 10% | @ 33% |
|---|---|---|---|
| 50 | 1.000 (0.88 ms) | **0.512** (p5 0.20, 1.09 ms) | 1.000 (1.13 ms) |
| 200 | 1.000 (0.90 ms) | 1.000 (2.46 ms) | 1.000 (1.33 ms) |
| 400 | 1.000 (0.95 ms) | 1.000 (2.63 ms) | 1.000 (1.47 ms) |

A traversal budget that is ample unfiltered — `l_search = 50` reaches exact at every budget with no
predicate — finds barely half the true neighbours once a 10%-selective predicate is applied, and
needs roughly 4x the budget to recover. Where SurrealDB's HNSW absorbed the same predicate by
traversing harder at a fixed `ef_search` (4.6x latency, recall intact), DiskANN keeps its latency and
loses recall instead. And at `l_search = 50` the *wrong* answer is the faster one — 1.09 ms against
2.46 ms — so latency picks it again.

This is why the filter list expands against the search sweep rather than beside it: the search budget
a filtered query needs depends on the selectivity, and any single point would have reported DiskANN
as either broken or fine depending on an arbitrary choice.

It is also why the low end of each shipped ladder sits **below** saturation and should stay there. A
ladder whose every point already reaches exact prints a flat column of `1.000` and measures nothing —
the recall equivalent of reporting latency with no recall column. The starved point is what makes the
effect visible, and the unfiltered leg beside it at the same budget is what identifies it as a
budget/selectivity interaction rather than a defect.

The HNSW ladder, `ef_search = [16, 64, 128, 256]`, is calibrated at the scale the config is meant
for ([#290](https://github.com/surrealdb/crud-bench/issues/290)). Unfiltered recall@10 at 1M × 768-d:

| `ef_search` | 16 | 64 | 128 | 256 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| pgvector | 0.516 | 0.821 | 0.937 | 0.975 |
| Redis | 0.463 | 0.774 | 0.904 | 0.966 |

16 sits clearly under the knee, 64 and 128 across it, 256 near saturation. The ladder it replaced,
`[32, 128]`, was chosen on a 20k × 128-d smoke run on the guess that it was already saturated; at 1M
it was not (32 reads 0.670 / 0.608). Budgets saturate at different points as a corpus grows, which is
why the calibration had to happen at the target scale. Selective predicates do not follow the budget
at all — at 1% pgvector's post-filter never passes 0.271 on this ladder, while Redis brute-forces the
matching rows at 1.000 — so the ladder is chosen on the unfiltered and 50% columns.

The DiskANN ladder, `[50, 200]`, is **not calibrated**. DiskANN runs only on SurrealDB, whose 1M arm
is blocked: the index keeps materialising for over an hour after reporting ready, so there is nothing
yet to calibrate against.

Note every **exact** leg reads `1.000` under both predicates on all three engines. That is the check
that the three renderings select the same rows the harness does: if SurrealQL, ANSI SQL and the
RediSearch expression disagreed with the in-process predicate by even one row, exact search could not
score a perfect recall against it.

##### Predicate grammar

A filter is `{ name, field, op, value }`:

- `name`: labels the leg in the results. Must be unique within a scan; it is not part of the
  ground-truth cache key, so renaming a predicate does not invalidate a computed answer key.
- `field`: an `integer`, `float`, `string` or `bool` column from the value template. Other column
  types are rejected — a datetime or decimal filter would need per-engine literal formats and
  collation rules, and getting either subtly wrong leaves two engines answering different questions.
- `op`: `eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `lte`, `gt`, `gte`, or `in`. The ordering operators require a numeric
  column; `in` takes a list and is the natural way to dial selectivity on a categorical column.
- `value`: a literal, or a list for `in`. Text literals are restricted to letters, digits, space and
  `_-./+:@` — every engine here quotes strings differently, and a mis-escaped literal does not fail
  loudly, it silently selects a different set of rows in one engine than in another.

The predicate has to be something crud-bench can evaluate, not an opaque per-dialect string like
`scan.condition`. That is what makes a filter-aware answer key possible at all: the harness
reconstructs the seeded corpus, applies the same predicate, and computes exact top-k over the rows it
admits.

##### Selectivity is measured, not declared

The ground-truth sweep regenerates every row anyway, so it counts matches while it is there. The
share that actually matched is reported in the leg label and in the `Filter` column of the summary
table (`Filter_selectivity` in CSV, `filter_selectivity` in JSON). Names like `sel~1%` are intentions;
the reported figure is what the corpus did.

This also makes the sweep *cheaper* rather than dearer: a non-matching row is skipped before any
distance is computed, so a 1%-selective predicate pays for about 1% of the arithmetic.

A predicate that matches no rows fails the run rather than reporting it. Every query would have an
empty answer, recall would be undefined, and the timed leg would be measuring an engine returning
nothing — a configuration mistake, not a result.

##### How each engine is asked

| engine | rendering |
|---|---|
| SurrealDB (3.x) | `WHERE <field> <\|k,ef\|> $q AND <pred>`, with the KNN operator leading — HNSW and DiskANN share this path; bruteforce gets a plain `WHERE` before the `ORDER BY` |
| PostgreSQL | `SELECT id FROM record WHERE <pred> ORDER BY <field> <op> $1 LIMIT k` |
| Redis Stack | `(<pred>)=>[KNN k @v $q …]`, a hybrid query; filter columns are mirrored into the `vec:{key}` HASH and declared `NUMERIC` / `TAG CASESENSITIVE` in `FT.CREATE` |

`CASESENSITIVE` matters: RediSearch folds case on TAG fields by default, which would admit rows the
answer key excludes and produce a systematic recall error that looks like an index fault.

SurrealDB 2.x declines filtered legs and reports `-`. Running the unfiltered query and scoring it
against a filter-aware answer key would report a recall collapse that says nothing about the engine,
and a skip is distinguishable from that where a wrong number is not.

DiskANN is filtered wherever it exists, which today is SurrealDB 3.x alone — it shares the index path
above with HNSW. Neither pgvector nor Redis Stack ships a DiskANN index, so there is nowhere else to
apply it; pgvectorscale's `diskann` would be a separate adapter and is tracked in #284.

##### Indexed filter columns

Whether the filter column is indexed changes how an engine can answer, far more than any search
parameter does. Without an index it has to test the predicate candidate by candidate as it
searches; with one it can start from the rows that match. That is a property of the schema, not the
engine, so it is a switch — `filter_index = true` on a `vector_query` — and
`config/vector-filtered.toml` runs every strategy both ways, the second labelled `· filter index`.

Each distinct filter column is indexed after the vector index and before the first leg, so the
unfiltered baseline runs against the same schema, and dropped after the last. The build is not timed:
it is schema setup, not the index under test.

| engine | what `filter_index` does |
|---|---|
| SurrealDB (3.x) | `DEFINE FIELD <col> ON record TYPE <int\|float\|string\|bool>` plus a b-tree index; both removed afterwards |
| PostgreSQL | a b-tree index, then `ANALYZE` so the planner can cost it straight after a bulk load |
| Redis Stack | nothing: filter columns are already `NUMERIC` / `TAG` fields of the vector index, so the two variants measure the same configuration |
| SurrealDB (2.x) | declined (`-`), like every filtered leg |

SurrealDB needs the declared type. Its KNN pre-filter turns an indexed predicate into an allow-list
of matching records — scored exactly when few match, without touching the graph — but only trusts a
b-tree index on a column that cannot hold arrays: on a schemaless table an array value fans out to one
index entry per element, so the index could admit rows the predicate rejects. With an index and no
declared type the plan does not change. At 1% selectivity on 50k × 768-d, the pre-filter took a
filtered HNSW query from 1.1 s and recall 0.96 to 25 ms and 1.000
([#314](https://github.com/surrealdb/crud-bench/issues/314)).

`--skip-indexes` removes `filter_index` scans along with the other index builds.

Two caveats worth knowing when reading the numbers:

- **pgvector runs with its defaults.** Without `filter_index` it post-filters its HNSW scan, its
  documented default (`hnsw.iterative_scan = off`). Iterative scans are not exercised yet
  ([#312](https://github.com/surrealdb/crud-bench/issues/312)).
- **Redis mirrors filter columns on every write.** They ride in the same `HSET` as the embedding, so
  the cost is marginal, but the create and update phases of a filtered config are not byte-identical
  in work to those of `config/vector.toml`.

```bash
cargo run -r -- -d surrealdb -s 100000 -c 12 -t 24 --config config/vector-filtered.toml
```

#### Concurrency

Vector legs default to `clients = 1`, `threads = 1` in `config/vector.toml`, and that default is
load-bearing. Once an index is warm a KNN query answers in well under a millisecond, so at the
benchmark's usual concurrency the timed legs measure queueing rather than search: the same query
measured **0.4 ms at one client and roughly 1500 ms at sixty-four**. Raise the setting to measure
throughput under load — that is a legitimate thing to want — but do not read the latency columns of
such a run as search cost.

The first leg timed after an index build is also warmed with untimed queries first. Without that it
absorbs the whole cost of warming the index, and not by a little: on a 50k-row HNSW the first leg
measured ~295 ms per query against ~0.5 ms for the identical query in the leg that followed, and it
was *more accurate* as well — a cold index answers differently, not just slower.

#### Recall

An approximate index has a free parameter — `ef_search`, `l_search` — that trades accuracy for
latency, so a latency number on its own cannot tell a fast index from an inaccurate one. Every KNN
run is therefore scored for recall@k, reported as `mean / 5th percentile` in the summary table and in
full in the JSON and CSV output. The 5th percentile is shown because a mean can look healthy while a
tail of queries is answered badly.

Ground truth is computed by crud-bench itself and shared by every engine, rather than taken from each
engine's own bruteforce leg. Scoring an engine against itself measures whether its index agrees with
its own exact path — useful for tracking regressions, but not a number that can sit beside another
engine's, because a quirk shared by an engine's exact and approximate paths cancels out and divergent
metric definitions leave every engine near 1.0 against itself. A useful side effect: each engine's
own bruteforce leg is scored too, and should read `1.000`. Anything less is a metric divergence or an
engine bug.

Recall needs a reproducible corpus, so a vector config must set `seed` (or the run must pass
`--corpus-seed`). Row content then becomes a pure function of the seed and the sample index, which
also means the same dataset is benchmarked across engines and across runs. Without a seed the KNN
runs still execute and report latency, and print why recall is unavailable.

The answer key is a pure function of its inputs — both seeds, the sample count, `top_k`, the metric,
the field, and the value template — so it is computed once, cached under `--ground-truth-cache`
(default `.crud-bench-gt`, gitignored), and reused by every subsequent engine and run.

Specify a custom endpoint using `-e` or `--endpoint` to benchmark a custom deployment:

| Endpoint | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `server:memory` | Docker server with in-memory storage engine |
| `server:rocksdb` | Docker server with RocksDB storage engine |
| `server:surrealkv` | Docker server with SurrealKV storage engine |
| `memory` | Embedded with in-memory storage engine. |
| `rocksdb:<path>` (`rocksdb:/tmp/db`) | Embedded with RocksDB storage engine. |
| `surrealkv:<path>` (`surrealkv:/tmp/db`) | Embedded with RocksDB storage engine. |
| `ws://...`, `wss://...`, `http://...`, `https://...` | Remote server you manage yourself (no Docker started by crud-bench). |

### [SurrealKV](https://surrealkv.org)

## SurrealDB local benchmark

To run the benchmark against an already running SurrealDB instance, follow the steps below.

Start a SurrealDB server:

```bash
surreal start --allow-all -u root -p root rocksdb:/tmp/db
```

Then run crud-bench with the `surrealdb` database option:

```bash
cargo run -r -- -d surrealdb -e ws://127.0.0.1:8000 -s 100000 -c 12 -t 24 -r
```

## SurrealDB Authentication

When benchmarking SurrealDB (including `surrealdb`, and `surrealds`), you can configure authentication credentials using environment variables.

### Environment Variables

- **`SURREALDB_USER`**: Username for SurrealDB authentication (default: `root`)
- **`SURREALDB_PASS`**: Password for SurrealDB authentication (default: `root`)

These environment variables are used in two scenarios:

1. **Docker Container Startup**: When crud-bench automatically starts a SurrealDB Docker container (`-d surrealdb` with no endpoint, or with `-e server:rocksdb` / `-e server:memory` / `-e server:surrealkv`), it uses these credentials to configure the database server
2. **Client Authentication**: When connecting to SurrealDB instances (both embedded and networked), the benchmark client uses these credentials to authenticate

### Usage Examples

**Using default credentials (root/root):**

```bash
cargo run -r -- -d surrealdb -s 100000 -c 12 -t 24 -r
```

**Using custom credentials via environment variables:**

```bash
export SURREALDB_USER=admin
export SURREALDB_PASS=secure_password
cargo run -r -- -d surrealdb -s 100000 -c 12 -t 24 -r
```

**One-line command with custom credentials:**

```bash
SURREALDB_USER=admin SURREALDB_PASS=secure_password cargo run -r -- -d surrealdb -e ws://127.0.0.1:8000 -s 100000 -c 12 -t 24 -r
```

**Connecting to an external SurrealDB instance with custom credentials:**

First, start your SurrealDB instance with custom credentials:

```bash
surreal start --allow-all -u admin -p secure_password rocksdb:/tmp/db
```

Then run the benchmark with matching credentials:

```bash
SURREALDB_USER=admin SURREALDB_PASS=secure_password cargo run -r -- -d surrealdb -e ws://127.0.0.1:8000 -s 100000 -c 12 -t 24 -r
```

> **Note**: When using the automatically started Docker containers, the environment variables configure both the server and client credentials, ensuring they match. When connecting to external instances, ensure the environment variables match the credentials configured on your SurrealDB server.

## SurrealDS - Multi-Instance Distributed Benchmark with TiKV

SurrealDS (SurrealDB Distributed System) enables benchmarking against multiple SurrealDB instances simultaneously, with the **primary use case being SurrealDB with TiKV as the distributed storage backend**. This is particularly useful for testing SurrealDB's performance characteristics when using TiKV's distributed, transactional key-value storage in production-like environments.

### Features

- **TiKV Integration**: Designed specifically for benchmarking SurrealDB with TiKV distributed storage
- **Multi-Instance Support**: Connect to multiple SurrealDB instances using a single endpoint configuration
- **Round-Robin Load Balancing**: Automatically distributes client connections evenly across all configured instances
- **Networked Connections Only**: Designed for remote SurrealDB instances (supports ws://, wss://, http://, https://)

### Prerequisites

#### TiKV Cluster Setup (Primary Use Case)

Before running SurrealDS benchmarks with TiKV, you need to have a TiKV cluster and multiple SurrealDB instances connected to it. Here's a typical setup:

1. **Start a TiKV cluster** (using TiUP or your preferred deployment method):
   ```bash
   # Example using TiUP for local testing
   tiup playground --mode tikv-slim
   ```

2. **Start multiple SurrealDB instances** connected to the TiKV cluster:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Start first SurrealDB instance connected to TiKV
   surreal start --allow-all -u root -p root --bind 127.0.0.1:8001 tikv://127.0.0.1:2379
   
   # Terminal 2 - Start second SurrealDB instance connected to the same TiKV cluster
   surreal start --allow-all -u root -p root --bind 127.0.0.1:8002 tikv://127.0.0.1:2379
   
   # Terminal 3 - Start third SurrealDB instance connected to the same TiKV cluster
   surreal start --allow-all -u root -p root --bind 127.0.0.1:8003 tikv://127.0.0.1:2379
   ```

#### Alternative: Local Testing Without TiKV

For testing the load distribution mechanism without TiKV, you can use independent local instances:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start first instance on port 8001
surreal start --allow-all -u root -p root --bind 127.0.0.1:8001 rocksdb:/tmp/db1

# Terminal 2 - Start second instance on port 8002
surreal start --allow-all -u root -p root --bind 127.0.0.1:8002 rocksdb:/tmp/db2

# Terminal 3 - Start third instance on port 8003
surreal start --allow-all -u root -p root --bind 127.0.0.1:8003 rocksdb:/tmp/db3
```

> **Note**: When using independent storage backends (like RocksDB above), each instance maintains its own separate data. With TiKV, all instances share the same distributed storage, which is the recommended production setup.

### Usage

To benchmark against multiple SurrealDB instances backed by TiKV, specify the endpoints separated by semicolons:

```bash
cargo run -r -- -d surrealds -e "ws://127.0.0.1:8001;ws://127.0.0.1:8002;ws://127.0.0.1:8003" -s 100000 -c 12 -t 24 -r
```

### How It Works

SurrealDS uses a round-robin algorithm to distribute client connections across all configured SurrealDB endpoints:

1. When the benchmark engine starts, it parses the endpoint configuration string
2. For each concurrent client creation, the engine selects the next endpoint in sequence
3. Connections cycle through endpoints evenly (client 0 → endpoint 0, client 1 → endpoint 1, etc.)
4. This ensures balanced load distribution across all SurrealDB instances

When using TiKV as the storage backend, all SurrealDB instances read from and write to the same distributed TiKV cluster, allowing you to benchmark:
- How SurrealDB performs with distributed storage
- Load distribution across multiple SurrealDB query/compute nodes
- TiKV's performance under distributed workloads
- Network overhead and coordination costs

**Example with 3 endpoints and 6 concurrent clients:**

- Client 0 → `ws://127.0.0.1:8001` (SurrealDB instance 1 → TiKV cluster)
- Client 1 → `ws://127.0.0.1:8002` (SurrealDB instance 2 → TiKV cluster)
- Client 2 → `ws://127.0.0.1:8003` (SurrealDB instance 3 → TiKV cluster)
- Client 3 → `ws://127.0.0.1:8001` (wraps around)
- Client 4 → `ws://127.0.0.1:8002`
- Client 5 → `ws://127.0.0.1:8003`

### Configuration

The endpoint string must:
- Contain one or more SurrealDB endpoints separated by semicolons (`;`)
- Use remote connection protocols only: `ws://`, `wss://`, `http://`, or `https://`
- Point to instances that accept the same root credentials (default: `root`/`root`)

> **Note**: You can customize authentication credentials using the `SURREALDB_USER` and `SURREALDB_PASS` environment variables. See the [SurrealDB Authentication](#surrealdb-authentication) section for details.

**Valid endpoint configurations:**

```bash
# Local TiKV testing with three SurrealDB instances
-e "ws://127.0.0.1:8001;ws://127.0.0.1:8002;ws://127.0.0.1:8003"

# Production TiKV cluster with remote SurrealDB nodes
-e "ws://surreal-node1.example.com:8000;ws://surreal-node2.example.com:8000;ws://surreal-node3.example.com:8000"

# Single instance (still works, but no load distribution)
-e "ws://127.0.0.1:8000"
```

### Use Cases

SurrealDS is ideal for:

- **TiKV Performance Benchmarking**: Evaluate SurrealDB's performance when using TiKV as the distributed storage backend
- **Distributed Storage Testing**: Assess how SurrealDB handles distributed transactional workloads across a TiKV cluster
- **Load Balancing Evaluation**: Test load distribution across multiple SurrealDB compute nodes sharing the same TiKV storage
- **Scalability Assessment**: Compare single-node vs. multi-node SurrealDB performance with TiKV
- **Production Deployment Simulation**: Benchmark configurations that mirror real-world distributed SurrealDB+TiKV deployments
- **High Availability Testing**: Evaluate performance characteristics of redundant SurrealDB instances backed by TiKV
