**ResearchTrack** is an academic research laboratory and literature management platform designed for university labs, faculty advisors, and student researchers. It centralizes literature reviews, isolated student paper syntheses, multi-scope paper assignments (individual, lab-wide, and sub-group-wise), onboarding starter packs, journal clubs, and sync meetings into a unified, privacy-aware workspace.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🏢 1. Academic Research Labs & Sub-Group Management
* **Lab Workspaces**: Create or join research laboratories with secure join codes and member approval workflows.
* **Sub-Group Clusters**: Organize lab members into specialized project teams (e.g. *Foundations*, *Mechanistic Interpretability*, *Agentic Systems*).
* **Lab Notices & Noticeboard**: Pinned deadlines, priority announcements, and lab-wide updates.
* **Starter Packs**: Curated foundational reading lists for onboarding new lab members with automated progress tracking.
* **Journal Club Seminars**: Schedule paper presentations with slide decks, designated discussants, and structured agendas.
* **Lab Meetings & Syncs**: Schedule video meetings with countdown badges and Google Meet / Zoom links.

### 📋 2. Multi-Scope Paper Assignments & Mentorship
* **Multi-Target Assignment Engine**:
  * 🎓 **Individual Student**: Assign targeted papers to specific advisees.
  * 🏛️ **Whole Research Lab**: Bulk-assign landmark papers to all student researchers in a laboratory in 1 click.
  * 👥 **Sub-Group Cluster**: Bulk-assign domain-specific papers to specialized project teams in 1 click.
* **Real-Time Student Notifications**: Automatically notifies assigned researchers with direct links to their reading queue.
* **Context-Aware Attribution Badges**:
  * **Supervisors** see: `"Assigned to [Student Name]"` with individual status badges (`COMPLETED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `PENDING`).
  * **Students** see: `"Assigned by [Faculty Advisor Name]"` with 1-click status changers (`[To Read]`, `[Reading]`, `[Completed]`).

### ✍️ 3. Isolated Multi-Student Synthesis & Comparative Review
* **Strict Student Workspace Isolation**: When multiple students are assigned the same paper, each student writes and submits their own independent Q1–Q9 literature review questionnaire without data leakage or master paper overwrites.
* **Supervisor Comparative Tabs**: Supervisors can toggle between student tabs with 1 click to review and compare individual student notes, insights, and answers side-by-side.
* **Deep-Link Navigation**: Clicking any student's assigned paper from the **My Students** hub (`/students`) automatically deep-links directly into that student's review tab (`/papers/[id]?studentId=<id>`).

### 📚 4. Paper Library, Survey Matrix & In-App Reader
* **Interactive Literature Review Matrix**: Compare problem formulation, methodology, datasets, benchmarks, and limitations side-by-side.
* **In-App PDF Reader**: Read papers directly inside the browser with distraction-free layout.
* **Citation Graph & Connected Literature**: Visual citation network mapping foundational works, derivative papers, and research lineage.
* **AI Research Assistant**: Context-aware paper chat answering queries based on title, abstract, and annotations.
* **Faculty Evaluation Rubric**: Standardized multi-criteria evaluation scorecards (Novelty, Rigor, Reproducibility, Significance).
* **Export Center**: 1-click LaTeX Survey Matrix tables, BibTeX citation records, and CSV exports.

### 👥 5. My Students Hub (Faculty Supervision)
* **Student Activity Stream**: Live feed showing recent student paper reviews (`Q1–Q9 ✓`), questions, feedback, and deliverables.
* **Reading Progress & Completion Rates**: Visual progress indicators tracking total assigned papers vs. completed reading reviews.
* **1-on-1 Mentorship Scheduler**: Schedule advisory sessions with shared collaborative agendas and action items.

### 🛡️ 6. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Governance
* **3 Native System Roles**: `STUDENT`, `SUPERVISOR`, and `ADMIN`.
* **Administrative Console**: Manage user roles, affiliations, account status, and inspect immutable audit logs.
* **Clean Navigation**: Each role receives a tailored sidebar without extraneous or restricted tools.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone & Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or copy from `.env.example`):
```env
# PostgreSQL connection string (Local or Cloud e.g., Neon / Supabase)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@hostname:5432/researchtrack?sslmode=require"

# JWT Secret Key (Used for secure session token signing)
JWT_SECRET="your-secure-jwt-secret-at-least-32-characters"

# App URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### 3. Initialize Database Tables
Push the Prisma schema to your PostgreSQL database:
```bash
npx prisma db push
```

### 4. Seed Pre-Configured Demo Accounts & AI Papers
```bash
npm run seed
```

### 5. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
