# llmwiki · Quiz_wiki — a lightweight, local-first project wiki that compounds, and quizzes you back

*Also known as: quiz wiki · llmwiki quiz · Quiz_wiki — the spaced-repetition layer that quizzes you on your own past decisions.*

**English** · [한국어](readmes/README.ko.md) · [日本語](readmes/README.ja.md) · [中文](readmes/README.zh.md)

Whatever project, terminal (default/tmux/iTerm2), or coding agent (Claude Code · Codex · OpenCode) you work in, project-specific LLM knowledge **compounds** instead of evaporating.

## What it looks like after 11 weeks of daily use

One developer, one machine, 19 repositories, 997 pages — measured 2026-08-21, not projected.
Everything below is a number this engine reports about itself; `llmwiki doctor`, `llmwiki bench`
and `llmwiki downstream-read` print them on your own wiki.

| Observed in daily use | Measured | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Per-session cost does not grow with the wiki | 6.7KB injected at session start on the largest repo (236 pages) | Pointer counts are capped, not proportional — the wiki can keep growing without the session tax growing with it |
| Retrieval stays interactive | search 0.11s · per-turn hook 0.16s, same repo | The loop runs on every prompt, so anything slower would be felt |
| Derived data is cheap to rebuild | full reindex 6.9s | The wiki itself is plain Markdown in your git history; the index is disposable |
| Local state is bounded, not cumulative | 167MB across all 19 wikis | Capture expires with the harness's own retention window instead of growing forever |
| One wiki, more than one agent | opens recorded from both Codex and Claude Code against the same repo | Switching agents does not restart the knowledge |
| Delivery is measured, including when it is low | pointer open-through 2.1% | Reported rather than assumed — the same instrument caught its own sampling bug, a "0%" that had read 5 of 54 sessions |

These are one person's numbers on one machine over eleven weeks, on wikis in the languages that
person writes in. They say the engine stays cheap and stays honest at this scale; they are not a
claim about teams, other corpora, or answer quality.

## Everything you need to do

Already have Git, [Bun](https://bun.sh), and one coding agent installed? The rest is one clone and one prompt.

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/suwonleee/llmwiki.git
cd ~/llmwiki
```

These commands install the current public version. If you need a reproducible deployment, choose
a tagged version on the [Releases page](https://github.com/suwonleee/llmwiki/releases) before
setup. Updates are always manual — but you never have to track releases: the daemon checks origin
once a day, and when a newer version exists your next session starts with a one-line notice and the
exact command. That line is shown to **you**, not only to the agent: Claude Code and Codex display it
as a hook system message at session start, OpenCode raises a toast, and every `llmwiki` command
prints it once on stderr — including the case where origin has newer code under the same version
number. Running it stays your act; the engine never updates itself. Uninstall before moving
or deleting this directory (see below): the installed hooks point at it.

Start **one** agent from this folder:

```bash
claude
# or: codex
# or: opencode
```

Paste this into the agent:

```text
Read setup_text.md and install llmwiki for this machine and the coding agent I am currently using. Follow the file exactly, run the health checks, and tell me about any manual step that remains.
```

This is the recommended installation path. The README stays human-facing; exact harness branches,
health checks, `PATH` handling, hook trust, OS notes, and recovery rules live in the
agent contract [`setup_text.md`](setup_text.md) and its
[installation-flow reference](reference/INSTALLATION_FLOW.md).

Machines differ, and the engine resolves that itself where it can: when the default locations come
up empty it also checks the ones they predictably miss — a mounted Windows profile under
`/mnt/c/Users/*` (WSL), XDG variants, `~/.opencode`, and the per-account Codex homes that Codex
Desktop keeps under its own data directory (every home found is swept; an explicit `CODEX_HOME`
stays exclusive) — and verifies each by schema signature. A
single verified candidate **inside your own home** is connected without asking. Anything outside
your home (a mounted Windows profile is routinely another person's) is never auto-connected: it is
reported with the exact `llmwiki connect` command, so claiming it is one paste and one deliberate
decision. `llmwiki locate <harness>` shows what discovery found; when it cannot act (nothing found,
several candidates, an env var pointing at a broken location, or data outside your home) it prints
one block naming what was tried, what blocked it, and the numbered options — and
`llmwiki connect <harness> <path>` records only what verification accepts. The setup agent runs
this flow for you as part of `setup_text.md`.

### Then turn it on for a project — once

Installation is machine-level, but it stays **inert everywhere until you enroll a repository**:

```bash
llmwiki init /absolute/path/to/my-project     # one project-level activation step
```

`init` scaffolds the wiki and records a marker under that worktree's `.git/` directory. Until it
runs, that project produces no cold-start context, no per-turn injection, and no captured
sessions — even if it already contains a complete `docs/wiki/`, because a wiki arrives with any
`git clone` and cloning someone's repository is not a decision to run llmwiki in it. After `init`
there are no further prompts or confirmations, ever.

- `llmwiki status <repo>` — is it on, and why not
- `llmwiki verify <repo> --harness <harness>` — one receipt for machine wiring, enrollment, index,
  and non-empty cold-start work memory
- `llmwiki disable <repo>` — turn it back off (your wiki files are untouched)
- CLI discovery: `llmwiki --help` shows the first-use path and command groups;
  `llmwiki <command> --help` shows one command without running it; `llmwiki --version` prints the
  engine version.
- automatic integration is **git-only** and per-worktree; a linked worktree (`git worktree add`)
  inherits its main worktree's enrollment (reads its own branch wiki, files sessions into the main
  tree's backlog; `llmwiki disable <worktree>` opts one out), and moving a repository requires
  re-running `init` (the marker records its canonical path)
- every harness install gets the same user-level `llmwiki` launcher; setup prints a one-time `PATH`
  line when the shell does not already include it
- **OpenCode only — restart it once after setup** (and after re-pointing the clone): OpenCode loads
  the read-injection plugin at process start, so a session already open when you installed keeps
  running without it. Claude Code and Codex pick the hooks up on their next session.
- **start your agent from the project directory**: a session reads, captures into, and files the
  wiki at its cwd. A session whose edits actually went to a different enrolled repo is flagged at
  close-out (`# ⚠ route:` on the extract header) so its record lands in the right wiki

After setup reports healthy, stay in the same setup session and tell the agent:

```text
Initialize llmwiki for /absolute/path/to/my-project using the engine you just installed. Verify the project wiki, then tell me the close-out command for this coding agent.
```

Then open that project with your coding agent and work as usual. At the end of a meaningful session, use `/wiki-save` in Claude Code or
OpenCode, and `$wiki-save` in Codex. Run `/wiki-deep` (Codex: `$wiki-deep`) periodically for
the backlog and deeper maintenance. If a project wiki looks unhealthy, run `/wiki-doctor`
(Codex: `$wiki-doctor`).

To check that the wiki is compounding, paste this in that project's agent session:

```text
Run /wiki-doctor for this project. Repair safe generated state and evidence-grounded page problems, then summarize what was fixed and what still needs attention. In Codex, run $wiki-doctor.
```

### What the public clone is verified to do

Every release candidate is checked from fresh, pinned clones through the installed Claude hooks,
Codex hooks, and OpenCode plugin callbacks, project enrollment, session capture, exact-session
close-out mechanics, restart, and next-session retrieval. The public
retrieval fixtures also gate correctness at 10, 100, and 1,000 generated wiki pages. Release checks
cover the documented macOS/Linux/native-Windows/WSL2 harness branches, local-only data boundaries,
and the exact files allowed into the public package.

That automation does **not** claim that a live model will always write a good wiki page or that a
new person will understand the workflow without help. Observed-user usability remains a separate,
preregistered gate with no participant results yet. See the
[release gates](reference/RELEASE_GATES.md), [support contract](reference/support-contract.json),
and [usability-study protocol](reference/USABILITY_STUDY.md) for the exact claim boundary.

### Want it another way? One file

The engine code stays untouched — everything below lives in one config:

```bash
cd ~/llmwiki
cp llmwiki.config.example.toml llmwiki.config.toml   # English, fully commented
```

| Setting | What it changes |
|---|---|
| `[wiki] lang` | the language the **engine** writes in. Unset = follows your session (the wiki's own pages, then what you type to your agent); pin it with `en` · `ko` · `ja` · `zh`. Your pages always follow your conversation either way |
| `[[category]]` | the wiki folders and what belongs in each |
| `[quiz] questions` | how many questions a quiz session asks — the `5_topic` · `0_review` · `6_quiz` folders are fixed structure |
| `[private] dirs` | folders indexed for you but never committed |
| `[models]` | which model drafts (`light`) and which verifies (`heavy`) |
| `legacy_dirs` | old folders to keep scanning after a rename — the three core files (`current-state` · `overview` · `log`) are fixed structure |
| `[lint.banned_terms]` | wording to warn about (advisory only) |

Easiest path: tell your agent what you want and ask it to edit only `llmwiki.config.toml`, then check the result with `llmwiki config <project-path>`. Existing pages are never migrated without your explicit approval.

No MCP server, Docker, external database, vector database, or cloud service is required. llmwiki uses Bun, local hooks, a local capture daemon, local SQLite, and git markdown. See [`setup_text.md`](setup_text.md) for the installation contract the agent follows.

- **What it is**
    - an LLM-maintained project wiki for agentic environments — sourced from your work transcripts, stored as plain git markdown
    - engine = a local library: SQLite index · deterministic lint · citation/cross-reference graph · content-hash increments
    - on top: an automatic capture daemon + transcript compounding — **no MCP registration**
- **Labor split**
    - fact — written unattended, by the AI
    - judgment (direction · decisions · contradictions) — always human-present
    - human memory — a daily forgetting-curve quiz (`/wiki-quiz`), keeping your recall of your own decisions as sharp as the model's context
- **Two layers, one source**
    - per-session *logbook* — time axis: `2_milestone` · `3_decision` · `4_insight`
    - per-concept *topic encyclopedia* — `5_topic`, topic axis, in-place consolidation
    - both re-derived from raw transcripts only — no wiki→wiki

The core idea — a project wiki that the LLM maintains and the human only steers — comes from [Andrej Karpathy's LLM-wiki note](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f). That note is the only outside reference: the design and code here are original.

## Plugin install (lighter alternative — no clone)

The same repo doubles as a Claude Code / Codex plugin marketplace. The plugin carries the read
loop and the `/wiki-*` skills; the **background capture daemon ships only with the clone install
above** — pick ONE path per machine (the hooks detect a clone install and defer to it).

```bash
# Claude Code
claude plugin marketplace add suwonleee/llmwiki
claude plugin install llmwiki@llmwiki

# Codex (approve the two hooks once in /hooks afterwards)
codex plugin marketplace add https://github.com/suwonleee/llmwiki
codex plugin add llmwiki@llmwiki
```

Then, once per repository you want the wiki in: run `/wiki-doctor` in a session there (or
`bun <plugin-root>/src/cli.ts init <repo>`) — repositories you never enroll stay untouched and
receive zero injection. Bun is still the one prerequisite; without it the plugin says so once at
session start and stays silent. Adds ~330 tokens of always-on skill metadata per session.

Before installing, review the [plugin disclosure](PLUGIN.md), [privacy policy](PRIVACY.md),
[terms](TERMS.md), and [support guidance](SUPPORT.md).

## Manual fallback

Use this only when you intentionally want to install without an agent. Select one harness;
do not use `auto` unless you want every detected harness wired.

```bash
./setup.sh --harness claude
# or: ./setup.sh --harness codex
# or: ./setup.sh --harness opencode
```

- Follow the exact next command printed by setup
    - macOS, Linux, or WSL2: user-level `llmwiki …` for every harness
    - Native Windows, every harness: explicit `bun <clone>/src/cli.ts …`; the optional
      `llmwiki` launcher is a Git Bash-only shell script, while Codex/OpenCode use PowerShell
- Complete any printed manual action
    - Codex only: review and trust the two current llmwiki hooks in `/hooks`
    - OpenCode: restart it after initial setup or clone re-pointing
- Full branch and recovery reference: [`reference/INSTALLATION_FLOW.md`](reference/INSTALLATION_FLOW.md)

## The Compounding Loop

Six stages — two fully unattended, the rest one command each.

| Stage | What | Automatic? | Implementation |
|------|------|:---:|------|
| **Capture** | Every session transcript → central queue | ✔ | `src/daemon/watch.ts` (terminal/profile-agnostic) |
| **Condense (update)** | Queue → that repo's `docs/wiki/` **log layer** (incremental append) | 1 command | Codex: `$wiki-save` / `$wiki-deep` · Claude/OpenCode: `/wiki-save` / `/wiki-deep` + `src/engine/update.ts` |
| **Consolidate** | Log → per-concept **topic encyclopedia** `5_topic/` (in-place merge·raw re-grounding) | 1 command | Codex: `$wiki-save` / `$wiki-deep` · Claude/OpenCode: `/wiki-save` / `/wiki-deep` + `src/engine/consolidate.ts` |
| **Read** | Cold-start injection + per-turn related-page pointers | ✔ | `hooks/sessionstart-inject.sh` · `hooks/userpromptsubmit-inject.sh` (Claude Code; Codex/OpenCode → `adapters/`) |
| **Quiz (human memory)** | Wiki's judgment layer → day-granular spaced-repetition quiz **for the human** (`6_quiz/` records — never indexed/searched; cold-start shows a due-count line) | 1 command | Codex: `$wiki-quiz` · Claude/OpenCode: `/wiki-quiz` + `src/engine/quiz.ts` (`quiz-status`·`quiz-next`·`quiz-record`) |
| **Self-healing** | Structural (orphan·stale·dangling) = deterministic `lint` / semantic (contradiction·stale claim·missing concept) = generative `review` (auto on sync — engine-gated cadence `--if-due`, default 7d·scoped+cached) → gaps land in `gaps`'s self-closing queue (`0_review/gap-queue.md`) | 1 command → auto | `lint`·`review`·`gaps` (`src/engine/{lint,review,gaps}.ts`) |

- **Transcript retention** — transcripts are the agent's files, not llmwiki's
    - they rotate on each agent's own schedule (Claude Code defaults to ~30 days; Codex compresses finished sessions to `.zst`) — llmwiki never copies them
    - close out sessions worth keeping with `/wiki-save` before they age out; queue rows whose transcript is already gone are pruned by the deep pass (`capture-prune`, 30-day guard)

### The human memory loop (`/wiki-quiz`)

Every other stage keeps the **model** grounded; this one keeps the **human** sharp.

- **Why it exists**
    - the labor split leaves the human exactly one non-delegable duty — direction + contradiction judgment
    - that judgment decays together with your memory of your own past decisions
- **How it schedules** — deterministic, engine-side, zero LLM
    - day-granular forgetting curve: boxes of 1·3·7·16·35·60 days
    - wrong or skipped → back to 1 day; an item is never asked twice in one day
    - scope: the wiki's judgment layer — direction > decision > insight·topic > milestone, newest first
- **How a session runs** — pre-authored in one batch
    - the engine picks the due items; the session reads those pages together and writes every question up front — answering one shows the next with no wait
    - answers are gist-graded warm, grounded in the pages; wrong answers come back first the next day
    - size: `[quiz] questions` in `llmwiki.config.toml` — default **3**, raise per run like `/wiki-quiz 5`, engine-capped at **7** (a quiz people skip reinforces nothing)
    - where the questions reach you: Claude Code `AskUserQuestion` (4 per call) · OpenCode `question` · Codex `request_user_input` (3 per call, and outside Plan mode only once you run `codex features enable default_mode_request_user_input`) — anywhere else the whole set arrives as one numbered block
- **Where records live**
    - `docs/wiki/6_quiz/` — ledger + per-day session notes
    - a human-only layer excluded from indexing/search/cold-start — the LLM never feeds on its own quiz output: strictly wiki → human

### Evidence that travels with the page (page format v3)

A citation like `[^s1]: <session>.jsonl` points at a transcript that lives on **one machine** — a teammate can read your conclusion but not the grounding behind it. v3 puts 1–2 lines of the evidence itself right under the footnote:

```markdown
- We kept the log layer and added the topic layer on top of it [^s1]

[^s1]: 3bd9cac5-….jsonl
    > [2026-06-29 14:02 user] "keep the log as-is and layer on top — replacing it is the risky part"
```

- **Format contract**
    - the footnote definition line stays byte-identical to before — four parsers read it, and one of them keeps a teammate's citation from erroring
    - excerpts come only from `llmwiki excerpt` — verbatim, length-capped, secret-screened (raw transcripts routinely contain credentials)
    - judgment claims quote the human; factual claims carry a machine tool-record
- **Scannable page body**
    - numbered sections in reading order — `## 1. <label>`, split as `### 1-1. <label>` when a section has parts; a short single-group page stays a bare bullet list
    - inside a section: one concrete point per `-` line; supporting detail at `    -`; deeper detail at `        -` (no fourth level)
    - one point per line: a bullet enumerating more than three items becomes a parent plus one child per item, never a `·`-joined pile-up (lint: `dense-bullet`)
    - noun-phrase or telegraphic endings where natural; verbs retained when needed for an unambiguous actor, action, condition, or outcome
    - no abstract framing, paragraph repetition, or child bullet that merely restates its parent (lint: `flat-body` when a long page has no sections)
- **Lint stance**
    - a quote is verified against the transcript only **where that transcript is readable**; on other clones lint stays silent — "can't check" must never read as "wrong"
- **Zero retrieval cost**
    - excerpts are excluded from the search index and the topic-page budget — evidence costs neither retrieval quality nor prose room

### Self-healing flow (the human only fills in)

The wiki reports what's missing on its own; the human supplies only the judgment that fills it.

- **At close-out (`/wiki-save`) and on the deep pass (`/wiki-deep`)**
    - ① deterministic `lint` — structure (orphan · stale · dangling)
    - ② generative `review` — semantics (contradiction · stale claim · missing concept); auto via `--if-due` with an engine-enforced cadence (default 7 days, `LLMWIKI_REVIEW_INTERVAL_DAYS`), input scoped to recent + tag-neighbor pages, skipped when nothing changed; the deep pass runs it unconditionally
    - ③ `gaps` — stacks the *missing concepts · follow-up questions* that `review` surfaced into a tracking queue (`0_review/gap-queue.md`)
- **How a gap closes**
    - filled once someone works that topic once, or the deep pass fills it
    - auto-closes when `review` fails to surface it twice in a row
- **Deliberately not auto-generated** — pages never get invented from thin evidence

```

Storage principle — three homes, one owner each:

- capture queue — central: `<state>/capture.db`, where `<state>` defaults to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/llmwiki` (an existing `<clone>/.state` from an older install keeps being used; `llmwiki migrate-state` moves it)
- content — each repo's own `docs/wiki/` (co-located; markdown = source of truth)
- index — engine-held, one directory per project under the state root (`llmwiki state-path <repo>`); regenerable at any time, so the repository carries only `docs/wiki/`

## Updating the engine

```bash
cd ~/llmwiki
git pull && ./setup.sh          # pull alone is not enough — see below
```

`git pull` changes the files in the clone and nothing else. The surfaces the harnesses actually run
were written at install time and keep pointing at what they were given: the capture daemon froze its
code when it started, and the OpenCode plugin is a copy under your config directory. Re-running
`setup.sh` is what re-points them — it is idempotent, and it restarts the daemon for you.

`llmwiki doctor` reports the drift if you forget:

- `[update] ⚠️ v… → v… available` — the clone itself is behind `origin`
- `[update] ⚠️ N commit(s) behind origin at the same version` — origin has newer code that did
  not bump the version number; the version check alone would never have said so
- `[update] ⚠️ clone files changed after the last successful install` — `git pull` finished but
  setup has not yet refreshed every previously installed harness surface and daemon; the reminder
  clears after successful setup has refreshed all of those components
- `[daemon] ⚠️ running code older than this clone` — the loop that is sweeping predates your pull
  (`llmwiki daemon-sync` restarts it when it is actually behind, and `llmwiki doctor --fix` does the
  same inside a full health run). You will rarely reach for either: the `/wiki-save` and
  `/wiki-deep` close-outs run `daemon-sync` as their last deterministic step, so a session you close
  normally leaves the daemon on the code you just pulled.
- `[opencode] ⚠️ plugin stale` — the installed plugin copy is older than the clone's adapter

## Uninstall

```bash
cd ~/llmwiki
./setup.sh --uninstall                 # remove every llmwiki-owned hook, plugin, command, launcher and service
./setup.sh --uninstall --purge-data    # …and delete llmwiki's local runtime state as well
```

Removal is by ownership, not by restoring a backup: entries llmwiki installed are removed, and
anything else in your harness configuration is left exactly as it is (including hooks you added
between two installs). Run it from the installed clone **before** you move or delete that clone.

- your wikis are never touched — `docs/wiki/` is ordinary Markdown in your own repositories
- without `--purge-data`, the local state (capture queue, daemon log, transcript exports) is kept
  and its location reported; `--purge-data` deletes exactly the artifacts llmwiki created, never a
  directory or file it did not create
- per-project enrollment markers live in each repo's `.git/llmwiki/` and are inert without the
  engine; remove one explicitly with `llmwiki disable <repo>`

## Data llmwiki keeps on your machine

| what | where | retention |
|---|---|---|
| capture queue (which repositories you worked in, when — metadata only) | `<state>/capture.db` | kept until `--purge-data` |
| daemon log (aggregate counts; never repository paths of unenrolled projects) | `<state>/daemon.log` | kept until `--purge-data` |
| OpenCode transcript exports (conversation text — the only bodies llmwiki stores) | `<state>/opencode-export/` | **auto-deleted after 30 days** |
| per-project index and caches (regenerable) | `<state>/projects/<id>/` | compacted, and dropped after 60 idle days |

The state directory and everything in it are created private (`0700` / `0600`). Claude and Codex
transcripts are read in place from the harness's own store — llmwiki makes no copy of them.

| **Bun ≥ 1.1** (1.2+ recommended) | ✔ required | Single binary — POSIX: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install \| bash`; native Windows: `irm bun.sh/install.ps1 \| iex` in PowerShell (the POSIX installer does not run there). Runs `.ts` directly, and `bun:sqlite` bundles FTS5 — zero build·`node_modules`. Running the engine and `bun test` work with no install; only `bun run typecheck` (tsc) needs a one-time `bun install` (dev-only). Below 1.2 there is no in-process zstd: Codex's compressed rollouts (`*.jsonl.zst`) are read only if a `zstd` binary is on `PATH`, and `llmwiki doctor` says which route it found. |
| **git** | ✔ required | The capture loop asks git whether a directory is a worktree. Setup searches beyond `PATH` (Homebrew · MacPorts · Nix · `~/.local/bin`) and stops before mutation if it is absent; the resolved path is baked into the daemon environment and reported by `llmwiki doctor` under `[deps]`. |
| **Codex · OpenCode CLI** | their quick starts only | `codex` / `opencode` on `PATH`. Codex additionally needs lifecycle-hook support with the stable `hooks` feature enabled. Setup checks support — and any existing feature setting — before changing hooks, skills, or services. |
| **LLM CLI** | optional, opt-in | Capture·read-injection·`/wiki-*`·`ingest` (capture-only, queues pending updates) work without it, and **nothing is sent anywhere by default**. `autoupdate·review` and `ingest`'s consolidation launch a generative subprocess only when you set `LLMWIKI_LLM_CMD` in your shell environment (e.g. `export LLMWIKI_LLM_CMD='claude -p {prompt} --model {model} --disallowedTools Write Edit NotebookEdit Bash'`). Unset → those passes report "unavailable" and skip; everything deterministic keeps working. |
| **OS** | macOS / Linux / Windows | macOS=launchd, Linux=systemd (`--user`) falling back to cron+nohup, Windows=per-user Startup folder (unelevated; starts at logon, no restart-on-crash) — for the capture daemon AND for unattended update (`daemon/autoupdate-schedule.sh`). macOS and Linux run the full suite in CI; Windows runs a platform-contract job (typecheck, LF checkout, and the generated harness pages/hooks) and the rest is verified by hand. Daemon details in [`daemon/README.md`](daemon/README.md) |

### Harness · OS notes (Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode / Windows)

- **Claude Code** — `git clone … && ./setup.sh --harness claude`, done
    - capture · read-injection · `/wiki-*` commands all wired automatically
- **Codex (OpenAI)** — `./setup.sh --harness codex`
    - installs the user CLI + five `$wiki-*` skills, and merges native `SessionStart`/`UserPromptSubmit` hooks into `$CODEX_HOME/hooks.json`
    - one-time: start Codex and review the exact commands in `/hooks` — new or changed hooks stay skipped until trusted
    - capture watches `$CODEX_HOME/sessions/**/*.jsonl[.zst]`
    - warm skills run on Codex itself; unattended `autoupdate`/`review` run only when `LLMWIKI_LLM_CMD` is set
- **OpenCode** — `./setup.sh --harness opencode`
    - installs global `/wiki-*` custom commands, a clone-pinned read-injection plugin, and the user CLI
    - capture reads the SQLite session store; `XDG_DATA_HOME`/`OPENCODE_DB` are preserved in the daemon environment
- **Windows** — native or WSL2, both supported
    - Bun·`bun:sqlite` run natively (FTS5 trigram included), and path matching normalizes backslashes
    - native Windows: install Bun and Git, then `./setup.sh --harness claude` (or `all`) from Git
      Bash — the `.sh` scripts need it, and Claude Code runs the hook scripts through it without
      `bash` being on the Windows `PATH`
    - **Codex and OpenCode are wired without the shell adapters here.** `bash` is never on the
      Windows `PATH` (Git's installer adds `<root>\cmd`, not `<root>\bin`) and both harnesses hand
      the agent's shell commands to PowerShell, so a hook spelled `bash '<script>'` reported nothing
      but "hook exited with code 1" and every `llmwiki …` line in a skill hit
      `CommandNotFoundException`. On Windows the hook command and the skill bodies name
      `bun <clone>/src/cli.ts` directly — no interpreter, no `PATH` entry
    - the `llmwiki` launcher in `~/.local/bin` is a `#!/bin/sh` script: usable from Git Bash (which
      does not put that directory on `PATH` — add it yourself), not from PowerShell or `cmd`.
      Nothing the harnesses install depends on it
    - the capture daemon registers itself in your per-user **Startup folder** and runs hidden (no
      console window). That needs no elevation — a Task Scheduler `/SC ONLOGON` entry does, and a
      note-taking daemon is not worth an elevated installer. It starts with your session and does
      **not** restart on crash, the same guarantee as the Linux `cron @reboot` fallback; `llmwiki
      doctor` reports "starts at logon" and "running" as the two separate facts they are
    - under WSL2 everything runs unmodified (launchd→systemd·bash·paths) — also the official Claude Code·Codex recommendation

## Install / Usage

**Clone this repo anywhere, under any name, and run `./setup.sh`** — that makes it the engine for that machine.

- every wire (daemon · hooks · CLI · `/wiki-*` commands) is derived from the clone location itself — no fixed path like `~/llmwiki`, any folder name
- with just Bun, `.ts` runs as-is — no bundle, no build step
- after moving or updating the clone, re-run setup — it refreshes generated skills and wiring idempotently

```bash
# 0) clone the engine (once, one per machine) — location/name doesn't matter
git clone https://github.com/suwonleee/llmwiki.git
cd llmwiki

# 1) one-shot install — doctor → capture daemon (OS auto-detect) → harness wiring → doctor
./setup.sh --harness claude              # or: codex · opencode · auto (auto wires EVERY detected harness)

# 2) just work — sessions are captured automatically in any folder/terminal
#    manual per-repo commands: bun <clone>/src/cli.ts init|index|search|lint <repo>

# 3) close out the session in your agent's prompt
/wiki-save                               # close out this session (Codex: $wiki-save)
/wiki-ask                                # ask this project's wiki (Codex: $wiki-ask)
/wiki-deep                               # periodic DEEP pass (Codex: $wiki-deep)
/wiki-doctor                             # diagnose + repair this wiki (Codex: $wiki-doctor)
/wiki-quiz                               # human memory loop (Codex: $wiki-quiz)
```

> Individual steps: `bun <clone>/src/cli.ts doctor` · `bash <clone>/daemon/install.sh` ·
> `bun <clone>/src/daemon/wire.ts` (Claude) · `wire-codex.ts` / `wire-opencode.ts` (Codex/OpenCode) —
> each wire script also takes `--revert` to undo its own changes.

### Installation doctor vs project wiki doctor

- `llmwiki doctor` checks the llmwiki installation: engine files, daemon, hooks, installed skills,
  and the user CLI. Its `--fix` repairs wiring.
- `llmwiki wiki-doctor <repo>` diagnoses one project's `docs/wiki/` read-only by default:
  structure, exact index freshness, SQLite integrity/storage, lint, capture continuity, gap queue,
  and semantic-review cadence. Add `--fix` to rebuild only safe derived/generated state.
- `/wiki-doctor` (Codex: `$wiki-doctor`) runs the full repair workflow. After the deterministic
  engine repair, the active agent reads the remaining lint/review evidence and fixes page content
  without deleting provenance or inventing project direction.

## Configuration (environment variables) — provider · model · CLI agnostic

The generative pass (autoupdate/review) is **off until you enable it**: with no configuration at
all, llmwiki launches no subprocess and sends nothing to any provider. Setting `LLMWIKI_LLM_CMD` in
your machine's environment is the one-time opt-in — it cannot be set by a repository's config file,
a Markdown page, a tracked file, or an autoloaded `.env`. Once enabled, every transcript- or
page-derived block is screened for secrets before it becomes part of a prompt, and a block that
screens down to nothing cancels the call instead of sending the remainder.

| env | default | purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `LLMWIKI_MODEL_HEAVY` | `claude-opus-4-8` | reasoning-tier — VERIFY (adversarial gate)·review (semantic check) |
| `LLMWIKI_MODEL_LIGHT` | `claude-sonnet-5` | draft-tier — WRITE (page generation) |
| `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | (Claude Code standard) | If set, that directory is also recognized as a Claude profile — hook wiring (wire)·capture (claude source)·doctor all honor it. |
| `LLMWIKI_LLM_CMD` | **unset — no subprocess, no network** | argv template for the LLM call. `{prompt}`·`{model}` are substituted token-by-token (no shell parsing). If `{prompt}` is absent, the prompt is sent via stdin. For multi-word values needing quotes, use a JSON array (`["my-llm","--q","{prompt}"]`). Any CLI works — Codex·`llm`·ollama, etc. |
| `LLMWIKI_STATE_DIR` | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/llmwiki` (or an existing `<clone>/.state`) | Optional machine-local state location. Repository `.env` files cannot redirect it. A custom path must be new, empty, or already owned by llmwiki; foreign non-empty directories fail closed. |
| `LLMWIKI_LANG` | `en` | Language for cold-start operating rules/headers. `ko` for Korean. (The wiki body itself stays as written — only the UI copy switches.) |
| `LLMWIKI_SEARCH_RELAX` | (on) | Set `off` to disable the relaxed-recall fallback — when a natural-language query strict-AND matches 0 rows, search retries ONCE with the same terms OR-joined (trigram-safe, Unicode/CJK-aware, no stopword lists). Kill-switch for A/B measurement. |
| `LLMWIKI_MAX_SOURCE_BYTES` | `262144` (256KB) | Per-file content cap for SOURCE files. Larger files (multi-MB yaml/json fixtures) are registered metadata-only — findable by name, but not full-text indexed. Wiki pages are exempt. Keeps the index compact and search fast on fixture-heavy repos, with no quality change on search/turn-context. |
| `LLMWIKI_REVIEW_MAX_PAGES` | `80` | Input cap for a single `review` pass. If the wiki exceeds this, only recent+tag-neighbor pages are reviewed (to avoid prompt overflow). |
| `LLMWIKI_REVIEW_INTERVAL_DAYS` | `7` | Cadence gate for `review --if-due` — it runs only when this many days have passed since the last committed review (before that it skips deterministically in ~0.03s). Makes the per-session close-out's review cost zero by default. |
| `LLMWIKI_TOPIC_BUDGET` | `10000` | Character budget for the `topic-oversize` advisory warning on `5_topic` pages — over budget, the deep pass rewrites the page from its cited transcripts, gated by `distill-verify` (the citation set must not shrink). |
| `LLMWIKI_OVERVIEW_BUDGET` | `8000` | Character budget for overview.md at which `overview` warns (watches for entry-point bloat; `--check` previews without writing). |
| `LLMWIKI_L0_BUDGET` | `1600` | Character **standard** for the cold-start L0 (current-state). Injection **never cuts**: an over-standard page is injected whole with a one-line notice appended (nudging the next close-out to trim); the `oversized-l0` lint warns from 1.25×. |

- bump each tier to whatever top-tier model just shipped, or swap in a non-Anthropic model/endpoint
- **Harness-agnostic reading**
    - `bun <clone>/src/cli.ts context <repo>` — the cold-start context · `… turn-context <repo>` (hook stdin JSON or `--prompt`) — per-turn related-page pointers (≤3 lines, silent unless confident)
    - Claude Code wires both hooks automatically; recent Codex runs the same hook scripts natively (`adapters/codex/`); OpenCode injects via a one-file plugin (`adapters/opencode/`)
    - any other harness calls the same commands from AGENTS.md or a startup prompt
    - per-turn injection is a progressive enhancement — the cold-start + `search` baseline is identical everywhere

### Index maintenance escalation (bounded, opt-in)

`/wiki-save` only calls `llmwiki db-health <repo> --notice`: it records a cooldown-governed health signal and may recommend `/wiki-deep`; it never compacts SQLite or runs semantic cleanup. `/wiki-deep` refreshes the index and lint first, compacts only after the health command marks the database eligible, then rechecks. It recommends the manual, dry-run `llmwiki wiki-clean <repo>` only when **post-compact** live indexed bytes still exceed 30 MiB. A free-ratio-only pressure resolved by compaction is reported as no cleanup action.

The defaults are intentionally conservative and currently have no environment override: compaction requires all of **30 MiB database size**, **10% free-page ratio**, and a **1 MiB free-page floor**. The notice state cools down for **7 days** (unless eligibility changes or indexed bytes grow by 10%). The reversible cleanup classifier considers eligible old pages after **180 days**; gap reporting retains the **20** most-recent resolved rows. `wiki-clean --date YYYY-MM-DD` only supplies a deterministic review date — neither `wiki-clean --commit` nor `wiki-clean-apply` is ever part of save/deep automation.

## Team use (sharing one project's wiki)

Solo is the default and needs none of this — everything below is additive and silent for a single user. With several people on one project, each runs their own local engine (own capture daemon, own queue) and condenses **their own sessions** into the shared `docs/wiki/`; sharing is plain git.

- **Scaffold safety**
    - `.gitignore` seeded — `.llmwiki/` stays listed so an index written by an older engine can never be committed
    - `.gitattributes` seeded — `docs/wiki/log.md merge=union`, so concurrent appends merge instead of conflicting
- **Attribution**
    - authorship is derived from git history (`.mailmap`-aware); pages never stamp `author:` into frontmatter
    - a `0_review` question carries `owner: <GitHub login>` — cold-start shows it as `[→ login]`, so teammates skip questions that aren't theirs
- **Teammate citations self-heal**
    - every clean cited `.jsonl` is registered as a virtual source on index rebuild (transcripts rotate anyway)
    - a teammate's citation never breaks your `lint` gate; malformed citations still error
- **Continuity**
    - cold-start prints one line when your clone is behind origin — a teammate may have merged context; pull before starting
- **Review flow**
    - wiki commits ride the same branch and PR as code — the PR review *is* the human gate for AI-written pages
    - `gap-queue.md` / `overview.md` conflicts: take either side, re-run `llmwiki gaps` / `llmwiki overview` (they converge) — never hand-merge their generated bodies
- **Known-safe conflicts**
    - `current-state.md` (L0): either side is safe — the next `/wiki-save` re-derives Now/Next from the wiki state; prefer the union of both sides' **Next** bullets (never lose a pending action)
    - same `5_topic` page, concurrent appends: keep **both sides' bullets** — topic pages are additive by format rule (existing lines immutable, merges only add), so the union is always the correct merge

## Team conventions — `llmwiki.config.toml` (optional)

The stock category structure (`0_review · 1_direction · 2_milestone · 3_decision · 4_insight · 5_topic`) is the built-in default — **without a config file nothing changes, byte-identically** (the rendered prompts/rules are pinned to the historical text by tests). To run a different team format, copy `llmwiki.config.example.toml` to `llmwiki.config.toml` at the clone root and declare your categories:

```toml
[[category]]
dir = "1_goal"     # folder under docs/wiki
domain = "goal"    # frontmatter domain routed here
review = "human"   # human → 0_review queue · model → strong-model adjudication
guide = "Quarterly goals; changes need human sign-off."
```

- **Single source of truth**
    - the WRITE prompts, cold-start operating rules, and `llmwiki conventions <repo>` (which the `/wiki-*` skills defer to) all render from this file — no prose duplicates to drift
- **Per-repo configs** (optional)
    - multiple `*.toml` files under `<clone>/configs/` — a file with `applies_to = ["<folder>", …]` governs those folders and everything under them (segment-safe prefix, most-specific match wins, `~` expands)
    - a file without `applies_to` = the default for all repos (canonical: `configs/default.toml`, shipped as `configs/default.toml.example` — copy it to activate)
    - precedence: named match → `configs/` default → root `llmwiki.config.toml` → built-in defaults; matching uses the path the session hook passes (`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`/cwd)
- **Check** — `llmwiki config [workspace]`
    - shows which file was selected and why (with validation); an invalid or unreadable file falls back safely with a warning — never breaks a session
- **Restructure an existing wiki** — `llmwiki migrate <repo>` (dry-run) → `--commit`
    - folder renames with every wikilink/relative link rewritten, frontmatter `domain:` updated, `.schema-version` stamped
    - never runs automatically — drift is detected (both directions: wiki newer than your engine config, or config newer than the wiki) and surfaced at every cold-start, in `llmwiki doctor`, and as a preflight in the `/wiki-deep` · `/wiki-doctor` passes; applying it always takes an explicit `--commit` with your OK
- **Team distribution**
    - commit the config to your team's engine fork; members `git pull`, one person runs `migrate`, the result merges by PR like any other change (`configs/*.toml` is gitignored by default — track a team config with `git add -f configs/<team>.toml`; the root `llmwiki.config.toml` commits normally)
- **Compatibility discipline**
    - config keys are removed only after a deprecation window with a lint warning and a `migrate` step — never silently

## Regression measurement (engine-dev tools — never part of the daily loop)

- **`llmwiki bench <repo>`** — deterministic retrieval benchmark (zero LLM, runs in ms)
    - golden query set at `<repo>/docs/wiki/.bench/golden.toml` (≤20 per repo, any language)
    - scores search any-hit `r@k` + turn-context pointer-hit/silence — a refusal query is correct when turn-context stays silent (structural, language-neutral)
    - seeded tune/sealed split — `--tune-only` to iterate freely, `--sealed` for final checks only (every look at sealed results weakens it as a regression guard)
- **`llmwiki compare-arm <repo> --corpus <dir> --label <name>`** → **`llmwiki compare-verdict A.json B.json`** — frozen-corpus A/B
    - builds an isolated temp wiki per config/git-state from the same transcript corpus — the arm build is the only LLM step
    - validates report schema, query identities, score kinds, counts, and bounded metrics before judging; malformed or incompatible evidence fails closed to `keep`
    - judges the two labeled results with sequential gates: regression-block first → keep/adopt/undecided, zero LLM
    - run only when prompts/models change
- **`llmwiki bench-scale --repeats 2`** — deterministic generated-corpus scale report
    - runs the public 10/100/1000-page tiers and gates search/context correctness
    - timing and disk distributions are observational diagnostics, never release thresholds
- **`llmwiki bench-capture --repeats 2 [--sessions 100,1000,10000]`** — deterministic historical-session scale report
    - compares Claude, Codex, and OpenCode discovery, unchanged revision candidates, and bounded sample materialization
    - measures the actual lightweight automatic-hook entrypoint (cold start, empty turn, and enrollment probe), with full public-CLI startup reported separately as a reference
    - structural counts are deterministic; timing and source-byte distributions remain observational

The complete reproducible command set and the claims each result permits are maintained in

## Contributing

Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the clean-clone workflow and executable checks,
then use [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) to find the owning module and safety boundary for a
change. `bun run check:quick` is the iteration gate; `bun run check` runs the complete contributor
gate before review.

## Principles

- transcript = raw and immutable — citation only, no wiki→wiki re-derivation; incremental = only what's past the watermark
- fact = automatic by AI / judgment (decision Why·What·Alt·direction) = human — the `status: draft` flag
- git markdown = single source of truth — commits under a single author's identity (the repo owner)
- no over-engineering — under 100k tokens, no vector DB·RAG needed (index.md navigation suffices)
