ShareTab is a free, self-hosted alternative to Splitwise for tracking shared expenses with roommates, friends, and travel groups. Snap a photo of a receipt, let AI extract the line items, and assign them to group members. Taxes and tips split proportionally. Deploy on your own server with Docker Compose.

## Features

- **Group expense tracking** with multiple split modes (equal, percentage, shares, exact, item-level)
- **AI receipt scanning** -- photograph a receipt, AI extracts line items, assign items to group members with proportional tax/tip; zoomable/pannable receipt viewer; rescan with correction prompts
- **Guest bill splitting** -- no account needed, shareable summary links; admins can turn off guest receipt uploads (admin toggle or `DISABLE_GUEST_UPLOADS`) so anonymous visitors can't upload receipt images or run AI scans (signed-in users with an active account keep access, so also limit who can create an account: Registration Control only covers password sign-up, while magic link, Google and OIDC auto-registration still create accounts; see [Security notes](#oidc-security-notes))
- **Pluggable AI providers** -- OpenAI (GPT-4o), OpenAI-Codex (ChatGPT OAuth), Claude (API key), Meridian (Claude Max subscription), local Ollama
- **Group archiving** -- archive inactive groups to declutter your dashboard; toggle archived view on groups page
- **Cross-group dashboard** -- see all your balances at a glance, with per-person debt breakdown
- **Debt simplification** -- minimize the number of payments needed
- **Settle up** -- record payments between any two group members with explicit From/To fields
- **Placeholder members** -- add people without accounts; rename or remove them from group settings
- **Dark mode** -- system-aware with manual toggle
- **Invite links** -- share a link to add friends to your groups
- **Magic link auth** -- passwordless email sign-in
- **Single sign-on (OIDC)** -- sign in with Authentik, Authelia, Keycloak, or other OpenID Connect providers; optional auto-registration and password-login disable
- **PWA** -- installable on mobile with app-like experience
- **Admin dashboard** -- user management, group overview, storage stats, AI usage, audit log, registration control, guest receipt upload toggle, announcements, server logs, user impersonation, data export, expired guest split cleanup
- **Self-hosted** -- Docker Compose deployment, designed for Unraid

## Quick Start

ShareTab ships as an all-in-one Docker container with PostgreSQL bundled inside. No external database needed.

```bash
cd docker
cp ../.env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your settings -- at minimum, generate real values for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `AUTH_SECRET`:

```bash
# Generate a secret
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Then start the container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Unraid

If you want to run ShareTab on Unraid, this repo includes a ready-made template at [unraid/sharetab.xml](unraid/sharetab.xml).

To use it:

```bash
# On your Unraid server
mkdir -p /boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user
cp /path/to/sharetab/unraid/sharetab.xml /boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user/sharetab.xml
```

Then in the Unraid web UI:

1. Open `Docker`.
2. Click `Add Container`.
3. Select the `ShareTab` template from the template dropdown.
4. Fill in the required variables like `AUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, and any optional AI settings.
5. Click `Apply` to create and start the container.

You can also skip the manual copy and paste the raw template URL into Unraid's template install flow:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sw-carlos-cristobal/sharetab/main/unraid/sharetab.xml`

**Backups:**

```bash
docker compose exec sharetab su-exec postgres pg_dump -U sharetab sharetab > backup.sql
```

## Upgrading

When upgrading to a new ShareTab version, pull the latest image and recreate the container:

```bash
cd docker
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

The entrypoint automatically runs any SQL migration files in `prisma/migrations/` before applying the Prisma schema, and the files in `prisma/after-push/` after it. Most upgrades are fully automatic.

### Manual migration (v0.7.x → v0.8.0)

Version 0.8.0 added an `updatedAt` column and converted the `status` column from text to an enum on the `GuestSplit` table. This migration now runs automatically on container startup. If you need to run it manually:

```bash
docker compose exec sharetab su-exec postgres psql -U sharetab -d sharetab \
  -f /app/prisma/migrations/guest_split_status_enum.sql
```

This is idempotent — safe to run more than once.

### Accounts whose emails differ only in letter case

The database rejects a new account whose email matches an existing one ignoring case (`Alice@example.com` and `alice@example.com`). The index that enforces this is created on startup, but it can't be created while such accounts already exist, which older versions allowed. In that case ShareTab starts normally and the container log shows a warning listing the affected addresses:

```
WARNING:  Case-insensitive email uniqueness is not enforced yet: more than one account uses each of these addresses in different letter cases: alice@example.com. ...
```

In the admin dashboard, delete the account the person no longer uses (its expenses stay in their groups under "Deleted user"). The index is created on the next start, or right away with:

```bash
docker compose exec sharetab su-exec postgres psql -U sharetab -d sharetab \
  -f /app/prisma/after-push/user_email_lower_unique.sql
```

## Configuration

All configuration is done through environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust as needed.

| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `AI_PROVIDER_PRIORITY`   | Comma-separated provider priority list (for example `openai-codex,meridian,openai`). ShareTab checks providers in order, uses the first available one, and falls through to the next provider if extraction fails. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`         | Required when `openai` is included in `AI_PROVIDER_PRIORITY`.                                                                                                                                                      |
| `OPENAI_MODEL`           | OpenAI model for receipt scanning. Defaults to `gpt-4o`.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `OPENAI_CODEX_MODEL`     | Model for ChatGPT OAuth / Codex backend receipt scanning. Defaults to `gpt-5.4`.                                                                                                                                   |

| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`        | Claude model for receipt scanning. Defaults to `claude-sonnet-4-6` (claude provider) or `claude-opus-4-6` (meridian provider).                                                                                     |
| `ANTHROPIC_HEALTH_MODEL` | Model for health-check probes (auth verification). Defaults to `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`.                                                                                                                        |
| `MERIDIAN_PORT`          | Port for the embedded Meridian proxy. Defaults to `3457`.                                                                                                                                                          |

| `OLLAMA_MODEL`           | Ollama model name. Defaults to `llava`.                                                                                                                                                                            |

The `openai-codex` provider uses ChatGPT OAuth via the Codex backend instead of an API key. Auth data lives in `/app/chatgpt`, so if that path is on a persistent volume the login survives restarts and image updates.

After the container is running, open the ShareTab admin dashboard and complete the ChatGPT OAuth flow there:

1. Sign in as the admin user and open `/admin`.
2. In the ChatGPT OAuth section, start the login flow.
3. Authorize with ChatGPT in your browser.
4. When the flow redirects to `http://localhost:1455/auth/callback`, copy the full URL from the browser address bar and paste it back into ShareTab.

If you use your own Docker or Unraid template, mount a persistent path to `/app/chatgpt` when `openai-codex` is in `AI_PROVIDER_PRIORITY`.

The `meridian` provider uses a Claude Max/Pro subscription via an embedded proxy -- no API key needed. Claude login data lives in `/app/claude`, so if that path is on a persistent volume the login survives restarts and image updates.

After the container is running, open the ShareTab admin dashboard and complete the Meridian login flow there:

1. Sign in as the admin user and open `/admin`.
2. In the Meridian auth section, start the login flow.
3. Authorize with Claude in your browser.
4. Copy the full callback URL from the browser address bar and paste it back into ShareTab.

The bundled Docker Compose setup persists `/app/claude` automatically. If you use your own Docker or Unraid template, mount a persistent path to `/app/claude`.

**⚠️ OCR provider (removed):** The `ocr` provider (Tesseract.js) was originally included as a free fallback for users without AI API access, but after extensive testing across hundreds of real-world receipts, the accuracy was too unreliable for production use. Common failures included extracting modifiers as line items, failing to exclude delivery fees, and poor handling of non-standard receipt layouts. The OCR provider has been removed from the codebase. Existing configs that include `ocr` in `AI_PROVIDER_PRIORITY` will silently ignore it. If you need reliable receipt scanning, configure one of the AI providers above (openai-codex or meridian are recommended). Community contributions to reintroduce OCR with improved accuracy are welcome.

### AI Provider Performance

Benchmarked on a set of receipt photos (grocery, coffee shop, restaurant). Results represent typical single-receipt extraction.

| Provider                         | Speed  | Item Accuracy | Cost                                | Notes                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OpenAI Codex** (ChatGPT OAuth) | ~6 s   | 5/5 items     | Free (uses ChatGPT subscription)    | **Recommended.** Best balance of speed and accuracy.             |
| **Meridian** (Claude OAuth)      | ~16 s  | 5/5 items     | Free (uses Claude Max subscription) | Same accuracy, but 2–3x slower.                                  |
| **OpenAI** (API key)             | ~4 s   | 5/5 items     | Pay-per-token                       | Fastest, but requires an API key and costs money.                |
| **Ollama** (local LLM)           | Varies | Varies        | Free, fully local                   | Depends on model and hardware. Requires a running Ollama server. |

**Recommendation:** Use `openai-codex` as your primary provider. It delivers the same accuracy as API-key providers at no additional cost (it piggybacks on your existing ChatGPT Plus/Pro subscription). Set your priority to:

```
AI_PROVIDER_PRIORITY="openai-codex"
```

If you also have a Claude Max subscription, you can add `meridian` as a fallback:

```
AI_PROVIDER_PRIORITY="openai-codex,meridian"
```

### OAuth (optional)

| Variable               | Description                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`     | Google OAuth client ID for "Sign in with Google". |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Corresponding client secret.                      |

### OIDC / Single Sign-On (optional)

Sign in through your own identity provider (IdP): Authentik, Authelia, Keycloak, Pocket ID, or another OpenID Connect provider that supports confidential clients (client ID + secret) and a UserInfo endpoint. OIDC is enabled when the issuer, client ID, and client secret are all set; the login page then shows a **Sign in with &lt;name&gt;** button.

| Variable                   | Default               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`           | —                     | Client ID of the application you created at the IdP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`       | —                     | Client secret (confidential client).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `OIDC_ALLOW_EMAIL_LINKING` | `false`               | Link a first-time IdP sign-in to an existing ShareTab account with the same email (case-insensitive), unless that account is already linked to an IdP identity. Refused while anyone can sign up with a password (password login on and Registration Mode set to _Open_), and when the IdP marks the email unverified. See [Security notes](#oidc-security-notes). |
| `OIDC_TOKEN_AUTH_METHOD`   | `client_secret_basic` | How the client secret is sent to the token endpoint: `client_secret_basic` or `client_secret_post`. Must match the client's setting at the IdP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `DISABLE_PASSWORD_LOGIN`   | `false`               | Hide the email/password form and close registration. Ignored (with a warning in the log) unless OIDC or magic link sign-in is configured. With SSO only, link existing accounts first (see _Moving existing users to SSO_) or their owners, the admin included, can't sign in.                                                                                     |

`OIDC_AUTO_REGISTER` is independent of the admin **Registration** setting, which only governs the email/password sign-up form: with SSO, your IdP decides who may sign in. If your IdP allows public self-enrollment, set `OIDC_AUTO_REGISTER=false` or restrict the application at the IdP.

**Setup**

1. At your IdP, create an OpenID Connect application (Authentik: _OAuth2/OpenID Provider_, client type _Confidential_) with the scopes `openid`, `email`, and `profile`.
2. Set its redirect URI to `<NEXTAUTH_URL>/api/auth/callback/oidc`, e.g. `https://sharetab.example.com/api/auth/callback/oidc`.
3. Set `NEXTAUTH_URL` to the URL people use to reach ShareTab (it defaults to `http://localhost:3000`), then `OIDC_ISSUER`, `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, and `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, and restart ShareTab. Behind a reverse proxy, also set `AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true`.

**Moving existing users to SSO**

1. Make sure each person's email at the IdP matches their ShareTab email (case doesn't matter) and that the IdP doesn't mark it unverified: ShareTab won't link an account when the IdP sends `email_verified: false`. Authentik's default email scope mapping always sends `false`; if you trust the addresses stored in Authentik, give the provider a custom email scope mapping that returns `"email_verified": True` instead.
2. In the admin dashboard, set Registration Mode to _Closed_ (linking is refused while anyone can sign up with a password; _Invite Only_ is accepted too, but anyone holding an unused invite code could still register someone else's address, so revoke unused invites first). Then check that each ShareTab account whose email matches an IdP user really belongs to that person: linking hands the account to the IdP user, and its existing password keeps working.
3. Set `OIDC_ALLOW_EMAIL_LINKING=true` and have everyone sign in once with the SSO button; this links their IdP identity to their existing account.
4. Turn `OIDC_ALLOW_EMAIL_LINKING` back off, and optionally set `DISABLE_PASSWORD_LOGIN=true`.

**Troubleshooting:** "Sign-in failed" after clicking the SSO button or returning from the IdP usually means an issuer mismatch (check the trailing slash), `invalid_client` (switch `OIDC_TOKEN_AUTH_METHOD`), or an IdP client that doesn't allow the authorization code grant (the log shows `OAuthCallbackError`, and Authentik logs `Invalid grant_type for provider`; enable the _authorization_code_ grant type on the provider). Landing back on the login page with no message means ShareTab couldn't map the IdP's profile (the log shows `OAuthProfileParseError`). In both cases the container log shows the exact Auth.js error.

"An account with this email already exists…" means a ShareTab account has that email but the IdP identity isn't linked to it. The `reason` in the `auth.oidc_denied` log line says why:

- `linking_disabled`: `OIDC_ALLOW_EMAIL_LINKING` is off; link as in _Moving existing users to SSO_.
- `email_unverified`: the IdP sent `email_verified: false` for this user; see step 1 above.
- `password_registration_open`: linking is on but Registration Mode is _Open_; close it (step 2 above).
- `already_linked`: the account is linked to a different IdP identity. If the IdP user was recreated, confirm at the IdP that the old identity (the row's `providerAccountId`) no longer exists before deleting that account's `provider = 'oidc'` row in the `Account` table, then link again.
- `ambiguous_email`: several ShareTab accounts share the email in different letter cases; delete the extra account (see [Accounts whose emails differ only in letter case](#email-case-uniqueness)).
- `placeholder`: the email belongs to a placeholder or deleted user, which can't be signed in to.

<a id="oidc-security-notes"></a>**Security notes**

- Only enable `OIDC_ALLOW_EMAIL_LINKING` if your IdP doesn't let users set arbitrary, unverified email addresses (for example by editing their own email in the IdP's profile page); otherwise someone could claim another person's email at the IdP and take over their ShareTab account. ShareTab refuses to link when the IdP marks the email unverified, but many IdPs don't send `email_verified` at all, so that check alone doesn't make linking safe. Keep it on only while migrating.
- Admin rights still come from `ADMIN_EMAIL`, so whoever the IdP lets sign in with that address is the admin. On a new instance, sign in as the admin before anyone else can: once the admin account exists and is linked, another IdP identity with that address is refused. SSO accounts are created with a lowercase email; keep `ADMIN_EMAIL` lowercase.
- If someone is already signed in, starting an SSO sign-in for a different or not-yet-linked identity is refused; they must sign out first. This stops an IdP account from being attached to whoever last used a shared device.
- Accounts are linked to the IdP's user ID (`sub`). If you switch to a different IdP, delete the old links first (rows with `provider = 'oidc'` in the `Account` table), or a new IdP user whose ID happens to match an old one would sign in to that old account; then link everyone again as in _Moving existing users to SSO_.
- Signing out of ShareTab doesn't sign you out of the IdP.
- Magic link sign-in (when `EMAIL_SERVER_HOST` is set) creates an account for any email address, regardless of `OIDC_AUTO_REGISTER` or the Registration setting.
- Google sign-in (when `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` are set) likewise creates an account for any Google user, regardless of the Registration setting.

## Development

### Automation Commands

These commands are intended to be explicit enough for a human or an LLM to use without inferring repo-specific workflow details.

```bash
# Bump version files on main and update CHANGELOG.md
npm run version:bump -- patch

# Create a release branch + PR from main
npm run release:create -- patch

# Create a PR from the current branch
npm run pr:create -- --title "feat: example change"

# Push the current HEAD to origin/main
npm run push:main

# Publish a merged release by pushing the version tag
npm run release:publish -- v1.2.3
```

Intent mapping:

- "bump the version" -> `npm run version:bump -- <patch|minor|major>`
- "create a release" -> `npm run release:create -- <patch|minor|major>`
- "create a PR" -> `npm run pr:create -- [--base main] [--title \"...\"]`
- "push to main" -> `npm run push:main`
- "publish the release" -> `npm run release:publish -- [vX.Y.Z]`

Release flow:

1. Run `npm run release:create -- patch` from `main`.
2. Merge the generated `release/vX.Y.Z` PR.
3. Run `npm run release:publish -- vX.Y.Z` from `main`.

`release:publish` only creates and pushes the git tag. The actual GitHub release page and semver Docker images are still published by [publish-release.yml](./.github/workflows/publish-release.yml).

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env  # Then edit .env as needed

# Option A: All-in-one (embedded PostgreSQL + schema push + seed + dev server)
npm run dev:full

# Option B: Manual setup (bring your own PostgreSQL)
# Set DATABASE_URL in .env pointing to your PostgreSQL instance
npx prisma db push
npm run db:seed    # optional -- creates demo data
npm run dev
```

Demo accounts after seeding: `alice@example.com`, `bob@example.com`, `charlie@example.com` (password: `password123`).

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests (Vitest)
npm test

# E2E tests (requires dev server running)
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 npx playwright test

# E2E with visible browser
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 npx playwright test --headed

# Include AI-dependent tests (requires configured AI provider)
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 RUN_AI_TESTS=1 npx playwright test
```

Set `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX=9999` and `GUEST_RATE_LIMIT_MAX=9999` in `.env` to avoid rate limiting during repeated test runs.
