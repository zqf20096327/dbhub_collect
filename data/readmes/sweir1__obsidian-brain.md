A standalone Node MCP server that gives Claude (and any other MCP client) **semantic search + knowledge graph + vault editing** over an Obsidian vault. Runs as one local stdio process — no plugin, no HTTP bridge, no API key, nothing hosted. Your vault content never leaves your machine.

## Why obsidian-brain?

- **Works without Obsidian running** — unlike Local REST API-based servers, obsidian-brain reads `.md` files directly from disk. Obsidian can be closed; your vault is just a folder.
- **No Local REST API plugin required** — nothing to install inside Obsidian for the core experience.
- **Chunk-level semantic search with RRF hybrid retrieval** — embeddings at markdown-heading granularity, fused with FTS5 BM25 via Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Finds the exact chunk, ranks on meaning.
- **The only Obsidian MCP server with PageRank + Louvain + graph analytics** — ask for your vault's most influential notes, bridging notes, theme clusters. Nobody else ships this.
- **Ollama provider for high-quality local embeddings** — switch to `qwen3-embedding:0.6b`, `nomic-embed-text`, `bge-m3`, etc. with one env var.
- **All in one `npx` install** — no clone, no build, no API key, no hosted endpoint. Vault content never leaves your machine.

## Quick start

### One-line install (macOS + Claude Desktop)

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sweir1/obsidian-brain/main/scripts/install.sh)"
```

Installs Homebrew + Node 20+ if you don't already have them, adds the `/usr/local/bin` symlinks that Claude Desktop needs, merges obsidian-brain into your `claude_desktop_config.json`, opens the Full Disk Access pane for you to toggle Claude on, and relaunches Claude. You'll be asked for your macOS password once (for Homebrew + the symlinks) and your vault path once. Everything else is automatic. Audit what it does: [`scripts/install.sh`](scripts/install.sh).

### Manual install

Requires Node 20+ and an Obsidian vault (or any folder of `.md` files — Obsidian itself is optional).

Wire obsidian-brain into your MCP client. Example for **Claude Desktop** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian-brain": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "obsidian-brain@latest", "server"],
      "env": { "VAULT_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/your/vault" }
    }
  }
}
```

Quit Claude Desktop (⌘Q on macOS) and relaunch. That's it.

> [!NOTE]
> On first boot the server auto-indexes your vault and downloads a ~34 MB embedding model. Tools may take 30–60 s to appear in the client. Subsequent boots are instant.

> [!TIP]
> **Not a developer?** The [macOS walkthrough](docs/install-mac-nontechnical.md) covers Homebrew, Node, the GUI-app PATH fix, and Full Disk Access step-by-step.

**For every other MCP client** (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Jan, Windsurf, Cline, Zed, LM Studio, JetBrains AI, Opencode, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Warp): see [Install in your MCP client](docs/install-clients.md).

## What you get

18 MCP tools grouped by intent:

- **Find & read** — `search`, `list_notes`, `read_note`
- **Understand the graph** — `find_connections`, `find_path_between`, `detect_themes`, `rank_notes`
- **Write** — `create_note`, `edit_note`, `apply_edit_preview`, `link_notes`, `move_note`, `delete_note`
- **Live editor** (requires [companion plugin](docs/plugin.md)) — `active_note`, `dataview_query`, `base_query`
- **Maintenance** — `reindex`, `index_status`

## How it works

```mermaid

    Client["<b>MCP Client</b><br/>Claude Desktop · Claude Code<br/>Cursor · Jan · Windsurf · ..."]

    subgraph OB ["obsidian-brain (Node process)"]
        direction TB
        SQL["<b>SQLite index</b><br/>nodes · edges<br/>FTS5 · vec0 embeddings"]
        Vault["<b>Vault on disk</b><br/>your .md files"]
        Vault -->|"parse + embed"| SQL
        SQL -.->|"writes"| Vault
    end

    Client <-->|"stdio JSON-RPC"| OB
```

Retrieval and writes both go through a SQLite index: reads are microsecond-cheap, writes land on disk immediately and incrementally re-index the affected file. Embeddings are chunk-level (heading-aware recursive chunker preserving code + LaTeX blocks), and `search`'s default `hybrid` mode fuses chunk-level semantic rank with FTS5 BM25 via Reciprocal Rank Fusion.

## Companion plugin (optional)

An optional Obsidian plugin at [`sweir1/obsidian-brain-plugin`](https://github.com/sweir1/obsidian-brain-plugin) exposes live Obsidian runtime state — active editor, Dataview results, Bases rows — over a localhost HTTP endpoint. When installed and Obsidian is running, `active_note`, `dataview_query`, and `base_query` light up. Install via BRAT with repo ID `sweir1/obsidian-brain-plugin`.

Ship plugin and server at the **same major.minor** — server v1.7.x pairs with plugin v1.7.x. Patch-version drift is fine.

## Troubleshooting

Four most common:

- **"Connector has no tools available"** in Claude Desktop — usually the server crashed at startup. Check `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-obsidian-brain.log`. Fix: `npm install -g obsidian-brain@latest`, quit Claude (⌘Q), relaunch.
- **`ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED` / `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` mismatch** — `better-sqlite3` built against a different Node ABI. Fix: `PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH npm rebuild -g better-sqlite3`.
- **`Vault path not configured`** — `VAULT_PATH` is unset. Set it in the `env` block of your client config or shell.
- **Old version loading via `npx`** (your client still shows the previous release after a publish) — stale npx cache. Fix: `rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx`, then restart your client. Keeping `@latest` in your config prevents this.
