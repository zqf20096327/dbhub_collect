`beaver` is a simple, local, and embedded database designed to manage complex, modern data types without requiring a database server, built on top of SQLite.

## Design Philosophy

`beaver` is built with a minimalistic philosophy for small, local use cases where a full-blown database server would be overkill.

  * **Minimal Dependencies**: The core library has minimal dependencies (`numpy`, `pydantic`, `rich`, `typer`). Advanced features (like the REST server) are optional extras.
  * **Safe Concurrency**: Thread-safe and multi-process-safe by default, with robust inter-process locking.
  * **Local-First**: A single, portable SQLite file is the default.
  * **Fast & Performant**: Zero network latency for local operations and an optional, in-memory read cache.
  * **Standard SQLite**: The database file is 100% compatible with any standard SQLite tool, ensuring data portability.
  * **Pythonic API**: Designed to feel like a natural extension of your code, using standard Python data structures and Pydantic models.

## Installation

Install the core library:

```bash
pip install beaver-db
```

> **Note:** `beaver-db 2.0` is currently in release-candidate cycle. The
> CLI (`beaver` command), REST API server (`beaver serve`), `BeaverClient`
> remote, and the published Docker image are all **landing in 2.0 final**
> (target: June 2026). Today the library is consumed as a Python API only.
> Track progress at `vault/Atlas/Architecture/2026-05-15-beaver-v2-release-plan.md`
> in the workspace, or watch the `2.0` issues on GitHub.

## Quickstart

Get up and running in 30 seconds. This example showcases a dictionary, a list, and full-text search in a single script.

```python
from beaver import BeaverDB, Document

# 1. Initialize the database
db = BeaverDB("data.db")

# 2. Use a namespaced dictionary for app configuration
config = db.dict("app_config")
config["theme"] = "dark"
print(f"Theme set to: {config['theme']}")

# 3. Use a persistent list to manage a task queue
tasks = db.list("daily_tasks")
tasks.push("Write the project report")
tasks.push("Deploy the new feature")
print(f"First task is: {tasks[0]}")

# 4. Use a document collection for storage + full-text search
articles = db.docs("articles")
doc = Document(
    id="sqlite-001",
    body="SQLite is a powerful embedded database ideal for local apps.",
)
articles.index(document=doc)

# Perform a full-text search
results = articles.search("database")
top = results[0]
print(f"FTS Result: '{top.document.body}' (score={top.score:.2f})")

db.close()
```

## Features

  * [**Key-Value Dictionaries**](https://syalia.com/beaver/guide-dicts.html): A Pythonic, dictionary-like interface for storing any JSON-serializable object or Pydantic model within separate namespaces. Includes TTL support for caching.
  * [**Blob Storage**](https://syalia.com/beaver/guide-blobs.html): A dictionary-like interface for storing binary data (e.g., images, PDFs) with associated JSON metadata.
  * [**Persistent Lists**](https://syalia.com/beaver/guide-lists.html): A full-featured, persistent Python list supporting `push`, `pop`, `prepend`, `deque`, slicing, and in-place updates.
  * [**Persistent Priority Queue**](https://syalia.com/beaver/guide-queues.html): A high-performance, persistent priority queue perfect for task orchestration across multiple processes.
  * [**Probabilistic Sketches:**]() Track cardinality and membership for millions of items in constant space using HyperLogLog and Bloom Filters.
  * [**Document Collections**](https://syalia.com/beaver/guide-collections.html): Store rich documents combining a vector embedding and Pydantic-based metadata.
  * [**Vector Search**](https://syalia.com/beaver/guide-collections.html%23vector-search): Fast, multi-process-safe linear vector search using an in-memory `numpy`-based index.
  * [**Full-Text & Fuzzy Search**](https://syalia.com/beaver/guide-collections.html%23full-text-fuzzy-search): Automatically index and search through document metadata using SQLite's FTS5 engine, with optional fuzzy search for typo-tolerant matching.
  * [**Knowledge Graph**](https://syalia.com/beaver/guide-collections.html%23knowledge-graph): Create directed, labeled relationships between documents and traverse the graph to find neighbors or perform multi-hop walks.
  * [**Pub/Sub System**](https://syalia.com/beaver/guide-channels.html): A powerful, thread and process-safe publish-subscribe system for real-time messaging with a fan-out architecture.
  * [**Time-Indexed Logs**](https://syalia.com/beaver/guide-logs.html): A specialized data structure for structured, time-series logs. Query historical data by time range or create a live, aggregated view.
  * [**Event-Driven Callbacks**](https://syalia.com/beaver/guide-channels.html): Listen for database changes in real-time. Subscribe to events on specific managers to trigger workflows or update UIs.
  * [**Inter-Process Locking**](https://syalia.com/beaver/guide-locks.html): Robust, deadlock-proof locks. Use `db.lock('task_name')` to coordinate arbitrary scripts, or `with db.list('my_list') as l:` to perform atomic, multi-step operations.
  * [**Pydantic Support**](https://syalia.com/beaver/dev-architecture.html%23type-safe-models): Optionally associate `pydantic.BaseModel`s with any data structure for automatic, recursive data validation and (de)serialization.
  * **Data Export**: Dump most data structures to a portable JSON file with a single `.dump()` command. (Full backup/restore symmetry — `.load()` across all managers, plus the `beaver` CLI and REST server — lands in `2.0` final; tracked in issues #15, #18, #36.)
