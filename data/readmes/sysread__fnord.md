## NOTE

`fnord` is no longer under active development. It is still usable, but may not receive updates or support. I encourage you to take a look at `fnord`'s successor, [thatch](https://www.github.com/sysread/thatch), an `opencode` plugin that brings `fnord`'s capabilities to your favorite AI API provider (well, those supported by `opencode` anyway).

## Description

`fnord` is a command line tool that uses multiple LLM-powered agents and tools to provide a conversational interface to your codebase, notes, and other (non-binary) files.
It can be used to generate on-demand tutorials, playbooks, and documentation for your project, as well as to search for examples, explanations, and solutions to problems in your codebase.

For markdownlint rules and configuration reference, see [the markdownlint documentation](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint?tab=readme-ov-file). The `.markdownlint.json` file is kept as strict JSON for compatibility with the installed `markdownlint-cli2` parser.

## Why `fnord`?

AI-powered tools are limited to the data built into their training data. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** using tool calls can supplement the training data with information, such as your code base, to provide more accurate and relevant answers to your questions.
But even with RAG, the AI still runs up against the **context window**. This is the conversational "memory" of the AI, often making use of an "attention mechanism" to keep it focused on the current instructions, but causing it to lose track of details earlier in the conversation.
If you've ever pasted multiple files into ChatGPT or worked with it iteratively on a piece of code, you've probably seen this in action. It may forget constraints you defined earlier in the conversation or hallucinate entities and functions that don't exist in any of the files you've shown it.
`fnord` attempts to mitigate this with cleverly designed tool calls that allow the LLM to ask _other_ agents to perform tasks on its behalf. For example, it can generate a prompt to ask another agent to read through a file and retrieve specific details it needs, like a single function definition, the declaration of an interface, or whether a specific function behaves in a certain way. This keeps the entire file out of the "coordinating" agent's context window while still allowing it to use the information in the file to generate a response. This allows `fnord` to conduct more complex research across many files and directories without losing track of the details it needs to provide accurate answers.

## Documentation

fnord's docs are organized into three lanes:

- **[Use-case runbooks](docs/use-cases/README.md)** — end-to-end
  workflows: "I'm trying to do X, here's the path and the gotchas." Start
  here if you want to *do* something.
- **[User guides](docs/user/README.md)** — feature and configuration
  reference: what each command, flag, and setting does.
- **[Developer docs](docs/dev/README.md)** — architecture notes for
  contributors and LLMs working on fnord itself.

You can also ask fnord about its own features directly — the documentation
search tool covers the use-case and user lanes.

## Installation

`fnord` is written in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and is distributed as an `escript`.

- **Install [elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)**

```bash
# MacOS
brew install elixir

# Debian-based
sudo apt-get install elixir
```

- **Add the `escript` path to your shell's PATH**

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.mix/escripts:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

- **Install `fnord`**

```bash
mix escript.install github sysread/fnord
```

- **Set your OpenAI API key**

`fnord` reads the key from either `FNORD_OPENAI_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
Create or view your keys [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

- **Optional: Install `ripgrep`**

`fnord` includes tooling for the LLM to use the `ripgrep` tool in addition to semantic search.
This enables the LLM to answer questions about your code base, even if the project has not been indexed yet (with the caveat that the results will be less context-aware).

- **Optional: Install a markdown viewer**

Markdown seems to be the language of choice for LLMs, so installing something like `gum` or `glow` to pipe output to will make the output more readable.
You can make your preferred formatter persistent by setting the `FNORD_FORMATTER` environment variable in your shell.

```bash
export FNORD_FORMATTER="gum format"
```

## Getting Started

For the purposes of this guide, we will assume that `fnord` is installed and we are using it to interact with your project, `blarg`, which is located at `$HOME/dev/blarg`.

## Tool usage

### Index your project

The first step is to index your project to make it searchable with `fnord`'s semantic search capabilities.
The first time you index your project may take a while, especially if there are a lot of files.
`fnord` respects `.gitignore`, but you may also wish to exclude certain paths or globs from indexing (e.g., `-x 'node_modules'`).

```bash
fnord index --project blarg --dir $HOME/dev/blarg --exclude 'node_modules'
```

If you cancel partway-through (for example, with `Ctrl-C`), you can resume indexing by running the same command again.

**Once indexed, `fnord` starts background indexers during `ask` runs and reports whether files remain new, stale, or deleted at the end of the session.**

You can also manually re-index your project at any time to pick up changes immediately. This is done by running the same command again.

`fnord` stores its file index under `$HOME/.fnord/projects/<project>`.

`fnord` also builds a commit index for semantic search over your repository history. Commits are enumerated starting from `HEAD` and walking back through history. The commit index is stored under `$HOME/.fnord/projects/<project>/commits`. This is _not_ currently exposed via `fnord search`.

Note that semantic search requires an existing index. You can still perform text searches via the shell tool (e.g., ripgrep) if installed and approved, but indexing is recommended for full capabilities.

**Warning:** If you have _just_ created your OpenAI API key, you are likely to encounter rate limits when indexing project (or otherwise using fnord).  OpenAI has API rate limits restricted by [usage tiers](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits#usage-tiers).

### Prime the knowledge base

`fnord` can generate an initial set of learnings about your project to prime its knowledge base.

```bash
fnord prime --project blarg
```

### Configuration

You can view and edit the configuration for existing projects with the `fnord config` command.

```bash
fnord config list --project blarg
fnord config set --project blarg --root $HOME/dev/blarg --exclude 'node_modules' --exclude 'vendor'
```

Projects can also define validation commands that fnord runs automatically after code-modifying tool usage when the configured rules match the changed files. If you omit `--path-glob`, the rule applies to any changed file in the project.

```bash
fnord config validation list --project blarg
fnord config validation add --project blarg "mix format"
fnord config validation add --project blarg "mix test"
fnord config validation add --project blarg "mix format" --path-glob 'lib/**/*.ex'
fnord config validation remove --project blarg 2
fnord config validation clear --project blarg
```

### Approval patterns

For safety, fnord requires approval for shell commands and file operations. You'll be prompted to approve operations as fnord works. To streamline your workflow, you can pre-approve specific commands using regex patterns. See [docs/user/approval-patterns.md](docs/user/approval-patterns.md) for details.

### Search your code base

`fnord`'s semantic search is powered by embeddings generated by OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` model. The indexing process does a lot more than simply generate embeddings for the contents of your files. It also generates summary documentation for each file as well as an index of all functions, entities, and symbols in each file to enhance semantic matches for common questions and symbols.

Commit search is available to the assistant as a tool during `fnord ask`. It is not a standalone CLI command; the agent may call it internally to answer questions about your repository history.

```bash
fnord search --project blarg --query "callers of some_function"
fnord search --project blarg --query "some_function definition"
fnord search --project blarg --query "unit tests for some_function"
```

The summaries generated by the indexing process can also be included in the search results with the `--detail` flag.

```bash
fnord search --project blarg --query "some_function declaration" --detail | glow
```

If you would like to see more information about a single file, you can use the `summary` command.

```bash
fnord summary --project blarg --file "path/to/some_module.ext" | glow
```

### Search behavior and fallbacks

`fnord` uses semantic search by default when the project has been indexed.
For `fnord search`, an index is required; without it you won't get semantic results.
You can still ask questions, and the AI may use shell_tool-assisted text searches (for example, ripgrep) if installed and approved.
For rich, accurate results, index your project first.

### Generate answers on-demand

`fnord` uses LLM-powered agents and tool calls to research your question, including semantic search and git tools (read only).

```bash
fnord ask --project blarg --question "Where is the unit test for some_function?"

# Continue a conversation
fnord ask --project blarg --follow <ID> --question "Is some_function still used?"
```

After each response, you'll see a conversation ID. Use `--follow <ID>` to continue the conversation or `--fork <ID>` to branch a new thread.

Use the `--save` (or `-S`) flag to save the raw assistant response (before `FNORD_FORMATTER`) to a file.
By default, files are written under `~/fnord/outputs/<project_id>/<slug>.md`.
The `<slug>` comes from the first line `# Title: ...` in the response.

Use `--tee <file>` (or `-t <file>`) to write a plain-text (no ANSI) transcript of the entire `ask` run to a file.
If the file already exists, fnord prompts before overwriting in interactive use; non-interactive runs fail and require `--TEE`.
Use `--TEE <file>` (or `-T <file>`) to overwrite/truncate without prompting.

```bash
fnord ask --project blarg -S --question "Explain foo's behavior"
```

For advanced options (e.g., unindexed projects, replaying conversations), see [docs/user/asking-questions.md](docs/user/asking-questions.md).

#### Create and manage your fnord doc library

`fnord` keeps a persistent library of saved outputs, project notes, and searchable memory so later sessions can reuse prior work.

- Saved outputs (via `--save`) are stored in `~/fnord/outputs/<project_id>/`.
- View project notes with `fnord notes`.
- Search project or global memory with `fnord memory`.
- Browse saved outputs and notes with a markdown viewer (for example, `glow`). For more, see [docs/user/asking-questions.md](docs/user/asking-questions.md) and [docs/user/learning-system.md](docs/user/learning-system.md).

### Learning over time

`fnord` learns about your project while researching your questions. It builds up project notes and memory that later sessions can search and recall. As that context grows, fnord can answer increasingly complex questions with less repeated research.

You can prime this learning process with:

```bash
fnord prime --project blarg
```

For managing and viewing learned knowledge, see [docs/user/learning-system.md](docs/user/learning-system.md).

### Upgrades

`fnord` is under active development and new features are added regularly. To upgrade to the latest version, simply run:

```bash
fnord upgrade
```

Note that this is just a shortcut for:

```bash
mix escript.install --force github sysread/fnord
```

### Other commands

- List projects:        `fnord projects`
- List files:           `fnord files --project <project>`
- View file summary:    `fnord summary --project <project> --file <path>`
- View notes:           `fnord notes --project <project>`  (use `--reset` to clear)
- Delete a project:     `fnord torch --project <project>`
- Upgrade fnord:        `fnord upgrade`

## User integrations

### Project prompts

Create a project-level `FNORD.md` file at your project's root for project-specific guidance and optionally a `FNORD.local.md` file for personal instructions. When both exist, fnord reads `FNORD.md` first and appends `FNORD.local.md`, with the local file taking precedence on conflicts unless explicitly overridden in your prompt. We recommend adding `FNORD.local.md` to your `.gitignore` to avoid committing personal instructions.

### Frobs

Create custom tools (frobs) that fnord can use while researching. Use frobs to query project-specific APIs, check deployment status, retrieve GitHub PR details for review, or gather information from Kubernetes clusters.

```bash
fnord frobs create --name my_frob
fnord frobs check --name my_frob
fnord frobs list
```

Frobs are stored in `~/fnord/tools/`. For implementation details, see [docs/user/frobs-guide.md](docs/user/frobs-guide.md).

### MCP support

MCP servers extend fnord with external tools and data sources. Add servers for GitHub, Kubernetes, project-specific APIs, or any MCP-compatible service.

```bash
# Add a stdio server
fnord config mcp add <name> --transport stdio --command ./server

# Add an HTTP server
fnord config mcp add <name> --transport http --url https://api.example.com

# Add with OAuth when the server supports automatic discovery and registration
fnord config mcp add <name> --transport http --url https://api.example.com --oauth
fnord config mcp login <name>
```

**Advanced Configuration:** For complete command reference, custom transport options, and manual configuration, see [docs/user/mcp-advanced.md](docs/user/mcp-advanced.md).

#### OAuth Authentication

`fnord` supports OAuth2 for MCP servers, including automatic discovery and registration when the server supports it:

```bash
fnord config mcp add myserver --transport http --url https://example.com --oauth
fnord config mcp login myserver
```

For advanced OAuth options, troubleshooting, and security details, see [docs/user/oauth-advanced.md](docs/user/oauth-advanced.md).

## Writing code

`fnord` can (optionally) automate code changes in your project using the `ask` command with the `--edit` flag.

- Use `--edit` with extreme caution.
- AI-driven code modification is unsafe, may corrupt or break files, and must always be manually reviewed.
- Optionally add `--yes` to auto-confirm edit prompts. In fnord-managed worktrees, it also skips the interactive post-session review and attempts the usual merge-and-cleanup flow automatically.

### How it works

The LLM has access to several tools that allow it to modify code within the project directory and perform basic file management tasks.
It *cannot* perform write operations with `git` or act on files outside of the project's root and `/tmp`.

```bash
fnord ask --project myproj --edit --question "Add a docstring to foo/thing.ex"
```

**In git repositories, fnord may use a conversation-bound worktree for edit-mode sessions. Use `--worktree` to point fnord at an existing git worktree directory for the current run.**

```bash
fnord ask --project myproj --worktree /path/to/myproj-wt --edit --question "Add a docstring to foo/thing.ex"
```

Code modification by an LLM is *unreliable* and is not safe for unsupervised use.
The AI may behave unpredictably.
