Self-hostable version (great for teams)
----------------------------------------

There are 3 ways:

1. Run as a standalone: JAR file, Docker, and Render.com.
2. Embed into your Java application and serve on a specific port.
3. Embed into your Java application and serve on your main port but at a specific path.

Backdoor is based on [Embeddable Java Web Framework](https://github.com/tanin47/embeddable-java-web-framework) and
published as a fat jar. Therefore, there is no external dependency. Its jar is self-contained and suitable for embedding
into your JVM application.

### 1. Run as a standalone

__<ins>Use Docker</ins>__

The docker image is here: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tanin47/backdoor

```
docker run -p 9999:9999 \
           --entrypoint "" \
           --pull always \
           tanin47/backdoor:web-latest \
           java -jar backdoor.jar \
           -port 9999 \
           -url "postgres://127.0.0.1:5432/backdoor_test,jdbc:ch://localhost:8123?user=backdoor&password=test_ch" \
           -secret-key SbZlbmJIXh \
           -user test_user:test_pass,another_user:another_pass
```

__<ins>Run from the JAR file</ins>__

First, you can download the `backdoor-VERSION.jar` file from
the [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.tanin47/backdoor) page.

Then, you can run the command below:

```
java -jar backdoor-VERSION.jar \
  -port 9999 \
  -url "postgres://127.0.0.1:5432/backdoor_test,jdbc:ch://localhost:8123?user=backdoor&password=test_ch" \
  -secret-key SbZlbmJIXh \
  -user test_user:test_pass,another_user:another_pass
```

You can visit http://localhost:9999 and login with a Postgres user, a ClickHouse user, or a masked user (e.g.
`test_user` and `another_user`).

See FAQ for how authentication works.

__<ins>Use Render.com</ins>__

The file [render.yaml](./render.yaml) shows a blueprint example of how to run Backdoor on Render.

### 2. Embed and serve on a specific port

First, you see the latest version in
the [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.tanin47/backdoor) page.

Add the dependency to your project:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.tanin47</groupId>
    <artifactId>backdoor</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST_VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

Then, initialize Backdoor when your Java application starts:

```
var server = new BackdoorServerBuilder()
  .addDatabaseConfig("postgres", "postgres://127.0.0.1:5432/backdoor_test", null, null)
  .addDatabaseConfig("clickhouse", "jdbc:ch://localhost:8123", "backdoor", "test_ch")
  .withPort(9999)
  .withSecretKey("SbZlbmJIXh")
  .addUser("test_user", "test_pass")
  .addUser("another_user", "another_pass")
  .build();

server.start();
```

Then, when your Java application stops, make sure to stop Backdoor with:

```
server.stop();
```

### 3. Embed and serve on a specific path

First, you must follow the steps above in order to serve Backdoor at a specific internal port.

Then, you can designate a specific path and use the below code to proxy requests to Backdoor:

```
var client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
var httpRequest = HttpRequest
  .newBuilder()
  .uri(URI.create("http://localhost:9999" + path)) 
  .method("GET", HttpRequest.BodyPublishers.ofByteArray(new byte[0])) // Set the method and body in bytes
  .headers(/* ... */) // Forward the headers as-is.    
  .build();
var response = client.send(httpRequest, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofByteArray());
```

The above code uses the HTTP client offered by Java. It doesn't require any external dependency.


Features
---------

* Support multi-databases.
* Edit a field, delete a row, sort, and filter
* Rename and drop table
* Run arbitrary SQLs
* Activity history (through regular logs).
* Support its own users, so you don't have to share the database credentials.
* Support database users e.g. logging in with Postgres or ClickHouse users.

Secure your Backdoor instance
------------------------------

While Backdoor comes with strong security limiting the session lengths and deterring brute-force attacks through a
Proof-of-Work Captcha through [altcha](https://github.com/altcha-org/altcha), you can add more layers of security.
Here are 2 more ways:

### 1. SSH tunneling

You can block your port using a firewall and use SSH tunneling to allow you to connect to a Backdoor instance.

You can run: `ssh -L <local_port>:<remote_backdoor_host>:<remote_backdoor_port> <user>@<ssh_server>` and visit:
`http://localhost:<local_port>` to access Backdoor.

### 2. VPN

Your company might already use VPN. It's a great option to connect to a server that hosts a Backdoor instance.

The setup might be complicated and overkilled, so I'd recommend using this option if your company already have a
VPN. [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) is one example that provides a company VPN.

FAQ
-----

### How does the authentication work?

Backdoor supports __masked users__ and __database users__.

1. __Masked users__ are the users you set on Backdoor through `BackdoorServerBuilder.addUser(..)` or `-user`.
2. __Database users__ are the users that you set on the databases
   e.g. [Postgres users](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-createuser.html), [ClickHouse users](https://clickhouse.com/docs/operations/settings/settings-users).

These 2 types of users work in conjunction with the database configurations as follows:

1. Any 2 type of users can login into the dashboard.
2. Any logged-in user can access any database whose config contains valid credentials.
3. If a database config doesn't contain credentials, then the logged-in user can click on the "locked" database to
   provide valid credentials for that database.

With these combinations, you can configure the authentication to fit your needs.

For simplicity, I'd recommend using masked users and providing valid credentials in all database configurations.

### How to configure the loggers?

Backdoor uses `java.util.logging`. The default logging config is at
`./web/src/main/java/resources/logging.properties`.

If you have your own log config file, you can load it using:

```
try (var configFile = YourClass.class.getResourceAsStream("/YOUR_LOG_CONFIG_FILE")) {
  LogManager.getLogManager().readConfiguration(configFile);
  logger.info("The log config) has been loaded.");
} catch (IOException e) {
  logger.warning("Could not load the log config file: "+e.getMessage());
}
```

3. On a separate terminal, run `npm run hmr` in order to hot-reload the frontend code changes.
4. Visit http://localhost:9090 and login with `masked_test` and `1234`

How to run tests
-----------------

1. Run `./setup/setup_db.sh` in order to set the postgres database.
2. Set up the ClickHouse instance as follows:

- The HTTP port is 8123

- The password is `test_ch`

3. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
4. On a separate terminal, run `npm run hmr`.
5. Start the ClickHouse server by running `clickhouse server`.
6. Run `./gradlew test` in order to run all the tests.

Publish JAR
------------

This flow has been set up as the Github Actions workflow: `publish-jar`.

1. Run `./gradlew clean publish`. It is *IMPORTANT* to include *clean*.

You can run your server with: `java -jar ./build/libs/backdoor-VERSION.jar`

To publish to a Maven repository, please follow the below steps:

1. Set up `~/.jreleaser/config.toml` with `JRELEASER_MAVENCENTRAL_USERNAME` and `JRELEASER_MAVENCENTRAL_PASSWORD`
2. Run `./gradlew jreleaserDeploy`

Test Docker locally
--------------------

   Central Sonatype.

Release a new desktop version
------------------------------------

1. Create an empty release with a new tag. The tag must follow the format: `desktop-X.Y.Z`.
2. Go to Actions and wait for the `create-release-desktop` (which is triggered automatically) workflow to finish.
3. Download the DMG and test it locally.
4. Go to Actions and trigger the workflow `publish-desktop-testflight` on the tag `desktop-X.Y.Z` in order to publish
