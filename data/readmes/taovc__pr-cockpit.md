## Download

A desktop build is the fastest way to try it — no clone, no toolchain.

**[⬇ Download a build](https://github.com/taovc/pr-cockpit/releases)** — builds are currently published as a rolling `nightly` pre-release, rebuilt on every push to `main`.

| Platform | File |
|---|---|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `pr-cockpit-<version>-arm64.dmg` |
| Windows (x64) | `pr-cockpit-<version>-x64.exe` |
| Linux (x86_64) | `pr-cockpit-<version>-x86_64.AppImage` |

Intel Macs are not covered by a prebuilt package yet — [build from source](#build-from-source) instead.

**None of the packages are code-signed**, so every platform shows a warning on first launch:

- **macOS** reports the app as damaged or from an unidentified developer. Clear the quarantine flag once:
  ```bash
  xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/PR Cockpit.app"
  ```
  Or right-click the app in Finder → **Open** → **Open** in the dialog.
- **Windows** shows a SmartScreen "Windows protected your PC" dialog. Click **More info** → **Run anyway**.
- **Linux** needs the AppImage marked executable before it will start:
  ```bash
  chmod +x pr-cockpit-*-x86_64.AppImage
  ```

You still need `gh auth login` and a Claude or Codex login before the app can do anything — see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

## How it works

No more reviewing PRs one at a time in the terminal, and no more scattering fixes and feature work across separate shells. Pull a repo's PRs into the cockpit → the AI reviews, rechecks, fixes, or develops inside isolated worktrees → you gate findings, conversations, diffs, pushes and PR creation in the web UI → GitHub remains the external system of record. Each project can choose Claude or Codex with its own model, effort and review methodology.

## Features

**PR workbench and review**
- Pull a repo's PR list through `gh` / GraphQL, then filter by author, PR state, review state, fix state and worktree state; the list auto-refreshes on a poll while the page is visible.
- The right-side drawer shows AI review, fix chat, timeline and diff, with descriptions and comments rendered as markdown.
- The AI reviews in an isolated read-only git worktree and produces structured findings — severity, `path:line`, problem, detail and fix guidance — plus a plain-language summary of what the PR is trying to do and the shortest manual test path for it.
- Feedback-guided re-review keeps your checkboxes/notes; author-change recheck reads the latest commits and judges each finding.

**Human gate + publishing**
- Per-finding checkbox to "post as a PR comment" + a note (the note is woven into the comment as an edit instruction, not leaked verbatim).
- Pre-publish preview (dry-run, cacheable / regenerable); findings in any working language are rewritten as professional English GitHub comments.
- Findings whose `path:line` lands on a line the PR actually changed are posted as inline review comments; the rest are collected into a summary section instead of being dropped.
- Publishing goes through `gh api .../reviews`, with a posting claim and self-healing cleanup of leftover pending reviews, which prevents duplicate concurrent posts.

**Fix PRs**
- The fix tab is a persistent chat: the agent edits the PR worktree, but does not commit or push by default.
- "Commit and upload" first shows the diff plus an editable conventional commit message; only confirmation runs `git add/commit/push`.
- Supports stop/resume, expandable run logs, decision cards, an ultracode toggle that escalates the turn to higher reasoning effort, and an explicit dangerous-command toggle.

**Project assistant: directory chat and feature development**
- The project assistant (bottom-right button on a project page) starts a session either in the project directory or in an isolated feature worktree on a new branch ("New branch"), and lets the agent develop in a single native chat loop.
- Real decision points are rendered as `ask-user` cards. Opening a PR is an explicit action that allows the agent to commit, push and run `gh pr create` for that turn; commit messages and PR title/body are always written in English.
- The bottom-right global assistant inherits project provider/cwd when available and supports commands such as `/cd`, `/resume` and `/clear`, for ad-hoc troubleshooting and one-off operations.

**Per-project config**
- Each project chooses Claude or Codex. Review, fix chat, recheck, skill generation and publish-time rewriting follow that provider without mixing sessions or models.
- Claude models come from the local `claude`; Codex uses preset/default models. Effort, Codex Fast/service tier and methodology are configurable per project.
- Multiple review skills, one active at a time; AI generation reads the local repo docs and architecture, saves a candidate and lets you diff before activation — activation never overwrites the current skill.

**Safety & consistency**
- Review agents are read-only: tool-level blocking for git writes, file edits, network access and dangerous commands, plus an operating contract and skill linting.
- Write-capable paths run inside isolated worktrees; push, PR creation and dangerous commands require explicit UI action or toggles.
- Git operations on the same repo are serialized; findings are transactional; deleted tasks clean worktrees; restarts recover or stop interrupted work.
- PR automation is high-risk and disabled by default; when enabled it reuses the existing review/post/fix/push endpoints from a server-side poller.

## Tech stack

Nuxt 4 + @nuxt/ui (Tailwind v4) · better-sqlite3 + drizzle · `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` · `@openai/codex-sdk` · local `gh` CLI · Electron packaging that runs Nitro under Electron's Node mode.

## Prerequisites

Needed whichever way you run it:

- `gh auth login` completed — every GitHub read and write goes through the GitHub CLI
- Claude provider: local `claude` login or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Codex provider: local Codex login or `OPENAI_API_KEY`

Needed only when building from source:

- Node ≥ 22, pnpm 9

## Build from source

Step-by-step guide for a first run from source. If you only want to use the app, [download a desktop build](#download) instead — it needs no toolchain. See "Getting started" below for the condensed version.

**1. Check the prerequisites**

```bash
node -v      # ≥ 22
pnpm -v      # 9.x  (otherwise: corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@9 --activate)
gh --version
gh auth status   # must show "Logged in"; otherwise: gh auth login
```

Also confirm the provider you plan to use is available: Claude needs a local `claude` login or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; Codex needs a local Codex login or `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

**2. Get the project**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/taovc/pr-cockpit.git
cd pr-cockpit
```

**3. Configure the environment**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Every variable has a sensible default; in practice you only adjust:

| Variable | When to change it |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | If `3001` is already taken |
| `INFERENCE_PROVIDER` | `claude` (default) or `codex` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Optional for the Claude path; use when local `claude` login is unavailable |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | When local Codex login is unavailable and you want to use an OpenAI API key |

The full list of variables is in the [Configuration (.env)](#configuration-env) section.

**4. Install dependencies**

```bash
pnpm install
```

The `postinstall` step automatically runs `nuxt prepare` (Nuxt type generation).

**5. First run**

```bash
pnpm dev      # http://localhost:3001
```

On first start, **the SQLite database (`./data/cockpit.db`) is created automatically**. The default worktree location is `.pr-cockpit-worktrees/` inside each project's local clone, so IDEs can discover it like normal repo-local worktrees (VS Code needs `git.repositoryScanMaxDepth` set to `2` or `-1`; the default of 1 only scans one level down). The directory is added to the project's `.git/info/exclude`, keeping the main repo's `git status` clean. Startup recovery moves existing persistent worktrees from the old `./data/worktrees` location when they still exist. No manual migration is required. The Drizzle schema is set up on the fly (`ensureSchema()` / `ensureColumns()` in `core/db/client.ts`).

**6. Production build (optional)**

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

Electron preview / packaging:

```bash
pnpm electron:preview
pnpm electron:dist
```

**Troubleshooting**

- **Port already in use** → change `PORT` in `.env`.
- **`gh` not authenticated** → `gh auth login` (GitHub reads/writes depend on it).
- **Inspect the database** → `pnpm db:studio` (opens Drizzle Studio).

## Getting started

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # adjust PORT / model / paths as needed
pnpm install
pnpm dev                  # defaults to http://localhost:3001
```

Once inside, click the "＋" on the left to create a project (fill in `owner/repo` + the local clone path), configure provider/model/effort and generate a review skill. Then use "All PRs" for review/fix work, or the project assistant (bottom right) for a directory chat or a new feature branch.

## Configuration (.env)

See `.env.example`; key entries:

| Variable | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `3001` | Port |
| `INFERENCE_PROVIDER` | `claude` | `claude` / `codex` |
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | `sonnet` | Default review model (overridable per project) |
| `CODEX_MODEL` |  | Default model for Codex projects; empty uses the Codex default |
| `CODEX_SERVICE_TIER` |  | Optional global default Codex/OpenAI speed tier; the project-level Fast toggle overrides it. To disable global fast, leave/delete it and also remove `service_tier` from `~/.codex/config.toml` if set globally |
| `CODEX_PROJECT_DOC_FALLBACK_FILENAMES` | `CLAUDE.md,.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Project docs Codex reads when `AGENTS.md` is absent |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `sk-...` | Optional when local Codex login is unavailable |
| `TRANSLATE_MODEL` | `sonnet` | Lightweight model for rewriting GitHub comments into English |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `sk-ant-...` | Optional for the Claude path when local login is unavailable |
| `DEFAULT_REPO` | `owner/repo` | Optional, default repo when pasting a bare PR number |
| `DB_PATH` | `./data/cockpit.db` | SQLite path |
| `WORKTREE_LOCATION` | `repo` | `repo` = IDE-visible `.pr-cockpit-worktrees/` inside each local clone; `central` = use `REPOS_DIR` |
| `REPOS_DIR` | `./data/worktrees` | Worktree root for `central` mode; legacy migration source in `repo` mode |
| `MAX_CONCURRENCY` | `3` | Maximum number of parallel reviews |

### Codex log hints

- `Not inside a trusted directory and --skip-git-repo-check was not specified`: Codex started from a non-git directory. The project-page global assistant prefers the project's local path as its working directory; if you `/cd` to a non-git directory by hand, the runner skips the git repo check automatically.
- `CodexWarning failed to parse plugin hooks config .../claude-plugins-official/.../hooks.json`: Codex picked up a Claude plugin's hook config and does not recognize that format. This warning normally just means the hook was ignored — it does not mean the current task failed.
