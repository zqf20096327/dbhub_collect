# 🛡 Termaxa

**Run AI coding agents with confidence.**

**Try it in ten seconds, nothing installed:** [play.termaxa.com](https://play.termaxa.com) runs the real gate on a throwaway project. Try to get a destructive command past it.

*Inside the agent, not beside it: Claude Code asks to force-push, the gate answers in its own prompt with what the remote would lose and the backup already taken. Nothing staged.*

Termaxa is a Rust command-line gate for the shell commands a coding agent runs: it previews the blast radius, backs up first, blocks the dangerous ones, and keeps a record the agent cannot rewrite. No model, no service, no account — a hook for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and Copilot, or a wrapper for anything else. It's a cooperative windshield, not a sandbox.

---

Your AI agent wants to run `git push --force`, `DROP TABLE users`, `terraform apply`, `rm -rf`. Most of the time it's right. Sometimes it isn't. Today your only options are *supervise every command* (which defeats the point of an agent) or *trust it blindly* (which defeats your Friday).

Termaxa is a third option: a gate the agent's commands pass through. It reads a policy you wrote, shows you what's actually about to happen, backs up what's about to change, and records everything. Hooks for **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **Cursor** and **Copilot CLI**, all live-tested; `termaxa wrap` for a harness without hooks; a standalone CLI anywhere. Running agents in [Herdr](https://herdr.dev)? `herdr plugin install termaxa/termaxa` puts the gate, the record and the reason a pane went red in the multiplexer ([the plugin](herdr-plugin/)).

```
  Claude Code --> TERMAXA --> git . postgres . docker . terraform . your shell
                    |
                    +- decide    allow / ask / deny  (your policy)
                    +- preview   commits lost, rows affected, resources destroyed
                    +- insure    automatic backup before destructive ops
                    +- escalate  repeated destructive intent -> auto-deny
                    +- record    every attempt, with an execution report
```

## Quick start (5 minutes)

**1. Install.**

```bash
brew install termaxa/tap/termaxa     # macOS / Linux (prebuilt, sha256-pinned)
cargo install termaxa                # any OS, with a Rust toolchain
winget install Termaxa.Termaxa       # Windows (the winget manifest can lag a release)
scoop bucket add termaxa https://github.com/termaxa/scoop-bucket && scoop install termaxa   # Windows, always current
```

Or download the asset for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/termaxa/termaxa/releases); every one is attested and checksummed, and the Linux one is a static musl build that runs on any distro.

There is deliberately no `curl | sh` installer — Termaxa itself flags that pattern as a hazard, and the gate's rules apply to the gate. Every binary is a checksummed Release asset built by the tag-gated CI.

```bash
termaxa                       # what this is, and what to try next
termaxa check "rm -rf /"      # works immediately — no setup, no project config
termaxa replay                # every command your agents have run on this machine, judged; nothing executed
```

`replay` reads the transcripts Claude Code and Codex keep under your home directory and answers the question to ask before installing a gate: how often would it have asked about your ordinary work? Every ask it lists is a rule to add or a reason it should stay an ask.

**2. Wire up a project.**

```bash
cd your-project
termaxa init --claude-code      # writes .termaxa/policy.yaml, installs the Claude Code hook
termaxa doctor                  # confirm it's actually wired up
```

**3. See it work.**

```bash
termaxa check "git push --force origin main"
```

From now on, every Bash command Claude Code runs in this project passes through Termaxa first. Runtime state (logs, backups) lives in `~/.termaxa/`, safely **outside** your repo.

## What it looks like

### 1 - A destructive command can't hide behind a safe prefix

```console
$ termaxa check "git status && rm -rf /"
decision  deny
reason    segment 2/2 `rm -rf /` — Recursive delete from the filesystem root is blocked.
```

Termaxa splits compound commands and judges each part. `git status &&` buys nothing.

### 2 - Blast radius, before you commit to it

```console
$ termaxa check "psql -d shop -c 'DROP TABLE users'"
decision  deny
reason    DROP TABLE is blocked. Archive or rename instead.

postgres impact
  DROP TABLE users
    rows (estimate) : 50,000
    referenced by   : audit_log, orders, sessions (3 tables)
    without CASCADE : this DROP will FAIL (dependents exist)
  insurance : pg_dump users before execution (automatic on run/hook)
```

Row estimates come from the planner (`pg_class.reltuples`, stale between `ANALYZE`s) — Termaxa never scans your tables.

### 3 - An agent that retries can't syntax its way through

An agent blocked on `rm -rf .` will often just try again with different words. Termaxa classifies the *intent*, not the spelling, and trips a per-session circuit breaker on repeat attempts:

```console
$ rm -rf .                        -> ask   (file-delete #1)
$ Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .   -> ask   (file-delete #2, different shell)
$ del /s /q .                     -> DENY  circuit breaker: 2 prior
                                     file-delete attempts this session
```

Three shells, one intent, third variant auto-denied — no rule enumerated per spelling. `find -exec rm`, `xargs rm`, and `unlink` count too. Configure via `circuit_breaker:` in `policy.yaml` (on by default, threshold 2).

### 4 - Destroy, then un-destroy

```console
$ termaxa run -- git push --force origin main
┌ push preview (main -> origin)
│  ⚠ remote will LOSE 1 commit(s):
│    ✗ 44510f1 important work
└
Proceed? [y/N] y
🛟 backup b-1783006590625 — origin/main @ 44510f1 pinned to termaxa/backup/b-1783006590625
$ termaxa rollback b-1783006590625
✓ origin/main restored to 44510f1
```

Force push measures what the remote will *lose*, not just gain — and pins it to a backup branch first.

### 5 - What a delete actually costs

Deletes are the most common destructive command and the easiest to get wrong,
because a path can look correctly scoped right up until it isn't:

```console
$ termaxa check "rm -rf /c/Users/harih"
decision  ask
reason    no rule matched; policy default is `ask`

delete impact
  target      : C:\Users\harih
  as written  : /c/Users/harih
  ⚠ OUTSIDE the project root (C:\Users\harih\project)
  ⚠ resolves to a USER PROFILE directory
  ⚠ contains  : .ssh (SSH private keys), .aws (AWS credentials)
  contains    : 5,000+ files (stopped counting) across 422 directories
  ✗ insurance : too large to copy (5,000+ files) — NOT recoverable
```

`/c/Users/harih` is Git Bash syntax for `C:\Users\harih` — a real user
profile, not a stray directory. Termaxa resolves the path, counts what's
actually inside it (budgeted: 5,000 files or 300ms, and it says when it
stopped counting), flags credentials in the blast radius, and tells you
whether a backup is even possible.

An ordinary in-project delete says none of that, which is the point — a
warning that fires on `rm -rf ./target` is a warning nobody reads:

```console
$ termaxa check "rm -rf ./target"
delete impact
  target      : /home/you/project/target
  contains    : 1,204 files across 38 directories
  insurance   : copy 1 path(s) to .termaxa/backups before deletion
```

**What it can't do:** know what you meant. If the path has a typo in it,
Termaxa will faithfully report the blast radius of the path you actually
typed. Making that gap visible before execution is the whole contribution.

### Is it actually wired up?

The failure mode nobody warns you about: the hook is installed, the agent doesn't call it, and everything looks fine. `termaxa doctor` answers the question directly.

```console
$ termaxa doctor

Termaxa doctor

──────────────────────────────────────────

  proof is in the log: run your agent, then `termaxa report`
```

**Configured and live** is earned, not assumed: doctor invokes the registered hook command exactly as the agent would — synthetic must-deny payload on stdin, two-second timeout — and requires a decision back. Three states: **configured and live** (it answered), **registered but NOT firing** (a registration exists, the command doesn't run — worse than absent, because it's the state that *looks* safe), and **not configured**. Until v0.15 doctor only checked that a registration existed; a hook whose path was mangled at exec failed non-blocking, two full sessions ran ungated, and doctor said "configured" in green throughout.

Two honest boundaries. The probe only runs binaries named `termaxa` — a settings file arrives with a cloned repo and is untrusted input. And **live means "answered when doctor invoked it"**: if the agent's own invocation is broken on the agent's side, the probe can't see that — which is why doctor pairs it with the log. Live here plus no recent hook entries there means the agent has never reached the gate; doctor says so and points you at `TERMAXA_HOOK_DEBUG`, because agents rename their hook APIs, and when they do, the gate fails open and silent (see [Honest limitations](#honest-limitations)). Doctor is read-only, probe included: no backup, no audit entry, no notification — proven by test against the real binary.

The breaker blocked file-delete 1 time in this scope.

This often indicates:
• generated files being cleaned
• build/output directories
• an agent retry loop

If this work is intentional, add an explicit allow rule
scoped to the paths involved — relaxation is deliberate.

One command, no flags: what the agent tried, what got blocked, what's recoverable — plus a 30-day view. Note that *destructive intents* and *breaker trips* are separate numbers: a legitimate `rm -rf ./build` is a classified intent, not a trip.

Every line is a fact with a source in the audit log. Nothing invented, nothing collected: the report reads the local append-only log, makes no network calls, and sends no telemetry.

## Why Termaxa?

**"Claude Code already asks permission — why do I need this?"**

The built-in prompt tells you the *command*. Termaxa tells you the *consequence*: 50,000 rows, 3 dependent tables, 1 commit lost. It takes the backup **before** you approve, and when it blocks something it tells the model *why*, so the agent proposes an alternative instead of retrying.

**Why not a sandbox / Docker / Claude Code's `/sandbox`?**

A sandbox contains damage *to the sandbox*. But your repo, your database, and your Terraform state are exactly the real things an agent must touch to be useful — and a sandbox's default write scope *is* your working directory. Containment, consequence, and recovery are three different questions: sandboxes answer the first, Termaxa answers the second and third. They're complementary — run both. ([Longer version.](https://termaxa.com/blog/claude-code-sandbox))

**Why not OPA / policy engines?**

OPA decides allow/deny well. It has no execution previews, no automatic backups, no rollback, and no agent-native hook. Termaxa is policy *plus* the things you actually want when an agent is holding the keyboard.

## In Herdr

[Herdr](https://herdr.dev) is a terminal multiplexer for running several agents at once. The plugin in [`herdr-plugin/`](herdr-plugin/) gives it three things: an action that starts Claude Code (or Codex, through its hook) in a new pane under the gate; a pane that follows the project's record live; and a watcher that puts the gate's verdict on the sidebar (`termaxa deny`, with the command and reason) and opens the record beside the agent the moment it is refused. Measured in a live Herdr 0.9.1 session; the two Herdr facts it depends on (plugin commands do not get your login PATH; a plugin pane starts in the plugin root) are in its README.

```bash
herdr plugin install termaxa/termaxa
```

## Supervised mode (Unix, v0.17)

Everything above runs as **you**. The hook reads the policy, decides, writes the audit log and takes backups with the same filesystem authority the agent has — which is enough for the threat model Termaxa is built for, and not enough for one specific claim: in basic mode, **the audit log is the agent's own account of itself**.

Supervised mode moves the authority. A small daemon runs as you; the agent runs as a different user; the two talk over a socket:

```
  agent user                          you
  ----------                          ---
  claude --> termaxa hook --socket--> termaxa supervise
                                        |
                                        +- reads the policy
                                        +- decides
                                        +- takes the backup
                                        +- writes the audit log
```

The agent's user cannot read the audit log, edit the backups, change the policy, or stop the supervisor — **not because the code refuses, but because the OS does.**

```bash
termaxa init --supervised     # prints the setup; runs none of it
termaxa supervise &           # as you
sudo -u termaxa-agent termaxa wrap -- claude
```

`init --supervised` prints and never executes: creating a user and chowning a directory tree need root, and a tool that asks for root to "set things up for you" is asking to be trusted with exactly the authority this mode exists to bound. `termaxa doctor` then reports what those commands actually produced.

**What it does not change.** This is still an enforcement layer, not an isolation layer. An agent's native file tools reach the gate only through the path rules that name them (v0.19), under a supervised gate exactly as under a basic one, and `wrap` catches a shell resolved by name — not `/bin/sh` by absolute path. What changes is who decides and who holds the record.

**How well it is proved.** A boundary rig creates a second real account and has it try: 23 assertions, each with a control leg proving the operator *can* do the thing, so a refusal means "blocked" rather than "impossible for everyone". It has also run with a real agent twice — and the [field report](docs/field-reports/2026-08-17-supervised-routing.md) is published including what broke, because the first session found agent commands never reached the supervisor at all. Full setup, the credential tradeoff, and what remains untested: [docs/supervisor.md](docs/supervisor.md).

## Architecture

```

Six engines, one binary. Policy is in-repo (`.termaxa/policy.yaml`, reviewable in PRs); logs and backups live in `~/.termaxa/` where no `git` operation can touch them.

## Policy

`.termaxa/policy.yaml` — first match wins, `*` is a wildcard, matching is case- and whitespace-insensitive:

```yaml
version: 1
default: ask                     # unmatched commands require approval

rules:
  - match: "git status*"
    action: allow
  - match: "git push*--force*"
    action: ask
    reason: "Force push — remote history will be overwritten."
  - match: "*drop table*"
    action: deny
    reason: "DROP TABLE is blocked. Archive or rename instead."

  # match_path matches the RESOLVED target, not the spelling. `> .env` and
  # `> ./.env` are one file, and a rule needs only one of the two matchers.
  - match_path: "*/.env"
    action: deny
    reason: "Overwriting .env destroys credentials that are not in the repo."

circuit_breaker:                 # optional (on by default)
  enabled: true
  threshold: 2                   # trip on the 3rd repeated destructive attempt

notify:                          # optional
  webhook: https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
  on: [deny, ask]

# Both default to the cooperative choice; set them for unattended runs.
unrecognised: allow              # deny: refuse a shell event the hook cannot read
backup_failure: proceed          # deny: refuse a command whose backup could not be taken
```

## Honest limitations

Termaxa is pre-1.0. It's real and tested, and it is not magic. Specifically:

- **Hooks advise; they don't enforce.** Termaxa gates commands an agent submits through the Claude Code or Cursor hook. Those agents are *cooperative* — they respect a `deny` and propose an alternative, which is what makes the gate work. An agent running in full-auto mode could, in principle, retry a blocked action through a different command or shell; the circuit breaker raises the cost of that, but a hook is an *integration* point for visibility and policy, not an *enforcement* boundary. `termaxa wrap -- <agent>` (Unix, v0.16) widens this: commands the agent runs *through a shell resolved by name* pass through the gate even without a hook, though a caller naming `/bin/sh` by absolute path still does not. Claude Code is that caller — measured Sep 10, 2026, it runs `/bin/bash` by absolute path when it finds no zsh — so `wrap` sets `CLAUDE_CODE_SHELL` to its shim, which Claude Code honours; a harness that hardcodes its shell and offers no such setting stays outside — Codex is one (measured Sep 19, 2026: its login shell by absolute path, `$SHELL` ignored), and its hooks are the way in. [**Supervised mode**](#supervised-mode-unix-v017) (Unix, v0.17) goes further and moves the *authority* — but it moves who decides, not where the boundary is: an agent's native tools bypass it exactly as they bypass a basic gate. For hard guarantees today, pair Termaxa with OS-level sandboxing.
- **The gate fails open on a payload it doesn't recognise — by design, and you can turn that off.** A hook that fails closed on every harness update becomes the outage the day a harness renames an event. So a payload Termaxa can't read passes through untouched, and `termaxa doctor` and the liveness probe are how you find out it happened. (It has happened: Cursor 3.11 renamed its hook events and four releases went ungated before v0.11.4.) For unattended runs, where a stopped agent is cheaper than an ungated one, `unrecognised: deny` in the policy refuses any event that looks like a shell tool call and can't be read, and `backup_failure: deny` refuses a command whose insurance couldn't be taken instead of running it with a warning nobody is reading.
- **Native agent tools are judged by their target, and only by their target.** Since v0.19 the write matcher's events go through the same `match_path` rules as a shell command: a rule that names the file decides, with the cost shown, insurance taken and a receipt afterwards; a file no rule names gets no decision at all. String rules and the policy default do not apply to them. Every harness's write payloads are captured and read: Claude Code's `Write`/`Edit`/`MultiEdit`/`NotebookEdit`, Codex's `apply_patch` (its file headers, v0.19.1), Cursor's `Write` and `Delete` (v0.19.2; `Delete` passed through by default until then). `docs/dialects.md` has every shape. The Cursor agent that switched to its file-delete tool in live testing and removed files Termaxa never saw is the case this was built for; OS-level isolation is still what stops an agent that is trying. A script the agent writes and then runs (`python remover.py`) is the biggest thing the gate cannot see: an ask, with no preview and no insurance.
- **Cooperative, not a sandbox.** Termaxa governs commands that flow through the agent hook, `termaxa run`, or a `wrap`ped shell. An agent with raw, unhooked shell access is *not* contained — that needs OS-level sandboxing, a complementary layer. Supervised mode does not change this: it makes the *record* trustworthy and the *decision* privileged, and leaves the interception boundary where it was. The threat model is *agents making expensive mistakes*, not a malicious agent actively evading you.
- **Shell parsing is good, not perfect.** It splits on `&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`
  and a lone `&`, reads `-c` strings, `eval '…'` and git's global options as
  what they run, and flags `$(...)` unless the policy would explicitly allow
  what is inside it (a quoted heredoc is data). Subshells `( )` and deeply
  nested quoting are judged conservatively, not deeply understood. A path
  built from a variable the same command line assigns in the clear
  (`X=/tmp/a; rm -rf $X`) resolves since v0.19; one from the caller's
  environment (`rm -rf ~/x/$SID`) does **not** — Termaxa cannot see that
  environment, and expanding it here would be guessing. Since v0.16 that
  target is carried as *unresolved* rather than resolved-wrongly, which lets
  the policy layer treat it as its own kind of risk instead of pretending to
  know where it points.
- **Previews are best-effort.** No database connection → static analysis only. Terraform previews shell out to `terraform plan`. Remote Terraform state is versioned by its backend, not by Termaxa.
- **Backups have edges.** Since v0.16 delete insurance resolves the command head, so `sudo rm`, `/bin/rm`, `env rm` and (since v0.19.4) `git -C <dir> rm` are covered — but a delete expressed some other way (a script, a language runtime) is not, and a target over the preview's budget is refused by the copy with the preview's own words rather than silently uninsured. A link is copied as a link, never followed (v0.19.4). Postgres backups use `pg_dump`/`psql` and must be on your PATH. Retention since v0.19: a `retention:` key (defaults keep 50 / 30 days, both required) prunes at most one backup per insured command and all of them under `termaxa backups --prune`; every prune is a manifest record.
- **The format may still change.** Pre-1.0 means the policy schema and CLI can shift between minor versions. Pin a release.
- **Claude Code, Cursor, Codex and Copilot CLI are live-tested.** Claude Code and Cursor are exercised end-to-end, including the circuit breaker tripping under a real Cursor session and, since v0.19, native writes denied through the hook and Claude Code under `wrap` on Linux with and without zsh. Codex was measured live on Sep 5–6, 2026 (codex-cli 0.153.4, Windows 11) and again on Sep 19 (0.155.1, Linux, `apply_patch` and `PostToolUse` captured): a hard stop lands in Codex's own UI as "Blocked by hook" with Termaxa's reason and the blast-radius preview. Two things to know about Codex: its hooks honour exactly one PreToolUse verdict, `deny`, so under Codex an **ask is a refusal** — the reason says the gate asked and how to add an allow rule — and its "Bash" tool on Windows is PowerShell, which is why the starter allows the read-only cmdlets. Copilot CLI was measured live on Sep 9–10, 2026 (Copilot Free, Windows 11): an **ask arrives as a real prompt** with Termaxa's reason in it, a deny shows the reason, and an agent that was refused in PowerShell and tried `cmd /c rmdir /s /q` instead was refused again. Three things to know about Copilot: its shell tool on Windows is named `powershell`; it runs the hooks in `.github/hooks/*.json` first and then any in `.claude/settings.json` ("repo settings"), and a deny from the first stops the chain; and it reads a non-zero exit as a hook error, so Termaxa answers it with exit 0 and the verdict in the JSON. Write those hook files without a byte-order mark — Windows PowerShell 5.1's `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` adds one, and Copilot then ignores the file.
- **Windows PowerShell 5.1 mangles redirected Unicode.** `termaxa report > out.txt` writes UTF-16 and garbles the box-drawing glyphs. That's the shell, not Termaxa — use PowerShell 7, or `termaxa report --md | Out-File -Encoding utf8 report.md`.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. `cargo test` must pass; CI runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. The codebase is dependency-light Rust: ~13,600 lines of production code in `src/`, plus ~15,200 lines of tests (unit tests live beside the code they test; `tests/` holds the integration ones). More test than product, on purpose — `src/policy.rs` and `src/preview.rs` are the best places to start reading, and the test module at the bottom of each file explains what the code is defending against.

If you can make an agent get past the gate in a way that isn't already documented above, that's the most useful contribution you can make: [open an issue](https://github.com/termaxa/termaxa/issues) or email security@termaxa.com.
