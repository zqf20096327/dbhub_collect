## The Problem
Auth was built for humans clicking buttons. Your agents need something better.

When an AI agent delegates to a sub-agent, the trust chain breaks. Bearer tokens leak. Revocation becomes a mess. Auditors ask "which agent did what?" and you have no answer.

**SharkAuth aims to solve this.** It treats agents as first-class identities with native delegation, cryptographically bound tokens, and a unified audit trail that tracks every hop from user to resource.

## Install in 10 Seconds

```bash
curl -fsSL sharkauth.com/get | sh

# Or with Go 1.22+
go install github.com/shark-auth/shark/cmd/shark@latest
```

```bash
# Boot. SQLite-embedded, zero config.
shark serve
# => admin UI : http://localhost:8080/admin
# => issuer   : http://localhost:8080

# Dev mode (in-memory DB, magic links to stdout)
SHARK_DEV_MODE=1 shark serve
```

## Why Teams Choose SharkAuth

### 1. Agent Delegation That Actually Works

Real delegated authority using **RFC 8693 Token Exchange**. SharkAuth issues `may_act_grants` that are revocable, time-limited, and hop-constrained. No more prompt-level "trust me" delegation.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/demo.gif" width="480" alt="SharkAuth Demo" />
  <br /><em>Demo: user delegates to an agent, which delegates to a sub-agent — every hop cryptographically signed and auditable.</em>
</p>

### 2. Tokens Bound to Keys, Not Bearers (RFC 9449 DPoP)

Bearer tokens are a liability. SharkAuth ships **Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession** by default for tokens it issues. Every SharkAuth token is cryptographically bound to the agent's private key. Stolen via prompt injection or log leak? Useless without the key.

> **Current:** DPoP is enforced on all SharkAuth-issued tokens.  
> **Roadmap:** Extend SharkAuth to issue DPoP-bound tokens that agents use to call downstream services directly — so the agent never touches a raw bearer token, even when talking to third-party APIs.

### 3. Complete Provenance in One Query

One `grant_id` correlates every token, every hop, and every resource touched. Reconstruct the full lifecycle of an agent's authority instantly. No more "the agent did it" dead ends.

### 4. One Binary. Zero Dependencies. Anywhere.

SharkAuth is a single static Go binary with embedded SQLite WAL. No Postgres, no Redis, no Docker, no Helm charts.

### 5. Open Source, Zero Lock-In (MIT)

100% open source. SharkAuth collects only a one-time anonymous `install_id` ping by default, with telemetry opt-out available. No user, token, session, or auth data leaves your infrastructure. No vendor lock-in, no "free until we change our mind." Your auth stack is yours forever.

## Getting Started
Get the binary via the install script then:
### Running Shark

```bash
shark serve
```

### Dev mode (no config needed)

```bash
SHARK_DEV_MODE=1 shark serve
```


### TypeScript SDK

```typescript
import { AuthClient } from "@sharkauth/sdk";

const auth = new AuthClient("http://localhost:8080");

// Sign in
const session = await auth.login("alice@co.io", "Strong-Pwd-2026");
```

### Python SDK

```python
from shark_auth import AuthClient

auth = AuthClient("http://localhost:8080")
