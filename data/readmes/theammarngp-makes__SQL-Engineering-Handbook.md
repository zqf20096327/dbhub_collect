## Who This Is For

If you're an aspiring or practicing **Data Analyst** or **Analytics Engineer** who wants a structured path from SQL fundamentals to real business analytics — not another disconnected list of `.sql` files — this handbook is built for you.

---
## 🗂️ Module Guide

This is the part most handbooks . Every module below links straight to its folder and tells you exactly what's inside before you click.

## What Makes It Different

| | Typical SQL repo | SQL Engineering Handbook |
|---|---|---|
| 🗄️ Data | One generic sample table | Real-world-style datasets across HR, e-commerce, sales, finance, healthcare |
| 📖 Context | Bare query, no explanation | Business problem stated before every solution |
| ⚠️ Failure modes | Rarely documented | Common mistakes called out per pattern |
| 🎯 Interview angle | Absent | Dedicated interview-prep module + question bank |
| 📅 Progress | Static snapshot | Public roadmap, versioned via [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) |
| 🤝 Contribution | Solo repo | Structured community process via [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) |

## Feature Highlights

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 🏗️ Production SQL
Every completed module follows one format: **business context → SQL solution → explanation → common mistakes → interview follow-ups → practice challenge.**

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 📊 Real Datasets
Practice is built around real-world-style datasets (HR, e-commerce, sales, finance, healthcare) instead of one toy table, so the SQL transfers directly to a job.

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 🎯 Interview Ready
`17_SQL_INTERVIEW_QUESTIONS/` and `exercises/interview/` target the questions that come up most. Until they ship, `08_WINDOW_BUSINESS_CASES/` is the closest match.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 🧠 Analytics Engineering
Modules progress from syntax → analytical SQL (windows, CTEs) → engineering concerns (views, indexes, query optimization).

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 🧪 Exercises & Projects
`exercises/` (beginner → interview) and `projects/` (HR analytics, e-commerce, pizza sales, Olist, NagpurLens) turn concepts into a portfolio.

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 📚 Documentation Quality
Architecture, style guide, roadmap, and changelog are first-class files — not afterthoughts — so the repo stays maintainable as it grows.

```

Every numbered module is self-contained: read its own README, run its queries against the relevant dataset, then attempt the practice challenge at the end. See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the reasoning behind this layout.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/theammarngp-makes/SQL-Engineering-Handbook.git
cd SQL-Engineering-Handbook

# 2. Load a practice dataset (start with the core sample database)
mysql -u root -p < 00_SAMPLE_DATABASE/schema.sql

# 3. Start with Fundamentals, or jump to any completed module
cd 01_FUNDAMENTALS
```

**Database:** MySQL 8.0+. Queries are ANSI-standard where possible, with MySQL-specific notes called out — most run on PostgreSQL with minor syntax changes.

---

## Learning Tracks

<details>
<summary><b>📘 Sequential learner</b> — go module by module</summary>
<br>

Work straight through `00_SAMPLE_DATABASE` → `09_DATE_FUNCTIONS` (currently complete), then continue into `10`–`20` as they release. No prior SQL knowledge assumed.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🎯 Interview sprint</b> — targeted prep</summary>
<br>

Once live, `17_SQL_INTERVIEW_QUESTIONS/` and `exercises/interview/` will be the fastest path. Until then, `07_WINDOW_FUNCTIONS/` and `08_WINDOW_BUSINESS_CASES/` cover the most commonly tested interview topic.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>📚 Desk reference</b> — search when you need a pattern</summary>
<br>

Bookmark the repo and jump directly to the numbered module matching the syntax you need on the job.
</details>

---

## Sample Query

**Salary ranking with window functions** *(from `07_WINDOW_FUNCTIONS/`)*

```sql
SELECT
    emp_id,
    emp_name,
    salary,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank,
    LAG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS prev_salary
FROM employees;
```

Every completed module follows this format: business context → SQL solution → explanation → common mistakes → interview follow-ups → practice challenge.

## FAQ

**Is this finished?**
No — and it says so on purpose. Modules 00–09 are complete and stable. 10–20, plus datasets, exercises, projects, and cheatsheets, are actively being built. Check [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for live status.

**Do I need MySQL specifically?**
Queries are ANSI-standard where possible, with MySQL-specific notes called out. Most run on PostgreSQL with minor syntax changes.

**Is this beginner-friendly?**
Yes — start at `01_FUNDAMENTALS/`. It assumes no prior SQL knowledge.

**Can I use this for interview prep only?**
That's the goal of `17_SQL_INTERVIEW_QUESTIONS/` and `exercises/interview/` once live; until then, `08_WINDOW_BUSINESS_CASES/` is the closest match.
