`monarchmoney-cli` lets you query, manage, and automate Monarch Money data from the terminal or via AI agents, with stable JSON output and explicit safety gates around financial mutations.

## Highlights

- Agent-first: stable JSON output, distinct stdout/stderr, and predictable exit codes
- Safety-first: `--read-only`, `--dry-run`, and `--confirm` gates for financial data mutations
- Auditable: local JSONL audit logs for remote mutations
- Plain-text ownership: one-way regenerating hledger backups of your complete financial history (`monarch hledger backup`)
- Full-fidelity local archive: SQLite cache for offline queries, so your data outlives any subscription
- Fast single binary with broad Monarch surface: accounts, transactions, budgets, cashflow, rules, splits, recurring items, investments, and more

## Why

Monarch Money is powerful in the browser, but automations and agents need a deterministic command surface. `monarchmoney-cli` exposes account, transaction, budget, rule, and cashflow workflows as auditable commands rather than fragile browser steps.

## Quickstart

### Install

Run the following on macOS or Linux:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thedavidweng/monarchmoney-cli/main/install.sh | sh
```

Run the following on Windows:

```shell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thedavidweng/monarchmoney-cli/main/install.ps1 | iex"
```

The installer detects Homebrew automatically and uses it when available (recommended for easy upgrades). Otherwise it downloads the binary to `~/.local/bin`.

<summary>Other installation methods</summary>

**Homebrew Cask (macOS/Linux):**

```shell
brew install --cask thedavidweng/tap/monarchmoney-cli
```

If you installed the old Homebrew formula, migrate to the cask:

```shell
brew update
brew uninstall --formula thedavidweng/tap/monarchmoney-cli
brew install --cask thedavidweng/tap/monarchmoney-cli
monarch version
```

**Go:**

```shell
go install github.com/thedavidweng/monarchmoney-cli/cmd/monarch@latest
```

**Manual download:** grab the archive for your platform from the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/thedavidweng/monarchmoney-cli/releases/latest), extract it, and place the `monarch` binary on your `PATH`.

### Set up

```shell
monarch doctor
monarch auth login
```

Then try it:

```shell
monarch accounts list --json
monarch transactions search "Amazon" --from 2024-01-01 --json
monarch cashflow spending --from 2024-01-01 --to 2024-01-31 --json

# own your history as plain text (after `monarch cache sync`)
monarch hledger backup ~/finances/monarch.journal
```

### Uninstall

```shell
# Homebrew Cask
brew uninstall --cask thedavidweng/tap/monarchmoney-cli

# install.sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thedavidweng/monarchmoney-cli/main/install.sh | sh -s uninstall

# Go
rm "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/monarch"
```

Remove local data if desired: `rm -rf ~/.monarchmoney-cli` (on Linux, the state directory may live under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/monarchmoney-cli`).

[`money`](https://github.com/thedavidweng/money) is an open-source, self-hosted, fully local personal finance backend. It borrows the same JSON-first CLI contract and safety gates from `monarchmoney-cli`, but stores data on your own machine with no Monarch subscription required.
