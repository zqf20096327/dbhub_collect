## What it is

FinCore Engine is a modular, JVM-based financial core that provides the infrastructure layer for regulated fintech products. It handles the hard parts: ledger consistency, idempotent payment processing, KYC/AML orchestration, and explainable compliance decisions. Teams build their domain logic on top.

**What it is not:** a payment gateway, a banking-as-a-service product, or a SaaS platform. It is a self-hosted, embeddable engine for teams building their own regulated financial products.

## Features

- **Double-entry ledger** with invariant enforcement at application, service, and database layers - balances never drift.
- **Idempotent payment orchestration** - safe to retry; deduplication via `Idempotency-Key` header and transactional outbox.
- **KYC/AML orchestration framework** - the compliance service owns the workflow and delegates to external systems
  through plug-in ports (`KycProvider`, `SanctionsProvider`, `AmlCopilot`), with deterministic sandbox providers in
  tree. Real integrations are your adapters; see [PROVIDERS.md](PROVIDERS.md).
- **JSON DSL Decision Engine** - deterministic, auditable rule evaluation with full explainability; no embedded scripting languages.
- **OpenTelemetry-native observability** - distributed tracing, structured logging, and Micrometer metrics out of the box.

---

## Quick start

Requirements: Java 21+, Docker, Docker Compose.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tiana-code/fincore-engine.git
cd fincore-engine

# Start the sandbox stack: PostgreSQL, Keycloak, and the ledger, payments, and web services
docker compose up -d

# Run the ledger smoke demo (creates accounts, posts a balanced transaction)
./scripts/demo.sh
```

Prefer a guided flow? The `scripts/fincore` helper wraps the common steps:

```bash
./scripts/fincore init        # scaffold a local .env with sandbox defaults
docker compose up -d
./scripts/fincore status      # check the health of the running services
./scripts/fincore run-demo    # run the ledger smoke demo
```

The web dashboard is served at `http://localhost:8082`, the ledger API at `:8080`, payments at `:8081`, and
Keycloak at `:8085`.

Full documentation: [Wiki](https://github.com/tiana-code/fincore-engine/wiki)

### Observability profile (optional)

The telemetry backends are an opt-in Compose profile, so the default stack stays lean:

```bash
docker compose --profile observability up -d
```

This adds Prometheus (`:9090`, scrapes the services' `/actuator/prometheus`), Grafana (`:3000`, anonymous access
enabled, datasources pre-provisioned), Tempo (receives OTLP traces via the OpenTelemetry collector) and Loki. The
services export traces to the collector automatically when the profile is up. Loki is provisioned as a datasource;
shipping the services' JSON logs into it (a log shipper) is a follow-up - until then use `docker compose logs`.

## Developer experience

FinCore Engine ships with the tooling an adopter needs to integrate quickly:

- **Client SDKs** - a [Kotlin SDK](libs/sdk-kotlin) (`com.fincore:sdk-kotlin`) and a [TypeScript SDK](sdk/typescript)
  (`@fincore/sdk-typescript`) with typed clients for the ledger, payments, and compliance services. Ledger amounts are
  represented as strings to avoid floating-point drift.
- **`fincore` CLI** - the [`scripts/fincore`](scripts/fincore) helper scaffolds a sandbox `.env`, checks service
  health, and runs the smoke demo.
- **Runnable examples** - [`examples/node-quickstart`](examples/node-quickstart) lists and reads accounts through the
  TypeScript SDK, and [`examples/webhook-receiver`](examples/webhook-receiver) is a local harness that verifies
  payment-webhook HMAC signatures exactly as the payments service does.
- **API collection** - an importable [Bruno collection](api/collection) covering the ledger, payments, decision, and
  compliance endpoints for exploring a running sandbox.

## Architecture

Each service exposes its own REST API and is reached directly. There is no shared gateway: clients call the
ledger, payments, compliance, and decision services on their own ports.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Client -->|REST / OpenAPI| Ledger[Ledger Service]
    Client --> Payments[Payments Service]
    Client --> Compliance[Compliance Service]
    Client --> Decision[Decision Service]
    Ledger -->|Outbox| Broker[(Redpanda / Kafka)]
    Payments -->|Outbox| Broker
    Compliance -->|Outbox| Broker
    Ledger --> Postgres[(PostgreSQL 17)]
    Payments --> Postgres
    Compliance --> Postgres
    Decision --> Postgres
```

The message broker (Redpanda or Kafka) is a production option for cross-service event delivery; the local sandbox
stack runs the ledger, payments, and web services against PostgreSQL and Keycloak only.

## Why JVM, why now

Kotlin on the JVM offers virtual threads, sealed classes, and a mature ecosystem for building correct, maintainable financial software. The JVM has a long operational track record in regulated industries. Details in the [FinCore manifesto](https://itiana.dev/blog/fincore-manifesto).
