# TiDB Cloud Examples

A collection of examples demonstrating how to connect and use TiDB Cloud.

## Getting Started

These examples are built with modern web development tools and practices. Before you begin, make sure you have the following prepared:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or later
- pnpm 9.x or later (we use pnpm workspaces to manage multiple examples)
- A [TiDB Cloud](https://tidbcloud.com) account (free tier available, no credit card required)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tidbcloud/examples-projects.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Each example has its own environment variables that need to be configured. Check the README in each example directory for specific setup instructions.

4. If you only want to clone a single example, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx degit tidbcloud/examples-projects/examples/with-chat2query-api my-example
```

Then cd into that example directory and run `pnpm install`.

You can also replace **with-chat2query-api** with the name of the example you want to clone, for example:

```bash
npx degit tidbcloud/examples-projects/examples/with-data-api my-example
npx degit tidbcloud/examples-projects/examples/with-nextjs-todo my-example
npx degit tidbcloud/examples-projects/examples/with-vector-search my-example
```

Each project requires a `.env` file to be created in the root of the example directory. You can refer to the README in each example directory for more details.
