# Extensions for Vector

We have some sources and sinks associated with TiDB Cluster, but not sutable to put in official vector repository, e.g. the topsql source, are putted in this repository.

## Development

To add a new component, you can take topsql source as an example.

Steps in general:
1. Initialize a crate as a member of current workspace.
    * create a new crate at `extensions/${YOUR_COMPONENT_NAME}`
    * declare the crate at `workspace.member` in `Cargo.toml`
2. Introduce the component as a dependency.
    * add the component to `dependencies` in `Cargo.toml`
3. Add a feature to control if equipped with the component in `Cargo.toml`.
    * add a feature depends on the dependency introduced in step 2
    * extend the `features.default` to include the feature
4. Declare the component in `src/main.rs`
    * submit the config of the component via `inventory::submit!`
    * add an attribute `#[cfg(feature = "${FEATURE_ADD_IN_STEP_3}")]` above the delcaration

### Clean
