# GeoKenya

GeoKenya is a pnpm + Turborepo monorepo with an offline-first Expo mobile app, a TanStack Start landing site, and a Cloudflare Workers sync API.

| Package | Path | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `mobile` | `apps/mobile` | Expo React Native app |
| `web` | `apps/web` | Landing page, privacy policy, sync server |

**All mobile operations run 100% locally** — no internet required after install. The app uses SQLite with SpatiaLite for offline geospatial data.

**Note:** Android-only for now. iOS is not yet implemented.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- pnpm 9
- Android Studio (for native mobile builds)

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tigawanna/geo-kenya
cd geo-kenya
pnpm install
```

### Mobile app

```bash
pnpm --filter mobile dev
pnpm --filter mobile run:android
```

### Web (landing + sync API)

```bash
pnpm --filter web dev
```

Runs at `http://localhost:3050`. Privacy policy: `/privacy`. Sync API: `/api/sync/events`.

Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_WEB_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_SYNC_API_URL` in `apps/mobile/.env` to point the mobile app at your deployed web worker.

### Deploy web to Cloudflare

```bash
# once — create D1 and put the database_id into apps/web/wrangler.jsonc
wrangler d1 create geo-kenya-db
pnpm --filter web db:migrate:remote
pnpm --filter web secrets:auth
pnpm --filter web secrets:sync

# deploy (builds then wrangler deploy with dist/server/wrangler.json)
pnpm deploy:web
```

For Cloudflare Workers Builds (dashboard), do **not** run `npx wrangler deploy` from the monorepo root. Use:

- **Build command:** `pnpm --filter web build`
- **Deploy command:** `pnpm --filter web exec wrangler deploy --config dist/server/wrangler.json`

Set production secrets and update `BETTER_AUTH_URL` / `CORS_ORIGINS` (and build-time `VITE_API_URL`) to your worker URL.

## Building the Application

**Important**: This application requires a native build due to its custom Expo modules and SQLite with Spatialite extensions. The development server alone will not provide full functionality.

### Development Build

For development testing on a physical device or emulator:
```bash
npm run build:android
```

### Production Build

For creating a preview APK:

```bash
npm run build-apk
```



**Note**: A native build is required for the application to function properly due to the custom SQLite with Spatialite module and map functionality.

## Screenshots

### Location-Based Ward Discovery
Find wards closest to your current location with distance calculations (all computed locally)

**Note:** For improved location accuracy, consider enabling your network/WiFi connection alongside location services, even though the app works completely offline.

## Dataset

The geographic data used in this application is available in a separate repository: [kenya_wards_geojson_data](https://github.com/tigawanna/kenya_wards_geojson_data). This dataset contains GeoJSON files for Kenya's administrative boundaries that can be used in your own projects.

## Key Technologies

- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Navigation**: Expo Router (file-based routing)
- **UI Library**: React Native Paper with Material Design 3
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state, React Query for local data caching
- **Database**: SQLite with Spatialite extension via custom Expo modules (100% local)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage for persisted settings and preferences
- **Maps**: MapLibre GL for interactive mapping
- **Geospatial**: Local coordinate calculations and distance computations

## Interactive Map Features

GeoKenya includes powerful interactive map functionality:

1. **Visualize Wards**: View ward boundaries with color-coded styling for the selected ward and its neighbors
2. **Pin Placement Search**: Tap anywhere on the map to search for the nearest ward at that location
3. **Coordinate Search**: Enter latitude and longitude coordinates to find specific wards
4. **Location Services**: Use device GPS to automatically find your current ward
5. **County Boundaries**: Visualize Kenya's 47 counties with labeled overlays

## Search Functionality

GeoKenya offers multiple ways to find wards:

### Device Location
- Automatically detect your current ward using device GPS
- Find nearby wards with distance calculations

### Coordinate Search
- Enter latitude and longitude coordinates in the search bar (e.g., "-1.2921, 36.8219")
- Find wards at specific geographic points

### Interactive Map Search
- Tap anywhere on the map to search for the nearest ward at that location
- Visualize ward boundaries and neighboring wards

### Text Search
- Search wards by name, county, or constituency
- Filter through the complete list of 1,450+ wards

## Acknowledgments

This project builds upon several excellent open-source libraries and tools:

1. **[expo-material3-theme](https://github.com/pchmn/expo-material3-theme)** - Our dynamic color implementation is based on this project, which provides Material You theme generation for Expo applications.

2. **[android-spatialite](https://github.com/ev-map/android-spatialite)** - Our Expo Spatialite module is based on this Android library, which provides Spatialite extension support for SQLite on Android.

3. **[maplibre-react-native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-react-native)** - Interactive map rendering and manipulation.

We're grateful to the maintainers of these projects for their excellent work that made GeoKenya possible.

## Privacy & Offline Operation

**GeoKenya operates entirely offline** - your location data never leaves your device. All geographic calculations, database queries, and ward lookups are performed locally using the embedded SQLite database with Spatialite extensions.

## Platform Support

This is currently an **Android-only** project. While the codebase uses cross-platform technologies, it has only been tested and optimized for Android devices. iOS support is not yet implemented and may require additional work to function properly.
