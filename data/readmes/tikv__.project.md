# TiKV `.project`

`.project` (dot-project) is a CNCF initiative to centralize and automate metadata management for all CNCF projects.
This repository holds the canonical metadata for [TiKV](https://tikv.org) and is maintained by the CNCF automation tooling.

## What's in this repo

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `project.yaml` | Canonical project metadata (name, maturity, repositories, governance links, …) |
| `maintainers.yaml` | Maintainer and reviewer roster used for drift detection and mailing-list sync |
| `CODEOWNERS` | Ensures PRs to this repo require maintainer approval |
| `.github/workflows/validate.yaml` | CI — validates `project.yaml` and `maintainers.yaml` on every PR |
| `.github/workflows/update-landscape.yml` | Automatically proposes landscape updates when `project.yaml` changes |

## Keeping metadata up to date

Open a pull request against this repository to update any metadata field.
The validate workflow will check schema correctness and block merge if validation fails.

> **Note:** This repository was bootstrapped automatically from public sources (CNCF landscape, CLOMonitor, GitHub governance files).
> Some fields are best-effort guesses marked with `# TODO: AUTO-DETECTED — please verify` in the YAML files and should be confirmed by the project maintainers.
