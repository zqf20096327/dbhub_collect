RSigma is a complete detection engineering toolkit for the [Sigma](https://sigmahq.io/) detection standard, including a parser, evaluation engine, rule conversion, streaming runtime, linter, CLI, MCP, and LSP.

RSigma parses Sigma YAML rules into a strongly-typed AST, compiles them into optimized matchers, and evaluates them against log events in real time. It handles stateful correlation logic in-process with memory-efficient compressed event storage. Or as Zack Allen put it in [DEW #149](https://www.detectionengineering.net/i/191079258/detection-engineering-gem), "RSigma is essentially a SIEM."

You can send events in many formats, including JSON, syslog (RFC 3164/5424), logfmt, CEF, EVTX (Windows Event Log), plain text, and OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol), with auto-detection by default. pySigma-compatible processing pipelines handle field mapping and backend configuration. OTLP support lets any OpenTelemetry-compatible agent (Grafana Alloy, Vector, Fluent Bit, OTel Collector) forward logs to RSigma via HTTP or gRPC for detection.

For rule quality and editor integration, a built-in linter validates rules against 85 checks derived from the Sigma v2.1.0 specification, and an LSP server provides real-time diagnostics, completions, hover documentation, and quick-fix code actions in any editor.

RSigma builds on open industry standards throughout: [Sigma](https://sigmahq.io/) for detection rules, [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) for log ingestion and detection export, and [STIX](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro) and [TAXII](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/taxii/intro) for threat intelligence.

Full documentation, including guides, CLI reference, and library API docs, lives at [rsigma.io](https://rsigma.io/).

* **[Built-in linter](https://rsigma.io/guide/linting-rules/):** Validates rules with 85 checks, four severity levels, suppressions, custom tag namespaces, and auto-fix for 14 safe rules
* **[ADS metadata](https://rsigma.io/guide/detection-strategy/):** Documents rules with [Palantir ADS](https://github.com/palantir/alerting-detection-strategy-framework) sections under `rsigma.ads.*`, enforced by the linter and scaffolded with `rule doc`
* **LSP server:** Provides real-time diagnostics, completions, hover documentation, document symbols, and quick-fix code actions in [VSCode](https://rsigma.io/editors/vscode/), [Neovim](https://rsigma.io/editors/neovim/), and any LSP-capable editor
* **[MCP server](https://rsigma.io/guide/mcp-server/):** Exposes the toolchain to AI agents (Cursor, Claude Code, ...) as structured MCP tools over stdio or Streamable HTTP with `rsigma mcp serve`

### Test

* **[Detection diagnostics](https://rsigma.io/cli/engine/explain/):** Explains why a rule did or did not match an event with `engine explain`, diffs pipeline transformations with `pipeline diff`, and introspects live correlation windows
* **[Corpus backtesting](https://rsigma.io/cli/rule/backtest/):** Replays an event corpus against declared per-rule expectations with `rule backtest`, emitting a JSON or JUnit XML report for CI
* **[Output formats](https://rsigma.io/reference/output/):** Structured commands render JSON, NDJSON, table, CSV, or TSV with a TTY-aware default via a global `--output-format` flag; artifact and protocol commands keep their fixed wire format (see the per-command contract)

### Deploy

* **[CI integration](https://rsigma.io/guide/ci-cd/):** Gates a rule repository in one pull-request check with the [`timescale/rsigma-action`](https://github.com/timescale/rsigma-action) GitHub Action, wrapping lint, validate, fields-drift diff, backtest, and coverage
* **[Configuration](https://rsigma.io/reference/configuration/):** Layers settings from YAML config files, environment variables, and CLI flags, managed with the `rsigma config` command group
* **[Signed artifacts](https://rsigma.io/deployment/docker/):** Ships multi-arch Docker images with cosign signatures, SBOM, and SLSA Build L3 provenance, plus prebuilt binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows

### Detect

* **[Rule evaluation](https://rsigma.io/guide/evaluating-rules/):** Compiles rules into optimized matchers and evaluates them against events in real time, with stateless detection and stateful correlation (sliding/tumbling/session windows, group-by, chaining, suppression)
* **[Streaming daemon](https://rsigma.io/guide/streaming-detection/):** Runs as a long-lived detection daemon with hot-reload, Prometheus metrics, stdin/HTTP/NATS/OTLP/Unix-socket input, and async sinks (stdout, file, NATS, OTLP, webhook, Unix socket) with per-sink retry, DLQ, and a per-sink wire format (native NDJSON or [OCSF Detection Finding](https://rsigma.io/guide/ocsf-findings/) JSON)
* **[Input formats](https://rsigma.io/guide/input-formats/):** Ingests JSON, syslog (RFC 3164/5424), logfmt, CEF, EVTX (Windows Event Log), plain text, and OTLP logs with format auto-detection
* **[Processing pipelines](https://rsigma.io/guide/processing-pipelines/):** Maps fields and transforms rules with pySigma-compatible pipelines (transformations, conditions, finalizers)
* **[Dynamic pipelines](https://rsigma.io/reference/dynamic-sources/):** Populates any pipeline value from external sources (HTTP, files, commands, NATS) with template expansion, auto-refresh, and extraction via jq, JSONPath, or CEL
* **[Schema recognition](https://rsigma.io/cli/engine/classify/):** Recognizes which schema each event uses (ECS, Sysmon, CEF, OCSF, or user-defined) with `engine classify`, watches a live daemon for unrecognized sources, and mines candidate signatures with `engine discover-schemas`
* **[Schema routing](https://rsigma.io/guide/schema-routing/):** Builds one engine per pipeline set and dispatches each classified event to its engine, feeding a shared correlation store
* **[Logsource routing](https://rsigma.io/guide/logsource-routing/):** Skips rules whose logsource conflicts with an event's declared `product`/`service`/`category`, so a mixed-product stream only pays for the rules that can match
* **[Eval prefilters](https://rsigma.io/guide/performance-tuning/):** Prunes large rule sets before evaluation with a bloom substring prefilter and a cross-rule Aho-Corasick index
* **[NATS JetStream](https://rsigma.io/guide/nats-streaming/):** Consumes and publishes over JetStream with authentication (credentials, mTLS), replay, consumer groups, and dead-letter queues
* **[OTLP integration](https://rsigma.io/guide/otlp-integration/):** Receives logs from any OpenTelemetry-compatible agent (Grafana Alloy, Vector, Fluent Bit, OTel Collector) via HTTP or gRPC, and exports detections to an OTLP collector
* **[TLS termination](https://rsigma.io/reference/security/):** Terminates TLS in-process on the daemon API listener with optional mutual TLS and cross-platform certificate hot-reload
* **[State persistence](https://rsigma.io/guide/streaming-detection/):** Persists correlation, alert-pipeline, risk, and disposition state to SQLite with `--state-db` and restores it across restarts. The capture ring is not persisted.
* **Live operations:** Inspects a running daemon with [`engine status`](https://rsigma.io/cli/engine/status/), records replayable fixtures with [`engine tap`](https://rsigma.io/cli/engine/tap/), and streams live detections with [`engine tail`](https://rsigma.io/cli/engine/tail/)

### Alert & Triage

* **[Enrichment](https://rsigma.io/guide/enrichers/):** Injects context (asset info, IP reputation, identity, GeoIP, runbook URLs, ...) into detection and correlation results via `template`, `lookup`, `http`, and `command` primitives
* **[Risk-based alerting](https://rsigma.io/guide/risk-based-alerting/):** Scores each firing per entity (user, host, source IP) and raises a single incident when an entity's accumulated risk crosses a threshold
* **[Alert pipeline](https://rsigma.io/guide/alert-pipeline/):** Silences, inhibits, and deduplicates results, then groups the survivors into incidents, modeled on Alertmanager
* **[Webhook alerts](https://rsigma.io/guide/webhooks/):** Delivers detections to Slack, Teams, Discord, PagerDuty, or any HTTP endpoint with templated payloads, HMAC request signing, per-webhook retry, rate limiting, and DLQ
* **[Triage feedback](https://rsigma.io/guide/triage-feedback/):** Ingests analyst dispositions into a per-rule false-positive ratio that feeds the detection scorecard
* **[Verdict-driven corpora](https://rsigma.io/guide/verdict-to-corpus/):** Retains admitted `group_by` detection events and writes TP/FP bundles after an accepted disposition for `rule backtest` and `rule tune --from-dispositions`

### Measure

* **[ATT&CK coverage](https://rsigma.io/guide/attack-coverage/):** Exports an ATT&CK Navigator layer with `rule coverage` and reports gaps against Atomic Red Team, the SigmaHQ baseline, and a target technique list
* **[Telemetry visibility](https://rsigma.io/guide/visibility-and-data-sources/):** Scores data-source maturity with `rule visibility`, exporting [DeTT&CT](https://github.com/rabobank-cdc/DeTTECT) administration files and a Navigator layer that surfaces blind spots
* **[Field observability](https://rsigma.io/guide/observability/):** Surfaces which event fields no rule references and which rule fields never appear in events, live on the daemon or as a one-shot report from `engine eval`
* **[Detection scorecard](https://rsigma.io/guide/detection-scorecard/):** Fuses backtest, coverage, production-volume, and triage signals with `rule scorecard` into per-rule keep/tune/retire verdicts
* **[Rule hygiene](https://rsigma.io/guide/rule-hygiene/):** Flags retirement candidates with `rule hygiene`: silent, noisy, untagged, unowned, incomplete ADS, broken field coverage, or stale status

### Hunt

* **[Rule conversion](https://rsigma.io/guide/rule-conversion/):** Converts rules into backend-native queries via a pluggable backend trait, with native PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB, LynxDB, and Fibratus backends plus sigma-cli delegation for 30+ pySigma backends (Splunk, Elasticsearch, Microsoft Sentinel, ...)
* **[Hunt execution](https://rsigma.io/guide/hunting/):** Runs converted detection rules read-only against a PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB archive with `hunt run` and streams matching rows back as exemplar-shaped NDJSON that `rule draft`, `rule tune`, `rule test`, and `rule backtest` consume directly
* **[Field catalog](https://rsigma.io/cli/rule/fields/):** Lists every field a ruleset references, before or after pipeline mapping, with `rule fields`

## Quick Start

```bash
# Evaluate a single event against Sigma rules
rsigma engine eval -r rules/ -e '{"CommandLine": "cmd /c whoami"}'

# Stream NDJSON from stdin (auto-selected when stdout is piped)
cat events.ndjson | rsigma engine eval -r rules/

# Interactive triage in a terminal: width-aligned table view
rsigma engine eval -r rules/ -e @events.ndjson --output-format table

# Recognize which schema each event is (ECS, Sysmon, CEF, OCSF, ...)
cat events.ndjson | rsigma engine classify --output-format table

# Pipe a CSV view into a spreadsheet or data tool
rsigma engine eval -r rules/ -e @events.ndjson --output-format csv > matches.csv

# Run as a daemon with hot-reload and Prometheus metrics
rsigma engine daemon -r rules/ -p ecs.yml --api-addr 0.0.0.0:9090

# Accept events via HTTP POST
rsigma engine daemon -r rules/ --input http

# Check a running daemon's status (rules loaded, events processed, uptime)
rsigma engine status

# Record 30s of a running daemon's live events to a replayable fixture
# (opt-in: start the daemon with --enable-tap)
rsigma engine tap --duration 30s --redact-fields user.email,src_ip -o fixture.ndjson

# Stream a running daemon's live detections to the terminal
# (opt-in: start the daemon with --enable-tail)
rsigma engine tail --level high

# Convert rules to PostgreSQL SQL for historical threat hunting
rsigma backend convert rules/ -t postgres

# Any non-native target delegates to sigma-cli when it is installed (pipx install sigma-cli)
rsigma backend convert rules/ -t splunk

# Draft a detection rule from exemplar events, contrasted against a baseline corpus
rsigma rule draft -e @incident.ndjson --baseline @normal-day.ndjson

# Draft a temporal correlation from grouped, timed exemplars
rsigma rule draft --groups @observed.ndjson --negative @benign.ndjson

# Backtest a corpus against per-rule expectations (CI fixture harness)
rsigma rule backtest -r rules/ --corpus ci/corpus/ --expectations ci/expectations.yml

# Map coverage onto MITRE ATT&CK: export a Navigator layer and gate on a target list
rsigma rule coverage -r rules/ --navigator coverage.json --targets threat-model.txt --fail-on-gaps
```

See the [Quick Start guide](https://rsigma.io/getting-started/quick-start/) for a guided tour and the [CLI README](crates/rsigma-cli/) for complete documentation of all subcommands and flags.

### MCP Server (AI agents)

Expose the toolchain to MCP-aware agents (Cursor, Claude Code, ...) over stdio:

```bash
# Run the MCP server (register it in your agent's mcp.json / via `claude mcp add`)
rsigma mcp serve --rules-dir rules/
```

The agent then calls structured tools (`parse_rule`, `lint_rules`, `validate_rules`, `evaluate_events`, `convert_rules`, `list_fields`, ...) and gets back JSON. Point `--daemon-url` at a running daemon to add the Operate-cycle tools. See the [MCP server guide](https://rsigma.io/guide/mcp-server/).

To teach an agent the current CLI and that loop, install the skill (Sigma YAML authoring is a separate skill):

```bash
npx skills add timescale/sigma-rules -g -y
npx skills add timescale/rsigma -g -y
```

### Library Usage

Use the crates directly from Rust:

```rust
use rsigma_parser::parse_sigma_yaml;
use rsigma_eval::Engine;
use rsigma_eval::event::JsonEvent;
use serde_json::json;

let yaml = r#"
title: Detect Whoami
logsource:
    product: windows
    category: process_creation
detection:
    selection:
        CommandLine|contains: 'whoami'
    condition: selection
level: medium
"#;

let collection = parse_sigma_yaml(yaml).unwrap();
let mut engine = Engine::new();
engine.add_collection(&collection).unwrap();

let event = JsonEvent::borrow(&json!({"CommandLine": "cmd /c whoami"}));
let matches = engine.evaluate(&event);
assert_eq!(matches[0].rule_title, "Detect Whoami");
```

## Architecture

![rsigma streaming detection architecture](assets/architecture.svg)

A Sigma rule is parsed into a strongly-typed AST (`rsigma-parser`), lowered into a shared intermediate representation (`rsigma-ir`), then compiled and evaluated against live events (`rsigma-eval` inside `rsigma-runtime`), converted into backend-native queries (`rsigma-convert`), or served to editors and AI agents (`rsigma-lsp`, `rsigma-mcp`). The evaluation library also powers exemplar-driven rule drafting and verified filter tuning through the CLI and MCP. The full walkthrough, covering every module and all four execution shapes, lives in the [Architecture reference](https://rsigma.io/reference/architecture/).

![rsigma internal architecture](assets/internal_architecture.svg)

## Performance

RSigma is designed for high-throughput detection. On an Apple M4 Pro:

- **Parsing**: 12.4 MiB/s for 1000 rules
- **Detection**: 1.12M events/sec (JSON runtime pipeline, 100 rules)
- **Correlation**: 501K events/sec (temporal + event-count)
- **Dynamic pipelines**: 2.85M events/sec once built (no per-event overhead)

See [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md) for full Criterion results across all subsystems.
