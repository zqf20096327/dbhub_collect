# Tiger Agents for Work

Tiger Agent is a production-ready library and CLI for building Slack-native agents for serious work.
Tiger Agents can handle concurrent conversations with enterprise-grade reliability and (optionally) zero-code setup.

## Features

- **Durable & Atomic Event Handling**: PostgreSQL-backed event claiming ensures exactly-once processing with no duplicates, even under high concurrency and failure conditions
- **Bounded Concurrency**: Fixed worker pools prevent resource exhaustion while maintaining predictable performance under load
- **Immediate Event Processing**: Events are processed within milliseconds of arrival rather than waiting for polling cycles, providing real-time responsiveness
- **Resilient Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with visibility thresholds and cleanup of stuck or expired events
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Multiple instances can run simultaneously with coordinated work distribution across all instances
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Pydantic-AI Agents using the model of your choice with (optional) MCP server integrations
- **Extensible Architecture**: No coding required for basic bots and easy customization via Python for more specialized use cases
- **Complete Observability**: Full Logfire instrumentation provides detailed tracing of event flow, worker activity, and database operations

How does Tiger Agent provide all of these features? Read the [docs](/docs/README.md).

## Developer Quick Start

### 0. Prerequisites

1. [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
2. [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
3. An ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

### 1. Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/timescale/tiger-agents-for-work
cd tiger-agent

# install the dependencies
uv sync

# verify the installation
uv run tiger_agent --help
```

### 2. Run a TimescaleDB database in a docker container.

```bash
# pull the latest image
docker pull timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg17

# run the database container
docker run -d --name tiger-agent \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=tsdb \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=tsdbadmin \
  -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432 \
  timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg17
```

### 3. Create a Slack App

Tiger Agent use the Slack Events API with Socket Mode to receive `app_mention` events when your Slack users mention the bot.
You must create a Slack App for your Tiger Agent.

1. Edit the [slack-manifest.json](/slack-manifest.json) file to have the names and descriptions you want to use.
2. [Create a new Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1)
3. Choose to create an app **from a manifest**.
4. Pick your workspace and click `Next`.
5. Paste that manifest configuration in the input field provided and click `Next`.
6. Review and verify that the configuration you entered matches the summary and click `Create`.
7. Navigate to: App Home → Show Tabs → Messages Tab
8. Enable the Messages tab setting as well as checkbox to "Allow users to send Slash commands and messages from the messages tab"
9. Navigate to: Basic Information → App-Level Tokens
10. Click 'Generate Token and Scopes' → Add 'connections:write' scope → Generate
11. Save your `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` (It starts with `xapp-`).
12. Navigate to: Install App → Click 'Install to [Workspace]'
13. After installation, save the 'Bot User OAuth Token' A.K.A. `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` (It starts with `xoxb-`)

### 4. Set your environment variables

Copy the sample .env file.

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```
Edit the .env file.

1. Add your `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`. It starts with `xapp-`.
2. Add your `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`. It starts with `xoxb-`.
3. Add your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. It starts with `sk-ant-`.
4. [OPTIONAL] Add your `LOGFIRE_TOKEN`. It starts with `pylf_`.

### 5. Run the Tiger Agent

Run the Tiger Agent.

```bash
uv run tiger_agent run
```

Now, Tiger Agent will be receiving `app_mention` events from your Slack workspace!
Send a Slack message mentioning your bot by name.

### 6. Next Steps

At this point, your Tiger Agent is using our default prompts and has no tools at its disposal.
It can only respond using the knowledge that was trained into the LLM, and it only "sees" the one Slack message that mentioned it.
To make your Tiger Agent powerful, you'll need to customize it.

For light customization, you can use [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) templates to customize the system and user prompts.
You can give your Tiger Agent custom superpowers by configuring one or more MCP servers. See the [CLI docs](/docs/cli.md) for more information.

Tiger Agent supports overriding prompts and/or supplementing prompts by supplying a path to a directory containing prompts with the `--prompts` CLI argument. If you wish to override the default prompt, provide a `system_prompt.md` or `user_prompt.md` markdown file. However, if you want to supplement the default prompts, supply markdown files matching one of these regex patterns:

* `^(system_prompt|shared_system_prompt).*\.md$` — main agent's system prompt
* `^user_prompt.*\.md$` — main agent's user prompt
* `^(investigator_system_prompt|shared_system_prompt).*\.md$` — investigator sub-agent's system prompt

Prompts matching a pattern are stitched together as a sequence, sorted shortest filename first then alphabetically. Files named `shared_system_prompt.<tag>.md` are loaded by both the main agent and the investigator sub-agent — use this pattern for cross-agent guidance. See [Prompt Templates](/docs/prompt_templates.md) for details.

For heavy customization, you can subclass the TigerAgent class or implement a TaskProcessor from scratch. This strategy, also, supports overriding and/or supplementing the base prompts. Consider this example:

```python
class MyCoolAgent(TigerAgent):
    # override TigerAgent.make_system_prompt
   async def make_system_prompt(
        self, ctx: AgentResponseContext
    ) -> str | Sequence[str]:

        # if you want to supplment the base system prompt, grab it
        # and add it to a sequence of prompt strings
        base_system_prompt = await super().make_system_prompt(ctx)
        system_prompt = (
            [base_system_prompt]
            if not isinstance(base_system_prompt, Sequence)
            else base_system_prompt
        )

        # then add what you want
        system_prompt.append("Always respond like a playful pirate. Draw your inspiration from Pirates of the Carribean.")

        return system_prompt
```

#### Using Tiger Agent as a Library

You can embed Tiger Agent directly in your own application instead of using the CLI. There are two approaches depending on how much control you need.

##### Option 1: TigerApp (simple)

`TigerApp` is the easiest way to get started. It wires everything together — Slack listener, Salesforce listener (if configured), and the task worker pool — and exposes a single `run()` method.

```python
import asyncio
from tiger_agent import TigerApp

async def main():
    # Zero config — reads SLACK_BOT_TOKEN and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from environment
    app = await TigerApp.create()
    await app.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Pass a custom `TigerAgent` subclass to override prompts or add custom logic:

```python
import asyncio
from tiger_agent import TigerApp, TigerAgent

class MyCoolAgent(TigerAgent):
    async def make_system_prompt(self, ctx):
        base = await super().make_system_prompt(ctx)
        return [base, "Always respond like a playful pirate."]

async def main():
    app = await TigerApp.create(
        agent=MyCoolAgent(model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929")
    )
    await app.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Worker configuration is passed directly to `TigerApp.create()`:

```python
async def main():
    app = await TigerApp.create(
        num_workers=10,
        max_attempts=5,
        worker_sleep_seconds=30,
    )
    await app.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

##### Option 2: TigerAgent + Harnesses (advanced)

For full control — custom `HarnessContext`, integrating with an existing event loop, or wiring up your own `TaskProcessor` function — use the lower-level building blocks directly:

* **`HarnessContext.create()`** — builds the shared `HarnessContext` (Slack app, database pool, trigger queue, worker config, and optional Salesforce client)
* **`ListenerHarness`** — receives external events (Slack mentions, Salesforce cases) and enqueues them as tasks
* **`TaskHarness`** — drives the worker pool that processes queued tasks

```python
import asyncio
from tiger_agent import HarnessContext, TaskHarness, TigerAgent
from tiger_agent.listeners.harness import ListenerHarness

async def main():
    # Worker config lives on HarnessContext
    hctx = await HarnessContext.create(num_workers=5)
    agent = TigerAgent(model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929")

    listener_harness = ListenerHarness(hctx=hctx, task_processor=agent)
    task_harness = TaskHarness(agent, hctx=hctx)

    await hctx.pool.open(wait=True)
    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tasks:
        await task_harness.run(tasks)
        await listener_harness.start(tasks)

asyncio.run(main())
```

You can also pass a plain `async` function as your `TaskProcessor` instead of a `TigerAgent`:

```python
import asyncio
from tiger_agent import HarnessContext, Task, TaskHarness
from tiger_agent.listeners.harness import ListenerHarness

async def my_handler(hctx: HarnessContext, task: Task):
    channel = task.event["channel"]
    ts = task.event["ts"]
    await hctx.app.client.chat_postMessage(
        channel=channel, thread_ts=ts, text="Hello from my custom handler!"
    )

async def main():
    hctx = await HarnessContext.create(num_workers=2)
    listener_harness = ListenerHarness(hctx=hctx, task_processor=my_handler)
    task_harness = TaskHarness(my_handler, hctx=hctx)

    await hctx.pool.open(wait=True)
    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tasks:
        await task_harness.run(tasks)
        await listener_harness.start(tasks)

asyncio.run(main())
```
