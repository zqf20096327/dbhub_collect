# Tiger CLI

Tiger CLI is the command-line interface for Tiger Cloud. It provides commands for managing and querying database services, as well as an integrated Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for use with AI assistants.

## Installation

Multiple installation methods are provided. Choose your preferred method from the options below. If you aren't sure, use the first one!

### Install Script (macOS/Linux/WSL)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.tigerdata.com | sh
```

### Install Script (Windows)

```powershell
irm https://cli.tigerdata.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew install --cask timescale/tap/tiger-cli
```

### Debian/Ubuntu

```bash
# Add repository
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/timescale/tiger-cli/script.deb.sh | sudo os=any dist=any bash

# Install tiger-cli
sudo apt-get install tiger-cli
```

For manual repository installation instructions, see [here](https://packagecloud.io/timescale/tiger-cli/install#manual-deb).

### Red Hat/Fedora

```bash
# Add repository
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/timescale/tiger-cli/script.rpm.sh | sudo os=rpm_any dist=rpm_any bash

# Install tiger-cli
sudo yum install tiger-cli
```

For manual repository installation instructions, see [here](https://packagecloud.io/timescale/tiger-cli/install#manual-rpm).

### Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/timescale/tiger-cli/cmd/tiger@latest
```

## Updating

To upgrade an existing installation to the latest release:

```bash
tiger upgrade
```

This downloads the latest published binary, verifies its checksum, and replaces the currently running binary in place. If Tiger CLI was installed via a package manager (Homebrew, apt, yum/dnf), `tiger upgrade` will instead point you at the matching package-manager command.

## Quick Start

After installing Tiger CLI, authenticate with your Tiger Cloud account:

```bash
# Login to your Tiger account
tiger auth login

# View available commands
tiger --help

# List your database services
tiger service list

# Create a new database service
tiger service create --name my-database

# Get connection string
tiger db uri

# Connect to your database
tiger db psql

# Run a query without psql
tiger db query -c "SELECT now()"

# Install the MCP server
tiger mcp install
```

## Usage

Tiger CLI provides the following commands:

- `tiger auth` - Authentication management
  - `login` - Log in to your Tiger account (use `--headless` to authorize with a short code in a browser on any machine)
  - `logout` - Log out from your Tiger account
  - `status` - Show current authentication status and project ID (alias: `whoami`)
- `tiger project` - Project management
  - `list` - List all projects you have access to, marking the active one (alias: `ls`)
  - `use` - Switch the active project (requires an OAuth login; clears the default `service_id`, since it belonged to the previous project) (alias: `switch`)
- `tiger service` - Service lifecycle management (aliases: `services`, `svc`)
  - `list` - List all services (alias: `ls`)
  - `create` - Create a new service
  - `get` - Show detailed service information (aliases: `describe`, `show`)

  - `stop` - Stop a running service (alias: `pause`)
  - `rename` - Rename a service
  - `resize` - Resize service CPU and memory allocation
  - `delete` - Delete a service (alias: `rm`)
  - `update-password` - Update service master password
  - `logs` - View service logs (alias: `log`)
- `tiger db` - Database operations
  - `psql` - Connect to a database with psql (in an interactive terminal, if the service has read replicas, offers to connect to one of them; use `--no-replica-prompt` to skip) (alias: `connect`)
  - `query` - Execute a SQL query against a database and display the results, without needing psql (alias: `sql`)
  - `uri` - Get connection URI for a service (alias: `connection-string`)
  - `ping` - Test database connectivity (aliases: `test`, `test-connection`)
  - `schema` - Display database schema information (tables, views, indexes, functions, TimescaleDB hypertables, and more)
  - `save-password` - Save a database password to configured password storage (keyring, pgpass, or none)
  - `create role` - Create a new database role, with optional read-only enforcement, inherited grants (`--from`), and statement timeout (alias: `create user`)
- `tiger config` - Configuration management (alias: `cfg`)
  - `list` - List current configuration (aliases: `ls`, `show`)
  - `set` - Set configuration value
  - `unset` - Remove configuration value (aliases: `rm`, `delete`)
  - `reset` - Reset configuration to defaults (alias: `clear`)
- `tiger mcp` - MCP server setup and management
  - `install` - Install and configure MCP server for an AI assistant (alias: `add`)
  - `start` - Start the MCP server
  - `list` - List available MCP tools, prompts, and resources (alias: `ls`)
  - `get` - Get detailed information about a specific MCP capability (aliases: `describe`, `show`)
- `tiger feedback` - Submit feedback or a bug report to the Tiger Data team (pass the message as an argument or on stdin)
- `tiger version` - Show version information
- `tiger upgrade` - Upgrade the Tiger CLI to the latest version (alias: `update`)

Use `tiger <command> --help` for detailed information about each command, or browse the generated [CLI reference](docs/cli/tiger.md).

## MCP Server

Tiger CLI includes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants like Claude Code to interact with your Tiger Cloud infrastructure. The MCP server provides programmatic access to database services and operations.

### Installation

Configure the MCP server for your AI assistant:

```bash
# Interactive installation (prompts for client selection)
tiger mcp install

# Or specify your client directly
tiger mcp install claude-code      # Claude Code
tiger mcp install codex            # Codex
tiger mcp install copilot          # GitHub Copilot CLI
tiger mcp install cursor           # Cursor IDE
tiger mcp install devin            # Devin
tiger mcp install gemini           # Gemini CLI
tiger mcp install vscode           # VS Code
```

After installation, restart your AI assistant to activate the Tiger MCP server.

#### Manual Installation

If your MCP client is not supported by `tiger mcp install`, follow the client's
instructions for installing MCP servers. Use `tiger mcp start` as the command to
start the MCP server. For example, many clients use a JSON file like the
following:


```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tiger": {
      "command": "tiger",
      "args": [
        "mcp",
        "start"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Streamable HTTP Protocol

The above instructions install the MCP server using the stdio transport. If you
need to use the Streamable HTTP transport instead, you can start the server with
`tiger mcp start http --port 8080` and install it into your client using
`http://localhost:8080` as the URL.

### Available MCP Tools

The MCP server exposes the following tools to AI assistants:

**Service Management:**
- `service_list` - List all database services in your project
- `service_get` - Get detailed information about a specific service
- `service_create` - Create new database services with configurable resources
- `service_fork` - Fork an existing database service to create an independent copy
- `service_start` - Start a stopped database service
- `service_stop` - Stop a running database service
- `service_rename` - Rename a database service
- `service_resize` - Resize a database service by changing CPU and memory allocation
- `service_delete` - Permanently delete a database service; deleting a service tagged PROD first asks the user to confirm through the MCP client (elicitation), and is refused if the client cannot prompt
- `service_update_password` - Update the master password for a service
- `service_logs` - View logs for a database service

**Database Operations:**
- `db_query` - Execute SQL queries against a database service, passed inline or as a path to a SQL file, with support for parameterized queries, custom timeouts, and connection pooling
- `db_schema` - Display a service's database schema (tables, views, materialized views, enums, functions, procedures, indexes, triggers, and TimescaleDB hypertable/continuous aggregate metadata) as readable text for an agent's context

**Feedback:**
- `feedback` - Submit feedback or a bug report to the Tiger Data team

The MCP server automatically uses your CLI authentication and configuration, so no additional setup is required beyond `tiger auth login`.

#### Proxied Tools

In addition to the service management tools listed above, the Tiger MCP server also proxies tools from a remote documentation MCP server. This feature provides AI assistants with semantic search capabilities for PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, and Tiger Cloud documentation, as well as prompts/guides for various Tiger Cloud features.

The proxied documentation server ([pg-aiguide](https://github.com/timescale/pg-aiguide)) currently provides the following tools:
- `view_skill` - Retrieve comprehensive guides for Postgres and TimescaleDB features and best practices
- `search_docs` - Search PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB documentation using natural language queries

This proxy connection is enabled by default and requires no additional configuration.

To disable the documentation proxy:

```bash
tiger config set docs_mcp false
```

## Configuration

The CLI stores configuration in `~/.config/tiger/config.yaml` by default, and supports hierarchical configuration through environment variables and command-line flags.

```bash
# List current configuration
tiger config list

# Set configuration values
tiger config set output json

# Remove configuration value
tiger config unset output

# Reset to defaults
tiger config reset
```

### Configuration Options

All configuration options can be set via `tiger config set <key> <value>`:

- `analytics` - Enable/disable analytics (default: `true`)
- `color` - Enable/disable colored output (default: `true`)
- `docs_mcp` - Enable/disable docs MCP proxy (default: `true`)
- `mcp_max_rows` - Maximum number of rows the `db_query` MCP tool returns per result set before truncating, to limit how much data lands in an AI agent's context. Only applies to the MCP tool, not CLI commands. Default: `100`
- `output` - Output format: `json`, `yaml`, or `table` (default: `table`)
- `password_storage` - Password storage method: `keyring`, `pgpass`, or `none` (default: `keyring`)
- `read_only` - Which services this CLI may change: `all`, `prod`, or `off` (default: `off`, which protects nothing). An interactive `tiger auth login` offers a menu of the three modes, and records your choice either way, so it only asks until you answer once. `true` and `on` are accepted as aliases for `all`, and `false` for `off`, so existing config files and `TIGER_READ_ONLY=true` behave as before.

  Changing a protected service is refused, and so is creating one: `tiger service create`/`fork`/`start`/`stop`/`rename`/`resize`/`update-password`/`delete` and `tiger db create role` return an error. Connection strings for it open the session in Tiger Cloud's immutable read-only mode, so the server rejects writes and DDL — that covers `tiger db psql`, `tiger db query`, `tiger db uri`, the `db_query` MCP tool, and the connection strings embedded in `tiger service` output and the equivalent MCP tools.

  - `all` protects every service, and the MCP write tools aren't registered at all, so they don't appear in `tools/list` and can't be called.
  - `prod` protects only services tagged `PROD`, leaving `DEV` services writable. `tiger service create`/`fork` and the `service_create`/`service_fork` MCP tools are gated on the environment they request, so creating a `DEV` service is allowed and a `PROD` one is not — otherwise you could create a service this same mode then refuses to delete. Forking a `PROD` service into a `DEV` fork is allowed, since that reads production without changing it. The MCP write tools stay registered — they still work on `DEV` services — and refuse per call instead. Reading a service's tag costs one extra API call for `tiger service start`/`stop`/`rename`/`resize`/`delete`, and the operation is refused if that lookup fails. A read replica is judged on its own tag, so a replica of a `PROD` primary is protected only if that replica set is itself tagged `PROD`.

- `service_id` - Default service ID. Cleared automatically when the active project changes: by `tiger project`, and by `tiger auth login` unless it lands on the same project as the previous login. A service belongs to the project it was created in
- `version_check` - When `true`, the CLI checks for a newer version on each invocation (in an interactive terminal) and prints a notice if one is available. Set to `false` to disable. Default: `true`.

### Environment Variables

Environment variables override configuration file values. All variables use the `TIGER_` prefix:

- `TIGER_ANALYTICS` - Enable/disable analytics
- `TIGER_COLOR` - Enable/disable colored output
- `TIGER_CONFIG_DIR` - Path to configuration directory (default: `~/.config/tiger`)
- `TIGER_DOCS_MCP` - Enable/disable docs MCP proxy
- `TIGER_OUTPUT` - Output format: `json`, `yaml`, or `table`
- `TIGER_PASSWORD_STORAGE` - Password storage method: `keyring`, `pgpass`, or `none`
- `TIGER_READ_ONLY` - Which services this CLI may change: `all`, `prod`, or `off` (same aliases as `read_only`)
- `TIGER_PUBLIC_KEY` - Public key to use for authentication (takes priority over stored credentials)
- `TIGER_SECRET_KEY` - Secret key to use for authentication (takes priority over stored credentials)
- `TIGER_SERVICE_ID` - Default service ID
- `TIGER_VERSION_CHECK` - When `true`, the CLI checks for a newer version on each invocation (in an interactive terminal) and prints a notice if one is available; `false` to disable

### Global Flags

These flags are available on all commands and take precedence over both environment variables and configuration file values:

- `--analytics` - Enable/disable analytics
- `--color` - Enable/disable colored output
- `--config-dir <path>` - Path to configuration directory (default: `~/.config/tiger`)
- `--password-storage <method>` - Password storage method: `keyring`, `pgpass`, or `none`
- `--service-id <id>` - Specify service ID
- `--version-check` - Enable/disable checking for updates on startup
- `-h, --help` - Show help information
