Long-term memory extension for the [pi coding agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent):
**allow-listed ACP compression blocks → SQLite FTS5 → `memory_search`**.

ACP plugins compress long conversations into summaries. This extension collects
those compression summaries from **allow-listed source locations** into one
searchable store and registers a `memory_search` tool the model can call at any
time. The compatibility target is compression blocks / compression sidecars;
the recommended upstream for pi is
[billion-context-pi](#relationship-to-billion-context-pi).

## Relationship to billion-context-pi

This project is **independent and community-maintained**. It is **not
affiliated with, endorsed by, or a fork of**
[billion-context-pi](https://github.com/ranxianglei/billion-context-pi).

- billion-context-pi is the **recommended optional upstream for pi**. It
  produces the `<session>.jsonl.acp.json` compression sidecars that this
  extension indexes. Install it separately if you want pi-side compression
  memory:
  ```bash
  pi install npm:billion-context-pi
  ```
- This extension reads those sidecars **read-only**. It does not import,
  bundle, call, or modify billion-context-pi, and it has no code dependency on
  it.
- billion-context-pi is optional. Without it, pi sessions have no sidecars to
  index; the extension can still index opencode-acp state files and
  billion-context proxy session files if configured.
- This extension **does not hook pi's `context` event**. It only registers the
  `memory_search` tool and the `/memory` command, so it is safe to run
  alongside billion-context-pi. It does not participate in context-compression
  ordering or clobber compressed output.
- The sidecar format is an implementation detail of billion-context-pi and may
  change. This extension is tested against the sidecar format produced by
  billion-context-pi `0.1.65`; a format change may require an adapter update.
- billion-context-pi is MIT-licensed. Its name and logo belong to its authors.
  This project's MIT license covers only this project's code.

## Features

- **Allow-list first**: scanning is restricted to the roots/patterns in the
  allow-list file. There is no global discovery across every session or
  message file, so scanning stays bounded even with many sessions.
- **Compression blocks only**: the pi adapter reads
  `<session>.jsonl.acp.json`, the opencode adapter reads `ses_*.json` state
  files, and the bili adapter reads billion-context proxy sessions
  (`<host>_<hash>.json`). Raw conversation messages are never parsed during
  ingestion.
- **Incremental and durable**: per-source `mtime + size` watermarks live in a
  durable ledger; `UNIQUE(source_file, block_id)` + `INSERT OR IGNORE` dedupes
  blocks. `prune()` writes tombstones so a later rescan cannot resurrect
  pruned blocks.
- **Chinese-friendly search**: FTS5 `trigram` for queries of 3+ characters;
  AND-ed `LIKE` against `summary OR topic` for shorter queries; a mixed mode
  combines both. No LLM translation or keyword generation.
- **Lazy project resolution**: the pi session header is read only when a source
  file actually needs (re)ingestion, and only its first line is read. An
  unchanged store costs no header reads.
- **Optional block expansion**: with `expandEnabled`, `memory_expand` resolves a
  block's recorded message pointers back to the original session messages on
  demand. It is two-step (manifest first, then an explicit selection), bounded,
  filtered like ingestion, and never written to the store.
- **No context hook**: the extension never participates in pi's `context`
  event; it only indexes and searches compression summaries.

## Requirements

- **Node.js >= 22.19.0** (built-in `node:sqlite`; Node 24 is recommended and
  tested). `node:sqlite` is still marked experimental in Node, so Node may
  print an `ExperimentalWarning` at startup; this is expected and safe to
  ignore for this extension.
- **pi coding agent >= 0.85.1** (tested with 0.85.1; the extension uses only
  public extension APIs).
- At least one enabled compression source:
  - [billion-context-pi](https://github.com/ranxianglei/billion-context-pi)
    for pi sidecars (**recommended**),
  - [opencode-acp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opencode-acp) state files, or
  - a billion-context proxy session directory (e.g. WorkBuddy/codebuddy
    sessions) with `adapter: "bili-session"`.
- No third-party runtime dependencies. The extension uses Node built-ins and the
  pi host API (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, a peer dependency). Optional
  billion-context-pi sidecars are read from disk.

## Install

The extension is distributed **through git only** — there is no npm package, so
every install path is `pi install git:...`.

### GitHub

```bash
# Latest main — simplest, but not reproducible
pi install git:https://github.com/tjp72/pi-billion-memory.git

# SSH instead of HTTPS — handy if you already have a key registered with GitHub
pi install git:git@github.com:tjp72/pi-billion-memory.git
```

Append `@<tag>` to pin a release (reproducible; tags are listed on the
[Releases](https://github.com/tjp72/pi-billion-memory/releases) page):

```bash
pi install git:git@github.com:tjp72/pi-billion-memory.git@<tag>
```

> `pi install git:...` clones the repository and runs `npm install --omit=dev`.
> It does not build the project, so the built `dist/` directory is committed to
> the repository. Do not delete `dist/` before tagging a release.

### Update

```bash
pi update --extensions   # re-reconciles git packages; pinned tags stay where they are
```

To move a tag-pinned install to a newer release, re-run the install line with the
new tag (`pi install git:https://github.com/tjp72/pi-billion-memory.git@v0.5.2`).

### Local development

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run build
pi install /absolute/path/to/pi-billion-memory
```

### Verify

```bash
pi list
```

Then in a pi session:

- `/memory` — show store stats (sources / blocks / compressed tokens).
- `/memory sources` — print the active allow-list.
- `/memory rescan` — force a full allow-list rescan.
- `/memory prune <days>` — durably delete blocks older than N days.
- Ask the model something like "what did I work on before?" so it can call
  `memory_search`.

### Uninstall

```bash
pi remove git:git@github.com:tjp72/pi-billion-memory.git
```

The local store is not removed automatically. To delete it as well:

```bash
rm -f ~/.pi/pi-billion-memory.db ~/.pi/pi-billion-memory.db-wal ~/.pi/pi-billion-memory.db-shm
rm -f ~/.pi/pi-billion-memory.log ~/.pi/pi-billion-memory.sources.jsonl ~/.pi/pi-billion-memory.json
```

Never delete pi session files (`.jsonl`, `.jsonl.acp.json`), the opencode
database, or `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` to remove this extension.

## How it works

```
pi sidecars (.jsonl.acp.json)     ┐
opencode-acp ses_*.json           ┤─ allow-list ─► scanSources() ─► ~/.pi/pi-billion-memory.db
bili sessions (<host>_<hash>.json)┘                                 (SQLite + FTS5 trigram)
                                                                        │
                                                                        ▼
                                                         memory_search tool (on demand)
```

1. `session_start` runs a background allow-list scan (configurable with
   `scanOnStartup`).
2. `agent_settled` and `session_shutdown` incrementally scan the current pi
   session.
3. Every `memory_search` performs a light allow-list scan first, then queries
   the SQLite store.
4. For an allow-listed pi sidecar, the session file's first line is read only
   when the sidecar needs (re)ingestion, to resolve the project name from
   `cwd`. Message lines are never read.
5. For opencode sources, `opencode.db` is opened read-only (or `query_only`)
   only to map session IDs to working directories. Conversation content is
   never read.
6. For bili sources, the proxy session file is read for its compression blocks
   under `payload.state.blocks`; the project name comes from the file's
   `<host>` segment. Message content is never read.

## Data and privacy

- **No network**: the extension makes no network requests and has no telemetry.
- **No raw messages at ingestion**: only compression blocks/sidecars are
  ingested. The pi session file is read for its first-line header (`cwd`, `id`,
  `timestamp`, `type`, `version`) when project resolution is needed, and — only
  when the opt-in `expandEnabled` is on and `memory_expand` is called — for the
  specific messages a stored block points at.
- **Secret and URL filter**: before a block is stored, its `topic` and
  `summary` are scanned for common credentials (passwords, API keys, tokens,
  private keys, JWTs, auth headers, cookies, and Chinese credential labels) and
  for URLs. Credential values are replaced with `[REDACTED]`, URLs with
  `[REDACTED_URL]`; a hit count is logged without the value. This is a
  best-effort safety net, not a guarantee. The filter applies to newly
  ingested/updated blocks; existing rows are not rewritten (delete
  `~/.pi/pi-billion-memory.db*` and rescan to rebuild).
- **No context hook**: the extension never hooks pi's `context` event.
- **No session writes**: the extension never writes to session files.
- **Local store**: the SQLite database, log, config, and allow-list live under
  `~/.pi/` by default. They stay on your machine.

## Configuration

`~/.pi/pi-billion-memory.json` is optional. Defaults:

```json
{
  "dbPath": "~/.pi/pi-billion-memory.db",
  "sourcesPath": "~/.pi/pi-billion-memory.sources.jsonl",
  "logPath": "~/.pi/pi-billion-memory.log",
  "maxSummaryChars": 20000,
  "debug": false,
  "excludeDirs": [],
  "scanOnStartup": true,
  "expandEnabled": false,
  "expandMaxChars": 40000,
  "expandMaxMessages": 200,
  "expandMaxReadBytes": 33554432
}
```

- `dbPath`: SQLite store path.
- `sourcesPath`: JSONL allow-list path.
- `logPath`: log file path (auto-truncated at 1 MB).
- `maxSummaryChars`: summaries longer than this are truncated on ingestion.
  Changing it does not rewrite existing rows; delete the `*.db*` files and
  restart pi to rebuild from source.
- `debug`: verbose logging.
- `excludeDirs`: directory names to skip inside pi-sidecar source roots.
- `scanOnStartup`: run a background allow-list scan at session start. If
  disabled, the current session is still force-scanned once and other sources
  are picked up by later scans.
- `expandEnabled`: register the opt-in `memory_expand` tool (default `false`).
  See "Expand a block" below.
- `expandMaxChars`: hard cap on characters returned by one `memory_expand` call
  (default 40000).
- `expandMaxMessages`: hard cap on messages rendered by one `memory_expand` call
  (default 200).
- `expandMaxReadBytes`: hard cap on bytes read from a session file by one
  `memory_expand` call (default 33554432, i.e. 32 MB). The file is opened and read
  in bounded chunks, so a larger session file is never slurped whole first.

## Allow-list sources

`~/.pi/pi-billion-memory.sources.jsonl` is optional. When it is missing, the
extension uses these two built-in defaults:

```jsonl
{"id":"pi","adapter":"pi-sidecar","root":"~/.pi/agent/sessions","pattern":"**/*.jsonl.acp.json","enabled":true}
{"id":"opencode","adapter":"opencode-acp","root":"~/.local/share/opencode/storage/plugin/acp","pattern":"ses_*.json","enabled":true,"opencodeDb":"~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db"}
```

- Each non-empty, non-comment line is one JSON object.
- `enabled: false` disables a source without deleting its line.
- `root` supports `~` for the current user's home directory.
- `pattern` supports a recursive `**/*.jsonl.acp.json` form or a flat
  `ses_*.json` form.
- `opencodeDb` is optional but recommended for opencode sources: it lets the
  adapter resolve each state file to its real working directory (project name)
  via a read-only lookup.

Example: index a billion-context proxy session directory (WorkBuddy/codebuddy):

```jsonl
{
  "id": "bili",
  "adapter": "bili-session",
  "root": "~/.local/share/billion-context/sessions",
  "pattern": "**/*.json",
  "enabled": true
}
```

- `bili-session` reads blocks under `payload.state.blocks` from each matched
  `<host>_<hash>.json` file; the project name is the `<host>` segment.

Example: scan only a pi sessions subtree plus one extra sidecar root:

```jsonl
{"id":"pi-work","adapter":"pi-sidecar","root":"~/.pi/agent/sessions","pattern":"**/*.jsonl.acp.json","enabled":true}
{"id":"pi-archive","adapter":"pi-sidecar","root":"~/archive/compressions","pattern":"**/*.jsonl.acp.json","enabled":true}
```

Run `/memory sources` to confirm, then `/memory rescan`.

## Search behavior

- `memory_search` accepts `query`, optional `project`, optional `limit`
  (default 6, max 20), and returns matching blocks with `source`, `project`,
  `topic`, `tier`, `createdAt`, `compressedTokens`, and a preview.
- Queries of **3+ characters** use the FTS5 `trigram` index, which matches
  Chinese substrings, mixed Chinese/English text, and code identifiers.
- Queries of **1–2 characters** use AND-ed `LIKE` matches against both
  `summary` and `topic`.
- **Mixed queries** (long + short tokens) use FTS for the long tokens and
  `LIKE` for the short ones, preserving AND semantics across modes.
- Pure-`LIKE` queries do not join the FTS table; they use
  `idx_blocks_created` for ordering.
- The schema is plain JSON; the extension does not require `typebox` or any
  other runtime dependency.

## Expand a block

`memory_search` returns summaries. When the exact original wording matters, an
opt-in tool resolves a block's recorded message pointers back to the session
messages it absorbed:

```json
{
  "expandEnabled": true
}
```

Set it in `~/.pi/pi-billion-memory.json`, then restart pi (or `/reload`).
`memory_expand` is only registered when this is on.

Expansion is deliberately two-step so that recovering text cannot silently
re-spend the context that compression just saved:

```text
memory_expand({ block: "b1" })
  -> manifest only: index, role, size and ref per absorbed message, no text
memory_expand({ block: "b1", mode: "full", select: [1, 2] })
  -> renders only messages 1 and 2
```

- `block` comes from a `memory_search` result. The same id can exist in several
  sessions, so add `source` (a substring of the `Source:` label, e.g. a session
  file name or project) when the lookup is ambiguous.
- `limit` and `chars` bound a single call; they are additionally clamped by
  `expandMaxMessages` and `expandMaxChars`.
- `mode: "full"` requires a non-empty `select`: it refuses to render a whole block,
  so recovering text always stays an explicit choice.
- Only pi sources (`*.jsonl.acp.json`) are expandable; opencode-acp state files
  and bili proxy sessions do not expose message references.
- A `#call_...` suffix on a reference renders only that one tool call, not the
  surrounding assistant message.
- A reference whose message is gone (deleted or truncated session file) is
  reported as missing rather than failing the call.
- Extension-injected `custom_message` context is expandable as user text. Generated
  ids (`acp_summary_*`) are labelled `synthetic`: they point at summaries, not at
  session lines, so there is nothing to recover for them.
- Expanded text passes through the same secret/URL filter as ingestion, and
  nothing is written back to the store.

Blocks ingested before 0.5.0 have no recorded pointers. Upgrading resets the
watermark ledger once, so the next scan re-reads the existing sidecars and
backfills the pointers without duplicating blocks: `INSERT OR IGNORE` still
protects the stored summary text, and tombstones still block resurrection.
Run `/memory rescan` to trigger the backfill immediately.

## Scale and prune

Summaries are distilled knowledge whose value only the model can judge, so
there is no automatic expiry. Prune manually:

```text
/memory prune 365   # delete blocks compressed more than 365 days ago
/memory prune 0     # delete every timestamped block
/memory rescan      # add new blocks; pruned blocks stay deleted
```

Prune is durable: every deleted block is tombstoned, and the watermark ledger
keeps pruned-but-unchanged sources skipped, so a rescan cannot resurrect them.
A pruned block can only return if the upstream source emits it with a new
`blockId` (or the tombstone row is removed manually).

Rough sizing: about 1 KB of body text per block; the database file runs about
5–7× the body size (SQLite + FTS index). 720 blocks is roughly 0.7 MB of body
text / 4.9 MB of database; 10k blocks is roughly 15–20 MB. No intervention is
needed until hundreds of thousands of blocks.

## Development

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run build        # tsup + tsc -> dist/
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint         # oxlint
npm test             # node --import tsx --test tests/*.test.ts
npm run check        # format check + typecheck + lint + test + build
npm run e2e          # load dist/ and verify the pi registrations
npm run verify:dist  # build and fail if committed dist/ is stale
```

Repository layout:

- `src/` — TypeScript source modules; the pi extension entry is
  `src/index.ts`.
- `dist/` — committed build output. Required by `pi install git:...`, because
  pi's git installer runs `npm install --omit=dev` and does not run a build.
- `tests/` — self-tests run with Node's test runner and `tsx`.
- `scripts/` — development helpers.
- `.github/workflows/` — CI and release automation.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `AGENTS.md` for the rules that apply to changes.

## Scope: single user, single machine

This extension is built for one person indexing their own sessions on their own
machine. That is also the only configuration it is safe in.

- **No accounts, no server, no sharing layer.** There is no login, no sync, no
  per-user permission model. The store is a local SQLite file. `project` in a
  `memory_search` call filters results; it is not access control.
- **Everyone using the same OS user shares one store.** On a shared workstation,
  a remote/cloud sandbox, or a container that runs as `root` for everyone,
  memories and their previews become searchable by every user of that account,
  and — with `expandEnabled` on — original session messages become readable.
  Use a separate OS user (and home directory) per person.
- **Never share the database file.** SQLite is opened in WAL mode with a 5 s
  busy timeout, which coordinates concurrent processes on **one host only**.
  Putting `dbPath` on NFS/SMB or any cross-host volume can corrupt the store.
- **Ephemeral homes rebuild from scratch.** In CI or a container with a
  non-persistent home, the index is rebuilt on every start; point `dbPath` (and
  the allow-list) at persistent storage if that matters.
- **Redaction is best-effort, storage is plaintext.** The secret/URL filter is
  regex-based, applies to newly ingested blocks only, and existing rows are
  never rewritten. The database is not encrypted; the store file is created
  owner-only where the OS supports it (`0600` on POSIX, ignored on Windows),
  but that is best-effort hardening rather than protection — the log file and
  the SQLite `-wal`/`-shm` files are not covered. There
  is no quota, retention policy, or audit log beyond `/memory prune`.
- **Cross-machine use**: sync the sidecar files, not the database. Each machine
  should build its own index from its own source files.

If you need shared or centrally governed memory, this extension is the wrong
tool — it is deliberately local-only.

## Known limitations

- Memory entries are ACP compression summaries, not original messages.
  Semantic (embedding) search is not implemented; trigram is literal substring
  matching. `memory_expand` recovers the originals only for pi sources and only
  for blocks that recorded message pointers.
- If a block is rewritten upstream, the already-ingested summary text is not
  updated (`INSERT OR IGNORE`); only its message pointers are refreshed.
  `/memory rescan` adds new blocks.
- Upstream compression formats are internal implementations that can change.
  The adapters are defensive (malformed/mid-write files are skipped and
  retried), but a format change may require an adapter update.
- Multi-tier blocks are intentionally not deduplicated: a tier-2/3 parent and
  its tier-1 children can both match. Parent summaries start with a
  `Source: bN+bM …` header that identifies what they aggregate.
