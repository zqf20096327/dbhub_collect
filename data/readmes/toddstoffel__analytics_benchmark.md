## Overview

This benchmark suite provides **standardized testing for Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) workloads** across multiple database engines. The framework enables fair, reproducible performance comparisons using real-world analytical queries and datasets, helping organizations make informed decisions about analytical database technologies.

### Scope and Purpose

**This benchmark specifically focuses on open-source analytical databases that can be deployed on-premises and containerized with Docker.** While we acknowledge the existence of excellent cloud-native solutions like Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, and Azure Synapse Analytics, these managed services are outside the scope of this evaluation.

**Why Open-Source, On-Premises, and Dockerizable?**
- **Data Sovereignty**: Organizations requiring complete control over their data location and governance
- **Cost Predictability**: Fixed infrastructure costs vs. variable cloud consumption pricing
- **Compliance Requirements**: Industries with strict data residency and security regulations
- **Technology Independence**: Avoiding vendor lock-in with portable, standards-based solutions
- **Customization Flexibility**: Ability to modify and tune systems for specific use cases
- **Container Portability**: Docker deployment enables consistent environments across development, testing, and production
- **Infrastructure Agnostic**: Run on any Docker-compatible platform, from laptops to enterprise clusters

This benchmark evaluates databases that can be deployed in your own infrastructure using Docker containers, whether on bare metal, virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, or private cloud environments, providing organizations with truly portable and self-managed analytical solutions.

### OLAP vs OLTP

**OLAP systems** are designed to handle complex analytical queries that typically involve:
- Large-scale aggregations across millions of records
- Complex multi-table joins and dimensional analysis  
- Time-series analysis and trend identification
- Ad-hoc analytical queries with varying selectivity

Unlike **OLTP** (Online Transaction Processing) systems optimized for high-volume transactional workloads, OLAP databases excel at read-heavy analytical operations, making them essential for business intelligence, data analytics, and decision support systems.

## Why OLAP Benchmarking Matters

### Performance Evaluation
Modern organizations generate massive volumes of data requiring fast analytical processing. Benchmarking helps identify which database engines can handle your specific analytical workloads with acceptable performance characteristics.

### Technology Selection
With numerous analytical database options available, from traditional columnar stores to modern cloud-native solutions, standardized benchmarking provides objective performance metrics to guide technology decisions.

### Cost Optimization
Understanding performance characteristics across different systems enables better resource planning and cost optimization, especially in cloud environments where compute and storage costs directly impact operational expenses.

## Dataset Description

The benchmark utilizes the **Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) On-Time Performance** dataset, representing typical analytical scenarios found in operational reporting and business intelligence applications.

### Schema Design (Star Schema)

| Table | Type | Records | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `airlines` | Dimension | 30 | Airline carrier information |
| `airports` | Dimension | 400 | Airport details and geographic data |
| `flights` | Fact | 38,083,735 | Flight departure/arrival data |

This star schema design reflects typical data warehouse patterns, enabling realistic testing of dimension-fact table joins, aggregations, and filtering operations.

## Supported Database Engines

**Tested Versions:**
- ClickHouse v23.8+
- Apache Doris v3.0+
- StarRocks v3.0+

### Important Notes on Database Startup

**Apache Doris & StarRocks**: These systems require additional time for backend nodes to initialize. The data loading script will automatically wait for all components to be ready (up to 2 minutes for each system). If you encounter "no available capacity" errors, the backend nodes may still be provisioning - wait longer or restart the containers.

**TiDB**: TiFlash columnar replicas need time to synchronize after initial data loading for optimal analytical performance.

**ClickHouse**: Generally starts quickly but may need a few seconds for metadata initialization.

**MariaDB ColumnStore**: Requires proper columnstore engine initialization which can take 30-60 seconds.

## Reproducibility

To reproduce the exact results shown in this benchmark:

1. **Environment**: Use the same hardware specifications listed in [Testing Environment](#testing-environment)
2. **Software Versions**: Ensure you're using the database versions specified in [Supported Database Engines](#supported-database-engines)
3. **Data Consistency**: The benchmark uses the same BTS dataset with 38,083,735 flight records
4. **Configuration**: Use the provided Docker configurations without modification
5. **Methodology**: Follow the cold cache approach - restart containers between test runs

**Note**: Results may vary slightly due to system load and hardware differences, but relative performance rankings should remain consistent.

## Benchmark Methodology

### Query Suite Design

The benchmark includes **a comprehensive set of 20 analytical queries** representing common OLAP patterns:

- Simple aggregations and filtering operations
- Multi-table joins with dimensional analysis  
- Time-based analysis and seasonal trending
- Complex analytical functions and window operations
- Advanced star schema pattern demonstrations
- Competitive analysis and market intelligence queries
- Aircraft utilization and operational efficiency analysis
- Weather impact and disruption pattern analysis
- Cross-airline performance benchmarking
- Varying data selectivity and aggregation complexity levels

**Example Query Patterns:**

The actual benchmark queries are significantly more complex than basic examples. Here are simplified representations of the analytical patterns used:

```sql
-- Pattern from Query 1: Multi-CTE airline market analysis
-- (Actual query calculates market share percentages with cross joins)
WITH flight_stats AS (
    SELECT a.airline, COUNT(*) AS volume, SUM(f.cancelled) AS cancelled
    FROM flights f JOIN airlines a ON f.carrier = a.iata_code
    WHERE f.year = 2020 GROUP BY a.airline
)
SELECT fs.airline, fs.volume,
       ROUND(100 * fs.volume / total.volume, 2) AS market_share_pct
FROM flight_stats fs CROSS JOIN (SELECT SUM(volume) AS volume FROM flight_stats) total;

-- Pattern from Query 12: Advanced window functions with performance categorization  
-- (Actual query includes month name conversion and performance categories)
WITH monthly_perf AS (
    SELECT a.airline, f.month, AVG(f.arr_delay) AS avg_delay
    FROM flights f JOIN airlines a ON f.carrier = a.iata_code
    GROUP BY a.airline, f.month HAVING COUNT(*) >= 100
)
SELECT airline, month, avg_delay,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY month ORDER BY avg_delay ASC) AS rank,
       CASE WHEN RANK() OVER (...) <= 3 THEN 'Top Performer' ELSE 'Average' END AS category
FROM monthly_perf;
```

> **Note**: These are simplified representations. The actual queries in [`queries/sql/`](queries/sql/) are more sophisticated, featuring complex CTEs, advanced aggregations, comprehensive business logic, and performance optimizations. View the individual `.sql` files for complete query implementations.

**Q: Can I add my own queries to the benchmark?**
A: Absolutely! Add your queries to the `queries/sql/` directory and they'll be automatically included in the benchmark run.

### Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "No available capacity" errors with Doris/StarRocks  
**Solution**: Backend nodes need time to initialize. Wait 2-3 minutes or restart containers.

**Issue**: ClickHouse connection failures  
**Solution**: Ensure the client is installed and the container is fully started before running benchmarks.

**Issue**: TiDB data loading is slow  
**Solution**: TiFlash needs time to create columnar replicas. This is normal and improves query performance.

**Issue**: "Couldn't find a tree builder with the features you requested: xml" error during data download  
**Solution**: This indicates `lxml` is missing. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again, which now includes `lxml` for XML parsing support.
