Documents, embeddings and conversations live in a local SQLite database. The only
thing that ever leaves your machine is the prompt sent to whichever LLM provider
you configure — and you can point that at a model running on the same machine.

## ✨ Features

| | Feature | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 📚 | **Bring your own sources** | PDFs, `.txt` and `.md` files, web pages and YouTube transcripts, extracted into Markdown, chunked along the document's own headings, and embedded locally. |
| 🔍 | **Hybrid retrieval** | Persistent sqlite-vec dense candidates and FTS5/BM25 keyword candidates run over the same document scope and are fused by reciprocal rank. The lexical terms include CJK character bigrams, so Chinese text is searchable too. |
| 💬 | **Answers with citations** | Every answer names the chunks behind it, with the document and the section path they came from. Conversations are multi-turn and persisted per project. |
| 🔌 | **Any LLM, or none** | Claude, OpenAI, anything speaking the OpenAI chat-completions API (Groq, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Gemini, xAI, Mistral), or a local Ollama / llama.cpp / vLLM server. |
| 🎛 | **Studio outputs** | A Markdown report, a spoken audio summary, an interactive concept map, and a narrated slideshow, grounded in your project's sources. |
| 🔐 | **Per-account isolation** | Register, sign in, and every route checks ownership. Another account's project answers `404` rather than `403`, so ids cannot be enumerated. |
| 📤 | **Export anything** | One conversation, a whole project, or a project summary, as Markdown, JSON or plain text. |

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tom1030507/OpenNotebookLM.git
cd OpenNotebookLM

cp .env.example .env          # then set JWT_SECRET_KEY and one LLM provider
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps
```

| | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend | <http://localhost:3000> |
| API | <http://localhost:8000> |
| Interactive API docs | <http://localhost:8000/docs> |
| Liveness | <http://localhost:8000/healthz> |
| Readiness | <http://localhost:8000/readyz> |

Register on `/login`, create a project, drop in a PDF, and ask it something. The
first request downloads the embedding model, so expect a slow cold start.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **With no LLM provider configured, question answering still returns a response
> — but an extractive one:** the first few sentences of the best-matching chunks,
> prefixed "Based on the provided documents". The API labels those responses
> `model_used: "fallback"`. That is the single most important thing to know
> before judging answer quality. See [Configuration](#-configuration).

## 📦 Installation

<details>
<summary><b>Docker Compose</b> — any platform (recommended)</summary>

Needs Docker 25.0+, Docker Compose 2.20.2+ (for `healthcheck.start_interval`
and the retained compatibility wrapper), roughly 4 GB of RAM, and 10 GB of
disk for the images and embedding model.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Set JWT_SECRET_KEY to a unique random value before Compose can start.
docker compose up -d --build
```

The production Compose file deliberately fails before creating containers when
`JWT_SECRET_KEY` is missing or empty. Generate one with
`python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"`. It also defaults
`DEBUG=false`. The copied `.env.example` allows CORS from
`http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:3001`; set `CORS_ORIGINS` to a
comma-separated list of your deployed frontend origins.

Browser requests use the same-origin `/api` path. Next proxies that path to
`BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL` (`http://backend:8000` in Compose), so Docker service
names never enter the browser bundle. Rebuild the frontend image after changing
that internal destination because Next compiles rewrites during its build.

The root `docker-compose.yml` also defines optional `ollama` and `redis`
services, behind profiles:

```bash
docker compose --profile with-ollama up -d      # add a local model server
docker compose --profile with-cache up -d       # add Redis
```

`start.sh` / `start.bat` wrap the same thing: `./start.sh`, `./start.sh with-ollama`,
`./start.sh with-cache`, `./start.sh full`. A freshly copied example has a blank
JWT secret, so the launcher exits with generation instructions instead of
claiming the stack started. Stop with `docker compose down`.

`deploy/docker-compose.yml` remains as a compatibility entry point for existing
automation. It includes the root Compose model rather than defining another
image or security policy:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

Ollama and Redis are reachable only on the Compose network. Their profiles do
not publish host ports; add an explicit loopback-only mapping such as
`127.0.0.1:11434:11434` in a local override if host tools need direct access.
Redis is deliberately disposable: Compose disables both AOF and RDB snapshots
and gives it no volume. Restarting it starts an empty cache, so repeated scoped
invalidation cannot grow persistent disk or replay an invalidated generation.

Database, model, and upload state use Docker-managed named volumes
(`opennotebooklm-data`, `opennotebooklm-models`, and
`opennotebooklm-uploads`). Recreating containers or running
`docker compose down` preserves them; `docker compose down --volumes` deletes
them.

Earlier versions bind-mounted `./data`, `./models`, and `./uploads`. Only
`data/opennotebook.db` and `uploads/` are durable user state. `models/` contains
rebuildable embedding and Ollama caches (including `models/ollama`), while
`data/redis` is a rebuildable Redis cache. Stop the old stack and back up all
three directories first. Then, before the first new-version start and with
`JWT_SECRET_KEY` already set in `.env`, migrate only the durable state once:

```bash
docker compose build backend
docker compose create backend
docker cp data/opennotebook.db opennotebook-backend:/app/data/opennotebook.db
docker cp uploads/. opennotebook-backend:/app/uploads/
docker compose run --rm --no-deps --user root backend \
  sh -c 'chown -R 1000:1000 /app/data /app/uploads'
docker compose rm -f backend
```

Skip a `docker cp` line when that old path does not exist. Do not bulk-copy
`data/` or `models/`: that would mix rebuildable `data/redis` and
`models/ollama` caches into the backend's durable volumes. This migration
intentionally leaves every cache in the old directories for rollback; the new
stack re-downloads embedding/Ollama models when used and starts Redis empty when
its profile is enabled. Remove the old directories only after verifying the
durable database and uploads in the new stack.

A Next.js App Router frontend talks to the FastAPI backend over the same REST API
documented below; there is no privileged path around it. Routers stay thin — they
validate, delegate to a service, and shape the response.

<details>
<summary><b>How retrieval actually behaves</b>, and how a change to it is measured</summary>

Retrieval is hybrid, and both halves are needed.

With the default `EMB_BACKEND=sqlitevec`, embeddings live in a persistent
sqlite-vec `vec0` index and nearest-neighbour candidates are selected in SQLite.
The application asks the database for a bounded top-k list and batch-loads its
chunk metadata; it does not unpickle every scoped embedding in Python. Lexical
terms are maintained in a persistent FTS5 table and ranked with SQLite BM25, so
they are not tokenized across the whole corpus again for each question.

sqlite-vec 0.1.9 performs an **exact** vector scan: moving the work into SQLite
removes Python deserialization, full-result sorting and metadata N+1 queries,
but it is not an ANN/HNSW index and its vector work is still O(n) in the eligible
rows. This is a correctness and bounded-candidate improvement, not a claim that
the database has become sublinear. If the sqlite-vec extension cannot load, the
service names the Python brute-force fallback and its reason in `/healthz`;
that fallback has a lower practical capacity because it materializes scoped
embeddings in the application process.

The dense half alone is weak here in a way that is easy to miss. On this
project's evaluation corpus, `multilingual-e5-base` returns cosine similarities
between roughly 0.67 and 0.71 for relevant and irrelevant chunks alike — a spread
of about 0.01 between rank 1 and rank 10. Any similarity threshold inside that
band is arbitrary, which is why `RETRIEVAL_MIN_SCORE` defaults to `0` and why an
exact term match carries so much weight.

The BM25 half supplies that exactness. Its tokenizer emits Latin words and **CJK
character bigrams**, so Chinese text is searchable; splitting on whitespace, as
the previous re-ranker did, yields one token for an entire Chinese sentence and
scores zero.

Fusion ranks by the *best* reciprocal rank either retriever gave a chunk, with
the sum as the tie-break. Plain summed RRF credits a chunk simply for appearing
in both lists, and with a weak dense list that buries a keyword hit: two
questions whose answer BM25 ranked first fell out of the top ten entirely that
way.

Chunking follows the document's own structure. Extraction emits headings as
`## Heading`, the chunker keeps a heading stack so no chunk straddles a section,
and the section path is stored on the chunk, prepended to the text that gets
embedded, and shown in the citation.

**Measuring a change.** `backend/scripts/eval_retrieval.py` scores retrieval
against a fixed corpus of six Wikipedia pages (three English, three Traditional
Chinese) and 30 questions, 12 of them cross-lingual. It builds its own database
and never touches `data/opennotebook.db`:

```bash
docker exec <backend-container> sh -lc \
  "cd /app && LLM_MODE=none python -m scripts.eval_retrieval --tag mychange --out /tmp/rag-eval"
```

Ground truth is answer-bearing *text*, not chunk ids, so the same question set
stays comparable across changes to the chunker. Reports land in the `--out`
directory as `metrics.json` and `report.md`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Who can read what</b> — sign-in and ownership</summary>

Every startup keeps a **demo account** present — `demo` / `demo1234` by
default — so a fresh install is not a locked door, and the sign-in page shows
those credentials with a button that fills the form. An account that already
exists is never modified, so changing `DEMO_PASSWORD` does not rotate a
password already in the database; when the stored password stops matching, the
sign-in page quietly stops offering it.

> **Set `SEED_DEMO_USER=false` on any deployment other people can reach.**
> While it is on, anyone who can open the sign-in page can read a working
> username and password. Deleting the account is not enough — the next restart
> recreates it.

Development keeps registration on `/login` open through
`POST /api/auth/register`; passwords are hashed with bcrypt. Production closes
public registration unless `ALLOW_PUBLIC_REGISTRATION=true` is set. Bootstrap
an operator account without opening enrollment (the password is prompted for
without echoing it) with:

```bash
docker exec -it opennotebook-backend sh -lc \
  "cd /app && python -m scripts.create_user --username operator --email operator@example.com"
```

The command is idempotent for the same username/email. Signing in exchanges the
credentials for a bearer token at `POST /api/auth/token`. There is no way in
that skips the backend — a session it never issued is refused by every API
route.

Every route except the health checks and the two credential endpoints is mounted
behind `get_current_user`, so a request with no `Authorization` header and one
with a token the backend cannot validate both get `401`, deliberately
indistinguishable. The frontend attaches the token to every request it makes, and
on a `401` discards the local session and returns to `/login` rather than leaving
you on a workspace where each panel fails on its own.

Sign-in also mirrors the token into an `auth_token` cookie, because the Next.js
middleware that guards `/` runs on the server and cannot read `localStorage`.
That middleware only checks the cookie is *present*: it is a navigation
convenience so you land on `/login` instead of an empty workspace, and it is not
what protects your data. The API is.

Projects and documents carry an owner, and every route that reads or writes them
checks it. Conversations follow their project; retrieval is confined to the
caller's own documents even when no project is selected, so a question cannot
reach another account's chunks. A resource that belongs to someone else answers
`404`, exactly like one that does not exist — `403` would confirm the id is real,
which turns id enumeration into a way of discovering what other accounts have.

**Rows created before ownership existed have no owner, and the API treats them as
belonging to nobody rather than to everybody.** They stay in the database and
stop appearing in the UI until they are claimed:

```bash
docker exec <backend-container> sh -lc \
  "cd /app && python -m scripts.assign_owner --username <account> --dry-run"
```

Drop `--dry-run` to write. Only null owners are touched, so it is safe to re-run
and can never move a row between accounts. The `user_id` columns themselves are
added to an existing database on start-up by `db.database.ensure_added_columns`,
since `create_all` only ever creates missing *tables*.

Cache administration is not public. The only cache routes invalidate a project
or document after the same ownership check used by its data routes; foreign and
missing ids both answer `404`.

## ⚙ Configuration

Set **one** LLM provider in `.env`. `LLM_MODE=auto` (the default) picks the first
one configured, in the order Claude → OpenAI → local server.

```bash
CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-...        # or
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...            # or
LLM_MODE=local                   # with OLLAMA_BASE_URL / OLLAMA_MODEL
```

`GET /healthz` reports which provider is *configured*; `model_used` on a
`/api/query` response tells you which one actually answered.

<details>
<summary><b>LLM providers in detail</b> — Claude, OpenAI-compatible, local</summary>

**Claude** (the default when a key is present)

```bash
CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-opus-5      # default
CLAUDE_EFFORT=low               # low | medium | high | xhigh | max
```

Two details worth knowing:

- **Sampling parameters are not sent.** Current Claude models reject
  `temperature`, so the `temperature` argument in a query request is ignored on
  this path. Control depth with `CLAUDE_EFFORT` instead. Answering from retrieved
  chunks is not reasoning-heavy, which is why the default is `low`.
- **Thinking is on by default and shares the output budget with the answer.** A
  request's `max_tokens` is therefore raised to at least `CLAUDE_MIN_MAX_TOKENS`
  (2048) so the reply is not truncated by the thinking.

**OpenAI, or any provider that speaks its API**

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.6            # default
OPENAI_BASE_URL=                # empty for OpenAI itself
```

`OPENAI_BASE_URL` redirects this path at any service implementing the same
chat-completions API, which is most of them. Give it the provider's `/v1`
endpoint and an `OPENAI_MODEL` that provider actually serves:

| Provider | `OPENAI_BASE_URL` |
|----------|-------------------|
| Groq | `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` |
| OpenRouter | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` |
| DeepSeek | `https://api.deepseek.com/v1` |
| Google Gemini | `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/` |
| xAI | `https://api.x.ai/v1` |
| Mistral | `https://api.mistral.ai/v1` |

Model ids differ per provider and change often — list them rather than guessing,
e.g. `curl -s $OPENAI_BASE_URL/models -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"`.

Note the `openai` SDK also reads an `OPENAI_BASE_URL` from the process
environment on its own, so an exported value takes effect even when this setting
is unset. Set it explicitly if you mean to reach OpenAI.

This path sends `max_tokens`. It has not been exercised against a live OpenAI key
here, and newer OpenAI models have been migrating that parameter to
`max_completion_tokens` — if a request is rejected for the parameter name, that is
the thing to change in `OpenAICompatibleProvider.generate`.

**Reasoning models return their thinking as the answer**

Groq's reasoning models (`qwen/qwen3.6-27b`, MiniMax M2.7) put their entire chain
of thought in `message.content`, wrapped in `<think>` tags — so it arrives as the
answer and the UI renders it. `OPENAI_REASONING_FORMAT=hidden` suppresses it
(`parsed` moves it to a separate field, `raw` is the provider default). Measured
on one retrieval question at the 512-token budget `services/rag.py` sends:

| `OPENAI_MODEL` | `<think>` in the answer | output tokens used |
|----------------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| `qwen/qwen3.6-27b` | yes | 373 / 512 |
| `qwen/qwen3.6-27b` + `hidden` | no | 332 / 512 |
| `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` | no | 25 / 512 |

`hidden` cleans the output but the reasoning is still generated, still billed, and
still counted against `max_tokens` — and because it comes first, hitting the
ceiling truncates the answer rather than the thinking. That is what
`OPENAI_MIN_MAX_TOKENS` (default 2048) exists to prevent: at the 512
`services/rag.py` sends, turns that reasoned for the whole budget came back cut
mid-sentence, or empty. Raise it further if answers still arrive truncated — a
five-turn conversation measured here peaked at 1915 output tokens. A
non-reasoning model is the cheaper way to a clean answer.

`OPENAI_REASONING_FORMAT` is a Groq extension, sent only when set, because OpenAI
and the others reject parameters they do not recognise. `openai/gpt-oss-*` models
are unaffected: they return reasoning in a separate field already.

**A local model** (Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM)

```bash
LLM_MODE=local
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2           # must match a model you have pulled
```

**Checking which provider is actually in use**

`GET /healthz` reports the configured provider and model:

```json
{ "config": { "llm_mode": "auto", "llm_provider": "claude", "llm_model": "claude-opus-5" } }
```

That says *configured*, not *reachable* — no network call is made from a health
check. To tell whether an answer was generated or extracted, read `model_used` on
the `/api/query` response: anything other than `"fallback"` is a real generated
answer. A provider that fails at call time logs the underlying error at `ERROR`
level and falls back for that request.

The `/healthz` response reports retrieval separately; this is operational health
data, not part of the `/api/query` response. `requested_backend` says what
configuration asked for, while `active_backend` says whether sqlite-vec is
actually serving dense candidates or the explicit Python fallback is active,
and `fallback_reason` explains why. Use the reindex dry-run below for an explicit
canonical/dense/lexical shape and drift audit; health remains a lightweight
operational signal rather than a substitute for that audit.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Embeddings</b> — model choice, memory cost, and re-indexing</summary>

Retrieval quality depends on the embedding model, configured by `EMB_MODEL_NAME`.
The dimension is read from the model at load time, so `EMB_DIMENSION`
self-corrects and does not need to match.

The default is `intfloat/multilingual-e5-base` (768 dimensions). The previous
default, `bge-small-en-v1.5`, was English-only.

The e5 family is trained with asymmetric prefixes — indexed text as `passage: …`,
a search string as `query: …`. `services/embeddings.py` applies them
automatically for models whose name contains `e5`, and adds nothing for models
that must not have them. If you switch to a non-e5 model, no change is needed.

**Memory is the binding constraint, not download size.** Measured in this
project's container, with the app's own imports already loaded (0.61 GB):

| Model | Peak RSS | Dimensions | Download |
|---|---|---|---|
| `intfloat/multilingual-e5-base` | 2.69 GB | 768 | ~1.1 GB |
| `BAAI/bge-m3` | 4.85 GB | 1024 | ~4.6 GB |

bge-m3 is the stronger multilingual model and needs no prefixes, but on an 8 GB
host it OOM-killed a full re-index. Use it only where the memory headroom is real.

sentence-transformers caches models under `$HOME/.cache/torch`. Docker Compose
redirects that to the `opennotebooklm-models` named volume so recreating the
container does not re-download; outside Docker, set
`SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_HOME` somewhere persistent.

Stored vectors are only comparable to vectors produced by the same model.
**Changing `EMB_MODEL_NAME` invalidates every embedding already in the database**
— retrieval will fail on a dimension mismatch until documents are re-indexed. To
switch models:

1. Stop the backend.
2. Set the new `EMB_MODEL_NAME` in `.env`.
3. Restart, then rebuild the index in place:
   ```bash
   docker exec <backend-container> sh -lc "cd /app && python -m scripts.reindex"
   ```

`scripts/reindex.py` re-extracts, re-chunks and re-embeds every document already
in the database, keeping document ids — so projects, conversations and citations
survive, which deleting the embeddings and re-uploading by hand does not. It then
idempotently reconciles the dense and lexical candidate indexes. Back up
`backend/data/opennotebook.db` first.

`python -m scripts.reindex --dry-run` does not load the embedding model and does
not write the database. It reports canonical/dense/lexical row counts plus dense
and lexical missing/stale rows, rows that would be added, updated or removed, and
vector dimension mismatches. `--source-type` and `--ids` narrow source rebuilding;
an explicit `--ids` also scopes index reconciliation. To repair only persistent
candidate indexes from the chunks and embeddings already stored, use:

```bash
python -m scripts.reindex --index-only
```

Backfill is idempotent: after one successful reconciliation, running the same
index-only command again reports zero added, updated and removed rows. It cannot
repair an embedding-model dimension mismatch because that requires producing
new vectors; run the full command for that. A source it cannot re-read — a URL
that now 404s, a PDF whose upload is gone — is marked `error` and keeps its old
chunks, so it stops being retrievable until it is re-added.

The same script is how a change to extraction or chunking reaches documents that
are already indexed. Stored chunks were produced by the old code and do not
improve on their own.

The shipped SQLite deployment runs one backend process. Its retained worker
requeues jobs left `running` by a previous process at startup; do not run
multiple backend processes against the same SQLite file because one process
could otherwise mistake another process's active job for abandoned work.

Without `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, a development server signs tokens with a key generated
per process — sessions do not survive a restart. Any non-development deployment
refuses to start without it.

See [`.env.example`](./.env.example). Both Compose entry points consume this
single canonical environment contract.

## 🔌 API

Interactive docs at `/docs`, ReDoc at `/redoc`. Every path except `/healthz`,
`/readyz` (and its legacy `/ready` alias), and the two `/api/auth` credential
endpoints requires
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` and answers `401` without one.

<details>
<summary><b>Every endpoint</b></summary>

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/healthz`, `/readyz` | Liveness and readiness |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/token` | Create an account, exchange credentials for a token |
| `GET` | `/api/auth/me` | The account behind a bearer token |
| `GET`/`POST` | `/api/projects` | List and create projects |
| `GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE` | `/api/projects/{id}` | Read, rename, delete a project |
| `GET` | `/api/projects/{id}/documents` | Documents in a project |
| `POST` | `/api/projects/{id}/upload` | Upload a file (PDF, txt, md) |
| `POST` | `/api/projects/{id}/upload-url` | Import a web page |
| `POST` | `/api/projects/{id}/upload-youtube` | Import a YouTube transcript |
| `GET` | `/api/docs/{id}`, `/api/docs/{id}/status` | Document detail and ingest status |
| `GET` | `/api/docs/{id}/file` | The stored file, served inline (PDF preview) |
| `POST` | `/api/query` | Ask a question; returns `answer`, `sources`, `chunks_used`, `model_used` |
| `GET`/`POST` | `/api/projects/{id}/conversations` | List and create conversations |
| `GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE` | `/api/conversations/{id}` | Read, rename, delete a conversation |
| `GET` | `/api/export/conversation/{id}` | Export one conversation (markdown, json, txt) |
| `GET` | `/api/export/project/{id}` | Export a project (markdown, json) |
| `POST` | `/api/export/project/{id}/summary` | Project summary — powers Studio's report and audio |
| `POST` | `/api/projects/{id}/mindmap` | Mind map of a project; returns `root`, `node_count`, `model_used` |
| `POST` | `/api/projects/{id}/video-summary` | Scene script for Studio's video summary; returns `scenes`, `estimated_seconds`, `model_used` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/cache/invalidate/project/{id}`, `/api/cache/invalidate/document/{id}` | Invalidate cache entries after an ownership check |

`/api/docs/{id}/file` is no exception to the bearer-token rule, which is why the
preview pane fetches a file through the API client and renders the bytes, rather
than pointing an `<iframe>` at the route.

Every datetime the API returns carries a UTC designator (`+00:00`), so clients in
any timezone render timestamps correctly.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Backend — against a running container
docker exec <backend-container> sh -lc "cd /app && python -m pytest tests -q"

# or locally, if the ML dependencies are installed
cd backend && pytest -q

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm test          # vitest
cd frontend && npm run lint
```

The backend and frontend suites have separate commands. The backend suite needs the ML dependencies
(`sentence-transformers` and its transformers pin) importable — a bare virtualenv
without them cannot collect the tests.

### Browser E2E

The default Chromium suite starts isolated Next.js and FastAPI servers on ports
3100 and 8100. It uses a run-specific SQLite database under `output/e2e`.
Installing Python/npm dependencies and Chromium uses their package-download
networks, but once installed the fast test runtime makes no external application
or API calls and needs no provider secret, API key, public network, torch, or
sentence-transformers.

From the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r backend/requirements-e2e.txt
npm --prefix frontend ci
npm --prefix e2e ci
npx --prefix e2e playwright install chromium
npm --prefix e2e test
```

The E2E server uses `python` by default. Point it at the E2E virtual environment
when that is not the Python on your `PATH`:

```bash
E2E_PYTHON="$(pwd)/backend/venv/bin/python" npm --prefix e2e test
```

```powershell
$env:E2E_PYTHON = (Resolve-Path 'backend\venv\Scripts\python.exe')
npm --prefix e2e test
```

Use `npm --prefix e2e run test:headed` or `npm --prefix e2e run test:debug` for
local investigation. Failed runs retain an HTML report, trace, video,
screenshot, server logs, and isolated database under `output/e2e/<run-id>`.
Successful runs clean that runtime unless `E2E_KEEP_RUNTIME=1` is set (or, in
PowerShell, `$env:E2E_KEEP_RUNTIME = '1'`).

The production-embedding test is a separate, slower opt-in. It needs
CPU-compatible PyTorch, sufficient disk, RAM, and time; a cold run also downloads
the embedding model unless it is already cached. It still uses `LLM_MODE=none`
and requires no provider secret:

```bash
python -m pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch==2.13.0
python -m pip install -r backend/requirements-e2e-rag.txt
E2E_PYTHON="$(pwd)/backend/venv/bin/python" npm --prefix e2e run test:full-rag
```

```powershell
$env:E2E_PYTHON = (Resolve-Path 'backend\venv\Scripts\python.exe')
npm --prefix e2e run test:full-rag
```

## Local YouTube audio transcription fallback

When YouTube has no manual or generated captions, ingestion falls back to
local speech-to-text rather than reject an otherwise accessible video. The
existing caption path remains first because it is faster and avoids downloading
media. Only explicit `TranscriptsDisabled` and `NoTranscriptFound` responses
activate the fallback; private, missing, region-blocked and transiently failing
videos keep their original error so a network problem is not disguised as a
long transcription job.

The fallback is isolated behind a `YouTubeAudioTranscriber` adapter. It uses
`yt-dlp` to inspect one video without playlist expansion, rejects live videos,
unknown durations and durations above 1,800 seconds before downloading, then
downloads the best available audio into a temporary directory. Multilingual
OpenAI Whisper `base` runs locally with automatic language detection. Its text
and timestamped segments are normalized to the existing YouTube adapter result,
so document chunking, embeddings and the `queued` / `processing` / `ready` /
`error` lifecycle do not change. Temporary media is deleted on both success and
failure.

The Whisper model is loaded lazily, cached under `models/whisper`, and reused by
the process. A process-wide lock permits one Whisper transcription at a time;
additional imports remain `processing` rather than competing for all CPU and
memory. The initial settings are `YT_WHISPER_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true`,
`YT_WHISPER_MODEL=base`, `YT_MAX_DURATION_SECONDS=1800` and
`YT_WHISPER_CACHE_DIR=./models/whisper`. Disabling the fallback restores the
caption-only behavior without changing the API.

Deployment adds the `yt-dlp` and `openai-whisper` Python packages and the
`ffmpeg` system package. No database migration or frontend contract changes are
required. Unit tests will cover caption-first behavior, fallback eligibility,
duration and playlist rejection, output normalization, single-job locking and
temporary-file cleanup. Service tests will verify that fallback output reaches
the existing index and that failures remain visible on the document.

## ⚠ Known limitations

<details>
<summary>Stated plainly, because several of these look like features until you hit them</summary>

- **There is no sharing.** Ownership is all-or-nothing: a project belongs to one
  account, and there is no way to grant another account access to it.
- **Caching defaults to bounded in-memory storage outside Compose.** Set
  `REDIS_URL` for a shared cache, or enable Compose's `with-cache` profile. Redis
  stays on the internal network; without it, each backend process keeps at most
  `CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES` cached values plus, separately, at most that many
  project/document scope-version markers. Stats report both counts and their
  total. Compose caps disposable, non-persistent Redis at `REDIS_MAXMEMORY`
  (256 MB by default) with `allkeys-lru`; resource invalidation rotates an opaque
  version in constant work, while unreachable values are reclaimed by TTL or
  eviction.
- **YouTube import still depends on YouTube.** Caption retrieval can be
  rate-limited and audio download can be blocked even when the code is correct.
  Captionless videos fall back to local Whisper, which can take roughly the
  video's duration on a CPU-only machine and is limited to 30 minutes.
- **Studio's video summary is not a video file.** The backend returns a scene
  script and the browser plays it as a narrated slideshow, reading the narration
  out with the Web Speech API — the same split the audio summary uses. There is
  nothing to download but the script, as Markdown. Rendering an MP4 would mean
  adding a drawing library, a speech engine and ffmpeg to the image; recording the
  slideshow in the browser is no substitute, because Web Speech output cannot be
  captured into a `MediaStream` and the file would come out silent.
- **A video summary's narration is only as good as its inputs.** With no LLM
  configured each source scene is extracted instead — heading structure first,
  then the document's opening sentences, then word frequency — and `model_used`
  says so, in the response and in the player.
- **Mind maps use representative source passages.** The model builds a subject,
  main concepts and nested subtopics from summary sections and passages across
  the body. Generation uses at most 24 ready, owned sources and 18,000 excerpt
  characters per request; the dialog and Markdown export show partial coverage
  when the notebook is larger. Without a usable model response, the map retains
  every eligible source and derives its branches from heading structure, or
  word frequency where headings are unavailable. `model_used` identifies this
  fallback; `source_count` and `total_source_count` report source coverage.
  Selecting **Ask in chat** prepares an editable question with the concept's
  parent context, preserving any existing draft. It does not send automatically.
- **A small provider tier costs one refused request per feature.** The mind map
  and the video summary ask for as much output as the model will give, because a
  reply cut off mid-JSON parses to nothing. Providers count the prompt and
  `max_tokens` together against a rate limit — Groq's on-demand tier allows 8000 a
  minute, under which qwen3.6-27b's own 16384-token limit does not fit — so the
  first such request is refused, the ceiling is read out of the refusal, and the
  request is retried inside it. Each feature holds its own provider and so pays
  that once. Set `LLM_MAX_REQUEST_TOKENS` to skip it entirely. A project large
  enough that its prompt alone approaches the ceiling still falls back to
  extraction.
- **No WebSockets.** Ingest progress is polled, not pushed.
- **Cross-lingual retrieval is only partly there.** A question in one language
  finds passages in the other when they share a proper noun, because BM25 matches
  it. When the vocabulary does not overlap at all — an English question whose
  answer exists only in Chinese prose — `multilingual-e5-base` does not reliably
  bridge the gap. `BAAI/bge-m3` is the stronger multilingual model and would
  likely close it, but needs roughly 4.85 GB of RSS against this one's 2.69 GB.
- **sqlite-vec is exact, not ANN.** Version 0.1.9 selects top-k vector candidates
  inside SQLite but still does O(n) distance work over eligible rows. Persistent
  FTS5 avoids rebuilding a lexical corpus per request, and metadata is loaded in
  one batch, but very large installations will eventually need an ANN backend.
  `/healthz` names the active backend; the Python brute-force fallback has a
  lower capacity because it loads scoped vectors into process memory.

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary>Why does my answer read like it was copied straight out of the document?</summary>

Because it was. No LLM provider is configured, so the answer is extractive: the
best-matching chunks, lightly stitched. Check `model_used` on the `/api/query`
response — `"fallback"` means exactly this — then set one of the keys in
[Configuration](#-configuration).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I run it with no cloud provider at all?</summary>

Yes. Embeddings, retrieval, storage and the whole UI are local already; the only
outbound call is generation. Point `LLM_MODE=local` at Ollama, llama.cpp or vLLM
and nothing leaves the machine.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Where is the video file for the video summary?</summary>

There isn't one. The backend returns a scene script and the browser plays it as a
narrated slideshow, speaking the narration through the Web Speech API. The
downloadable artefact is the script, as Markdown. See
[Known limitations](#-known-limitations) for why recording it in the browser
would produce a silent file.

</details>

<details>
<summary>I changed <code>EMB_MODEL_NAME</code> and retrieval broke. What now?</summary>

Stored vectors are only comparable to vectors from the same model, so the old
embeddings are now unusable and the dimensions no longer match. Re-index in
place — it keeps document ids, so projects, conversations and citations survive:

```bash
docker exec <backend-container> sh -lc "cd /app && python -m scripts.reindex"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I share a project with someone else?</summary>

Not yet. A project belongs to exactly one account, and requests from any other
account get `404`. Everyone who needs their own notebooks registers their own
account on the same instance.

</details>

## 🤝 Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) documents the
conventions this repository actually follows — thin routers, services that hold
the logic, UTC-aware datetime columns, and where the live code is (`backend/app/`,
not the orphaned root-level `app/`). Read it before the first commit.

Run both test suites before opening a pull request, and keep the README honest:
if a change alters what a feature does without an LLM configured, say so here.
