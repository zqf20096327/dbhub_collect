```

### Option B: Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tony-stark-eth/news-aggregator.git
cd news-aggregator
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local
make start

# Access at https://localhost:8443
# (Accept the self-signed certificate on first visit)
```

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and adjust:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | Admin login email | `admin@example.com` |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` | Bcrypt hash of admin password | `$2y$13$...` |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | OpenRouter API key (optional) | `sk-or-...` |

| `OPENROUTER_BLOCKED_MODELS` | Comma-separated blocked model IDs | (empty) |
| `NOTIFIER_CHATTER_DSN` | Notification transport DSN | see below |
| `FETCH_DEFAULT_INTERVAL_MINUTES` | How often to fetch feeds | `60` |
| `DISPLAY_LANGUAGES` | Comma-separated display languages | `en` |
| `MERCURE_URL` | Internal Mercure hub URL (for publishing) | `https://php/.well-known/mercure` |
| `MERCURE_PUBLIC_URL` | Public Mercure hub URL (for browser SSE) | `https://localhost:8443/.well-known/mercure` |
| `MERCURE_JWT_SECRET` | JWT secret for Mercure publishing | `!ChangeThisMercureHubJWTSecretKey!` |

| `RETENTION_ARTICLES` | Article retention period | `90` |
| `RETENTION_LOGS` | Notification/digest log retention | `30` |

Generate `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`:
```bash
docker compose exec php php bin/console security:hash-password
```

## Notification Setup

Notifications use Symfony Notifier. Install a transport package, then set the DSN.

### Popular transports

```bash
# Pushover (recommended for Android)
composer require symfony/pushover-notifier
# DSN: pushover://USER_KEY@TOKEN

# Telegram
composer require symfony/telegram-notifier
# DSN: telegram://BOT_TOKEN@default?channel=CHAT_ID

# Slack
composer require symfony/slack-notifier
# DSN: slack://TOKEN@default?channel=CHANNEL

# Discord
composer require symfony/discord-notifier
# DSN: discord://TOKEN@default?webhook_id=ID&webhook_token=TOKEN

# Email (via Mailer)
composer require symfony/mailer
# DSN: mailto://from@example.com?to=you@example.com
```

Set in `.env.local`:
```dotenv
NOTIFIER_CHATTER_DSN=pushover://USER_KEY@TOKEN
```

## Alert Rules

Alert rules watch incoming articles and send notifications when matched. All alert matches are logged to the notification log regardless of whether a notification transport is configured. The log shows delivery status: **sent** (green), **skipped** (gray, no transport), or **failed** (red).

### Loading from fixtures

Define alert strategies in YAML and load them via CLI:

```bash
make sf c="app:load-alert-rules fixtures/alert-rules/portfolio.yaml"
make sf c="app:load-alert-rules fixtures/alert-rules/"  # load all files in directory
make sf c="app:load-alert-rules fixtures/alert-rules/portfolio.yaml --dry-run"  # preview
make sf c="app:load-alert-rules fixtures/alert-rules/portfolio.yaml --purge"    # remove rules not in file
```

Fixture format (`fixtures/alert-rules/portfolio.yaml`):
```yaml
- name: "Hormuz De-escalation"
  type: ai
  keywords: ["hormuz ceasefire", "iran diplomacy", "iran peace deal"]
  context_prompt: "I hold CF Industries and K+S stocks that profit from the Hormuz blockade..."
  urgency: high
  severity_threshold: 6
  cooldown_minutes: 30
```

### Creating via UI

Navigate to **Alerts** in the sidebar. Each rule has a **type**:

| Type | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `keyword` | Matches if any keyword appears in title/summary. Fast, no AI calls. |
| `ai` | Sends all articles to AI for evaluation against a context prompt. |
| `both` | Keyword match first, then AI confirms on keyword hits only (~10-20 AI calls/day). |

### Creating an alert rule

Navigate to **Alerts** in the sidebar, then:

1. Enter a **name** (e.g. "AI funding news")
2. Choose **type**: `keyword`, `ai`, or `both`
3. **Keywords** (for `keyword`/`both`): comma-separated terms, e.g. `OpenAI, Anthropic, funding round`
4. **Categories**: optionally restrict to specific categories
5. **Context prompt** (for `ai`/`both`): describe what to match, e.g.:
   > "Alert me when there is news about AI startup funding rounds over $10M. Ignore incremental product updates."
6. **Urgency**: `normal` or `high` (high = immediate notification)

## Digest Configuration

Digests are periodic AI-generated editorial summaries. Navigate to **Digests** to manage configurations.

![Digests page](docs/screenshots/digests.png)

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Cron expression** | When to generate, e.g. `0 8 * * *` (daily 8am) |
| **Categories** | Which categories to include (leave empty for all) |
| **Max articles** | How many articles to summarize (default: 10) |
| **Enabled** | Toggle digest on/off without deleting it |

Full CRUD: create, edit, and delete digest configurations from the UI. Use the **Run Now** button to trigger a digest on demand without waiting for the schedule. View past digest content and included articles from the history section.

The digest processor runs every 5 minutes and checks which schedules are due.

## AI Integration

AI features use [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) free models via `symfony/ai-bundle`.

- **No API key required** — the system falls back to rule-based categorization/summarization.
- **Primary model**: `openrouter/free` — auto-routes to the best available free model.
- **Failover chain**: If `openrouter/free` is unavailable, `ModelFailoverPlatform` tries minimax, glm, gpt-oss, qwen, and nemotron in sequence.
- **Quality gates**: AI responses are validated for structure and confidence (>= 0.7). Low-confidence results fall back to rule-based output.
- **Keyword-first alerts**: For `both`-type rules, AI is only invoked on keyword matches — typically 10-20 AI calls per day.
- **Blocked models**: Set `OPENROUTER_BLOCKED_MODELS=model-id-1,model-id-2` to permanently skip unreliable models.
- **Stats**: Run `make sf c="app:ai-stats"` to see model quality metrics.

### AI enrichment pipeline

Each fetched article goes through this pipeline:

1. **Categorization** — assigns a category (politics, tech, business, science, sports)
2. **Summarization** — generates a 1-2 sentence summary
3. **Keyword extraction** — extracts 3-5 key entities (people, organizations, places, topics)
4. **Sentiment scoring** — extracts sentiment from -1.0 to +1.0 (zero extra cost, same API call)
5. **Translation** — translates title and summary if the source language differs from English

All four steps use the same decorator pattern: AI tries first, rule-based fallback on failure. Keywords and translations are stored alongside the original content.

### Source language & translation

Sources have a `language` field (e.g. `de`, `en`). When a source's language is not English, the AI translates the title and summary after enrichment. The original text is preserved (`titleOriginal`, `summaryOriginal`) and shown via a tooltip on the article card.

Add a language when creating a source in the UI, or set it in the seed data.

## Search

Articles are indexed via SEAL + Loupe (SQLite-based, zero infrastructure). Search covers title, content, summary, source name, category, and extracted keywords.

- **Navbar search** — full-text search via `/search?q=...`
- **Inline filter** — type in the filter input above the dashboard article list for instant client-side filtering
- **Auto-reindex** — new articles are indexed automatically via a Doctrine event listener. A daily full reindex runs as a safety net via the maintenance scheduler.
- **Manual reindex**: `make sf c="app:search-reindex"`

## Article Bookmarking

Save articles for later reading with a single click. Bookmarks are persisted per-user and survive article cleanup. The dashboard includes a bookmark filter to show only saved articles.

![Dashboard with bookmarks](docs/screenshots/dashboard-bookmarks.png)

## OPML Import & Export

Manage sources in bulk via standard OPML files. Import feeds from other readers (Miniflux, FreshRSS, Feedly exports) — duplicate URLs are detected and skipped. Export your current sources as OPML to back up or migrate to another reader.

![OPML import](docs/screenshots/opml-import.png)

Navigate to **Sources** and use the Import/Export buttons.

## Real-time Updates

New articles and enrichment completions are pushed to the browser in real time via Mercure SSE (Server-Sent Events), built into FrankenPHP/Caddy with zero additional infrastructure.

- **New articles banner** — appears when new articles arrive while you are reading
- **In-place enrichment** — article cards update live when AI enrichment completes (category, summary, keywords appear without page reload)

The browser connects via the native `EventSource` API. No WebSocket server or polling required.

## Full-text Article Fetch

Articles are fetched in full text during Phase 1.5 of the enrichment pipeline using Mozilla Readability. This runs between feed parsing and AI enrichment, so the AI receives the complete article text rather than a truncated RSS snippet.

- **Per-source toggle** — enable or disable full-text fetch on each source
- **Per-domain rate limiting** — configurable sliding window to respect publisher limits
- **Graceful fallback** — if full-text fetch fails, the original feed content is used

## Health Check

A lightweight endpoint at `/health` returns system status without requiring authentication. Useful for Docker health checks and container orchestration.

```bash
curl -k https://localhost:8443/health
# {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","messenger":"ok"}}
```

## Settings

Runtime configuration is available at **Settings** in the sidebar. Settings use a hybrid approach: environment variables set defaults, and the UI allows overriding them at runtime without restarting containers.

![Settings page](docs/screenshots/settings.png)

Configurable values include display languages, fetch interval, article retention period, and log retention period.

## Sentiment Slider

Every article receives a sentiment score from -1.0 (negative) to +1.0 (positive) during AI enrichment -- extracted in the same API call at zero extra cost. Articles without AI enrichment use a rule-based fallback with ~30 positive/negative keyword lists (title weighted 2x, capped at +/-0.8).

The navbar slider controls how sentiment affects your reading experience:

| Slider Value | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| 0 (center) | No sentiment influence -- default ranking |
| +/-1 to +/-5 | Boost articles matching your preferred sentiment |
| +/-6 to +/-10 | Boost matching sentiment AND filter out opposite articles |

![Sentiment slider positive](docs/screenshots/sentiment-slider-positive.png)

The chat assistant also adapts its tone: hopeful and solution-focused at +4 and above, critical and risk-focused at -4 and below.

Backfill existing articles:
```bash
make sf c="app:backfill-sentiment"
```

Monitor progress on the Pipeline Status page (`/settings/pipelines`).

## Data Retention

Old articles and logs are pruned automatically by the `app:cleanup` command (run daily via the maintenance scheduler).

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `RETENTION_ARTICLES` | `90` | Articles older than this are deleted |
| `RETENTION_LOGS` | `30` | Notification and digest logs older than this are deleted |

Run manually:
```bash
make sf c="app:cleanup"
```

## Architecture

Domain-driven design with bounded contexts. See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the full diagram.

```
Article    → core articles, scoring, deduplication
Source     → feed management, fetching, health tracking
Enrichment → rule-based + AI categorization/summarization/sentiment
Notification → unified alert rules + Notifier dispatch
Digest     → periodic AI-generated editorial summaries
User       → authentication, per-user read state
Shared     → AI infra, search, categories, cleanup commands
```

See [docs/article-lifecycle.md](docs/article-lifecycle.md) for the article pipeline diagram.
