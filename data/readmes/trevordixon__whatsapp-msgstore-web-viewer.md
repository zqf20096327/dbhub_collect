## Privacy First

**Your data never leaves your computer.** 

This application runs entirely in your browser. The database file is processed locally using WebAssembly (SQL.js). No data is uploaded to any server, ensuring your conversations remain private.

## Features

*   **Modern UI:** A clean interface inspired by WhatsApp Web.
*   **Fast & Local:** instant loading and querying of SQLite databases directly in the browser.
*   **Search:** Filter conversations by contact name or phone number.
*   **Date Grouping:** Messages are intuitively grouped by "Today", "Yesterday", and specific dates.
*   **Responsive:** Works on desktop and mobile.

## How to Use

1.  **Obtain your database:** You need a `msgstore.db` file (encrypted or unencrypted).
    *   *Note: Standard backups found in Android/WhatsApp/Databases are usually encrypted (e.g., `msgstore.db.crypt14`).*
2.  **Open the App:** Go to the [Live Demo](https://trevordixon.github.io/whatsapp-msgstore-web-viewer/).
3.  **Upload:** Click the upload box and select your `.db` file.
4.  **Browse:** Select a chat from the sidebar to view history.

## Encrypted Databases (New!)

We now support opening encrypted WhatsApp databases directly.

*   **Supported Formats:** `.crypt15` (Verified), `.crypt14`, `.crypt12`
*   **Requirements:**
    1.  The encrypted file (e.g., `msgstore.db.crypt15`)
    2.  The decryption key (e.g., `encrypted_backup.key`) **OR** your 64-character hex recovery key.
*   **Where to find the key:** 
    *   **Rooted Android:** `/data/data/com.whatsapp/files/key`
    *   **E2E-Encrypted Backups:** Use your 64-digit hex key.
*   **How to use:** Upload your `.crypt15` file, and when prompted, simply drag & drop your key file or paste the hex string.

> **Note:** Decryption is typically verified on `crypt15` files. Older formats may work but are heuristic-based.
