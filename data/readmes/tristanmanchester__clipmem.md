A private clipboard memory for your Mac.

`clipmem` watches the macOS clipboard, saves every observed state in a local
SQLite archive, and lets you search, recall, inspect, restore, and export what
you copied later. It works as a terminal tool, a native menu bar app, and an
agent-friendly memory layer for OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, and other local
automation.

Use it when you want to:

- recover the command, URL, snippet, file path, or message you copied earlier
- ask a coding agent "what did I copy?" without dumping your whole clipboard
  archive into the prompt
- restore an older clipboard item exactly, including rich clipboard formats
- filter history by time, app, content type, size, URL, image, PDF, or file URL
- make copied screenshots searchable with opt-in Apple Vision OCR, fully
  on-device

## Requirements

- **macOS** — clipboard capture uses `NSPasteboard` via `objc2`
- **Apple Silicon** for the prebuilt Homebrew package
- **Rust 1.88+** for building from source

## Install

Choose one path:

CLI only (Apple Silicon):

```bash
brew install tristanmanchester/tap/clipmem
clipmem setup
```

CLI + native menu bar app (Apple Silicon):

```bash
brew install --cask tristanmanchester/tap/clipmem-app
open -a ClipmemMenuBar
```

If Homebrew says `tristanmanchester/tap` is not trusted, trust only the
clipmem install surfaces and rerun the install command:

```bash
brew trust --formula tristanmanchester/tap/clipmem
brew trust --cask tristanmanchester/tap/clipmem-app
```

The cask installs the CLI, runs `clipmem setup`, and enables launch at login.
See [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md) for Cargo, source builds,
upgrades, and Intel Mac support.

## Start using it

```bash
clipmem setup
clipmem service status
```

Copy something new, then ask for it:

```bash
printf "clipmem can find this copied sentence later" | pbcopy
sleep 1
clipmem recall "copied sentence"
clipmem recent --hours 1 --human
```

Use the snapshot id from `recent` to inspect or restore a previous clipboard
state:

```bash
clipmem get 42 --human
clipmem restore 42
```

See [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md) for a full walkthrough.

## Everyday commands

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Best-first recall | `clipmem recall "what was that shell command?"` |
| Exact text for pasting | `clipmem recall "the copied API URL" --quote --full` |
| Recent unique clipboard states | `clipmem recent --hours 24 --human` |
| Direct lexical search | `clipmem search "invoice" --hours 168` |
| Chronological event history | `clipmem timeline --hours 24 --format json` |
| Detailed snapshot view | `clipmem get <snapshot-id> --human` |
| Restore an old clipboard state | `clipmem restore <snapshot-id>` |
| Archive health check | `clipmem doctor` |
| Agent context preflight | `clipmem agents context --format json` |

For screenshots and image-only clipboard items:

```bash
clipmem settings ocr on
clipmem ocr run --limit 25
clipmem recall "text from that screenshot"
```

## Privacy model

- Clipboard data stays on this Mac in
  `~/Library/Application Support/clipmem/clipmem.sqlite3`.
- OCR uses Apple Vision locally; image data is not sent to a hosted service.
- The database directory is created with `0700` permissions and the database
  file with `0600` permissions.
- The archive is not encrypted by `clipmem`; use FileVault or equivalent disk
  encryption for at-rest protection.
- Use `clipmem forget`, `clipmem purge`, `clipmem settings pause`, and ignored
  app rules to control what is retained.
