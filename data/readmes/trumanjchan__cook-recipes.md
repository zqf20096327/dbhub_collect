# Cook Recipes
Making a recipe website had been on my mind for awhile. It wasn't until recently that I began expanding my library of recipes and needed a medium to store them all. Before I would save a rough list of ingredients needed for certain recipes on my phone or save chrome tabs or instagram reels, or just rely on memory. I created this to immortalize recipes that I have made and can vouch for, and to hopefully motivate my friends to try a new dish today.

## Features
- MySQL Database - nicknames, passwords, and recipes are stored
- Bcrypt - passwords are hashed
- Paramaterized Queries & Sanitized Inputs - protects against SQL injection
- Pseudonymity - nicknames can be anything
- Socket.io - real-time CRUD database operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Responsive - view the site on your pc or phone
- Lazy Loading - fast initial page load time
- Cloudinary Upload Widget - upload images and display them in recipes
- Custom Domain - memorable
