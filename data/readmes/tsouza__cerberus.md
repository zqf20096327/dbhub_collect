Cerberus lets you keep your metrics, logs, and traces in **ClickHouse**
and go on querying them from **Grafana** with **PromQL, LogQL, and
TraceQL** — as if Prometheus, Loki, and Tempo were still doing the work.

It is a **read-only query gateway**. You add it to Grafana as three
datasources (one Prometheus, one Loki, one Tempo). When you run a query,
cerberus translates it into ClickHouse SQL, runs it, and hands back the
normal Prometheus / Loki / Tempo response. Grafana can't tell the
difference, so your existing dashboards and alerts keep working unchanged.

**Cerberus never ingests telemetry.** Your OpenTelemetry Collector already
writes telemetry into ClickHouse through its ClickHouse exporter, and cerberus
reads it back. Writers keep pointing at ClickHouse exactly as they do today —
never at cerberus. The only writes cerberus ever issues are opt-in and
operator-driven: the `CERBERUS_AUTO_CREATE_SCHEMA=true` provisioning DDL and
the `cerberus schema …` derived-table backfills.

## Why cerberus?

Metrics, logs, and traces rarely share a store. The usual answer is
Prometheus + Loki + Tempo: three systems, three retention policies, three
storage bills — for what is largely the same OpenTelemetry data sliced
three ways. ClickHouse is a great single store for all three signals.
Cerberus supplies the missing **query side**.

- **No Grafana plugin.** Cerberus speaks each upstream HTTP API verbatim
  (`/api/v1/query_range`, `/loki/api/v1/query_range`, `/api/search`, …),
  so Grafana sees three ordinary datasources.
- **No new query language.** PromQL, LogQL, and TraceQL — exactly as your
  dashboards and alerts already write them.
- **Faithful parsers.** If upstream parses a query, so does cerberus.
  PromQL goes through the upstream Apache `prometheus/promql/parser`; LogQL
  and TraceQL go through cerberus's own clean-room Apache reimplementations
  of the published grammars, checked against the real Grafana parsers in
  testing — so no AGPL-licensed code is linked into the binary.

## How it works

Your telemetry lives in the **standard OpenTelemetry ClickHouse schema** —
one table per signal, not one giant table: `otel_traces`, `otel_logs`, and
metrics split by type across `otel_metrics_gauge`, `otel_metrics_sum`,
`otel_metrics_histogram`, `otel_metrics_exponential_histogram`, and
`otel_metrics_summary`. That is what the Collector's ClickHouse exporter
writes by default. Cerberus reads those tables; by default it neither creates
nor writes them (`CERBERUS_AUTO_CREATE_SCHEMA=true` provisioning and the
`cerberus schema` derived-table backfills are the opt-in exceptions).
Different column layout? Point cerberus at it with the
[`CERBERUS_SCHEMA_*` overrides](docs/configuration.md#schema-overrides-and-prometheus-resource-labels).

Every query takes the same path:

**parse → lower to a shared plan → optimize → ClickHouse SQL → stream back
in the upstream wire format**

One pipeline sits behind all three heads, so a new optimization costs one
implementation instead of three. The full breakdown is in
[`docs/engine.md`](docs/engine.md), the performance strategy in
[`docs/performance.md`](docs/performance.md).

> **Rate-over-range is exact by default.** `rate(…)` range queries match
> reference Prometheus bit-for-bit and stay sub-second at realistic scale.
> For million-row queries a native ClickHouse path (`timeSeriesRateToGrid`,
> behind ClickHouse's own `allow_experimental_time_series_aggregate_functions`
> setting) trades a sub-observable last-bit rounding
> difference for flat memory and an order-of-magnitude speed-up — see the
> [exactness-vs-scale guide](docs/performance.md#native-rate-exactness-vs-scale-should-i-enable-it).

## Quick start

Kick the tyres locally, no ClickHouse of your own required:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tsouza/cerberus.git && cd cerberus
docker compose up --wait
open http://localhost:3000   # Grafana (auto-login as admin); cerberus on :8080
```

That builds cerberus, boots a single-node ClickHouse, loads a deterministic
OTel fixture (logs / traces / metrics), and brings up Grafana
pre-provisioned with cerberus as three datasources. A fresh dashboard
populates in ~30s; `docker compose down -v` wipes the volume.

### Install a release

Cerberus is one stateless binary, configured from a `cerberus.yaml` or from
`CERBERUS_*` environment variables — the same settings either way (see
[`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md)). The runtime contract
around it — lifecycle, scaling, the solver and experimental knobs in
context — is in [`docs/operations.md`](docs/operations.md).

**Docker.** Pin an explicit tag; `:latest` only moves with stable releases.

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/tsouza/cerberus:<tag>
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -e CERBERUS_CH_ADDR=clickhouse:9000 \
  ghcr.io/tsouza/cerberus:<tag>
```

**Homebrew** (macOS and Linuxbrew). The quickest way to get the
`cerberus migrate` CLI onto the machine holding your rules and dashboards —
see [migrating to cerberus](docs/migration.md#step-1-install-the-binary).
Only stable releases publish a cask, so `brew` never hands you a prerelease.

```sh
brew install --cask tsouza/tap/cerberus
```

**Binaries.** linux / darwin × amd64 / arm64 on the
[release page](https://github.com/tsouza/cerberus/releases), each with a
[SLSA build provenance](https://slsa.dev) attestation:

```sh
gh attestation verify cerberus_*_linux_amd64.tar.gz --owner tsouza --repo cerberus
```

**Helm.** A production chart lives in
[`deploy/helm/cerberus`](deploy/helm/cerberus), published as a
cosign-signed OCI artifact with SLSA provenance:

```sh
helm install cerberus oci://ghcr.io/tsouza/cerberus/charts/cerberus --version <x.y.z> \
  --set clickhouse.addr='{clickhouse:9000}' \
  --set clickhouse.existingSecret=ch-creds
```

It is stateless and secure-by-default, with typed
ClickHouse / OTLP / schema / admit blocks plus full escape hatches
(`extraEnv`, sidecars, affinity, ingress, HPA, PDB, NetworkPolicy). The
[chart README](deploy/helm/cerberus/README.md) has the complete values
reference and a production HA example.

## Migrating from Prometheus

Cerberus replaces Prometheus's **storage and query engine — not your
dashboards, alerts, or ruler.** It has no rule engine and never ingests, so
your recording and alerting rules keep being evaluated by whatever evaluates
them today, and the move is ultimately a datasource **URL swap**. You just
have to earn that swap by proving, query by query, that cerberus returns the
same numbers on your own data.

The `migrate` subcommand in the release binary is built for exactly that. It

- **harvests** your real PromQL, LogQL, and TraceQL from rule files and
  exported dashboards,
- **previews** the ClickHouse SQL and schema offline,
- **replays** every metric query against its head's reference backend
  (Prometheus, Loki, Tempo) _and_ against cerberus, then diffs the results,
- **gates** the cutover on all of it, refusing the flip while a single query
  still diverges. Nothing is allow-listed; the gate earns the flip.

**→ Follow the step-by-step operator playbook in
[`docs/migration.md`](docs/migration.md).**

## Version requirements

Two things decide whether a deployment is compatible: the **ClickHouse
server version** cerberus queries, and the **schema shape** your telemetry
was written in.

| Component            | Minimum                        | Notes                                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ClickHouse           | **24.8**                       | The supported floor — the SQL cerberus emits is correct down to it. |
| OTel exporter schema | **clickhouseexporter 0.152.0** | A table layout, not a binary version — any matching writer works.   |

**ClickHouse 24.8+.** A query that runs on 24.8 runs on every newer server
too, and the differential harnesses execute on ClickHouse 26.5, so the
validated SQL is exercised well forward of the floor.

You do not have to tune for your server version. The optimization
auto-picker (`CERBERUS_CH_OPTIMIZATIONS=auto`, the default) probes it once
at startup and turns on the result-equivalent optimizations it finds:

- `aggregation_in_order` — 24.8+
- `condition_cache` — 25.3+
- the native `timeSeries*ToGrid` aggregates — 25.9+, so an eligible
  `rate(<counter>[range])` range query lowers to the compiled
  `timeSeriesRateToGrid` aggregate there and emits the 24.8-safe SQL
  unchanged below it. Validated result-correct at flat memory; the
  aggregates sit behind ClickHouse's
  `allow_experimental_time_series_aggregate_functions` setting, which
  cerberus stamps per query.
- `columnar_result_decode` — opt-in only; a perf tradeoff `auto` never
  selects for you.

[`docs/clickhouse-optimizations.md`](docs/clickhouse-optimizations.md) and
[the runtime contract](docs/operations.md#native-rate-timeseriesratetogrid--auto-enabled-on-259)
have the details.

**The schema shape, not the exporter.** Cerberus reads the standard
OpenTelemetry ClickHouse schema, pinned to the `clickhouseexporter`
**v0.152.0** table layout (via the `tsouza/…:cerberus-ddl` fork in
[`go.mod`](go.mod)). What matters is the column names, types, and `Map`
shapes — not which binary wrote them — so any exporter, collector pipeline,
or other path that produces that layout works. If yours differs, point
cerberus at it with the
[`CERBERUS_SCHEMA_*` overrides](docs/configuration.md#schema-overrides-and-prometheus-resource-labels).

## Compatibility

The three `*QL compat` badges at the top are **parity scores**:
`passed / total` cases where cerberus returned the same answer as a real
Prometheus / Loki / Tempo on the same seeded data. Each head has a
**differential harness** that answers one corpus with both engines and diffs
the responses case-for-case — pinning observed behaviour on real ClickHouse
against an upstream oracle, not just the emitted SQL.

| Head    | Reference + corpus                                                  | Release-gate check         | Conformance leg                           |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| PromQL  | real `prom/prometheus` vs `prometheus/compliance` (PromLabs / CNCF) | `compatibility/prometheus` | third-party conformance suite (strongest) |
| LogQL   | real Loki vs `grafana/loki:pkg/logql/bench` corpus                  | `compatibility/loki`       | real-backend diff, Grafana bench corpus   |
| TraceQL | real Tempo vs cerberus-owned TXTAR corpus                           | `compatibility/tempo`      | author-written corpus (lightest)          |

PromQL is the strongest leg: the third-party **PromQL Compliance Tester**
(PromLabs / CNCF Prometheus Conformance Program tooling) against a real
`prom/prometheus`, seeded identically on both sides via remote-write — **every
recorded case passes, with no allow-list.** The per-head roster and its size
are generated, and live in
[`compatibility/parity-baseline/`](compatibility/parity-baseline/manifest.json);
this file deliberately does not restate them, because a hand-typed copy of a
generated count is exactly what drifts. LogQL is solid but measured on a
Grafana bench corpus rather than a standardised conformance suite. TraceQL
is the lightest leg: no third-party TraceQL conformance suite exists, so its
corpus is author-written TXTAR and its numerical confidence is
correspondingly lower than PromQL's.

```sh
just compat-all          # or compat-promql / compat-logql / compat-traceql
```

**No allow-lists.** Every diff against the reference is a real bug to fix at
the source, not an exception to suppress. The full playbook — per-head
drivers, local reproduction, rejection parity, the sole pinned
`upstream-skip-baseline` contract — is in
[`docs/compatibility.md`](docs/compatibility.md).

<details>
<summary><b>How those badges double as a release gate</b></summary>

<br>

The three `compatibility/<head>` checks are release-tier lanes. On an
ordinary pull request they short-circuit to a fast no-op, so the context
still appears in the rollup without paying for a real run; they execute for
real on push to `main`, nightly, on dispatch, and on a `release/*` PR, where
`release.yml`'s preflight refuses to publish past a red one. A real run has
two layers.

The harness itself is _scored_
([#503](https://github.com/tsouza/cerberus/pull/503)): it accumulates
per-case results into `report.json` / `compat-score.json` plus a per-case
roster in `compat-cases.json`, and exits 0 even when a case diverges — so
the harness step alone reddens the job only on infrastructure breakage
(stack won't boot, seed fails, report unparseable).

The gate is the step after it.
[`compat-ratchet.mjs`](.github/scripts/compat-ratchet.mjs) compares the
run's roster against the committed one in
[`compatibility/parity-baseline/`](compatibility/parity-baseline/manifest.json)
and **fails the required job on any case that moved**: a recorded case that
now diverges, one that stopped running, or a new case that either diverges
on arrival or passes without being recorded. Gating on case identity rather
than a count means a regression cannot hide behind an unrelated case that
started passing in the same run, and moving a roster is a deliberate
same-PR sync of that head's deterministic baseline buckets.

`compatibility/prometheus-forced-route` goes further: `FAIL_ON_DIFF=1`
hard-fails inside the harness on _any_ per-case diff, which is what proves
the sharded solver route is byte-identical to reference Prometheus over the
whole corpus.

So each head badge is both a continuously re-measured conformance score and
— through the ratchet floor — a gate on every commit that lands on `main`
and on every release. It is detection on the landed commit rather than
prevention of the landing; the checks that block a merge are inventoried in
[`docs/test-strategy.md`](docs/test-strategy.md).
[`docs/compatibility.md`](docs/compatibility.md#parity-regression-ratchet-the-gate)
is the canonical reference.

</details>

## Testing

Cerberus is tested at 14 layers: parser and plan checks, emitted-SQL
goldens, query roundtrips on real ClickHouse, the differential harnesses
above, end-to-end Grafana flows, chaos and leak detectors, performance
guards, and an oracle-based property framework. `just test` runs the core
lanes; [`docs/test-strategy.md`](docs/test-strategy.md) is the canonical
layer map and CI-gate inventory.
