## Why Eventara

Every company that scales past a handful of services needs event monitoring. The options today are either expensive SaaS platforms where you hand over your data, or stitching together 5+ open-source tools yourself.

Eventara is a single, self-hosted platform that handles ingestion, streaming, real-time analytics, threshold alerting, and live dashboards out of the box. You keep your data. You control the pipeline. You deploy with one command.

---

## What it does today (v0.1.1)

**Ingestion** -- REST API accepts events from any service, language, or platform. Events flow into Kafka for ordered, durable, high-throughput delivery.

**Real-time analytics** -- Redis sliding-window aggregation for sub-second metrics. TimescaleDB hypertables for time-series storage with automatic compression and continuous aggregates. Metrics roll up from Redis to TimescaleDB every 60 seconds.

**4 threshold rule types** -- evaluated in real time by a Java handler engine:

| Rule Type | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Simple Threshold** | Fire when a metric crosses a boundary (error rate > 10%) |
| **Composite** | AND/OR logic across multiple conditions (error rate > 10% AND latency > 500ms) |
| **Event Ratio** | Track ratios between event types (payment.failed / payment.total > 0.05) |
| **Rate of Change** | Detect spikes and drops (throughput fell 30% in 5 minutes) |

Drools is used under the hood for DRL generation, syntax validation, and the rule-testing API -- but the hot-path evaluation is pure Java for maximum throughput.

**Adaptive evaluation** -- the engine adjusts its polling interval based on traffic volume. 30s at idle, 100ms during bursts. No wasted compute when things are quiet, instant sensitivity when they are not.

**Live dashboard** -- React 19 + Vite + Chart.js with WebSocket push updates every second. Rule editor with visual composite builder, ratio config, and source/event filters.

**Webhook notifications** -- alert channels with webhook delivery when rules fire.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tusharkhatriofficial/eventara.git
cd eventara
docker compose up --build -d
```

For a VM-style deploy using a Docker image, see [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](./DEPLOYMENT.md).

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Dashboard | http://localhost:5173 |
| API | http://localhost:8080 |
| Swagger | http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html |
| Kafka UI | http://localhost:8090 |

### Send your first event

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "eventType": "payment.failed",
    "source": "payment-service",
    "userId": "user_123",
    "severity": "ERROR"
  }'
```

Open the dashboard. Events appear in real time.

## Architecture

```
Your Services --> REST API (Spring Boot) --> Kafka --> Redis (real-time metrics)
                                              |                |
                                              v                v
                                        TimescaleDB      Drools Engine
                                              |                |
                                              v                v
                                        Flyway Schema    WebSocket (STOMP)
                                                               |
                                                               v
                                                     Dashboard (React + Vite)
```

Core stack in one Docker Compose file. Full stack in 30 seconds.
