## Your family's memories don't belong to Facebook

Every photo you upload, every conversation you have, every relationship you map on a platform becomes training data for AI models. Your grandmother's recipe in a WhatsApp group is feeding a neural network right now. You agreed to it in a terms update you never read.

Platforms change without asking. WhatsApp rewrites its privacy policy. Instagram kills features. Ancestry gets acquired. Your data follows the corporate roadmap, not yours.

Governments block platforms overnight. Russia restricted Telegram and WhatsApp. Families who kept their archives on those services lost access with no warning. If your country bans the app, your memories go dark.

Your family's data has real value. Today you give it away for free. As personal data licensing matures, you will want to decide who accesses it and on what terms. You can't license what you don't control.

A SQLite file on your own server outlives every startup, every acquisition, every terms-of-service change. No subscription to lapse. No company to shut down. Your great-grandchildren can open it in 50 years.

Family Book gives you that file.

## Why Family Book?

Every family has a story. Photos on someone's phone. Names nobody remembers. A great-grandmother's maiden name lost because nobody wrote it down. A voice note from a grandparent, sitting in a WhatsApp chat that'll be deleted when the phone dies.

Family Book exists because **your family's history shouldn't depend on a cloud service's business model**.

- **No subscription.** Deploy once, run forever.
- **No data mining.** Your family photos don't train anyone's AI.
- **No platform risk.** You own the server, the database, the files. Move them anytime.
- **No walled garden.** Standard SQLite database. Export everything.

## Features

### 🚀 One-Click Setup
Deploy, visit your site, and click "Claim this site." A guided wizard walks you through removing demo data, adding your first family members, and sending invite links — all before your coffee gets cold.

### 🌳 Interactive Family Tree
A D3.js-powered tree visualization with branches, partnerships, and multi-generational navigation. Click any person to see their profile, relationships, and photos.

### 👤 Rich Person Profiles
Birth dates (with fuzzy precision — "about 1943" is valid), locations, languages spoken, patronymics, maiden names, nicknames. Every culture's naming conventions respected. Parent-child subtypes: biological, adoptive, step, foster, guardian.

### 📷 Media Gallery
Upload photos and documents. SHA-256 dedup means the same photo uploaded twice takes no extra space. Every file served through authenticated endpoints — no public URLs to your family photos.

### 📅 Moments
A family timeline. First steps. Weddings. Graduations. That Tuesday when grandpa told the story about the war. Each moment has comments and emoji reactions. Sort by date, filter by person, search by keyword.

### 🏖️ Trip Albums
Shared photo albums for family vacations. Day-by-day timeline, GPS map with color-coded contributor pins, invite links for family members to contribute, and ZIP export of all originals.

### 🔐 Privacy by Design
No access control lists. No admin panels for permissions. **The family tree structure IS the permission system.** Graph distance determines what you can see. Close family sees everything. Distant relatives see less. It's how privacy works in real families.

### 🌍 Multi-Language
English, Spanish, Russian out of the box. Add any language with a JSON file. Names render in their native script — Бабушка Юки stays Бабушка Юки.

### 📱 PWA
Install on your phone. Works offline for browsing. Feels native. No app store required.

### 💾 Automatic Backups
Daily SQLite backups to the persistent volume. Restore with one command. Your database is a single file — copy it anywhere.

## Quick Start

### Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tymrtn/family-book.git
cd family-book

cp .env.example .env    # Edit with your values
uv sync                 # Install dependencies
uv run alembic upgrade head   # Create database
uv run python -m app.seed     # Load demo family (optional)

uv run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). You'll see the landing page with a demo family to explore. Click "Claim this site" to make it yours — the setup wizard walks you through everything.

### Deploy to Railway (recommended)

```bash
# Install Railway CLI: https://docs.railway.com/guides/cli
railway login
railway init --name family-book
railway up
railway domain    # Get your public URL
```

Set environment variables:
```
SECRET_KEY=<generate with: python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))">
FERNET_KEY=<generate with: python3 -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())">
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///data/family.db
DATA_DIR=data
BASE_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app
```

### Deploy with Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The `docker-compose.yml` includes the app, persistent volume for `/data`, and optional Matrix bridge for WhatsApp/Messenger import.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Backend | Python 3.12 + FastAPI | Async, type-safe, great for APIs |
| Database | SQLite (WAL mode) | Single file, zero config, fast |
| ORM | SQLAlchemy 2.0 + Alembic | Async support, migrations |
| Frontend | Jinja2 + HTMX | Server-rendered, no build step, instant interactivity |
| Tree | D3.js | The gold standard for data visualization |
| Auth | Magic links (passwordless) | No passwords to forget or leak |
| Media | Local filesystem + SHA-256 dedup | Simple, reliable, deduplicated |
| i18n | JSON locale files | Easy to add languages |
| Deploy | Docker + Railway | One-click cloud or self-hosted |

### Why Not React/Vue/Angular?

Family Book is deliberately **not a SPA**. Server-rendered HTML + HTMX gives you:
- No build step (no webpack, no node_modules, no 200MB of JavaScript tooling)
- Works without JavaScript (graceful degradation)
- Instant page loads (HTML is fast)
- Easy to understand (read the template, see the page)

HTMX handles the interactive bits: inline editing, live search, modal dialogs. D3.js handles the tree. That's it.

### Key Design Decisions

**Siblings are derived, not stored.** Two people who share a parent are siblings. No explicit sibling table — the relationship is computed from parent-child links. This prevents impossible states (A is B's sibling but B is not A's).

**Partnerships, not marriages.** The `Partnership` model supports married, domestic_partner, engaged, separated, divorced, widowed, and other. No gender constraints. Same model for every relationship type.

**Fuzzy dates.** Not everyone knows their grandmother's exact birthday. `birth_date_raw` stores what the family member actually said ("about 1943", "spring 1967"). `birth_date_precision` indicates year/month/day confidence.

**Source tracking.** Every Person, relationship, and media file has a `source` field: manual, gedcom_import, whatsapp, messenger, email. When you import from WhatsApp in 2026, the fact that "this photo came from WhatsApp" is preserved forever.

## Vision

Family Book isn't just a family tree app. It's the **private social network your family actually needs**.

### The Problem

Your family's memories are scattered across platforms that don't care about your family:

- **WhatsApp** — Photos and voice notes buried in group chats. Phone dies, memories die.
- **Facebook** — Your family photos train their AI. Your grandmother's face is in a dataset.
- **iCloud/Google Photos** — Shared albums with no context. Who is this person? What year was this?
- **Ancestry.com** — $299/year to see your own family tree. Your DNA sold to insurance companies.
- **Physical albums** — Rotting in a closet in Portland. One flood away from gone.

### The Vision

A single place where:

1. **Every family memory flows in automatically.** WhatsApp photos arrive via Matrix bridge. Email forwards get parsed. Old scanned photos get uploaded with dates and context.

2. **The family tree IS the permission system.** Your cousin in Tokyo sees different things than your neighbor. No admin panel needed — closeness in the tree determines closeness in access. This is how privacy works in real families.

3. **Multiple families share one instance.** The Riveras and the Santoss on the same server, each seeing their own branch, with the shared grandchildren in the middle. Install once, serve the whole extended family.

4. **Every fact has provenance.** "Grandma was born in 1943" — who said that? When? Was it from a GEDCOM import, a WhatsApp message from Aunt Yuki, or a birth certificate scan? Source tracking on every piece of data.

5. **It works for every culture.** Patronymics (Russian), maiden names (Western), Eastern name order (Japanese), fuzzy dates ("about 1943"), and relationship labels that respect the actual complexity of modern families — step-parents, adoptive parents, guardians, domestic partners.

6. **It survives you.** SQLite database. Single file. Copy it to a USB drive. Your great-grandchildren can open it in 50 years with any programming language on any platform. No vendor lock-in. No subscription to expire. No company to go bankrupt.

### The Bridge Problem (and the Opportunity)

The biggest technical challenge is importing from messaging platforms. WhatsApp, Messenger, and iMessage don't offer easy APIs for personal data export. The current architecture uses Matrix bridges (Mautrix) to connect to these platforms using your own account — no business verification needed.

But for non-technical families, setting up Matrix bridges is unrealistic. A potential path: a hosted bridge service (like a "Family Book Connector") that handles the Twilio/WhatsApp Business API complexity, pre-approved for personal family use. One-click enable, and your family's WhatsApp photos flow into your Family Book automatically.

This is an unsolved problem in the self-hosted space. Whoever solves it unlocks a massive market of families who want to own their data but can't navigate API onboarding.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I import from Ancestry/FamilySearch/MyHeritage?**
GEDCOM import is on the roadmap. GEDCOM is the standard format — export from any platform, import into Family Book.

**Q: What about DNA/genetic data?**
Not planned. Family Book is about stories, photos, and relationships — not genetics. There are better tools for that.

**Q: Can multiple family members use it?**
Yes. Magic link auth means anyone with an email can log in. The tree structure determines what they see.

**Q: How do I back up?**
Automated daily backups run via cron. The database is a single SQLite file at `/data/family.db`. Copy it anywhere. Restore by replacing the file and running migrations.

**Q: Is there a hosted version?**
Not yet. Self-hosted only. If there's demand, a hosted option may come later.
