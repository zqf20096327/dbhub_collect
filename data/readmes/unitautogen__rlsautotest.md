# rlsautotest

[![Featured in Supabase's July 2026 Developer Update](https://img.shields.io/badge/Featured_in-Supabase_Developer_Update-3ECF8E?logo=supabase&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/releases/tag/v1.26.07)

**Automated pgTAP test generation for Postgres / Supabase Row-Level Security.** You write no test SQL and no fixtures - point it at your database and it generates the whole suite for you. Deterministic, not an LLM guessing.

> Featured in Supabase's [July 2026 Developer Update](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/releases/tag/v1.26.07) under "Made with Supabase."

> **Status: beta (v0.x).** Actively developed and the CLI may still change - but it's built to **never emit a false-passing test**: anything it can't verify soundly is marked, not faked.

Point it at your database. It reads your RLS policies from the catalog and **auto-generates both the tests and the seed data**: a native [pgTAP](https://pgtap.org) suite that *proves*, per table, per command, per identity, who can `SELECT` / `INSERT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE` which rows, plus a per-identity access-matrix report and a CI gate that fails the build on any leak or unprotected table.

```bash
pip install rlsautotest

# Quick check: write a per-identity access report, then open rls-report.html in your browser (nothing saved)
rlsautotest --db-url "$DATABASE_URL" --schema public --html rls-report.html

# Or: generate a native pgTAP suite to commit and run in CI (pg_prove / supabase test db / psql)
rlsautotest --db-url "$DATABASE_URL" --schema public --emit supabase/

# Or: audit EVERY RLS schema at once into one interactive dashboard (pick a schema left, its full report right)
rlsautotest --db-url "$DATABASE_URL" --all-schemas --html rls-report.html
```

> âš ï¸ **Point `--db-url` at a disposable copy of your database, never production.** rlsautotest probes each policy by seeding rows and running real `SELECT`/`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`. Every probe is wrapped in a transaction and rolled back (nothing is committed), but the statements do run (table locks, triggers, sequences fire). `--emit`, `--report`, and `--html` all connect and probe; only `--describe` and the static checks (`lint`/`snapshot`/`diff`) just read the catalog.

_Running the suite - on a local Supabase (`supabase test db`), `pg_prove`, or in CI - is covered in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)._

## Demo

**Path A - quick check (no files saved):** one command points at your database and reports who can touch what; an unprotected table is caught immediately.

**Path B - generate a suite to commit + run in CI:** generate native pgTAP and run it with `pg_prove` (video).

## What it does

RLS is the security boundary of a Postgres or Supabase app, and Supabase's own docs note that writing pgTAP tests for it is "inaccessible to most web developers." So most RLS goes untested. `rlsautotest` closes that gap without you writing a line of test SQL.

You point it at your database and it:

1. **reads your RLS policies** from the catalog,
2. **generates the test data and identities** that exercise each policy (owners, other users, anon, role-holders, tenants),
3. **proves, per table, per command, per identity, who can `SELECT` / `INSERT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE` which rows**,
4. **emits a native pgTAP suite you commit and run** with `supabase test db`, `pg_prove`, or `psql`,
5. and gives you a **per-identity access report** plus a **CI gate** that fails the build on a leak or an unprotected table.

## Verifying RLS for HIPAA and SOC 2

Storing PHI or other regulated data in PostgreSQL? RLS is the access control that keeps each patient, tenant, or customer to their own rows. It's the technical safeguard HIPAA's Security Rule requires ([45 CFR Â§164.312(a)(1), Access Control](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/164.312)), enforced in the database itself on any Postgres, whether that's Supabase, RDS, Neon, or your own server. On Supabase specifically, [their HIPAA guidance](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/security/hipaa-compliance) calls out RLS for exactly this and offers a [BAA](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/hipaa-projects).

But RLS only counts if it actually enforces what it claims. A policy with the wrong column or an always-true `USING (true)` passes review while silently exposing PHI across tenants. `rlsautotest` produces the evidence that it holds: a per-identity proof, per table and per command, that PHI can't cross a tenant boundary or reach an unauthorized role, plus a committed pgTAP suite and a CI gate that fails the build the moment a policy leaks. That's access-control verification you can put in front of a reviewer.

The same evidence serves [SOC 2](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/security/soc-2-compliance). RLS is a logical access control, so a passing suite is direct proof for the Common Criteria access-control requirement (CC6.1, logical access to protected data restricted to authorized users), turning "we use RLS" into "here is the test run showing our RLS restricts access as designed."

It verifies the access-control safeguard, not your whole HIPAA or SOC 2 program. Your BAA (with Supabase, your cloud provider, or however you host), encryption, audit logging, and the rest remain separate obligations.

## How it does it

- **Auto-generates the data, not just the tests. This is what makes the generated tests mean something.** An auto-generated test only proves anything if the data driving it is also generated to match the policy and the identity; otherwise it passes against empty or mismatched rows and proves nothing. rlsautotest does this with **reverse-predicate seeding**: it works backward from each policy's predicate to the exact rows *and* identities (owner, other user, other tenant, role-holder, anon) that drive it true and false. So "the owner can see their row" is checked against a row that is actually theirs, and "another tenant can't" against a real, different tenant. You don't hand-write fixtures or scenarios.
- **Proves policies are correct, not just present.** It becomes each identity (owner, other user, anon, role-holder) and checks actual access, so a policy that's enabled but wrong (`USING (true)`, the wrong column, an always-true predicate) is caught, not just "RLS is on."
- **Every test asserts a real, owned row.** Assertions check the exact rows an identity can and can't see, so a passing suite means something: break a policy and the test turns red.
- **Proves multi-tenant isolation.** It seeds two tenants' data and claims and verifies one tenant sees only its own rows: the core invariant of most apps, checked directly.
- **Probes the two-membership user single-membership fixtures can never test.** Every membership policy is exercised by test users who belong to exactly one team — but real users join second teams, and that's exactly when the classic bugs fire: `team_id = (SELECT team_id FROM team_members WHERE user_id = auth.uid())` errors (`21000`) the moment the subquery returns two rows, and a `LIMIT 1` "fix" silently picks one team at random. For membership-scoped tables rlsautotest additionally seeds **one identity belonging to two tenants** (plus a visible row in each), probes what that identity actually sees, and pins the union cardinality as a test — so a policy that breaks, hides data, or over-delivers for users who belong to 2 tenants fails the gate, and any later drift turns the suite red. `lint` flags the scalar-subquery shape statically, with the fix (use `EXISTS`/`IN`, or resolve the tenant into a JWT claim at auth time).
- **Models "denied" the right way.** Row-level filtering is verified as zero rows visible; a missing grant is verified as a permission error. The two are distinguished, so a block is proven for the right reason.
- **Catches the cross-policy `WITH CHECK` leak.** This fires when a table has **two or more *permissive* `UPDATE` (or `INSERT`) policies** whose per-policy `WITH CHECK` is a *narrow value constraint* (a partition, e.g. one allowed status per role), but the discriminator that's meant to limit *who* may write *what* (role, owner, tenant) sits **only in `USING`, not repeated in `WITH CHECK`**. Postgres OR-combines every permissive policy's `WITH CHECK` independently of which `USING` matched, so the effective check becomes the *union* of all of them, with no discriminator. Any identity that can target a row can then write *any* value *any* policy permits (e.g. a `cutter` setting `status='Completed'`). rlsautotest enumerates the value space and proves, per identity, exactly which forbidden values are accepted. Fix: repeat the role/owner/tenant guard inside each `WITH CHECK`, or enforce the transition in a trigger / `SECURITY DEFINER` function, or make the constraint `AS RESTRICTIVE` so it `AND`s instead of `OR`s.
- **Handles real schemas.** It seeds foreign-key parents in dependency order, so tables with required relationships are actually tested, and it handles the tricky policies: owner (`auth.uid()`), tenant/JWT-claim, membership (`EXISTS`/`IN`), array membership (`= ANY`), role lookups (`(select role from profiles where id = auth.uid())`), RBAC functions (`authorize()` / `has_role()`), recursive hierarchies, escape-hatch `OR` admin grants, and permissive + `AS RESTRICTIVE` composition.
- **Seeds rows it doesn't have a rule for, by asking the database.** When a table's constraints defeat a templated insert, a probe-and-repair synthesizer tries the insert, reads the real error, and fixes it: filling `NOT NULL` columns, seeding single and **composite** foreign-key parents, varying values to clear `UNIQUE` conflicts, and neutralizing a `CHECK` that delegates to a function (then restoring it). The result is that even an opaque-function-gated table with a composite FK and a function-backed CHECK still gets a valid row to test against, with no per-schema hand-coding.
- **Solves predicates it has never seen, instead of only matching known shapes.** When a policy doesn't fit any named pattern (say a numeric clearance threshold, `(auth.jwt() ->> 'clearance')::int >= sensitivity`), a general solver reads the predicate's operand roles, derives inputs that should make it pass and fail, and **verifies both against your database** before writing a test, so coverage extends to novel policies, and anything it can't confirm stays marked rather than guessed.
- **Sound by design: never a false pass.** Tests are derived from your policies and the catalog, not guessed by an LLM. When a policy can't be proven soundly (e.g. an opaque function) it's marked clearly instead of turned into a green checkmark. And if a test's data precondition can't be established (the seed for a row fails), the engine still probes, then marks that cell **UNRELIABLE** and fails loudly rather than letting a seeding failure masquerade as a policy outcome.
- **Native, ownable output.** Standard pgTAP into `supabase/tests/database/rls/`, runnable by `supabase test db`, `pg_prove`, or plain `psql`. Uses the [basejump test helpers](https://github.com/usebasejump/supabase-test-helpers) when present, or ships a tiny offline shim when they aren't, so it runs online or air-gapped.
- **Static checks too.** It flags open `USING (true)` reads, `WITH CHECK (true)` writes, asymmetric `USING`/`WITH CHECK`, self-referential (recursive) policies, RLS-on-but-no-policy, and policy drift via snapshot/diff.
- **Maps the bypass surface around your policies.** Correct policies can still be undone by *how the data is reached*, so it also reports the objects and roles that sidestep RLS: owner-rights (`SECURITY DEFINER`) views and functions a client can reach, materialized views, `BYPASSRLS`/superuser roles, and RLS-on-but-not-`FORCE`d tables (see [Beyond the policies: bypass surfaces](#beyond-the-policies-bypass-surfaces)).
- **Flags a column-scoped grant that a broader grant defeats.** `GRANT UPDATE (display_name, bio)` says "only these columns," but a leftover table-wide grant (or one inherited from another role) reaches every other column again, so the scope you wrote never actually held. rlsautotest compares each role's column grant against its *effective* column reach and flags exactly that contradiction - the column-level analogue of the cross-policy `WITH CHECK` leak (see [Column-level security](#column-level-security)).

## What it generates

```
supabase/tests/database/rls/     # our own folder, separate from your hand-written tests
  000-setup-tests-hooks.sql      # pgTAP + helpers (or offline shim if basejump absent)
  010-rls-enabled.test.sql       # guard: fails if any API-reachable table has RLS OFF
  101-rls-profiles.test.sql      # one file per table, native flat pgTAP
  102-rls-notes.test.sql
.rlsautotest/debug/               # nested/structured copies for debugging
```

Each test is Arrange-Act-Assert: seed as a privileged role (RLS bypassed), act as a mocked identity (`authenticate_as` / `set_config('request.jwt.claims', â€¦)` + `SET ROLE`), assert the visible/affected rows, with `SAVEPOINT` isolation so a write test can't corrupt the next one.

## Modes

| Command | What you get |
|---|---|
| `--emit DIR` | full suite layout under `DIR/` (default; helper-based, looks native) |
| `--no-helpers` | fully self-contained tests (inline `set_config`/`SET ROLE`, no helper/000 dependency) |
| `--report` | run the suite and print the per-identity access matrix (`--report-json` for CI) |
| `--html FILE` | run the suite and write the access matrix as an HTML report |
| `--all-schemas` | with `--report`/`--html`: scan **every** RLS-bearing schema at once; `--html` writes one combined dashboard (schema picker left, full report right) |
| `--no-fail` | with `--report`/`--html`: don't exit non-zero on problems (default **does**, for CI gating) |
| `--table T` | a single table instead of the whole schema |
| `--describe` | show the identity classes the generator derived for a table |
| `doctor` | subcommand: verify the probe environment (role privileges, pgTAP, policy-function ownership); writes `doctor.json` to attach to bug reports |

## Supabase

Working inside a Supabase project? `--supabase` is a zero-config path built for the Supabase CLI:

```bash
# run from anywhere in your project, with the local stack up:
supabase start
rlsautotest --supabase
supabase test db
```

In this mode rlsautotest:

- **Finds the project** by walking up for `supabase/config.toml` (so it runs from any subdirectory) and **defaults `--schema` to `public`**.
- **Reads the database URL from `supabase status`**, the CLI's own reported connection string: the host `127.0.0.1` URL, never the container-internal `db:5432` one. `--db-url` overrides it, and if the local stack isn't running it stops with a clear message.
- **Writes straight into `supabase/tests/rls/`** (no copy or rename step), one file per table suffixed `_rlsautotest.sql` so they never collide with your hand-written tests. `supabase test db` picks up the nested folder on its own.
- **Reconciles on every run:** after a successful write it removes only its own stale `*_rlsautotest.sql` files (a dropped or renamed table, an old run) and never a file without that suffix, so regenerating stays clean and your hand-written tests are untouched.

Because it binds to the local, disposable Supabase database, this mode stays quiet: it skips the "point at a disposable copy" warning the general `--db-url` path prints. To target a specific copy instead of the local stack, pass `--db-url`. For a read-only dashboard across **every** RLS schema in the project (not just `public`), add `--all-schemas --html`: it binds to the same local database and writes the combined report without emitting any test files.

## The report

One grid per table (rows are identities, columns are commands), so it reads like a permissions table:

```
notes                          SELECT  INSERT  UPDATE  DELETE
service_role                     âœ“       âœ“       âœ“       âœ“     bypasses RLS
authenticated, authorized        âœ“       âœ“       âœ“       âœ“
authenticated, not authorized    Â·       Â·       Â·       Â·
anon                             Â·       Â·       Â·       Â·
```

`âœ“` = can, `Â·` = blocked. The one thing that lights up red is a `âœ“` where it should be `Â·`: an *authenticated-but-not-authorized* user or *anon* that can act (a security hole). It jumps out without decoding anything. `service_role` is shown for completeness; it bypasses RLS by design. A table with **RLS off** is flagged loud (it has no row-level protection at all).

The identity rows are deliberately worded so they aren't mistaken for database roles: `authenticated, authorized` and `authenticated, not authorized` are the **same Postgres role** (`authenticated`) under different JWT identities/claims. Only `service_role`, `authenticated`, and `anon` are actual Postgres roles. "Authorized" vs "not authorized" is simply whether that identity passes the table's policies (owns the row, is in the right tenant/org, or has the required role).

## The two-membership user

A membership policy (`EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM team_members ...)`) is usually tested — by every tool and most hand-written suites — with users who each belong to exactly **one** team. Real users belong to two. That single difference is where a class of bugs lives:

- `team_id = (SELECT team_id FROM team_members WHERE user_id = auth.uid())` works perfectly in every single-membership test and **errors on every query** (`21000: more than one row returned`) the moment a user joins a second team.
- Adding `LIMIT 1` stops the error and starts something worse: Postgres picks one of the user's teams **arbitrarily**, so they randomly see one team's data with the other silently hidden.
- An over-broad rewrite quietly shows a multi-team user more than their memberships grant.

For a table whose policy is a canonical membership check, rlsautotest seeds an extra identity — `authenticated, member of 2 tenants` in the report — with membership rows in **two** tenants and a visible row in each, probes what it actually sees, and compares against the single-membership branch identity. Union confirmed → the exact count is **pinned as a test**, so any later drift into one of the shapes above turns the suite red in CI. Error, hidden data, or over-delivery → a failing test is baked, the report marks the row, and the gate exits non-zero.

Judgement is enforcement-only, never intent: the probe runs only when *nothing* in the policy (no claim or session input) could legitimately narrow a two-membership view to one team. And it skips, by construction, the membership table itself (seeding two memberships there would insert rows into the very table being measured) and any schema that makes a second membership impossible (a unique user column) — a state that cannot exist in production needs no test.

`rlsautotest lint` catches the scalar-subquery shape statically, too — flagged HIGH with the fix (use `EXISTS`/`IN` over the membership table, or resolve the tenant into a JWT claim at auth time), while the safe shapes (`EXISTS`, `IN`, the `(SELECT auth.uid())` initplan idiom, and lookups keyed on a unique column) are never flagged.

## Who a policy actually applies to: `TO`, `PUBLIC`, and role groups

Every policy has an audience (the `TO` clause), and it is the least-read line in the whole policy. The predicate gets all the attention, but the audience decides who the predicate applies to at all. Postgres gives you several ways to name that audience, and some of them routinely end up saying something different from what the author meant:

| You write | Postgres records | Who it actually covers |
|---|---|---|
| *(no `TO` clause at all)* | `PUBLIC` | **Every role, present and future.** Omitting `TO` is not "a sensible default audience"; it is the widest audience that exists. |
| `TO PUBLIC` | `PUBLIC` | The same as above, but at least it says so out loud. |
| `TO authenticated`, `TO anon` | that role | The named role, plus any role that inherits from it. These names are Supabase/Neon *conventions*, not Postgres keywords; on a vanilla cluster they mean nothing unless someone created them. |
| `TO some_group` | that role | The group **and every member that inherits its privileges**. Any role can act as a group: `GRANT some_group TO alice` puts `alice` under this policy without her name appearing anywhere near it. |
| `TO CURRENT_USER` / `TO CURRENT_ROLE` / `TO SESSION_USER` | a concrete role, resolved **at creation time** | Whoever ran the migration. The keyword is gone by the time the policy is stored; reading the catalog later, you cannot tell it was ever dynamic. |
| `TO pg_database_owner`, `TO pg_read_all_data`, ... | that predefined role | Postgres's built-in group roles. `pg_database_owner` is the strangest: its membership is *computed* (whoever owns the current database), never stored. |

One reassurance: a role literally named `public` cannot exist (the name is reserved), so when a catalog view shows `public` in a policy's role list, it always means "everyone".

Two of these rows are where audits go wrong:

**The omitted `TO` on a permissive policy.** A policy named `"Service role full access"` with `USING (true)` and no `TO` clause does not apply to the service role. It applies to **everyone**, anon included. And because permissive policies OR together, that one policy silently absorbs every carefully-scoped policy sitting next to it: the user-scoped predicates still evaluate, they just no longer matter. The policy's name is documentation; the audience is the enforcement, and here they disagree.

**Inheritance.** A policy `TO admins` covers `alice` the moment she is granted membership, even though no text search for `alice` across your migrations will ever connect her to it. Audience is a property of the role graph, not of the policy text.

Both are the same lesson this tool is built around: what a policy *reaches* is a fact about the catalog, not about the policy's name or the author's intent. Reach is what has to be measured.

## Every schema at once

Most runs target one schema (`--schema`). To audit the **whole database** in a single pass, add `--all-schemas`: it discovers every schema that has at least one RLS-enabled table and reports on each exactly as a single-schema run would, so an exposed or RLS-off table in any of them is still caught.

```bash
# one interactive dashboard for the entire database: pick a schema on the left, its full report on the right
rlsautotest --db-url "$DATABASE_URL" --all-schemas --html rls-report.html
```

With `--html` it writes one self-contained page: a schema picker on the left, the selected schema's full report on the right, with each embedded report byte-identical to that schema's own `--html` output. With `--report` it prints each schema's text matrix under a header. The CI exit gate is **aggregated across every schema** (table names schema-qualified), so one leaking or unprotected table anywhere fails the run. Inside a Supabase project, add `--supabase` to bind to the local stack and get the same whole-database dashboard without writing any test files.

## Beyond the policies: bypass surfaces

A correct set of table policies can still be undone by *how the data is reached*. A `SECURITY DEFINER` view or function runs with its owner's rights, so it can hand a client rows that client's own RLS would hide. A materialized view is always a frozen, owner-populated copy of its source. A role with `BYPASSRLS` (or superuser) skips RLS entirely. And an RLS-enabled table that isn't `FORCE`d is bypassed by its own owner. None of these show up when you only test the policies, which is exactly where real leaks tend to hide.

`rlsautotest` maps that surface straight from the catalog, alongside the policy checks, and reports each object or role that can sidestep RLS, with a severity and the reason:

- **Views and materialized views** that run with owner's rights (not `security_invoker`), are readable by `anon`/`authenticated`, and read an RLS-protected table.
- **`SECURITY DEFINER` functions** a client can `EXECUTE` that reach RLS-protected data (or whose body is opaque), plus any with a mutable `search_path` (a search-path-injection risk).
- **Roles** that bypass RLS (`BYPASSRLS`/superuser) and aren't a sanctioned platform role, flagged higher when a client can log in as or `SET ROLE` into them. Use `--allow-bypass-role` to allowlist the ones you expect.
- **Tables** with RLS enabled but not `FORCE`d whose owner isn't a superuser.

These are **review flags, not pass/fail**: a `SECURITY DEFINER` view is often exactly what you intended. They appear in `rlsautotest lint` and in a **Bypass surfaces** section of the `--report` / `--html` output (and in `--report-json`), so a reviewer sees, in one place, every way RLS could be sidestepped and can confirm each is deliberate. Reachability is judged by *effective* privilege (`has_table_privilege` / `has_function_privilege`, which include grants to `PUBLIC`), so a function a client can call only through Postgres's default `PUBLIC` `EXECUTE` grant is surfaced even when you never granted it explicitly.

## Column-level security

Postgres lets you scope a grant to specific columns: `GRANT UPDATE (display_name, bio) ON profiles TO authenticated` says a user may edit those two columns and nothing else. That scoping is real security - it is how you keep `role`, `is_admin`, or `tenant_id` out of a user's reach - but it is silently undone the moment a *broader* grant is also in force. A leftover table-wide `GRANT UPDATE ON profiles`, or a privilege inherited from another role, reaches every column again. The column list you wrote still sits in the catalog looking like a boundary, while the effective privilege runs straight past it.

This is the exact column-level analogue of the cross-policy `WITH CHECK` leak: a restriction expressed in one place, defeated by a wider grant that unions back in. `rlsautotest` flags that one contradiction and nothing else. It makes **no** guess about which columns are "sensitive" (there is no column-name heuristic), and it never flags a bare table-wide grant on its own - a grant with no column scoping expresses no intent to scope, so there is nothing to contradict. It compares the developer's expressed scope (`pg_attribute.attacl`, the column grant) against effective reach (`has_column_privilege`, which folds in table-wide and inherited grants); the leaked columns are simply *effective minus granted*.

Each table's `--report` / `--html` grid carries a **column level security** block beside the row-level one, per role and per command (`SELECT` / `INSERT` / `UPDATE`; `DELETE` is whole-row in Postgres, so it has no column-level privilege and shows `n/a`):

- **`granted: id, display_name +2`** (green) - a column grant is in force and effective reach matches it exactly: the scope holds, and the listed columns are the permission you gave.
- **`⚠ leaks: role, is_admin +1`** (red) - a broader grant reaches past the column grant; the named columns are the ones that slipped the scope.
- **`·`** - no column-level grant in force, so no scope was expressed and nothing is flagged.

![rlsautotest column-level-security report for the colsec example schema: colsec.accounts leaks columns past its column grant (red), colsec.profiles stays scoped (green), colsec.members is a bare table-wide grant (silent)](docs/colsec-column-level-security.png)

The same facts appear in `--report-json` under `column_security`, and - the part that makes this enforceable rather than merely visible - the **emitted pgTAP suite bakes it in**. For every column-scoped cell, `--emit` writes one assertion that fails if any column beyond the grant is reachable. A scope that holds today becomes a committed test that turns **red** the day someone adds a table-wide grant that widens past it; and a scope that is *already* leaking when you generate the suite is emitted as a real `not ok` that names the leaked columns, never quietly passed over. As everywhere else in rlsautotest, a detected contradiction is surfaced, not smoothed away.

The usual fix is to drop the redundant table-wide grant and keep only the column grants (or, if the wide grant is genuinely what you intend, drop the column grants so there is no false boundary). `examples/colsec.sql` is the runnable illustration: three tables with identical row policies whose only difference is the column grid - one scoped (green), one leaking (red), and one bare table-wide grant that is correctly left silent.

## When something looks wrong: `rlsautotest doctor`

The probe needs real privileges from the connection role: `SET ROLE` to the client roles (`anon`, `authenticated`, `service_role`), `CREATE` on the target schema (for the pgTAP shim and seed helpers), and the ability to replace any function your policies delegate to (for the mock-wiring proof). If the role can't do one of these, the affected cells show `â€¼ UNRELIABLE` instead of a result, the suite fails loudly on those tests, and the run exits 1. It never bakes a result it couldn't actually observe.

`doctor` checks all of this in seconds and prints the exact remedy for each failed check (for example, on Supabase local: connect as `supabase_admin`, which owns the helper functions). It is read-only: every write it attempts is savepoint-wrapped and rolled back.

```bash
rlsautotest doctor --schema public --db-url "postgresql://..."
```

It also writes `doctor.json` alongside the on-screen report. **Filing an issue? Attach that file.** It contains catalog metadata only (role, function and table names, sqlstates, check results, and a per-table classification summary). No row data, no credentials. It usually lets a problem be reproduced and fixed without any back-and-forth about your environment.

## Catching unprotected tables in CI (important)

A naive "generate tests, commit them, run them" setup has a dangerous blind spot: a table with **no RLS at all** generates no test, so the suite stays green and the exposure ships silently. `rlsautotest` closes that hole from **two** directions:

**1. The report is a CI gate.** `--report` and `--html` **exit non-zero (1)** when they find a problem: a table that's RLS-off-but-reachable (`anon`/`authenticated` can touch it), a check where a forbidden identity can act, or a **broken/unreadable** table (e.g. a self-referential policy that throws *infinite recursion detected in policy*, locking out every client role). So a single command fails the build:

```bash
rlsautotest --db-url "$DATABASE_URL" --schema public --report   # exits 1 if anything is exposed/leaking
```

Pass `--no-fail` to print the report without failing the pipeline (local or non-blocking use). Exit codes: `0` = clean, `1` = problems found.

**2. A schema-wide guard test.** `--emit` also writes `010-rls-enabled.test.sql`, which asserts that **every table reachable by `anon`/`authenticated` has RLS enabled**. A table shipped without RLS becomes a real `not ok`, so even teams that only run `supabase test db` on the committed files (and never re-run the generator) get a red build:

```
not ok 1 - public.exposed_tbl: RLS must be enabled (table is reachable by anon/authenticated)
```

It's scoped to *reachable* tables, so a genuinely-internal table with no client grant won't raise a false alarm.

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: rls
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  rls:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:16
        env: { POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres }
        ports: ["5432:5432"]
        options: >-
          --health-cmd pg_isready --health-interval 10s --health-timeout 5s --health-retries 5
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with: { python-version: "3.12" }
      - run: pip install rlsautotest
      # apply your migrations into the throwaway DB first, then:
      - name: Verify RLS
        env:
          DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
        run: rlsautotest --db-url "$DATABASE_URL" --schema public --report
```

The build goes red the moment a policy leaks or a reachable table is missing RLS.

## What it's tested on

The `examples/` folder is the runnable test corpus, covering the common and the hard RLS patterns: owner (`auth.uid()`), tenant/JWT-claim, membership (`EXISTS`), array claims (`= ANY`), RBAC functions, recursive policies, session-GUC, permissive + `AS RESTRICTIVE` composition, and role-gated status state machines (multi-policy `UPDATE`). On every commit, CI loads the owner-scoped and the multi-tenant example schemas, generates the suite, and runs it, so the core validation is reproducible rather than a claim. The corpus also includes deliberately broken cases that the tool is required to *catch*: a self-referential policy, and a role-gated state machine with a cross-policy `WITH CHECK` leak (a role can write a status its own policy forbids). It's been exercised against real-world Supabase schemas too, to harden the generator.

## Honest limitations

`rlsautotest` proves your database *enforces what your policies declare*. It cannot know your *intent*: a wrong policy will be faithfully (and greenly) confirmed. It tests the permissions your policies define; commands left with no policy show as `Â·` (implicit deny) and aren't asserted unless you opt in. Policies behind opaque/external functions it can't reason about are reported, not faked.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- A Postgres database. **pgTAP is handled for you.** rlsautotest uses your database's pgTAP if present (Supabase ships it) and otherwise loads a small built-in copy, so there's nothing to install on the server.
- A throwaway/local database holding a copy of your schema + policies. Every command that connects (`--emit`, `--report`, `--html`) probes by seeding rows and running real `SELECT`/`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`, each rolled back, nothing committed, but the statements do run. Point it at a disposable copy, **never production**. (`--describe` and the static `lint`/`snapshot`/`diff` checks only read the catalog.)

## Part of the UnitAutogen family

`rlsautotest` is the free, open-source PostgreSQL member of **UnitAutogen**. We build *automated unit-test generators for databases*: tools that read your schema and generate the tests for you, instead of you hand-writing them. The test frameworks themselves are open source (pgTAP on Postgres, tSQLt on SQL Server); what UnitAutogen adds is the generator that writes the tests (and the data) for them.

The same idea runs deeper on other engines:

- **PostgreSQL**: `rlsautotest` (this project, free) and automated unit-test + branch-coverage generation for PL/pgSQL functions, emitting **pgTAP**.
- **SQL Server**: automated unit-test generation and branch coverage for stored procedures, emitting **tSQLt** (the open-source SQL Server test framework).
- **Oracle, Azure SQL**: in development.

**Coming soon - UnitAutogen for PostgreSQL, Supabase & Neon:**

1. Automated pgTAP test-suite generation and coverage for functions and triggers which is ready for CI.
2. Database security-coverage suite - Every function and trigger exercised under every database role.
3. Automated HIPAA compliance evidence, generated as pgTAP tests.
