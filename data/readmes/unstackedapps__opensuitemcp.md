Source-available **NetSuite MCP client** — chat UI for NetSuite’s AI Connector Service, MCP Standard Tools, Companion prompt library, and SuiteCloud Agent Skills.

Bring your own LLM keys (**Google Gemini**, **Anthropic Claude**, **OpenAI**, or an **OpenAI-compatible** endpoint). Self-host for internal use. Commercial rights reserved by [Unstacked Apps, LLC](https://www.unstackedapps.com/).

**Star this repo** if it helps your NetSuite team — it makes the project discoverable.

**Current release:** [v5.4.0](https://github.com/unstackedapps/opensuitemcp/releases/tag/v5.4.0) · [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

<img src="./docs/screenshot-chat.png" alt="OpenSuiteMCP chat UI" width="100%" />

_Main chat UI._

## What’s in 5.3

- **Agent access** — hand an external AI agent a key and your install's URL and it works in your NetSuite workspace as you, with your permissions and your tool policy
- **Agent-readable skills and personas** — an agent can list and read the instruction packs and specialist playbooks this workspace has enabled, and switch the active NetSuite account
- **Org control** — **Admin → Agent access** turns it on for an organization and can narrow it to named members

## What’s in 5.2

- **Skill invocation modes** — Auto, Slash command, or Off for Oracle, Community, Connected, and Custom skills
- **Richer chat turns** — thinking chips, per-turn usage, and prettier MCP tool output (including SuiteQL)

## What’s in 5.0

- **Organization admin** — Org vs solo install modes, `/setup` bootstrap, centralized LLM providers, NetSuite MCP/OIDC policies, skills, search, personas, and user management
- **Post-install onboarding** — Step-by-step wizard for solo and org users (LLM, MCP, OIDC, search, skills) with optional steps and skip support
- **NetSuite OIDC login** — Separate app-login OAuth from MCP connect; per-account test connection, redirect URI copy fields, and setup guide
- **Per-account MCP UX** — DCR probing, integration setup, and OAuth connect per connection (settings, onboarding, and admin)
- **Cross-platform bootstrap** — Node-based local orchestrator (`bootstrap:local`, `reset:backend`) replaces bash-only setup scripts
- **Personas, skills, and providers** — Persona interview builder; Oracle, Community, Connected, and custom skills; multiple named AI providers per chat
- **BYOLLM** — Your API keys; no shared multi-tenant model account in this app

## Personas

Open **Personas** from the App Portal or the header badge on a new chat. Pick a built-in specialist or **Create my own…** to run the interview builder (guided chat that drafts a custom persona playbook).

Built-in personas ship in `.personas/*.md` in this repo. Custom personas are stored per user in Postgres.

## Skills

Open **Skills** from the App Portal (or the sidebar). Four sources, three invocation modes:

| Source | Default | How it works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Oracle** | Off | Shared pack; Auto / Slash / Off. Core AI Connector instructions stay Auto. |
| **Community** | Off | Shared pack from [opensuitemcp-community-skills](https://github.com/unstackedapps/opensuitemcp-community-skills); Auto / Slash / Off |
| **Connected** | Slash | Paste a public GitHub repo/folder URL; Auto / Slash / Off |
| **Custom** | Auto | Paste/import custom `SKILL.md`; Auto / Slash / Off |

**Auto** is injected for new messages. **Slash** only when you type `/skill-name`. **Off** is never injected. Composer `/` lists Auto and Slash skills. Modes apply to **new** messages, not as a per-thread override.

Shared packs are **not** vendored in git. Sync them with:

```bash
pnpm skills:sync
```

That downloads Oracle’s [agent-skills](https://github.com/oracle/netsuite-suitecloud-sdk/tree/master/packages/agent-skills) into `.data/oracle-skills` (or `ORACLE_SKILLS_DIR`) and Community skills into `.data/community-skills` (or `COMMUNITY_SKILLS_DIR`). Run after setup, on deploy (production entrypoint), and on a **weekly cron**. New upstream skills appear as Off until you set a mode; removed upstream skills are pruned. Optional: `GITHUB_TOKEN` for higher GitHub API limits.

**Connected** examples:

- `https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/tree/main/skills/productivity`
- `owner/repo` shorthand

Public repos only in v1. Synced files live under `.data/connected-skills/<userId>/…`.

_Skills panel — Oracle, Community, Connected, and Custom._

## Prompts

Open **Prompts** for the Companion SuiteApp library (requires NetSuite connected with Companion available). Filter by category, industry, or role; open a template; fill required placeholders; then use it in chat.

## NetSuite MCP tools

With AI Connector + MCP Standard Tools connected, chat can run SuiteQL, records, reports, saved searches, and related MCP tools against your account.

## MCP server (act on behalf of a user)

OpenSuiteMCP can also be an **MCP server**, so an external AI agent works
inside a user's NetSuite workspace as that user — their connected account,
their permissions, their tool policy.

Mint a key under **App Portal → Agent access**:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http opensuitemcp https://your-install.example.com/api/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer osmcp_..."
```

Keys are per user, shown once, and revocable. An agent reaches exactly what you
have enabled in the app — the key adds no gate of its own.
The server URL derives from your install's public address, so self-hosted and
hosted installs each have their own. Full guide: [MCP server](docs/mcp-server.md).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
- Docker ([Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) on macOS/Windows, or Docker Engine on Linux) for local PostgreSQL, Redis, and SearXNG via `pnpm setup:backend`
- **An active NetSuite user who can sign in** — the person who completes first-run setup must have a working NetSuite login today:
  - **Organization:** `OSMCP_ROOT_EMAIL` must be that user’s NetSuite email; they sign in on `/setup` via NetSuite OIDC (recommended) or local password with the same email
  - **Solo:** use NetSuite sign-in on `/login` with an account you can access now (local email/password is optional, but you still need NetSuite for MCP connect)
- A NetSuite account with:
  - [AI Connector Service](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/article_7200233106.html) enabled
  - [MCP Standard Tools](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/article_0902023450.html) SuiteApp
  - [Companion SuiteApp](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/article_9091153093.html) if you want the prompt library
- An LLM API key — **Google Gemini**, **Anthropic Claude**, **OpenAI**, or any **OpenAI-compatible** HTTPS endpoint (custom base URL + key)

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Run automated setup**

   ```bash
   pnpm bootstrap:local
   ```

   Or run the steps manually (`pnpm setup:backend`, then `pnpm skills:sync`, `pnpm db:migrate`, `pnpm dev`).

   `setup:backend` generates secrets, asks **organization vs solo** install mode, and writes:

   - `.env.local` — app / migrate vars (`POSTGRES_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `OSMCP_INSTALL_MODE`, etc.)
   - `docker/.env` — Compose vars (`PROJECT_NAME`, `POSTGRES_PW`, `REDIS_PW`); gitignored

   | Install mode | Set in `.env.local` | First-run experience |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | **Organization** (default prompt) | `OSMCP_INSTALL_MODE=org` and `OSMCP_ROOT_EMAIL` (active NetSuite user email) | `/setup` until org owner exists |
   | **Solo** (consultant / individual) | `OSMCP_INSTALL_MODE=solo` | `/login` — NetSuite sign-in or local email/password |

   For org installs, NetSuite OIDC login is optional during setup (account ID + client ID). You can enter them on `/setup` instead. See [NetSuite OIDC login](docs/netsuite-oidc-login.md). MCP account connect in the App Portal is separate (different OAuth integration and callback).

   The script can start Docker services (PostgreSQL, Redis, SearXNG). If Docker was not running during setup, start Docker Desktop/Engine, then:

   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file docker/.env -f docker/docker-compose.yml -p opensuitemcp up -d
   ```

   Use your project name instead of `opensuitemcp` if you chose a custom name during setup.

   **Fresh reset (local dev):** `pnpm reset:backend` — tears down Docker volumes, removes env files, waits briefly, then runs full bootstrap and starts `dev`. To only tear down without reinstalling: `pnpm teardown:backend`.

3. **Sync Oracle + Community skills** (included in `bootstrap:local`; run manually if you used `setup:backend` alone)

   ```bash
   pnpm skills:sync
   ```

4. **Migrate the database**

   ```bash
   pnpm db:migrate
   ```

5. **Start the dev server**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   Uses webpack by default (Turbopack can fail resolving `@ai-sdk/provider-utils` dynamic imports). Optional: `pnpm dev:turbo` if you want to try Turbopack.

   App: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

6. **First sign-in**

   The installer must be an **active NetSuite user** — locked, inactive, or wrong-email accounts cannot complete OIDC sign-in.

   **Organization install** — open the app; you are redirected to `/setup`.

   - **NetSuite (recommended):** follow [NetSuite OIDC login](docs/netsuite-oidc-login.md), enter account ID and client ID on `/setup`, then sign in with NetSuite. The NetSuite user must be able to log in and their email must match `OSMCP_ROOT_EMAIL`.
   - **Local password (legacy):** use the password form on `/setup` with the same email as `OSMCP_ROOT_EMAIL`.

   After bootstrap you are org **owner**. Open **Admin** from the sidebar (owners and admins) to manage users, providers, NetSuite accounts, and skills (Admin CRUD ships in a later phase; shell is available now).

   **Solo install** — open the app; you land on `/login`. Use **NetSuite** to register OIDC and sign in with an account you can access now, or **Email** for a local account. Full NetSuite steps: [NetSuite OIDC login](docs/netsuite-oidc-login.md).

7. **Configure in the App Portal** (sidebar icons open the same portal)

   - **AI Provider** — Add Google, Anthropic, OpenAI, or a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint and API key (stored encrypted)
   - **NetSuite** — Add an account ID, complete Integration / DCR setup, connect
   - **Personas** — Pick a built-in specialist or create a custom persona
   - **Skills** — Enable Oracle, Community, and/or custom skills; connect GitHub packs for `/` slash skills
   - **Prompts** — Browse Companion templates when NetSuite + Companion are available

## Install environment variables

Written by `pnpm setup:backend` (or set manually for production):

| Variable | Org | Solo | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `OSMCP_INSTALL_MODE` | `org` | `solo` | Locks first-run to `/setup` or `/login` |
| `OSMCP_ROOT_EMAIL` | Required | — | Active NetSuite user email; only this user can become org owner on `/setup` |
| `OSMCP_NS_ACCOUNT_ID` | Optional | Optional | NetSuite account for OIDC app login |
| `OSMCP_NS_OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | Optional | Optional | OIDC integration client ID for app login |
| `OSMCP_ENABLE_GUEST` | — | — | Set `true` only for demo/e2e; guest auto-login is off by default |

Upgrading an existing install with users already in the database: see [docs/org-admin-upgrade.md](docs/org-admin-upgrade.md).

## NetSuite setup (short)

1. In NetSuite, ensure AI Connector and the MCP Standard Tools SuiteApp are available for your account.
2. In OpenSuiteMCP → **NetSuite**, add your account ID (e.g. `1234567` or `1234567-sb1`).
3. Follow the in-app Integration instructions (admin once per account), then **Connect** (MCP OAuth — scope **mcp**, callback `/api/netsuite/callback`).
4. Confirm the header status chip shows connected before running SuiteQL / record tools.

**App login vs MCP connect:** [NetSuite OIDC login](docs/netsuite-oidc-login.md) is a separate integration (OIDC Provider, callback `/api/auth/netsuite/callback`). MCP connect in the portal uses the MCP integration only (callback `/api/netsuite/callback`).

## Usage limits (optional)

Self-host defaults are generous. Override with env vars if needed:

| Variable | Default (OSS) | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MAX_MESSAGES_PER_DAY_REGULAR` | `100` | Signed-in user messages / 24h |
| `MAX_MESSAGES_PER_DAY_GUEST` | `20` | Guest messages / 24h (only if `OSMCP_ENABLE_GUEST=true`) |
| `CHAT_BURST_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` | unset / `0` (off) | Redis burst cap; fail-open if Redis is down |
| `MCP_CALL_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` | unset / `0` (off) | Per-API-key MCP tool calls / minute; fail-open if Redis is down |

Guest auto-login is **disabled** unless `OSMCP_ENABLE_GUEST=true`. Normal self-host and org installs require sign-in.
