Source-available **NetSuite MCP client** — chat UI for NetSuite’s AI Connector Service, MCP Standard Tools, Companion prompt library, and SuiteCloud Agent Skills.

Bring your own LLM keys (**Google Gemini**, **Anthropic Claude**, **OpenAI**, or an **OpenAI-compatible** endpoint). Self-host for internal use. Commercial rights reserved by [Unstacked Apps, LLC](https://www.unstackedapps.com/).

**Current release:** [v5.9.0](https://github.com/unstackedapps/opensuitemcp/releases/tag/v5.9.0) · [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

<img src="./docs/screenshot-chat.png" alt="OpenSuiteMCP chat UI" width="100%" />

_Main chat UI._

## What’s in 5.9

- **An instance reports its health to whoever operates it** — set `OSMCP_INSTANCE_REPORT_TOKEN`, and `GET /api/instance/report` answers that bearer token with the version, usage counts, NetSuite accounts that need connecting again, and the 50 most recent server errors. Counts only: no message text, emails or names. See [Instance report](docs/instance-report.md)

Earlier releases are in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Personas

Open **Personas** from the App Portal or the header badge on a new chat. Pick a built-in specialist or **Create my own…** to run the interview builder (guided chat that drafts a custom persona playbook).

Built-in personas ship in `.personas/*.md` in this repo. Custom personas are stored per user in Postgres.

Pair skills to a persona on the **Skills** tab of its editor — built-in personas included, where the tab is the only part you can change. A paired skill applies whenever that persona is the one working, even when its mode is **Slash command**.

**Clone** copies a persona, including the skills it carries.

## Skills

Open **Skills** from the App Portal (or the sidebar). Four sources, three invocation modes:

| Source | Default | How it works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Oracle** | Disabled | Shared pack; Auto / Slash command / Disabled. Core AI Connector instructions stay Auto. |
| **Community** | Disabled | Shared pack from [opensuitemcp-community-skills](https://github.com/unstackedapps/opensuitemcp-community-skills); Auto / Slash command / Disabled |
| **Connected** | Slash command | Paste a public GitHub repo/folder URL; Auto / Slash command / Disabled |
| **Custom** | Auto | Paste/import custom `SKILL.md`; Auto / Slash command / Disabled |

**Auto** is injected into every new message. **Slash command** is injected when you type `/skill-name`. Composer `/` lists Auto and Slash command skills. A mode change applies to every message you send after it, in every thread.

A skill written by a connected agent is credited to the agent and starts as **Slash command**, so it applies when you invoke it or when a persona carrying it is working. A skill you add yourself starts as **Auto**.

**Clone** on a custom skill row copies it into one you own, including a skill your organization published. Over MCP, `osmcp_clone_skill` copies any of the four sources. **Import .md or .zip** in the skill editor loads a `SKILL.md` and the files beside it; the download button on a custom row returns the folder as a `.zip`.

A skill can carry reference files beside its `SKILL.md`, the way Oracle and Community packs do. `SKILL.md` holds up to 32,000 characters. Beside it, up to 32 reference files, 64,000 characters each and 256,000 across them.

Shared packs are **not** vendored in git. Sync them with:

```bash
pnpm skills:sync
```

That downloads Oracle’s [agent-skills](https://github.com/oracle/netsuite-suitecloud-sdk/tree/master/packages/agent-skills) into `.data/oracle-skills` (or `ORACLE_SKILLS_DIR`) and Community skills into `.data/community-skills` (or `COMMUNITY_SKILLS_DIR`). Run after setup, on deploy (production entrypoint), and on a **weekly cron**. New upstream skills appear as Off until you set a mode; removed upstream skills are pruned. Optional: `GITHUB_TOKEN` for higher GitHub API limits.

**Connected** examples:

- `https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/tree/main/skills/productivity`
- `owner/repo` shorthand

Public repos only. Synced files live under `.data/connected-skills/<userId>/<sourceId>/` (or `CONNECTED_SKILLS_DIR`).

## Prompts

Open **Prompts** for the Companion SuiteApp library (requires NetSuite connected with Companion available). Filter by category, industry, or role; open a template; fill required placeholders; then use it in chat.

## NetSuite MCP tools

With AI Connector + MCP Standard Tools connected, chat can run SuiteQL, records, reports, saved searches, and related MCP tools against your account.

## MCP server (act on behalf of a user)

OpenSuiteMCP can also be an **MCP server**, so an external AI agent works
inside a user's NetSuite workspace as that user — their connected account,
their permissions, their tool policy.

Create the app under **App Portal → Agent apps → New app**, choosing how it
connects:

- **OAuth 2.1** — every install is its own OAuth 2.1 authorization server. A client
  that supports DCR registers itself from the URL alone; for one that does not,
  tick **Connector needs a client ID and secret** and paste its callback URL.
  It sends you here to approve the app, then refreshes its own token.
- **Bearer auth** — a token in a header, for an app with no person behind it, a
  client with no OAuth support, or an install that is not on HTTPS.

Either way the app reaches what you have enabled in OpenSuiteMCP, and both appear
in one list you can rename, re-role and revoke. The server URL derives from your
install's public address, so self-hosted, sandbox and hosted installs each have
their own.

A connected agent reads and writes the workspace's skills: `osmcp_create_skill`,
`osmcp_clone_skill`, `osmcp_update_skill`, `osmcp_delete_skill`,
`osmcp_read_skill_file` and `osmcp_pair_skills`, alongside the persona and chat
tools. An agent may revise or delete only agent-authored skills; anything else it
clones first.

The server answers `prompts/list` and `prompts/get` as well as `tools/*`. Four
built-ins ship — **Start a NetSuite task**, **Choose the right specialist**,
**Record this session in OpenSuiteMCP**, **Save what you learned as a skill** —
alongside every prompt your NetSuite Companion library publishes, named
`netsuite_…`. Claude Desktop does not list them today.

The exact thing to paste, per client, is in
[Connect an agent](docs/connect-an-agent.md). Protocol and tool reference:
[MCP server](docs/mcp-server.md).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
- Docker ([Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) on macOS/Windows, or Docker Engine on Linux) for local PostgreSQL, Redis, and SearXNG via `pnpm setup:backend`
- **An active NetSuite user who can sign in** — the person who completes first-run setup must have a working NetSuite login today:
  - **Organization:** `OSMCP_ROOT_EMAIL` must be that user’s NetSuite email; they sign in on `/setup` via NetSuite OIDC (recommended) or local password with the same email
  - **Solo:** use NetSuite sign-in on `/login` with an account you can access now (local email/password is optional, but you still need NetSuite for MCP connect)
- A NetSuite account with:
  - [AI Connector Service](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/article_7200233106.html) enabled
  - [MCP Standard Tools](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/article_0902023450.html) SuiteApp
  - [Companion SuiteApp](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/article_9091153093.html) if you want the prompt library
- An LLM API key — **Google Gemini**, **Anthropic Claude**, **OpenAI**, or any **OpenAI-compatible** HTTPS endpoint (custom base URL + key)

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Run automated setup**

   ```bash
   pnpm bootstrap:local
   ```

   Or run the steps manually (`pnpm setup:backend`, then `pnpm skills:sync`, `pnpm db:migrate`, `pnpm dev`).

   `setup:backend` generates secrets, asks **organization vs solo** install mode, and writes:

   - `.env.local` — app / migrate vars (`POSTGRES_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `OSMCP_INSTALL_MODE`, etc.)
   - `docker/.env` — Compose vars (`PROJECT_NAME`, `POSTGRES_PW`, `REDIS_PW`); gitignored

   | Install mode | Set in `.env.local` | First-run experience |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | **Organization** (default prompt) | `OSMCP_INSTALL_MODE=org` and `OSMCP_ROOT_EMAIL` (active NetSuite user email) | `/setup` until org owner exists |
   | **Solo** (consultant / individual) | `OSMCP_INSTALL_MODE=solo` | `/login` — NetSuite sign-in or local email/password |

   For org installs, NetSuite OIDC login is optional during setup (account ID + client ID). You can enter them on `/setup` instead. See [NetSuite OIDC login](docs/netsuite-oidc-login.md). MCP account connect in the App Portal is separate (different OAuth integration and callback).

   The script can start Docker services (PostgreSQL, Redis, SearXNG). If Docker was not running during setup, start Docker Desktop/Engine, then:

   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file docker/.env -f docker/docker-compose.yml -p opensuitemcp up -d
   ```

   Use your project name instead of `opensuitemcp` if you chose a custom name during setup.

   **Fresh reset (local dev):** `pnpm reset:backend` — tears down Docker volumes, removes env files, waits briefly, then runs full bootstrap and starts `dev`. To only tear down without reinstalling: `pnpm teardown:backend`.

3. **Sync Oracle + Community skills** (included in `bootstrap:local`; run manually if you used `setup:backend` alone)

   ```bash
   pnpm skills:sync
   ```

4. **Migrate the database**

   ```bash
   pnpm db:migrate
   ```

5. **Start the dev server**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   Uses webpack (Turbopack can fail resolving `@ai-sdk/provider-utils` dynamic imports). `pnpm dev:turbo` runs Turbopack.

   App: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

6. **First sign-in**

   **Organization install** — open the app; you are redirected to `/setup`.

   - **NetSuite (recommended):** follow [NetSuite OIDC login](docs/netsuite-oidc-login.md), enter account ID and client ID on `/setup`, then sign in with NetSuite. The NetSuite user must be able to log in and their email must match `OSMCP_ROOT_EMAIL`.
   - **Local password (legacy):** use the password form on `/setup` with the same email as `OSMCP_ROOT_EMAIL`.

   After bootstrap you are org **owner**. Open **Admin** from the sidebar (owners and admins) for **Users**, **LLM Providers**, **Web Search**, **NetSuite**, **Skills**, **Personas** and **Agent apps**.

   **Solo install** — open the app; you land on `/login`. Use **NetSuite** to register OIDC and sign in with an account you can access now, or **Email** for a local account. Full NetSuite steps: [NetSuite OIDC login](docs/netsuite-oidc-login.md).

7. **Configure in the App Portal**

   - **AI Provider** — Add Google, Anthropic, OpenAI, or a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint and API key (stored encrypted)
   - **NetSuite** — Add an account ID, complete Integration / DCR setup, connect
   - **Personas** — Pick a built-in specialist or create a custom persona
   - **Skills** — Enable Oracle, Community, Connected and custom skills; connect a GitHub repo, or **Import .md or .zip**. Each skill is **Auto**, **Slash command** or **Disabled**
   - **Prompts** — Browse Companion templates when NetSuite + Companion are available

## Install environment variables

Written by `pnpm setup:backend` (or set manually for production):

| Variable | Org | Solo | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `OSMCP_INSTALL_MODE` | `org` | `solo` | Locks first-run to `/setup` or `/login` |
| `OSMCP_ROOT_EMAIL` | Required | — | Active NetSuite user email; only this user can become org owner on `/setup` |
| `OSMCP_NS_ACCOUNT_ID` | Optional | Optional | NetSuite account for OIDC app login |
| `OSMCP_NS_OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | Optional | Optional | OIDC integration client ID for app login |
| `OSMCP_ENABLE_GUEST` | — | — | Set `true` for guest auto-login in demo/e2e |
| `OSMCP_INSTANCE_REPORT_TOKEN` | Optional | Optional | Bearer token of 32+ characters that turns on `/api/instance/report`; see [Instance report](docs/instance-report.md) |

Upgrading an existing install with users already in the database: see [docs/org-admin-upgrade.md](docs/org-admin-upgrade.md).

## NetSuite setup (short)

1. In NetSuite, ensure AI Connector and the MCP Standard Tools SuiteApp are available for your account.
2. In OpenSuiteMCP → **NetSuite**, add your account ID (e.g. `1234567` or `1234567-sb1`).
3. Follow the in-app Integration instructions (admin once per account), then **Connect** (MCP OAuth — scope **mcp**, callback `/api/netsuite/callback`).
4. Confirm the header status chip shows connected before running SuiteQL / record tools.

**App login vs MCP connect:** [NetSuite OIDC login](docs/netsuite-oidc-login.md) is a separate integration (OIDC Provider, callback `/api/auth/netsuite/callback`). MCP connect in the portal uses the MCP integration only (callback `/api/netsuite/callback`).
