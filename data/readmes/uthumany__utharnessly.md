      U T H A R N E S S
        AGENT TERMINAL
```

**Utharness** is a local-first autonomous AI agent terminal. It combines a native Rust runtime, SQLite persistence, a conservative SAFE execution boundary, a scriptable CLI, and a reference-matched React/Ink terminal interface. The project is designed to be inspectable, reproducible, and useful both offline and with an explicitly configured provider.

> **Current status:** the repository is public and ships the working offline-first runtime, native CLI, real-time OpenAI-compatible provider streaming, bounded autonomous inspection path, persistent SQLite journal, and bundled TypeScript/Ink TUI. Broader autonomous write tools, messaging transports, scheduling, and native packages for every operating system remain subsequent milestones.

## Installation methods

The copyable installation entrypoint is [`INSTALLATION.md`](./INSTALLATION.md). It includes npm, npx, pnpm, pnpx, Bun, PyPI, pipx, uv, curl, PowerShell, Git source builds, runtime managers, and an explicit matrix for unavailable package channels. The package source manifests are [`packages/utharnessly-npm`](./packages/utharnessly-npm) and [`python/utharnessly`](./python/utharnessly).

```bash
# npm
npm install --global utharnessly
utharness --version
```

```bash
# npx
npx --yes utharnessly --help

```

```bash
# PyPI
python -m pip install utharnessly
utharness --version
```

```bash
# Linux/macOS shell installer
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uthumany/utharnessly/main/packaging/install.sh | bash
```

## Termux installation

A native Termux package is built under [`packages/utharness`](./packages/utharness) and is published through the signed UTHARNESS APT repository. The current release line provides v0.2.24 packages and does not require root:

```bash
pkg update
pkg install curl
curl -fsSL https://uthumany.github.io/utharnessly/termux/install.sh | bash
pkg update
pkg install utharness
utharness setup
utharness
```

`utharness setup` opens a responsive keyboard-driven wizard after a real environment and dependency scan. It offers Quick, Full, Developer, Local AI, Custom Provider, Blank Slate, and Import modes; accepts masked API-key input over stdin; discovers and validates provider models; and writes non-secret project settings to `utharness.json`. Setup-managed secrets are stored separately in `~/.utharness/secrets.env` with private permissions and are never printed or written to project configuration. See [`docs/setup.md`](./docs/setup.md) for the complete flow. For automation and CI, the same canonical Rust path is available without a TUI:

```bash
utharness setup --non-interactive --mode full --provider ollama \
  --model qwen2.5-coder:7b \
  --tools workspace_read,git_inspection,skills,memory \
  --skip-validation
```

The package installs only under `$PREFIX/bin/utharness`, `$PREFIX/lib/utharness`, and `$PREFIX/share/utharness`. User data remains under `~/.config/utharness`, `~/.local/share/utharness`, and `~/.cache/utharness`. Package-managed updates must use:

```bash
pkg update
pkg upgrade utharness
```

Termux diagnostics and optional integrations are available through:

```bash
utharness termux info
utharness termux doctor
utharness termux permissions
utharness termux keys install
utharness termux storage enable
utharness termux api
```

The signed Termux repository is published with each tagged release. The package and repository are built and cryptographically verified in CI and from the published Pages endpoints; physical-device, Android-version-specific, soft-keyboard, and real Termux:API testing still require an actual Android/Termux environment. See [`termux/README.md`](./termux/README.md) for package-builder details.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uthumany/utharnessly.git
cd utharnessly

# Build the native runtime and the TypeScript/Ink terminal UI
cargo build --release
pnpm --dir ui install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --dir ui build

# Initialize the current workspace and inspect it
./target/release/utharness init
./target/release/utharness doctor

# Open the persistent terminal UI
./target/release/utharness tui

# Or configure a live gateway and stream a response
export UTHARNESS_PROVIDER=ollama
export UTHARNESS_MODEL=qwen2.5-coder:7b
./target/release/utharness providers test
./target/release/utharness chat "Summarize this workspace"
```

The native binary remains named `utharness` for CLI compatibility. The repository and distribution identity is **utharnessly**. The default database is `~/.local/share/utharness/utharness.db`; use `UTHARNESS_HOME` or `UTHARNESS_DB` for isolated environments.

## Screenshots

The following captures were generated from real isolated CLI and PTY runs. They are included as documentation assets rather than mockups.

The interactive capture matrix covers `20`, `30`, `40`, `60`, `80`, `100`, `120`, `160`, and `200` columns, including short-height layouts. The UI keeps its banner, prompt, and status bar fixed while the conversation viewport changes with terminal size.

## Capabilities

| Capability | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Native CLI | Clap commands for `init`, `chat`, `run`, `tui`, `autonomous`, `doctor`, `config`, `sessions`, `memory`, `checkpoint`, `skills`, `providers`, `agents`, and `tools`. |
| SQLite persistence | Bundled SQLite with foreign keys, WAL mode, migrations, sessions, messages, tasks, checkpoints, events, memories, FTS5 search, tool calls, permission decisions, and audit records. |
| AI gateway | Real-time SSE token streaming and health checks for OpenRouter, OpenAI, Groq, Together, DeepSeek, Fireworks, NVIDIA NIM, Ollama, and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints. Keys come from the environment or the setup-managed private secrets file and never enter project configuration. |
| Offline operation | Deterministic offline planner responses persist user and assistant messages without credentials. |
| Bounded autonomy | Provider-neutral JSON planning with a strict SAFE read-only allowlist, step limits, workspace scoping, redaction, and persisted events. |
| Safety | SAFE default, explicit approval for shell execution, destructive-command denial, workspace path validation, and secret redaction. |
| Ink terminal UI | Full-screen React/Ink application with fixed branding, left-aligned message rows, tool cards, streaming presentation, command palette, prompt suggestions, scrolling, resize handling, spinners, and limited-color fallbacks. |
| Diagnostics | Database integrity, workspace, storage, shell, provider, permissions, skills, and clean-runtime checks. |
| Cross-platform source | Rust and Node 22 source builds for Linux, macOS, Windows, WSL, SSH, tmux, FreeBSD, and compatible Unix-like environments. |

### Chat identity and activity feedback

When asked who developed it, UTHARNESS identifies itself as developed by **"UTHUMAN & CO" Center for AI (UCAI)**, part of Uthuman Inc Data & AI, and names `𓁷 Uthuman M`, `𓁷 Shafiq N`, and `𓁷 Alid K` as developers.

Native chat and the Ink UI use a white `𓁬` marker for **UTHARNESS** and a blue `𓁶` marker for **YOU**. `UTHARNESS_ASCII=1`, `UTHARNESS_ICONS=ascii`, `NO_COLOR`, and dumb terminals retain readable ASCII/monochrome fallbacks. Terminal cells do not support pixel-sized glyphs, so markers adapt to the active terminal font and cell geometry.

While a response is active, the UI displays a 15-stage, 0–100 request-pipeline bar: Understanding → Decomposing → Retrieving → Grounding → Planning → Reasoning → Routing → Executing → Observing → Evaluating → Synthesizing → Verifying → Refining → Finalizing → Responding. Its percentage covers local, observable lifecycle events only; it holds during remote generation rather than inventing token progress or an ETA.

Desktop control is intentionally opt-in, like shell execution:

```bash
utharness desktop doctor                        # backends, install hints, policy
utharness desktop screenshot --output s.png     # denied without --allow
utharness desktop screenshot --output s.png --allow
echo hello | utharness desktop type --allow     # stdin only, never argv
```

Shell execution is intentionally opt-in:

```bash
utharness run --command "cargo test"           # denied in SAFE mode
utharness run --command "cargo test" --allow    # explicit approval path
```

Feature icons use Egyptian hieroglyph identities (white by convention) with
bracketed ASCII fallbacks when `NO_COLOR=1`, `TERM=dumb`, or `UTHARNESS_ASCII=1`
is set — 𓂀 computer use, 𓋹 self-improvement, 𓏞 memory, 𓉐 build, 𓄣 test, 𓌙 fix.
The interactive setup animates these during the environment scan (4 FPS, frozen
under `UTHARNESS_REDUCED_MOTION=1`), and `utharness update` draws a matching
gradient progress bar with byte counts and ETA on stderr.

Conversation identity markers are white `𓁬 UTHARNESS` and blue `𓁶 YOU`
(` [agent]` and `[you]` in ASCII mode). Live chats also show a 15-stage request
pipeline from Understanding through Responding. Its 0–100 value tracks only
observable local lifecycle events; remote model token progress and ETA are not
known and are never fabricated.

Live model setup, provider defaults, local endpoints, and the credential-safety contract are documented in [`docs/providers.md`](./docs/providers.md).

Provider and model resolution order is explicit: `UTHARNESS_PROVIDER`/`UTHARNESS_MODEL`
environment variables win, then the workspace `utharness.json`, then the global
`~/.utharness/config.yaml` written by every setup, and finally provider
autodetect from exported keys. Saving a setup therefore sticks everywhere —
opening utharness in another directory (or the TUI) reuses the saved choice
instead of falling back to whichever key autodetect finds first.

## Reference-matched terminal UI

The interactive UI under [`ui/`](./ui) is a replacement for the former Rust TUI, not an additional disconnected mock. The Rust launcher starts `ui/dist/index.js` through Node 22 and falls back to `pnpm --dir ui dev` when a source checkout has not built the bundle. Set `UTHARNESS_UI_ENTRY` to use a custom bundle and `UTHARNESS_RUNTIME_BIN` to override the runtime executable used by the UI adapter.

The design follows one shared left-aligned grid. The colored ASCII banner remains fixed on every display, including compact and short-height terminals. The conversation viewport contains UTHARNESS/YOU rows, timestamps, streaming token updates, running and completed tool cards, success/error/approval states, and result summaries. The cyan prompt supports slash suggestions, `@file`, `@folder`, `@url`, `@agent`, `@skill`, and `@memory` references, plus command history.

Banner breakpoints are `<40` minimal, `40–59` compact, `60–89` wrapped, `90–119` compressed, and `120+` full. The palette selects TrueColor, ANSI 256, ANSI 16, or monochrome behavior from `COLORTERM`, `TERM`, `UTHARNESS_COLOR`, `UTHARNESS_ASCII`, and `NO_COLOR`. Terminal resize events redraw the fixed region without appending duplicate banners; PageUp/PageDown scroll the conversation, mouse-wheel escape sequences adjust the viewport, and `UTHARNESS_REDUCED_MOTION=1` reduces animation.

Use `utharness --no-banner`, `utharness --banner=full`, `utharness --banner=compact`, or `utharness --banner=minimal` for a single run. Persistent settings use `utharness config set ui.banner true|false`, `utharness config set ui.banner_mode full|compact|minimal`, and `utharness config set ui.icons nerd|unicode|ascii`. Non-interactive and redirected CLI output omits the banner automatically.

## Installation

The complete installation matrix, including update, uninstall, clean reinstall, PATH, dependency, troubleshooting, operating-system, and terminal-environment guidance is in [`docs/installation.md`](./docs/installation.md). It deliberately distinguishes valid source or release workflows from channels that do not yet publish an utharnessly package.

### Release archive installer

For a published POSIX release archive:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uthumany/utharnessly/main/packaging/install.sh | bash
utharness
```

For Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uthumany/utharnessly/main/packaging/install.ps1 | iex
utharness
```

When a matching release archive is unavailable, these installers stop and print the Git source-build path instead of installing an unverified artifact.

### npm and PyPI launchers

The published npm and PyPI launchers download the matching native release archive on first use, verify its SHA-256 checksum, cache the bundled runtime/UI, and forward arguments to `utharness`.

```bash
# npm / npx / pnpm / pnpx
npm install --global utharnessly
utharness --help
npx --yes utharnessly --version
pnpm add --global utharnessly
pnpx utharnessly

# PyPI / pipx / uv / uvx
python -m pip install utharnessly
utharnessly --version
pipx install utharnessly
uv tool install utharnessly
uvx utharnessly --help
```

Both registry launchers currently support Linux x64, macOS x64/arm64, and Windows x64 release artifacts. Use `utharnessly update` to clear and redownload the cached runtime. Use `utharnessly uninstall` to print the package-manager and cache-removal commands. The complete package-manager, source, platform, terminal, compatibility, and troubleshooting matrix is in [`docs/installation.md`](./docs/installation.md).

## Skill Engine

UTHARNESS includes an indexed Skill Registry for modular agent capabilities. It supports normalized manifests, FTS search, bounded synchronization from the [VoltAgent catalog](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-agent-skills) and [skills.sh](https://www.skills.sh/), lazy installation, checksum validation, health checks, quarantine, local manifest import, and automatic skill recommendations in bounded autonomous planning. External skills are never executed merely because they appear in a catalog; review-gated adapters and explicit permissions are required.

See [`docs/skills.md`](./docs/skills.md) for the schema, lifecycle, source adapter behavior, scaling model, safety boundaries, and copyable commands. The registry is intentionally metadata-first: it can index 100,000-plus records without installing their dependency trees locally.

## Architecture

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `utharness-core` | Domain IDs, records, state machines, permission types, provider metadata, and diagnostic models. |
| `utharness-storage` | SQLite policy, embedded migrations, repositories, FTS5 memory search, and persistence tests. |
| `utharness-security` | Permission modes, workspace validation, shell policy, and secret redaction. |
| `utharness-cli` | Clap commands, offline behavior, bounded autonomous execution, tool execution, diagnostics, and the Rust-to-Ink launcher bridge. |
| `utharness-provider` | OpenRouter/OpenAI-compatible HTTP client with typed JSON responses and timeout/error handling. |
| `ui/` | React/Ink terminal UI, runtime metadata adapter, package scripts, tests, and PTY screenshot harness. |

## Development

```bash
# Native runtime
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo build --release

# TypeScript/Ink UI
pnpm --dir ui install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --dir ui typecheck
pnpm --dir ui test
pnpm --dir ui build
pnpm --dir ui screenshots
```

The public CI matrix runs Rust formatting, Clippy, tests, release compilation, and UI typechecking/build checks on supported hosted operating systems. Security automation runs dependency auditing and repository secret-pattern checks. Release automation packages the native binary together with the UI bundle and publishes SHA-256 checksums.

## Security and credentials

Provider credentials are never committed or persisted by the runtime. Supply provider secrets through environment variables or an external secret manager. The autonomous command accepts a model-generated plan but executes only SAFE read-only tools such as directory listing, file reads, Git status, and Git diff; it limits steps, scopes paths to the workspace, redacts output, and records events.

## Contributing

Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md), run the complete native and UI validation commands, and keep package-manager lockfiles in sync. Do not add a package-manager integration merely to claim compatibility: every installation channel must have a reproducible implementation and a documented dependency check.
