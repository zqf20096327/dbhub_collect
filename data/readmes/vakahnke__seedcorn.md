**Plan it. Run it. Adjust as you go. Share the plan that worked.**

*Seedcorn* is the grain a farmer keeps back from this harvest to plant the next one.
That is what a plan that worked is.

*Formerly "Timeline": same project, same license, same code; the old links redirect here.*

Seedcorn is a self-hosted project planner for the person who has to get something
big done, often for the first time: a product launch, a fundraise, an office move,
a hiring push, a first marathon.

You work out the steps and put them on a timeline you can actually grab. Then you run
the project from it, and the plan changes as you learn: you move dates, add what you
missed, and drop what turned out not to matter. A plan that changes is a plan that is
being used.

When the work is done, what you have is the plan that actually got you there. Save it
as a template and share it with your team, and the next launch, the next round, or the
next person starts from a route that is known to work instead of a blank page. A shared
plan carries its track record: how many projects ran it, how they finished, and what
they cost.

The timeline is drawn on canvas, so dragging, zooming, dependency arrows and the
critical path stay smooth with hundreds of events on screen, including on a phone.
When leadership asks where the project stands, one click turns the same schedule into
a one-page status report you can print, save as a PDF, or download as a fully
editable PowerPoint slide.

Free and open source under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE): use it, modify it, and redistribute
it, including commercially. Every project is private to the people you invite, with four roles from
viewer to owner.

## Templates: the plan that worked

Most projects are not new. They are the second product launch, the fourth hire, the
annual conference. But the plan from last time lives in someone's head, a stale
document, or a spreadsheet nobody trusts, so every run starts over.

Seedcorn treats a finished project as the most valuable thing you own. Any project
can be saved as a template in one step. It keeps the tracks, the events, their
durations and dependencies, the notes, which events are key milestones, and the to-do
list inside each event. It forgets what belonged to that one run: the dates, the
progress, and who did what. Start a new project from it, pick the day it begins, and
every event lands in the right place with its dependencies intact, at zero percent,
ready to go. Then you adjust it for this run, do the work, and save it again if you
learned something.

Over time a team builds up a library of plans that are known to work. A new hire
running their first launch does not need to know how; they need the template from
the last one and a start date.

### The template library

A saved template starts out private. When it is worth passing on, share it: with the
teams you choose, or with everyone on your server. The **Templates** page is where
people find it.

![The template library](docs/images/template-library.png)

- **See the plan before you use it.** Every template has a page with its tracks,
  events, dependencies and key milestones drawn out, plus what it assumes.
- **A track record, not just likes.** Each project remembers the template it came
  from, so a template can show how many projects were started from it, how many
  finished, and, once three have finished, how they ran against the plan:
  "typically runs 7% long". Totals only; it never shows which projects or whose,
  and an owner can keep a confidential project out of it.
- **What it cost and whether it worked.** When a project that came from a template is
  finished, its owner can close it out in a minute: how the plan worked, what it cost in
  money or person-days, and what they learned. The template then says "worked in 9 of 11
  closed-out runs" and "typically costs about $14,000". Cost is shown carefully: a typical
  figure only, and nothing until enough runs have answered
  ([the rules](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#the-template-library)).
- **Lessons learned, in the words of the people who ran it.** "Worked in 9 of 11" is half the
  story. Closing out asks a question that fits the answer ("What went wrong? When would you not use
  this plan?"), and the lesson goes straight onto the template's page, signed or anonymous, with
  how that run went. The plan's owner adds notes of their own, and the list is shown again when the
  next person starts from the plan.
- **Vote and comment.** One upvote each, and a comment thread for what worked and
  what to change. The built-in plans take votes and comments too.
- **Make your own copy** of any template to adapt, and it remembers where it came from.
- **Sharing is a review, not a switch.** A template is cut from a real project, so
  before it leaves your hands you are shown everything other people would get, and you
  choose what to leave out ([how sharing works](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#the-template-library)).

![A template's page: the plan, its track record, and the lessons learned by the people who ran it](docs/images/template-page.png)

An operator can limit sharing to teams, or switch it off, with `TEMPLATE_LIBRARY`.
Still to come: handing a template to another server as a file, and a community
gallery ([design](docs/design/template-library.md)).

Seedcorn ships with built-in plans so you can see the idea before you have a
library of your own:

- **Business:** Startup MVP: Idea to Launch, Seed Fundraising Round, Customer
  Discovery Sprint, Go-to-Market Launch, Hire a Key Role, Quarterly OKR Cycle,
  Incorporate & Set Up the Company
- **Work:** Two-Week Sprint, Product Launch, Event Plan, Custom Shop Build
- **Hobby:** Homebrew a Batch of Ale, Backyard Raised-Bed Garden, First Marathon,
  Solid-Wood Dining Table Build, Record & Release a Song, Write Your First Novel,
  Frame-Off Classic Car Restore, Hand-Knit Sweater, Open Water Diver Certification,
  Build a Steel-String Acoustic

The hobby plans are there on purpose: the tool is for anyone who has to do a big
thing well, and a marathon has dependencies too.

![The template picker](docs/images/templates.png)

## The status report: your schedule as a leadership slide

Most project managers rebuild the same slide by hand every week or two: copy the
dates into PowerPoint, pick a color, and hope the numbers still match the plan.
Seedcorn writes that page from the schedule itself. Click **Status report** in a
project's toolbar and it opens already filled in.

![The status report print tool: the page on the right, what it shows on the left](docs/images/status-report-tool.png)

- **A status you can defend.** On track, At risk, or Off track is derived by rule
  from the forecast finish against your committed date, missed milestones, and
  blocked work on the critical path. The rule that fired is printed in the
  footer. You can overrule it, but only with a reason, and the reason prints too.
- **Written for the reader.** A one-sentence headline drafted from the numbers, a
  path to green, the one decision you need and who it is from, five numbers each
  shown against a reference, a simplified timeline with your key milestones, what
  finished, what is next, and the top risks.
- **Edited where you print.** Click any text on the page to reword it. Switch
  blocks on and off, add your own numbers and text blocks, hide tracks, and pick
  the milestones for this audience. If the page gets too full it tells you what
  to cut; it never shrinks the type.
- **A real PowerPoint, not a picture.** **Download PowerPoint** produces a `.pptx`
  made of native text boxes, a grouped timeline drawn from shapes, and a real
  table. Everything stays editable, and pasting the slide into your own deck picks
  up that deck's fonts.
- **Or a PDF.** Print a single vector page as a 16:9 slide, or as a portrait
  handout on Letter or A4 that adds a milestone table.
- **History.** Save a dated copy. The next report starts from its shape and shows
  whether the status moved since last time.
- **Plan changes, only when you want them shown.** Optionally freeze an approved
  plan as a baseline and, per report, show what changed against it, what moved
  since the last report, and a milestone trend chart. All of it is off by default.
- **Your own limits.** Each project sets how late counts as At risk or Off track.
- **Built on an API.** The page reads one versioned, documented endpoint, so
  scripts and other tools can consume the same facts.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/status-report-handout.png" width="520" alt="The portrait handout with the optional baseline table and milestone trend chart switched on"></p>

### Optional: showing how the plan has changed

Plans should change. Keeping a plan current and pivoting in real time is healthy,
and most status reports have no reason to dwell on it. So by default the report
shows only where the project stands today.

Some audiences do need the history: a sponsor who approved specific dates, a
contract milestone, a review of why a launch moved. For those cases you can take a
**baseline**, a frozen copy of every event's dates at the moment the plan was
approved, and choose report by report whether to show changes against it.

1. Open **Status report** and, in the left panel, open **Baseline and limits**.
2. Name it, for example "Approved plan", and click **Set baseline**. Nothing on any
   report changes.
3. On a report that should show it, tick **Show changes against the baseline**.

That report then marks each track and milestone that moved ("Oct 6 (+3d)") and, on
the handout, lists baseline date, forecast date, and the difference. Two more
opt-in items sit beside it: a drafted **what moved since last report** line, and a
**milestone trend chart** on the handout. Re-baseline whenever new dates are
agreed; old baselines are kept. The same panel holds the project's **limits** for
the status rule: how late counts as Off track.

Try it on the [live demo](https://demo.seedcorn.io) (sign in as `demo` / `demo12345`):
open **Startup MVP: Idea to Launch** and click **Status report**. Details are in the [user guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md) and
the [design doc](docs/design/status-one-pager.md).

## Live demo

**https://demo.seedcorn.io**

Sign in as `demo` with password `demo12345` (or `editor` / `viewer` with the same
password to see the other roles), or register your own account. The demo is
public and writable, and it is wiped and reseeded every six hours, so do not
keep anything real in it. Tip: hold Ctrl (⌘ on a Mac) and drag an event to move
it; a plain drag pans.

## Run it yourself in two minutes

Requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). No other setup: no `.env`,
no database to install.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vakahnke/seedcorn.git
cd seedcorn
SEED_DEMO=1 docker compose up --build
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** and sign in as `demo` with password `demo12345`.
The seed creates three users and four projects, including two startup plans that
are already in flight so the timeline, board, and task panels have content.

| Username | Password    | Role on the sample projects |
|----------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| `demo`   | `demo12345` | Owner                       |
| `editor` | `demo12345` | Editor                      |
| `viewer` | `demo12345` | Viewer                      |

Leave `SEED_DEMO` off for an empty instance. The first account you register will
need approval in the Django admin unless you set `REQUIRE_ACCOUNT_APPROVAL=0`
(see [`.env.example`](.env.example)).

## What you get

**The timeline.** Hold Ctrl (⌘ on a Mac) and drag an event to move it, drag its
edge to resize it, or drag it onto another track to recategorize. A plain drag
pans the canvas, so you never nudge an event by accident. Zoom smoothly from months down to minutes with
Ctrl/⌘ + scroll or a pinch. Pan by dragging empty space. Press `0` to fit the
whole project. A minimap at the bottom shows the whole plan and lets you jump
around long projects. Dependencies draw as arrows and the critical path is
highlighted automatically.

![The timeline view: dependency arrows, the critical path in red, the now-line, and a minimap](docs/images/timeline.png)

**Three views of one plan.** Timeline for planning, a board grouped by task
status for day-to-day work, and an agenda-style list.

**Works on a phone, timeline included.** Drag to pan, pinch to zoom, press and
hold an event to pick it up and move it, and drag the dots at its ends to resize.
A quick swipe never moves anything, which is the touch version of the Ctrl/⌘ rule. The status report is one tap away on the **Report** tab: the slide shown whole, and the same report below it at a size you can read and edit.

<p align="center">

  &nbsp;
  <img src="docs/images/phone-report-read.png" width="230" alt="The same report below it, sized for reading and editing on a phone">
</p>

![The board view: tasks grouped into To do, In progress, Blocked, and Done](docs/images/board.png)

**Events with substance.** Each event has notes, a percent-complete slider,
predecessors and successors you pick from a list, sub-tasks with owners and due
dates, and a comment thread.

![The event editor with predecessors, successors, and percent complete](docs/images/event.png)

**Gets along with other tools.** Export a project to a calendar file (`.ics`) for
Outlook, Google Calendar and Apple Calendar, everything or key milestones only. Or
export Microsoft Project XML, the interchange format most scheduling tools open,
with dependencies intact and tasks set to manual scheduling so your dates arrive
unchanged. The XML is validated against Microsoft's published schema.

**Teams and roles.** Every project is private to its members. Roles are owner,
editor, commenter, and viewer. Reusable teams let you add a whole group to a
project at one role in a click, and team membership changes flow through to
projects live.

**A dashboard that knows what you owe.** Your projects with progress bars, and a
"My tasks" list across all of them sorted by due date.

![The dashboard: project cards with progress, and your tasks across projects](docs/images/dashboard.png)

**An API you can build on.** Everything the UI does goes through a documented
REST API with JWT auth. Swagger UI lives at `/api/docs/` and ReDoc at
`/api/redoc/` on any running instance.

## Tech stack

| Layer    | Stack                                                                                   |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Backend  | Python 3.12, Django 6.1, Django REST Framework, SimpleJWT, drf-spectacular, PostgreSQL 15+ |
| Frontend | React 19, Vite 8, React Router 7, @dnd-kit for the board. Plain JSX and CSS, no UI kit  |
| Infra    | Docker Compose for dev and prod, nginx + gunicorn in prod, GitHub Actions CI            |

The timeline canvas, dependency arrows, lane backgrounds, and minimap are drawn on
HTML canvas rather than the DOM, which is what keeps panning and zooming smooth
with hundreds of events, including on Safari.

## Development

The dev stack runs Postgres, the Django API, and the Vite dev server with hot
reload in containers. Source directories are mounted, so edits show up
immediately.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

| Surface               | URL                             |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
| App (hot reload)      | http://localhost:5173           |
| API                   | http://localhost:8000/api/      |
| API docs (Swagger)    | http://localhost:8000/api/docs/ |
| Django admin          | http://localhost:8000/admin/    |

Postgres is published on host port 5433 so it does not collide with a local
Postgres. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if you want to change any setting; the
defaults work without it.

Useful commands:

```bash
docker compose exec backend python manage.py load_sample          # seed demo users and projects
docker compose exec backend python manage.py load_sample --clear  # reseed from scratch
docker compose exec backend python manage.py createsuperuser      # for /admin
docker compose exec backend python manage.py test                 # backend test suite
```

CI runs on every push and pull request: Django system checks, a missing-migration
check, migrations and tests against a Postgres service, and a production build of
the frontend. See [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Production

The production stack is a single origin behind nginx: it serves the built SPA and
proxies `/api`, `/admin`, and static files to gunicorn, with Postgres alongside,
all in Docker.

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # set DJANGO_DEBUG=0, a real DJANGO_SECRET_KEY, your domain, RUN_COLLECTSTATIC=1
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

[Deployment](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) covers the environment variables, TLS options,
and backups. [AWS Deployment](docs/AWS_DEPLOYMENT.md) is a complete worked
example with Terraform.

## API overview

All endpoints take a JWT in the `Authorization` header. The live schema at
`/api/docs/` is the reference; this is the shape.

| Method                | Path                                                          | Notes                              |

`index.html` at the repo root is the original single-file prototype the app grew
out of. It is kept for reference and is not part of the build.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, from typo fixes to new views. The short version:

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.
2. Run the dev stack and make your change. Add or update tests in `backend/`
   when you touch the API or data model.
3. Make sure `python manage.py test` passes and the frontend builds
   (`npm run build` in `frontend/`). CI runs the same checks on your pull request.
4. Open a pull request that says what changed and why. Screenshots help for
   anything visual.

For a larger feature, open an issue or a design doc first. The
[design docs README](docs/design/README.md) describes the process: a short
document that captures the current state, prior art, and the proposed design,
so the discussion happens before the code.

Open issues with context and pointers into the code are in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/vakahnke/seedcorn/issues); the ones marked
[good first issue](https://github.com/vakahnke/seedcorn/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
are the easiest way in, and one of them needs no coding at all. Questions and ideas are welcome in
[Discussions](https://github.com/vakahnke/seedcorn/discussions).

Some directions that would be good contributions, roughly in order of effort:

- A signed-in "change password" screen: [design](docs/design/password-reset.md) (reset by email is built)
- Template library, phase 2: hand a template to anyone as a file or a link, versions with a
  "what I learned" note, and author pages: [design](docs/design/template-library-phase2.md)
- Template library, phase 3: a community gallery reviewed through pull requests:
  [design](docs/design/template-library.md) (the library inside one server is built)
- A subscribable calendar feed, so calendars stay current without exporting again:
  [design](docs/design/icalendar-export.md) (the one-off `.ics` export is built)
- Import from Microsoft Project XML:
  [design](docs/design/ms-project-xml.md) (export is built)
- Manual card ordering within board columns
- Guest access for people outside the team, read-only, without an account
- A schedule-health check over the dependency graph: missing links, dangling
  tasks, unusually high float

## Security

If you find a vulnerability, please report it privately rather than in a public
issue. Use GitHub's "Report a vulnerability" button on the Security tab of this
repository. [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) has the details.

## About

I manage projects for a living. Every project I ran taught me something about how to
run the next one, and none of my tools had a place to keep that. I wanted a planner
where the plan is the thing you build, and a finished plan is the thing you keep:
grab an event and move it, see what it pushes, hand leadership a slide without
rebuilding it by hand, and when it is done, save it for next time. I did not have the coding chops to build that alone. Seedcorn was built with
a great deal of help from an AI coding assistant (Claude), and every change is tested and checked
against the running app before it ships. Bug reports, ideas and pull requests are all welcome; the
[issues](https://github.com/vakahnke/seedcorn/issues) marked *good first issue* are a fine place to start.

If Seedcorn is useful to you, a star helps other people find it.
