Tenant recall (Semantic / Similar-to-id / Multimodal) on a live engine, then the full 5 min 18 s product tour: public site, operator dashboard, console, explorer, keys, runtime. Isolation bench in the recording is a browser sketch, not a live node. Embeddings stay with the caller — DBX does not run CLIP or MiniLM.

## Release status

**DBX v1.2.0 is the recall cut** on the same single-node production profile as
v1.1.0: 100 tenants/node, 100k vectors/tenant, durable strings + vectors.
Isolation Kernel (`strict` idle RSS ~14–17 MiB/worker) is unchanged. Certified
ANN p50 is still 2.304 ms. What is new: `VSEARCH` `MIN_SCORE` / `EF` / `SPACE`,
`VSIM` (neighbors of a stored id), `VFUSE` (weighted cosine sum, not a
multimodal model), Python helpers, playground tabs, and the public site that
demonstrates them. This is a better product an agent can call, not a faster
kernel.

Linux CI enforces race detection, coverage floors, noisy-neighbor isolation, and
the 100k-vector harness. Optional async WAL replicas can be provisioned without
putting writes through Raft; cluster/sharding, tiering, and non-string RESP
mutation families still fail closed. See the
[measured certification matrix](scripts/benchmarks/performance_analysis.md).

Before you put a customer on a node: enable control-plane TLS (do not ship with
`-insecure-http`), set `DBX_KEK` and `DBX_ISOLATION_MODE=strict` on Linux (the
Docker image defaults to this), mint per-tenant keys (a **reader** cannot `SET` or `VADD`),
scrape `GET /metrics` with a Bearer JWT or `DBX_INTERNAL_API_TOKEN`, and run
`make soak` on that hardware. Certification numbers are Windows-only; Linux is
the CI gate, not that host. Isolation details: [docs/isolation.md](docs/isolation.md).

The WAL/checkpoint format is intentionally incompatible with pre-hardening data. For an
offline reset that preserves the old directory, run
`go run ./cmd/dbx-v1-reset -data-dir <tenant-dir> -confirm-reset`.

### Operational upgrades: migrate live, inspect history

DBX includes two vector-memory upgrades for teams whose embeddings change over time:

- **Shadow migration:** `VMIGRATE START <index> <dimension> [encoding]`, repeated
  `VMIGRATE ADD <index> <id> <values...>`, then `VMIGRATE SWAP <index>` builds and
  promotes a complete shadow index while the existing index remains searchable. An empty
  migration is rejected; `VMIGRATE CANCEL <index>` leaves the live index untouched.
- **Time-travel search:** `VSEARCH <index> <query...> <k> AS_OF <unix-nanoseconds>`
  replays retained vector WAL history into a temporary index, allowing an audit or RAG
  incident to reproduce an earlier retrieval state.

These features are per-tenant and tested under overwrite, delete, cancellation, concurrent
workloads, and load. Shadow migration still requires the caller to re-embed and stream the
target corpus. `VMIGRATE` START/ADD/SWAP/CANCEL are written to the tenant WAL and replayed
on crash recovery (and on async WAL replicas). Time-travel is bounded by WAL retention and
is slower than current-state search.

---

## Performance & Benchmarks

At DBX, we believe in **100% transparent and reproducible** benchmarks. We prioritize strict per-tenant isolation, but we absolutely refuse to sacrifice throughput to get there.

By testing against DBX's plaintext port (`6380`) with the industry-standard `redis-benchmark` tool (64 clients, pipeline size 64), the engine achieves:
- **SET (string):** ~75,583 ops/sec
- **GET (string):** ~77,458 ops/sec

Don't take our word for it. You can run these tools yourself to verify.
**[Read the full methodology and get the verifiable benchmark script here](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).**

Local tip: `configs/local.yaml` ships with `auth.enabled: false` so plaintext RESP tools can connect without AUTH. Production and orchestrator tenants still require scoped keys.

---

## The problem DBX exists to solve

You are building a product where **every one of your customers needs their own memory**: an
agent platform, a copilot, a vertical AI SaaS, an on-prem deployment per client.

The stores you can buy today are built around one large shared cluster. Tenancy is something
you bolt on yourself:

- You prefix every key with `tenant:{id}:` and pray no query forgets the prefix.
- You keep session state in one system and embeddings in another, then write to both and
  hope they don't drift.
- You cannot back up, export, delete, or move *one customer* — only the whole cluster.
- A noisy tenant's working set evicts a quiet tenant's cache.
- "Delete my data" from a customer becomes an engineering project instead of an API call.

**DBX makes the tenant the unit of the database.** One API call gives you an isolated engine
with its own data directory, its own write-ahead log, its own HNSW vector index, and its own
snapshot lineage. Isolation is structural, not a naming convention.

Two profiles, pick one. Do not claim both at once:

| Profile | When | What you get | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| `inprocess` | `make run-dev`, CI, density soak | Directory + ACL + quotas | Shared Go runtime; 100 tenants/node path |
| `strict` | Linux production (Compose/Helm default) | Process + Landlock + encrypted WAL/meta/graph + `SO_PEERCRED` | ~15 MiB RSS per idle tenant |

Production (TLS, or `DBX_PRODUCTION=1`) **refuses `inprocess`** unless you set
`DBX_ALLOW_INPROCESS=1`. See [docs/isolation.md](docs/isolation.md).

---

## What makes DBX different

### 1. A tenant is a first-class object
`POST /tenants` returns a live, isolated engine in milliseconds. Its keys, vectors, WAL, and
snapshots live in their own directory. Deleting a tenant deletes their data — no scan, no
prefix sweep, no cross-customer blast radius. Per-customer export and restore are file
operations, not migrations.

### 2. Working state and vector memory in one engine
An agent's session, its scratchpad, its rate counters (KV with TTL) and its semantic
recall (HNSW vectors) live in the same process, behind the same connection, in the same data
directory, and inside the same backup archive. There is no dual-write path between a cache and
a separate vector service to reconcile.

The periodic `.rdb` checkpoint covers KV; vectors are durable through checksummed metadata,
their mmap rows, and the WAL. A per-tenant backup takes a mutation maintenance lock and writes
a versioned manifest with SHA-256 checksums for both surfaces.

### 3. Quantized by default, so idle tenants are nearly free
Vectors are stored as 8-bit scalar-quantized rows in an mmap'd file with asymmetric distance
computation at query time. Payload is roughly a quarter the size of float32, and a tenant
nobody has queried today lives in page cache instead of resident RAM. Your cost scales with
*active* tenants, not with the count of tenants you've signed.

### 4. Self-hosted, single binary, with the operator UI included
Embeddings never leave your VPC. The admin dashboard, interactive console, data explorer, and
vector playground are compiled into the same binary you deploy. No sidecar, no separate
control-plane service to run.

### 5. Isolation Kernel (Linux `strict`)
A tenant is its own `dbx-server` process. The kernel stops it opening a neighbour's
files. WAL, snapshots, vector ids, and the HNSW graph are sealed with a per-tenant
key you can shred. This is the security USP. It is not free, and `.vec` rows stay
mmap'd (put the volume on LUKS/fscrypt if embeddings must be ciphertext).
`inprocess` is a density profile, not this claim.

### 6. Your existing clients already work
DBX speaks RESP, so `redis-py`, `ioredis`, and `go-redis` connect without a custom driver.
This is an adoption on-ramp — you don't have to learn a new protocol to try DBX — not a claim
that DBX is a substitute for a tuned Redis cluster. The product API is
`TenantMemory.remember` / `recall` / `forget` in the Python SDK.

---

## What DBX is deliberately not

We would rather be the obvious choice for one job than a mediocre option for five. DBX is
**not** competing on these axes, and you should use the right tool instead:

| If you need… | Use | Why not DBX |
|---|---|---|
| Maximum single-instance KV throughput for one huge shared workload | Redis / Dragonfly | Their whole design target; DBX spends cycles on per-tenant isolation |
| Billion-vector ANN with sharding, replicas, and payload filtering at scale | Qdrant / Milvus | DBX indexes are sized for per-tenant working sets, not one giant corpus |
| A fully managed vector service with no infrastructure | Pinecone | DBX is software you run; that is the point |
| Relational queries, joins, transactions across entities | Postgres (+ pgvector) | DBX is a memory engine, not a system of record |

DBX is the layer *between* those: fast, isolated, per-customer memory that sits in front of
your system of record.

---

## Who it is for

- **AI agent platforms** — each end-customer's agent gets its own memory namespace with real isolation.
- **Vertical AI SaaS** — per-client RAG corpora that must be separately backed up, exported, and deleted.
- **On-prem and regulated deployments** — the whole stack is one binary inside the customer's network.
- **Teams tired of running two systems** — a cache and a vector DB collapsed into one operational surface.

If you have one workload and one tenant, you probably don't need DBX. If you have five hundred
customers who each need memory, DBX is built for exactly that shape.

---

## Quickstart

The Docker image (`deploy/Dockerfile`) embeds the dashboard, puts `dbx-orchestrator`
and `dbx-server` on `PATH`, and **defaults to `DBX_ISOLATION_MODE=strict`**.
Missing `DBX_KEK` (64 hex characters) is a boot failure, not plaintext fallback.
Product version is **1.2.0**, published as
`ghcr.io/vanshjain-0702/dbx-orchestrator` (`:v1.2.0` and `:latest` track GitHub
Releases, not every push). Isolation details:
[docs/isolation.md](docs/isolation.md).

### Option 1: Docker (published image)

```bash
# 64-hex wrapping key. openssl rand -hex 32 also works.
export DBX_KEK="$(python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))")"

docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 -p 6380:6380 \
  -e DBX_ADMIN_PASSWORD='replace-with-12-plus-characters' \
  -e DBX_JWT_SECRET='replace-with-at-least-32-random-characters' \
  -e DBX_INTERNAL_API_TOKEN='replace-with-a-random-service-token' \
  -e DBX_KEK \
  -e DBX_NODE_MEMORY_BUDGET=8gb \
  ghcr.io/vanshjain-0702/dbx-orchestrator:v1.2.0
```

Open **http://localhost:8000** and log in with `admin` / the password you set.
Mint a **writer** key on **Tenant keys**.

For a laptop try that skips envelope encryption (directory isolation only, not
the security USP), add `-e DBX_ISOLATION_MODE=inprocess` and omit `DBX_KEK`.
The image still starts with `-insecure-http`; do not ship that.

To build the same Dockerfile locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vanshjain-0702/DBX-Database-Extreme.git
cd DBX-Database-Extreme
docker build -t dbx:dev -f deploy/Dockerfile .
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 -p 6380:6380 \
  -e DBX_ADMIN_PASSWORD='replace-with-12-plus-characters' \
  -e DBX_JWT_SECRET='replace-with-at-least-32-random-characters' \
  -e DBX_INTERNAL_API_TOKEN='replace-with-a-random-service-token' \
  -e DBX_KEK \
  -e DBX_NODE_MEMORY_BUDGET=8gb \
  dbx:dev
```

### Option 2: Build from source

**Prerequisites:** Go 1.25+, Node.js 20+, and **GNU Make** (`make` is not
installed on Windows by default — use Git Bash, WSL, or Chocolatey/Scoop
`make`). A fresh clone has no dashboard UI until you build it (`dashboard/dist`
is only a `.gitkeep`; `make run-dev` / `make build` run `npm ci && npm run build`
when `dashboard/dist/index.html` is missing).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vanshjain-0702/DBX-Database-Extreme.git
cd DBX-Database-Extreme

make build      # dbx-server + dashboard embed + dbx-orchestrator
make run-dev    # http://127.0.0.1:8000  (admin / adminadminadmin)
```

Without Make (PowerShell), after `cd dashboard; npm ci; npm run build`:

```powershell
$env:DBX_ADMIN_PASSWORD="adminadminadmin"
$env:DBX_JWT_SECRET="supersecretjwtsecret1234567890123456"
$env:DBX_INTERNAL_API_TOKEN="internalapitoken1234567890123456"
$env:DBX_DEFAULT_PASSWORD="adminadminadmin"
$env:DBX_DATA_DIR="./data"
$env:DBX_NODE_MEMORY_BUDGET="8gb"
go run ./cmd/dbx-orchestrator -insecure-http=true
```

### Option 3: Docker Compose

[`deploy/docker-compose.yml`](deploy/docker-compose.yml) lives in `deploy/`, so
Compose will **not** auto-load a repo-root `.env`. Pass `--env-file .env` (or
use `make docker-up`). It also requires `DBX_KEK` and defaults to
`DBX_ISOLATION_MODE=strict` plus `DBX_PRODUCTION=1`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vanshjain-0702/DBX-Database-Extreme.git
cd DBX-Database-Extreme
cp .env.example .env
# set DBX_ADMIN_PASSWORD, DBX_JWT_SECRET, DBX_INTERNAL_API_TOKEN
# set DBX_KEK to 64 hex chars (see comments in .env.example)

make docker-up
# same without Make:
# docker compose --env-file .env -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

The root [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) builds the same image and
needs the same secrets.

---

## The tenant lifecycle

This is the API that defines the product. Everything else is a data-plane detail.

```bash
# JWT for the following calls
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD"}'
# Response: {"token":"..."}  — export it as DBX_TOKEN

# Provision an isolated engine for a customer
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/provision \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DBX_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id": "acme-corp", "name": "Acme Corp"}'

# Talk to that tenant, and only that tenant
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/t/acme-corp/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DBX_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"command": "SET session:42 active"}'

# Back up one customer, not the whole cluster
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/tenants/backup \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DBX_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"id": "acme-corp"}'

# Restore that checksummed archive into the same tenant
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/tenants/restore \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DBX_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"id": "acme-corp", "path": "data/backups/backup_acme-corp_....dbx.zip"}'

# Off-boarding is one call, not a data-deletion project.
# purge=true erases that tenant's directory and nothing else.
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/tenants/delete \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DBX_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"id": "acme-corp", "purge": true}'
```

---

## Connect your application

Mint a **writer** key after you provision: dashboard **Tenant keys**
(`/cluster/{tenant}/keys`) or `POST /api/v1/tenants/{id}/keys`. The secret is shown
once. A **reader** key can `GET`, `VSEARCH`, `VSIM`, and `VFUSE` and cannot `SET`, `SETEX`, `VADD`, or
`VDEL`. Orchestrator tenants have no default superuser — loopback `AUTH default`
is rejected.

Worked examples: [`examples/quickstart.py`](examples/quickstart.py) (15-minute path),
[`examples/langchain-rag`](examples/langchain-rag) (session KV + vectors, no OpenAI key),
[`examples/nextjs-cache`](examples/nextjs-cache) (`SETEX` / node-redis `setEx`).

### Python (AI / LangChain / LlamaIndex)

```python
from dbx import DBXClient

db = DBXClient(
    host="localhost",
    port=6380,
    tenant="acme-corp",
    key_id="key-id",          # from dashboard Tenant keys, not a dummy
    secret="one-time-key-secret",
)

# Working state for this customer's agent
db.set("session:42", '{"thread": "onboarding", "step": 3}')

# Semantic memory for the same customer, same engine, same backup
db.vadd("memories", "doc:1", [0.1, 0.2, 0.9])
results = db.vsearch("memories", [0.1, 0.2, 0.8], top_k=5)
```

**LangChain — one-line swap from Pinecone:**
```python
# Before:  from langchain_pinecone import PineconeVectorStore as VectorStore
from langchain_dbx import DBXVectorStore as VectorStore   # ← only change

store = VectorStore.from_texts(texts, embeddings, client=db, index_name="idx")
docs  = store.similarity_search("query", k=4)
chain = store.as_retriever() | llm   # works in LCEL chains
```

**LlamaIndex — one-line swap from Pinecone:**
```python
# Before:  from llama_index.vector_stores.pinecone import PineconeVectorStore as VectorStore
from llamaindex_dbx import DBXVectorStore as VectorStore   # ← only change

vector_store = VectorStore(client=db)
storage_ctx  = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)
index        = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(docs, storage_context=storage_ctx)
response     = index.as_query_engine().query("What is DBX?")
```

Install the SDK from this tree:
```bash
pip install -e "sdk/python"                  # core only
pip install -e "sdk/python[langchain]"       # + LangChain adapter
pip install -e "sdk/python[llamaindex]"      # + LlamaIndex adapter
pip install -e "sdk/python[all]"             # everything
```

Control-plane helpers live on `ControlPlane`. Per-tenant cost is
`GET /api/v1/tenants/{id}/usage`. Prometheus is `GET /metrics` on the
orchestrator (Bearer JWT or `DBX_INTERNAL_API_TOKEN` unless you passed
`-insecure-http`). Full integration docs in
[docs/api-reference.md](docs/api-reference.md#framework-integrations).

Python unit tests do not need a running node:

```bash
make python-check   # flake8, black, pytest (live AUTH tests skip without env)
```

### Node.js / TypeScript

```typescript
import { createClient } from 'redis'; // DBX speaks RESP, so existing clients work

const client = createClient({ url: 'redis://localhost:6380' });
await client.connect();
await client.sendCommand(['AUTH', 'acme-corp:key-id', 'one-time-key-secret']);
await client.set('session:abc', JSON.stringify({ userId: 42 }));
```

Each tenant is an isolated engine with its own durability chain. The orchestrator owns
provisioning, authentication, and routing.

## Performance

Numbers from a local single-node run. They exist to show that per-tenant isolation does not
cost you an order of magnitude — not to rank DBX against a tuned cluster of something else.
Measure on your own hardware before you rely on any of this.

| Operation | Single node, local | Measured with |
|---|---|---|
| SET (string) | 186,147 ops/sec | RESP, 64 connections, pipeline 64, WAL `everysec` |
| GET (string) | 284,785 ops/sec | Same run, 128k operations |
| Vector ingest | 7,233 vectors/sec | 100k × 128-dim, batches of 1,000, 8-way sharded HNSW |
| ANN search | p50 2.304 / p95 3.132 / p99 3.730 ms | 100k vectors, 128-dim, efSearch=80, 50 queries |
| Recall@10 | mean 0.920 / p05 0.800 | SQ8 HNSW vs float32 brute force |
| Vector payload | ~4× smaller than float32 | SQ8 quantization |

Methodology and the honest caveats are in
[scripts/benchmarks/performance_analysis.md](scripts/benchmarks/performance_analysis.md).

## Roadmap

CI runs a scaled density soak (12 idle / 4 active) plus backup/restore and hibernate
tests. Operators run the certified 100 idle / 25 active profile with `make soak`.
Per-tenant cost is `GET /api/v1/tenants/{id}/usage`. Hibernate/wake evicts a cold
engine without deleting it. The 15-minute path is
[`examples/quickstart.py`](examples/quickstart.py). Detail in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
