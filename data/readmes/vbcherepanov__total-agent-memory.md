## Version 14.5.0 — no significant difference from Mem0 Platform on LoCoMo and LongMemEval

**Release date: 2026-09-23.**

Mem0 publishes the per-question answers behind its LoCoMo and LongMemEval figures. We graded
them and TAM's answers to the same held-out questions under two grading configurations each — the
judge the public numbers used and Mem0's current one. Within a configuration both systems' answers
go through the same judge model and prompt; the two LongMemEval configurations differ in both judge
model and rubric ([report, protocol and how to reproduce it](docs/benchmarks/head-to-head-v14/RESULTS.md)):

| Held-out questions, accuracy % | LoCoMo (1,144), published judge | LoCoMo, Mem0 judge | LongMemEval-S (400), official judge | LongMemEval-S, Mem0 judge |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Mem0 Platform (gpt-5 answering, top 200 memories) | 88.46 | 94.32 | 91.00 | 91.75 |
| TAM (gpt-5 answering) | 86.54¹ | 94.23 | **92.25** | 90.75 |
| TAM (gpt-4.1-mini answering) | 88.02¹ | **94.32**¹ | 87.50 | 88.25 |

¹ English embedding preset (`MEMORY_TEXT_EMBED_MODEL=BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`); with the default
multilingual model, 87.50 and 92.57. No difference between TAM and Mem0 Platform at the same
answering model is statistically significant on these questions. That is not a demonstrated
equivalence, and the reported split was not scored blind (the report gives the tuning history); TAM
gets there retrieving locally and calling no LLM when it writes or searches. The report also lists how Mem0's published setup differs from the
earlier public protocol: a more lenient judge, 156 re-run questions, and answer-prompt hints that
match individual LoCoMo gold answers.

What changed:

| Change | How you use it |
|---|---|
| **Cross-encoder reads the neighbouring turns** | Automatic. Each candidate is scored alone and with the turns before and after it; `MEMORY_CROSS_RERANK_CONTEXT` (400 characters, `0` = off). |
| **Relative dates resolved in context mode** | Automatic. "last Thursday [Thu 14 December 2023]", counted from the record's timestamp; `MEMORY_CONTEXT_RESOLVE_DATES=off` disables it. |
| **Context budget shared by rank** | Automatic. The first hits keep long records whole; answers about something the assistant said reach the reader whole for every development question instead of 38%. |
| **`MEMORY_TEXT_EMBED_MODEL` works; models above 2 GB load** | Set it to change the model of ordinary records (re-embed with `python src/reembed.py --fastembed`). |
| **Head-to-head tooling** | `benchmarks/crossgrade_mem0.py`, `benchmarks/retrieval_eval.py`; the QA harnesses take reasoning models (`--answer-model gpt-5-2025-08-07`). |

---

## Version 14.4.0 — opt-in fact supersession, cheaper writes at 1M records

**Release date: 2026-09-22.**

A record can now retire the value it replaces. `memory_save(supersede=true)` looks for active
records of the same project and type that share the new record's opening words and end in a
different value ("X's citizenship is Argentina" → "... is Armenia", "billing runs on PostgreSQL
16" → "18"), marks them `superseded` and returns their ids. It is off by default: on a real
5,128-record store the rule would have retired 138 records that were not updates, such as
"likes jazz" next to "likes rock". On MemoryAgentBench FactConsolidation with gpt-4o-mini
([findings](docs/benchmarks/memoryagentbench/FINDINGS.md)):

| | 14.3.1 | 14.4.0, `supersede=true` |
|---|---:|---:|
| FC single-hop, 6k / 262k | 82 / 85 | 99 / 93 |
| FC multi-hop, 6k / 262k | 13 / 3 | 27 / 9 |

What changed, including two write-side costs that grew with the store:

| Change | How you use it |
|---|---|
| **Fact supersession** | `memory_save(..., supersede=true)` or `memory_save_fast(..., supersede=true)` for single-valued facts. The response lists retired ids under `superseded`. |
| **Vector cache patches instead of reloading** | Automatic. Migration 036 logs which record each change touched; a cached pool re-reads only those rows when a search next uses it. Unscoped recall right after a save at 1M records: 4.2 s → 0.37 s. |
| **Concept name refresh uses an index** | Automatic. Migration 037 indexes graph node names that can match text; the 60-second refresh that stalled one save a minute takes 2.6 ms. Save p99 at 1M records: 1,432 → 140 ms ([report](docs/benchmarks/scale-v14/RESULTS.md)). |

---

## Version 14.3.1 — updates are no longer dropped, recall stays fast at 1M records

**Release date: 2026-09-21.**

Two problems that got worse as a store grew. Dedup treated near-identical texts as repeats, so
an update that changed one value ("Messi's citizenship is Argentina" → "... Armenia",
"PostgreSQL 16" → "18") was dropped and the old value kept; on MemoryAgentBench
FactConsolidation 14.3.0 lost 36 of 455 facts. And several queries behind every recall and save
read the whole store. Measured on one machine with 200 synthetic tenants
([report](docs/benchmarks/scale-v14/RESULTS.md)):

| | 14.3.0 | 14.3.1 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Tenant-scoped `memory_recall`, 100k records, p50 / p95 | 781 / 1,901 ms | 25 / 35 ms |
| Tenant-scoped `memory_recall`, 1M records, p50 / p95 | 6–64 s | 105 / 147 ms |
| HTTP calls/s, 100k records, 16 clients | 1.3 | 37 (one process), 117 (`MCP_HTTP_WORKERS=4`) |

| Change | How you use it |
|---|---|
| **Updates are kept** | Automatic. A record is a repeat only when it has the same words in the same order (case, punctuation and ё/е aside). A repeat replaces the stored record, so "A", then "B", then "A" leaves A as the latest. |
| **Scoped search follows the project, not the store** | Automatic. Migration 035 puts the project into the full-text index (rebuilt once, about 30 s per million records); graph seeds and `available_solutions` use indexes. |
| **HTTP workers** | `MCP_HTTP_WORKERS=4` with `MCP_TRANSPORT=http`: four server processes on one port, stateless sessions, POSIX only. In Docker Compose: `TAM_MCP_WORKERS=4`. |
| **Scale benchmark** | `benchmarks/scale_bench.py` loads a synthetic multi-tenant corpus through the real save path and measures recall, save, HTTP throughput and concurrent writers. |
| **MemoryAgentBench** | FactConsolidation results: [findings](docs/benchmarks/memoryagentbench/FINDINGS.md). |

## Version 14.3.0 — Jev as the contradiction checker

**Release date: 2026-09-21.**

`memory_answer` can now check retrieved facts for contradictions with TypeSafe's Jev, a
System One model that answers typed questions with calibrated probabilities instead of
generating text. Every (supporting, opposing) pair becomes one `noul` question, and all of
them go in a single request. Measured on the same questions against the Claude Haiku 4.5
scorer ([report](docs/benchmarks/knowledge-update-v14/RESULTS.md#jev-as-the-contradiction-scorer-1430)):
accuracy is unchanged within noise (LongMemEval knowledge-update 35/78 vs 36/78, control
15/50 vs 16/50). The median contradiction pass drops from 3.1 s to 1.9 s, and Jev billed
$0.038 for all 78 questions.

| Change | How you use it |
|---|---|
| **Jev contradiction scorer** | `MEMORY_CONTRADICTION_SCORER=jev` plus `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`. The default stays `llm`. The client retries 408, 429, 5xx and connection errors like the official SDKs, honours `retry-after-ms` / `Retry-After` up to 60 s, and reports `jev_*` counters and a `jev_request_ms` latency histogram. |
| **API key hygiene** | An empty key, or one containing a newline or other control character, is rejected before any request, and the error never contains the key. (The official Python and JS SDKs echo it; reported upstream as typesafe-sdk-python#9 and typesafe-sdk-js#14.) |
| **Benchmark harness** | `benchmarks/knowledge_update_eval.py` records per-question contradiction-pass time and Jev token usage, so the two scorers can be compared on cost as well as accuracy. |

---

## Version 14.2.0 — facts that change over time

**Release date: 2026-09-21.**

"Mary loves red", saved in May, and "Mary no longer likes red; she has fallen for green",
saved in August: `memory_answer` now says *green, previously red*. Measured with Claude
Haiku 4.5 on the same questions ([report](docs/benchmarks/knowledge-update-v14/RESULTS.md)):
LongMemEval knowledge-update rose from 12/78 to 35/78, a Russian + English update suite from
8/30 to 22/30, and five other LongMemEval categories from 11/50 to 16/50.

| Change | How you use it |
|---|---|
| **Recording dates reach the reader** | `memory_answer`'s reader and verifier see when each record was saved. The latest record about the same subject gives the current value unless its text describes the past, and a value stays current until a later record changes it. Answers come back in the language of the question. |
| **Contradictions are resolved, not refused** | A hard contradiction now passes both sides, with their dates, to the reader. `MEMORY_CONTRADICTION_POLICY=abstain` restores the 14.1.0 refusal. The contradiction scorer sees the question, so a conflict about someone else no longer blocks the answer. |
| **Russian word forms** | The lexical recall tier stems Cyrillic terms (Snowball, new dependency `snowballstemmer`): "Маша" in a question finds "Маше" in a record, and claim grounding accepts the inflected name. |
| **One timestamp format** | Records are stored as `2026-09-21T08:21:37.622445Z` (UTC). Migration 034 rewrites older rows: `+00:00` and fraction-less values are reformatted, and zone-less values, which older versions wrote in local time, are converted with that zone's DST rules. The instants do not change, so atomic facts are not rebuilt. |

---

## Version 14.1.0 — what is new

**Release date: 2026-09-21.**

| Change | How you use it |
|---|---|
| **Negative retrieval in `memory_answer`** | Before reading, the grounded reader runs a second, contradiction-seeking search: a small model inverts the question, and each (supporting, opposing) pair — at most 5 × 5 — is scored in one batched call. Score ≥ 0.60 answers *Not enough information* without picking a side; 0.30–0.60 answers with a caveat; below 0.30 the answer is unchanged. The verdict is returned under `negative`. `MEMORY_NEGATIVE_RETRIEVAL=false` turns it off. |
| **`memory_answer` on Anthropic and Ollama** | Both providers now return schema-constrained output (forced tool call / JSON-schema `format`). Before this, Claude Haiku wrapped JSON in a markdown fence and `memory_answer` failed with *Reader returned invalid grounded evidence*. |

---

## Version 14.0.0 — what is new

**Release date: 2026-09-15 · Status: release candidate; registry publication pending.**
Use the prepared wheel or this source checkout for v14. The general package-manager commands below follow their published channels and do not guarantee v14 before publication.

| Change | How you use it |
|---|---|
| **Personal, team and shared memory** | Install one server; give Vasya and Petya separate tokens. Select a scope when saving; search all areas you can access. Each area has its own database, graph and index. |
| **Authorship and revision history** | The token identifies the author and client. See who changed a record, when and why; revision checks prevent overwriting another person's edit. |
| **Remote MCP and team web interface** | Connect an IDE through the lightweight Python bridge. In the browser, select a scope, search, browse, save, edit and inspect history. The interface displays the product name, version and release date. |
| **Lower CPU pressure** | Fast mode remains the default. Embedding and optional PyTorch models default to one compute thread. The team server retains three workspace workers to avoid repeated model loading. |
| **Configurable internal LLMs** | Use Ollama, an OpenAI-compatible endpoint or Anthropic for internal text tasks; explicitly select a vision model for images. |
| **Safer retrieval and answers** | Scoped context, model-aware vector search and privacy-safe write intents. The optional grounded reader checks supporting evidence and rejects contradictory claims; it is not the default answer path. |
| **Installation and packaging fixes** | Wheel, source archive and Docker checks cover Linux, Windows and macOS; the source archive now includes test fixtures and installation support files. |

**Validation:** 2,162 tests passed in the checkout; 2,145 passed from the source archive. Native wheel checks passed on Ubuntu, Windows and macOS; 12 browser scenarios passed across Chromium, Firefox and WebKit. The expanded CI matrix still requires execution. See the [final verification report](docs/benchmarks/release-final-v14-20260915/RESULTS.md) for skips, exact platforms and artifact hashes.

**Performance limits:** BGE is optional. On the measured Linux ARM64 setup, its one-thread p95 was about **2,179 ms**, above the 200 ms target. Limiting threads reduces parallel CPU load; it does not eliminate CPU work. No top-10 ranking or new default answer-quality improvement is claimed. [CPU measurements](docs/benchmarks/grounded-v14/CPU_RESULTS.md).

## Getting started with v14

### Choose local or server mode

| Mode | Install and use |
|---|---|
| **Local, one person** | Follow [native or Docker installation](#install), then [Quick start](#quick-start). Memory and models run on your machine; the local MCP catalogue has 74 tools. |
| **Server, multiple people** | Follow the setup below. Memory and models run on the server; clients need only Python and their token. The remote catalogue exposes eight core tools. |

The server instructions work with the prepared v14 wheel on Linux, macOS and Windows. Run commands in a directory where you can create the data folder and token files.

### Start a server without Docker

Install the candidate wheel in a dedicated environment. Linux/macOS:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install ./dist/total_agent_memory-14.5.1-py3-none-any.whl
```

Windows PowerShell, using the environment directly without changing the execution policy:

```powershell
py -3 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install .\dist\total_agent_memory-14.5.1-py3-none-any.whl
$env:PATH = "$PWD\.venv\Scripts;$env:PATH"
```

Then, on any of these systems:

```sh
tam-team --root ./team-data user-add vasya 'Vasya'
tam-team --root ./team-data user-add petya 'Petya'
tam-team --root ./team-data team-add engineering 'Engineering'
tam-team --root ./team-data member vasya engineering editor
tam-team --root ./team-data member petya engineering editor
tam-team --root ./team-data token-create vasya --client codex --out ./vasya.token
tam-team --root ./team-data token-create petya --client cursor --out ./petya.token
tam-team --root ./team-data serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3738
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3738/` and sign in with the contents of your token file. Keep each token private; give Petya his own token, not Vasya's. For access from other machines, configure an HTTPS reverse proxy to the server's `/mcp/` endpoint and web interface. [Permissions, backup, restore and server configuration](docs/TEAM_SERVER_V14.md).

### Start a server with Docker Compose

From this checkout, with port 3738 available:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.team.yml build
docker compose -f docker-compose.team.yml run --rm team-memory python /app/src/team_memory/cli.py user-add vasya 'Vasya'
docker compose -f docker-compose.team.yml run --rm team-memory python /app/src/team_memory/cli.py token-create vasya --client codex --out /team-data/vasya.token
docker compose -f docker-compose.team.yml up -d
docker compose -f docker-compose.team.yml cp team-memory:/team-data/vasya.token ./vasya.token
```

The web interface is at `http://127.0.0.1:3738/`. The token copied to the host is a credential: restrict file access to its owner. To add Petya, a team and membership, use the same CLI subcommands shown above through `docker compose -f docker-compose.team.yml run --rm team-memory python /app/src/team_memory/cli.py`.

Compose keeps data and model caches in persistent volumes. Set `TAM_TEAM_PORT`, `TAM_TEAM_MAX_WORKERS` and LLM settings in `.env` as needed; see [.env.example](.env.example). Plan at least 4 GiB RAM for three warm MiniLM workers and measure your own workload. [Docker server details](docs/TEAM_SERVER_V14.md#docker).

### Connect a remote IDE

Copy `src/team_memory/remote.py` to the client and supply its personal token file. This bridge uses only the Python standard library. For clients with an `mcpServers` configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "total-agent-memory": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/remote.py"],
      "env": {
        "TAM_REMOTE_URL": "https://YOUR_SERVER/mcp/",
        "TAM_REMOTE_TOKEN_FILE": "/absolute/path/vasya.token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace the paths and server address. On Windows use the path to `python.exe` and Windows file paths. Local testing may use `http://127.0.0.1:3738/mcp/`; remote connections require HTTPS. If the package is installed on the client, `tam-remote` is also available. [Client configuration details](docs/TEAM_SERVER_V14.md#лёгкий-удалённый-клиент).

### Save, search and see who changed what

Ask your agent to call `memory_scopes` first to list available areas. These are example arguments for the remote `memory_save` tool:

```jsonl
{"content":"My investigation notes", "scope":{"kind":"personal"}, "tags":["release-v14"]}
{"content":"Engineering release checklist", "scope":{"kind":"team","team_id":"engineering"}, "tags":["release-v14"]}
{"content":"Company-wide onboarding guide", "scope":{"kind":"shared"}, "tags":["onboarding"]}
```

- **Personal:** visible only to the token's owner; this is the default for saves.
- **Team:** visible to members; `reader` can read, `editor` can also change records.
- **Shared:** readable and editable by every authenticated user of this server.
- **Tags:** organize topics. Access comes from `scope` and membership; reserved `scope:`, `team:` and `user:` tags are managed by the server.

Call `memory_recall` with `{"query":"release checklist"}` to search all accessible areas, or add a `scope` to narrow the search. Use `memory_get` and `memory_history` with the returned record's `id` and `scope` to inspect content, author and changes. `memory_update` requires those fields plus `expected_revision`, `content` and `reason`; use the new ID returned by the update for subsequent operations. The author is taken from the token automatically.

The remote tools are `memory_scopes`, `memory_save`, `memory_recall`, `memory_get`, `memory_update`, `memory_delete`, `memory_history` and `memory_export`. History and export are paginated. [Full behavior and retry rules](docs/TEAM_SERVER_V14.md).

### Configure internal models and CPU

Fast mode works without an LLM. To use a local model for optional internal tasks, set these environment variables (or `.env` for Compose):

```dotenv
MEMORY_LLM_ENABLED=true
MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
MEMORY_LLM_MODEL=YOUR_INSTALLED_MODEL
OLLAMA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434
MEMORY_EMBED_THREADS=1
MEMORY_TORCH_THREADS=1
```

For Docker, the Ollama address must be reachable from the container; the team profile defaults to `http://host.docker.internal:11434`. For another compatible server, select `MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=openai-compatible` and set `MEMORY_LLM_API_BASE`, `MEMORY_LLM_MODEL` and, if required, `MEMORY_LLM_API_KEY`. Compatibility means Chat Completions, with JSON Schema support for structured tasks. Set `MEMORY_VISION_MODEL` separately for images. Restart after changing environment settings. [Provider settings and CPU limits](docs/LLM_V14.md).

Optional remote LLM providers receive the content used in those tasks. Keep Ollama local or set `MEMORY_LLM_ENABLED=false` if that content must stay on your own infrastructure.

## The problem it solves

**AI coding agents have amnesia.** Every new Claude Code / Codex / Cursor session starts from zero. Yesterday's architectural decisions, bug fixes, stack choices, and hard-won lessons vanish the moment you close the terminal. You re-explain the same things, re-discover the same solutions, paste the same context into every new chat.

**`total-agent-memory` gives the agent a persistent brain — on your machine, not in someone else's cloud.**

Every decision, solution, error, fact, file change, and session summary is:

- **Captured** — explicitly via `memory_save` or implicitly via hooks on file edits / bash errors / session end
- **Linked** — automatically extracted into a knowledge graph (entities, relations, temporal facts)
- **Searchable** — 6-stage hybrid retrieval (BM25 + dense + graph + CrossEncoder + MMR + RRF fusion), **95.1% R@5 on public LongMemEval**
- **Private by default** — SQLite + FastEmbed + optional local Ollama. In server mode, memory stays on your server; external LLMs receive content only when configured and used.

---

## 60-second demo

```
You:     "remember we picked pgvector over ChromaDB because of multi-tenant RLS"
Claude:  ✓ memory_save(type=decision, content="Chose pgvector over ChromaDB",
                       context="WHY: single Postgres, per-tenant RLS")

[3 days later, different session, possibly different project directory:]

You:     "why did we pick pgvector again?"
Claude:  ✓ memory_recall(query="vector database choice")
         → "Chose pgvector over ChromaDB for multi-tenant RLS. Single DB
            instance, row-level security per tenant."
```

It's not just retrieval. It's procedural too:

```
You:     "migrate auth middleware to JWT-only session tokens"
Claude:  ✓ workflow_predict(task_description="migrate auth middleware...")
         → confidence 0.82, predicted steps:
             1. read src/auth/middleware.go + tests
             2. update session fixtures in tests/
             3. run migration 0042
             4. regenerate OpenAPI spec
           similar past: wf#118 (success), wf#93 (success)
```

## Benchmarks — how it compares

Everything below is **retrieval**: does the memory surface the passage that
contains the answer, in the top-K? That is the part this project owns —
answer quality is bounded above by it, and it can be graded with no LLM in
the loop, which makes the numbers deterministic, free, and reproducible on
your machine.

Two things to read them honestly:

- These are the **default `fast` profile** — FastEmbed, no reranker, no LLM
  anywhere in the path. That is what you get after `install.sh`, not a tuned
  configuration.
- Every runner passes `record_usage=False`. `Recall.search` normally bumps
  `recall_count`, and the scorer adds `recall_boost = min(0.3, recall_count ×
  0.05)` — so before v13, each re-run against the same database scored higher
  than the last, partly measuring its own history. A clean run and a re-run
  are now byte-identical.

### LoCoMo — [snap-research/locomo](https://github.com/snap-research/locomo)

1,536 gradable questions across 10 long-running conversations (5,882 turns
ingested), plus 446 adversarial questions scored separately.

| Category | N | R@1 | R@5 | R@10 | MRR |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| single-hop | 282 | 0.202 | 0.500 | 0.638 | 0.332 |
| temporal | 321 | 0.411 | **0.689** | 0.735 | 0.524 |
| multi-hop | 92 | 0.163 | 0.413 | 0.435 | 0.256 |
| open-domain | 841 | 0.363 | 0.633 | 0.712 | 0.479 |
| **overall** | **1,536** | **0.331** | **0.607** | **0.687** | **0.448** |

Latency p50 **18.2 ms**, p95 55.4 ms. Temporal is the strongest category —
the bi-temporal knowledge graph earns its keep. Multi-hop is the weakest and
is the v13.1 target.

### BEAM — [Beyond a Million Tokens](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/BEAM), ICLR 2026

BEAM is the benchmark that starts where context windows stop: conversations of
100K / 500K / 1M tokens (a separate 10M set goes further), probed across ten
distinct memory abilities. Scored here against each probe's `source_chat_ids`.

**Scale 100K** — 20 conversations, 5,732 messages, 355 gradable probes:

| Ability | N | R@1 | R@5 | R@10 | MRR |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| contradiction_resolution | 40 | 0.700 | **1.000** | 1.000 | 0.824 |
| temporal_reasoning | 40 | 0.475 | **0.975** | 1.000 | 0.689 |
| knowledge_update | 40 | 0.550 | **0.925** | 0.950 | 0.719 |
| multi_session_reasoning | 40 | 0.375 | 0.675 | 0.850 | 0.486 |
| information_extraction | 40 | 0.400 | 0.625 | 0.725 | 0.503 |
| summarization | 36 | 0.167 | 0.444 | 0.556 | 0.267 |
| preference_following | 39 | 0.077 | 0.282 | 0.410 | 0.169 |
| event_ordering | 40 | 0.025 | 0.150 | 0.200 | 0.074 |
| instruction_following | 40 | 0.025 | 0.075 | 0.150 | 0.054 |
| **overall** | **355** | **0.313** | **0.575** | **0.651** | **0.423** |

Latency p50 **17.7 ms**. The shape is the useful part: contradiction
resolution, temporal reasoning and knowledge update are effectively solved,
while `instruction_following` and `event_ordering` are near-zero — those probes
ask *whether a stated instruction was followed* or *in what order things
happened*, and semantic similarity to the question does not find the message
where the instruction was given. Retrieval is the wrong primitive there, and
that is the roadmap item.

**Scale 500K** — 35 conversations, 38,058 messages, 629 gradable probes:

**Scale 1M** — 35 conversations, 74,630 messages, 625 gradable probes:

### How it scales, and what that exposed

| Scale | Messages | R@5 | search p50 | ingest |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 100K | 5,732 | 0.575 | 17.7 ms | 25.6 msg/s |
| 500K | 38,058 | 0.490 | 58.5 ms | 10.8 msg/s |
| 1M | 74,630 | **0.448** | **411.5 ms** | **5.0 msg/s** |

Recall decays gracefully — 13× the haystack costs 12.7 points of R@5, and the
abilities that hold up (knowledge update, contradiction resolution) hold up at
every scale. The two curves that do *not* decay gracefully are the interesting
part, and they have separate causes.

**Ingest — found and fixed.** Throughput fell 5× across the three scales on
identical code. The cause was ours: `graph/auto_link.py` runs on every save and
constructed a fresh `ConceptExtractor` each time. The node-name cache lives on
the instance, so it was thrown away immediately and the whole `graph_nodes`
table was re-read per write — 1,000 saves triggered 1,000 full table reads
(~139 million rows at the 139k nodes this ingest reaches). Fixed in v13.0.1;
counting reads rather than timing makes the check load-independent, and it is
now **1** read per 1,000 saves. **The ingest column above was measured before
that fix** and is kept as the record of the problem.

**Search — open.** p50 grew 7× between 500K and 1M for 2× the data.
`Store._binary_search` loads the binary vectors of every active record into
numpy on each query, so search is linear in store size. That is a different
problem from the ingest one and is not fixed; an ANN index over the binary
vectors is the obvious answer and has not been built yet. Stated rather than
buried, because 411 ms is a real number a user would feel.

### LongMemEval — [xiaowu0162/longmemeval-cleaned](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xiaowu0162/longmemeval-cleaned)

470 questions across six question types, re-measured for v13 **through the
product**: each question's haystack is ingested into a real `Store` and queried
with `Recall.search`, the same path an agent takes.

| Question type | Count | R@5 (recall_any) |
|---|---:|---:|
| knowledge-update | 72 | **100.0%** |
| multi-session | 121 | **98.3%** |
| single-session-user | 64 | 95.3% |
| single-session-assistant | 56 | 94.6% |
| temporal-reasoning | 127 | 92.9% |
| single-session-preference | 30 | 80.0% |
| **total** | **470** | **95.1%** |

Also `recall_all@5` 85.7% (every required fragment, not just one), NDCG@5
88.9%, **27.6 ms** per query.

> **This replaces the 96.2% we published before**, and the difference matters
> more than the 1.1 points. Until v13 this runner used its own self-contained

### On end-to-end accuracy numbers

Systems in this space usually publish LoCoMo **accuracy** — a generator answers
from the retrieved context and an LLM judges it. We publish it too, with the
two caveats that make it meaningful.

**One LLM-judged run is a sample, not a measurement.** Temperature 0 does not
make the API deterministic and OpenAI documents `seed` as best-effort, so the
runner takes `--seed` and we report three runs:

| Category | N | mean | min | max | spread |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| single-hop | 282 | 0.366 | 0.358 | 0.372 | 0.014 |
| temporal | 321 | 0.426 | 0.424 | 0.427 | 0.003 |
| multi-hop | 96 | 0.292 | 0.281 | 0.302 | **0.021** |
| open-domain | 841 | 0.570 | 0.567 | 0.573 | 0.006 |
| adversarial | 446 | **0.904** | 0.899 | 0.908 | 0.009 |
| **overall (no adversarial)** | 1,540 | **0.486 ± 0.002** | 0.484 | 0.488 | 0.005 |
| **overall (all)** | 1,986 | **0.579 ± 0.002** | 0.578 | 0.582 | 0.004 |

gpt-4o generator, gpt-4o-mini judge, seeds 1/2/3. Retrieval was **byte-identical
across all three** — only generation and judging vary.

**The judge needed two guards, and they point opposite ways.**

*Refusals scored as correct answers.* On ~100 of the 1,540 non-adversarial
questions per run, the judge answered YES to *"Not mentioned in the
conversation."* against golds like `Sweden`, `June 2023`, `Single` — F1 exactly
0.00. Almost certainly the adversarial rule bleeding across, since the judge is
told to accept a refusal when the gold also indicates no information. Per
category the inflation runs **3.2 pp (open-domain) to 14.3 pp (temporal)**.

*Hallucinations scored as correct abstentions.* **99.6% of LoCoMo's adversarial
golds are the empty string.** The judge accepts almost any fluent answer against
an empty reference, so 27–30 invented answers per run scored correct —
inflating the one category we used to lead on.

Both are rules rather than judgements — on categories 1–4 the gold *is* a fact,
so a refusal cannot be right; with an empty gold, only a refusal can be — so
both now run deterministically at judging time. **Effect: no-adv 0.551 → 0.486,
adversarial 0.966 → 0.904, all 0.645 → 0.579. The table above is corrected.**

How noisy is the rest? Aligning all 1,986 questions across the three seeds:

| | share |
|---|---:|
| generator's answer differed between seeds | 12.5% |
| judge's verdict differed | 5.1% |
| **judge flipped on an identical answer** | **2.7%** |

The aggregate holds within ±0.005 because those flips roughly cancel, not
because the instrument is precise. Quoting one run to three decimals — as we
did before — is not supported by the data.

Not comparable to the 90%+ figures some competitors publish: different
generators, judges, prompts and question subsets. And on this evidence, an
unguarded LLM judge can be worth six points on its own. The retrieval numbers
above remain our primary metric because they are checkable without an API key.

### Do the retrieval numbers mean anything? — negative controls

A retrieval score with no floor under it is not a claim. Every LoCoMo run now
scores three degenerate baselines on the same questions:

| Baseline | R@1 | R@5 | R@10 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| random — ten turns from the same conversation | 0.001 | 0.012 | 0.023 |
| first — the ten earliest turns | 0.000 | 0.023 | 0.039 |
| recency — the ten most recent turns | 0.001 | 0.003 | 0.011 |
| **the pipeline** | **0.331** | **0.607** | **0.687** |

**27× the best degenerate baseline.** The controls run in the same pass as the
metric, so the floor ships with the number rather than living in a script
somebody stops running.

**On competitors' benchmark numbers.** mem0 publishes 92.5 on LoCoMo and 94.4 on
LongMemEval, from its managed platform with gpt-5 answering and judging. It also publishes the
answers behind them, so they can be graded next to TAM's under one judge: on the same held-out
questions the two systems tie on both benchmarks
([head-to-head](docs/benchmarks/head-to-head-v14/RESULTS.md)). Where a project has not published
per-question answers, we do not compare against its number.

## What you get

### Eight capabilities nobody else ships

| Capability | Tool | One-liner |
|---|---|---|
| 🧠 **Procedural memory** | `workflow_predict` / `workflow_track` | "How did I solve this last time?" — predicts steps with confidence |
| 🔗 **Cross-project analogy** | `analogize` | "Was there something like this in another repo?" — Jaccard + Dempster-Shafer |
| ⚠️ **Pre-edit risk warnings** | `file_context` | Surfaces past errors / hot spots on the file you're about to edit |
| 🛡 **Self-improving rules** | `learn_error` + `self_rules_context` | Bash failures → patterns → auto-consolidated behavioral rules at N≥3 |
| 🕰 **Temporal facts** | `kg_add_fact` / `kg_at` | Append-only KG with `valid_from`/`valid_to` — query what was true at any point |
| 🎯 **Task workflow phases** | `classify_task` / `phase_transition` | Automatic L1-L4 complexity classification, state machine across van/plan/creative/build/reflect/archive |
| 🧩 **Structured decisions** | `save_decision` | Options + criteria matrix + rationale + discarded → searchable decision records with per-criterion embeddings |
| 💸 **Token-efficient retrieval** | `memory_recall(mode="index")` + `memory_get` | 3-layer workflow: compact IDs → timeline → batched full fetch. ~83% token saving on typical queries |

### Plus the basics done well

- **6-stage hybrid retrieval** (BM25 + dense + fuzzy + graph + CrossEncoder + MMR, RRF fusion) — 95.1% R@5 public
- **Multi-representation embeddings** — each record embedded as raw + summary + keywords + questions + compressed
- **AST codebase ingest** — tree-sitter across 9 languages (Python, TS/JS, Go, Rust, Java, C/C++, Ruby, C#)

- **rtk-style content filters** — strip noise from pytest / cargo / git / docker logs while preserving URLs, paths, code
- **3D WebGL knowledge graph viewer** — 3,500+ nodes, 120,000+ edges, click-to-focus, filters
- **Hive plot & adjacency matrix** — alternate graph views sorted by node type
- **A2A protocol** — memory shared between multiple agents (backend + frontend + mobile in a team)
- **`design-explore` skill** — drop-in Claude Code skill that walks L3-L4 tasks through options → criteria matrix → `save_decision` before code (see `examples/skills/design-explore/SKILL.md`)
- **`<private>...</private>` inline redaction** in any saved content
- **Cloud LLM/embed providers** with per-phase routing (OpenAI / Anthropic / OpenRouter / Together / Groq / Cohere / any OpenAI-compat)

## Install

### Quickstart — pick one

These are the published distribution channels. For the unpublished v14 candidate, use the [wheel or source-based Compose instructions above](#getting-started-with-v14).

| Channel | Command | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **npx** (Node) | `npx -y total-agent-memory connect claude-code` | Zero-install. Bootstraps a Python venv in `~/.tam/.venv` via uv (or python3 fallback), pulls the PyPI server, wires the MCP entry into your IDE. Replace `claude-code` with `codex` / `cursor` / `cline` / `continue` / `aider` / `windsurf` / `gemini-cli` / `opencode`. |
| **uvx** (Python via uv) | `uvx total-agent-memory` | One-off run with no install. Best for trying without commitment. |
| **pipx** (Python isolated) | `pipx install total-agent-memory` | Installs the `total-agent-memory`, `tam`, `tam-lookup`, `lookup-memory` binaries on PATH in an isolated venv. |
| **brew** (macOS / Linuxbrew) | `brew install vbcherepanov/tap/total-memory` | Bottle-style install with `tam` and legacy `claude-total-memory` symlinks. |
| **Docker** (multi-arch) | `docker run -p 37737:37737 -v ~/.tam:/data ghcr.io/vbcherepanov/total-agent-memory:14.5.1` | Containerized (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64). Dashboard on `:37737`. |
| **Claude Code plugin** | `/plugin marketplace add vbcherepanov/total-agent-memory`<br>`/plugin install total-agent-memory@vbcherepanov` | Installs the MCP server, the `memory-protocol` skill and all seven capture hooks in one step, from inside Claude Code. The bootstrap reuses an existing install if it finds one, so nothing is downloaded twice. |
| **Manual clone** | `git clone https://github.com/vbcherepanov/total-agent-memory ~/total-agent-memory && cd ~/total-agent-memory && ./install.sh --ide claude-code` | Full control. Lets you hack on the server, run benchmarks, and pick which background services to enable. Detailed walkthrough below. |

All seven channels land at the same MCP server. The `npx` and `./install.sh` paths
additionally configure IDE-specific MCP entries and hooks. Other channels start
the server bare — you wire the IDE afterwards (see [`docs/installation.md`](docs/installation.md)).

**The reranker is an extra, not a dependency.** A base install is 97 packages
and ~113 MB of wheels: fastembed runs the embeddings through ONNX and no torch
is resolved anywhere. The CrossEncoder / BGE reranker needs the torch stack,
which on Linux drags in the whole `nvidia-cu*` set — 147 packages and ~3.1 GB —
so it ships separately, and the default `MEMORY_MODE=fast` does not use it. Turn
it on with `MEMORY_MODE=deep` (or `MEMORY_RERANK_ENABLED=true`) and install it:

```bash
pip install "total-agent-memory[rerank]"      # pip / uvx / pipx
pip install -r requirements-rerank.txt        # clone / Docker
```

**Upgrade from v11.x?** Whatever channel you pick will auto-migrate
`~/.claude-memory/` → `~/.tam/` on first run and keep a symlink for backward
compat. No manual data move required.

---

### Detailed paths (manual / Docker / per-IDE)

Two manual paths. Same 74 tools, same dashboard, different deployment shapes.

### IDE matrix (v10.5)

The same MCP server, same tools, same protocol — different installation
locations and hook wiring per IDE. The installer (`install.sh --ide <name>`)
automates all of it.

| IDE | Skill API | Hook API | Sub-agents | Install command |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|
| Claude Code | ✅ | ✅ full | ✅ | `./install.sh --ide claude-code` |
| Codex CLI | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | `./install.sh --ide codex` |
| Cursor | rules-pane | ❌ | composer | `./install.sh --ide cursor` |
| Cline (VS Code) | `.clinerules/` | ❌ | ❌ | `./install.sh --ide cline` |
| Continue | rules file | ❌ | ❌ | `./install.sh --ide continue` |
| Aider | `.aider.conf.yml` read | ❌ ¹ | ❌ | `./install.sh --ide aider` |
| Windsurf | `.windsurfrules` | ❌ | cascade | `./install.sh --ide windsurf` |
| Gemini CLI | `.gemini/rules/` | ⚠️ partial | ❌ | `./install.sh --ide gemini-cli` |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/skills/` | ✅ | custom | `./install.sh --ide opencode` |

¹ Aider has no MCP yet — the bridge is via `lookup_memory.sh` /
`save_memory.sh` shell scripts.

Full per-IDE setup, manual fallbacks, and template snippets:
[`skills/memory-protocol/references/ide-setup.md`](skills/memory-protocol/references/ide-setup.md).

### Platform matrix

| OS | Command | Background services |
|---|---|---|
| macOS 10.15+ | `./install.sh --ide claude-code` | LaunchAgents (`launchctl`) |
| Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, Fedora 38+) | `./install.sh --ide claude-code` | systemd `--user` |
| WSL2 (Windows 11 + Ubuntu/Debian) | `./install.sh --ide claude-code` | systemd `--user` — requires `/etc/wsl.conf` with `[boot] systemd=true`; otherwise falls back to shell-loop autostart |
| Windows 10/11 native | `.\install.ps1 -Ide claude-code` | Task Scheduler |

Full per-platform walkthrough, WSL2 Windows-host-vs-WSL IDE nuances, the
`wsl -e` MCP-command pattern, IDE coverage matrix, and uninstall/diagnostic
flows: **[docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md)**.

### Path A — native (macOS / Linux / WSL2)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vbcherepanov/total-agent-memory.git ~/total-agent-memory
cd ~/total-agent-memory
bash install.sh --ide claude-code   # or: cursor | gemini-cli | opencode | codex
```

The installer:

1. Clones + creates `~/total-agent-memory/.venv/`
2. Installs deps from `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`
3. Pre-downloads the FastEmbed multilingual MiniLM model
4. Registers the MCP server via `claude mcp add-json memory ...` (stored in `~/.claude.json`, the canonical store Claude Code actually reads)
5. Copies **all hooks** (`session-*`, `user-prompt-submit.sh`, `post-tool-use.sh`, `pre-edit.sh`, `on-bash-error.sh`, etc.) into `~/.claude/hooks/` and registers them in `~/.claude/settings.json`
6. Grants `permissions.allow` for 20+ `mcp__memory__*` tools so hook-driven calls don't prompt for confirmation
7. Installs **background services** for the current OS:
   - **macOS** — 4 LaunchAgents (`reflection`, `orphan-backfill`, `check-updates`, `dashboard`) under `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`
   - **Linux / WSL2** — 7 systemd `--user` units (`*.service`, `*.timer`, `*.path`) under `~/.config/systemd/user/`; gracefully degrades if `systemd --user` is unavailable (WSL without `/etc/wsl.conf`)
8. Applies all migrations to a fresh `memory.db`
9. Starts the dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:37737`

Restart Claude Code → `/mcp` → `memory` should show **Connected** with 74 tools.

### Path A — native (Windows 10/11)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/vbcherepanov/total-agent-memory.git $HOME\total-agent-memory
cd $HOME\total-agent-memory
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1 -Ide claude-code
```

Same 9 steps as Unix, but:

- MCP config path is `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json` (or `.cursor\mcp.json`, etc.)
- Hooks copied to `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\hooks\` — `.ps1` versions (auto-capture, memory-trigger, user-prompt-submit, post-tool-use, pre-edit, on-bash-error, session-start/end, on-stop, codex-notify)
- Background services via **Task Scheduler**:
  - `total-agent-memory-reflection` — every 5 min (no native FileSystemWatcher equivalent)
  - `total-agent-memory-orphan-backfill` — daily 00:00 + 6h repetition
  - `total-agent-memory-check-updates` — weekly Mon 09:00
  - `TotalAgentMemoryDashboard` — AtLogon

### Uninstall

All installers preserve `~/.tam/memory.db` (legacy installs: `~/.claude-memory/memory.db`) and your config files; only services + hook registrations are removed.

```bash
./install.sh --uninstall          # macOS/Linux/WSL2 — removes LaunchAgents OR systemd units
.\install.ps1 -Uninstall          # Windows — unregisters Scheduled Tasks + cleans settings.json
```

### Diagnose

One-shot health check — prints ✓/✗ for each subsystem (OS detect, venv, MCP import, services, dashboard HTTP, Ollama, DB migrations):

```bash
bash scripts/diagnose.sh          # macOS / Linux / WSL2
.\scripts\diagnose.ps1            # Windows
```

Exit code 0 = all green, 1 = something broken.

### Path B — Docker (everything containerized, cross-platform)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vbcherepanov/total-agent-memory.git
cd total-agent-memory
bash install-docker.sh --with-compose
```

Brings up 5 services:

| Service | Role | Exposed |
|---|---|---|
| `mcp` | MCP server (HTTP transport) | `127.0.0.1:3737/mcp` |
| `dashboard` | Web UI | `127.0.0.1:37737` |
| `ollama` | Local LLM runtime | `127.0.0.1:11434` |
| `reflection` | File-watch queue drainer | internal |
| `scheduler` | Ofelia cron (backfill + update check) | internal |

First run pulls `qwen2.5-coder:7b` (~4.7 GB) + `nomic-embed-text` (~275 MB) — 5–10 min cold start.

**GPU note:** Docker Desktop on macOS doesn't forward Metal. Native install is faster on Mac. On Linux with NVIDIA Container Toolkit, uncomment the `deploy.resources.reservations.devices` block in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Verify (both paths)

```
memory_save(content="install works", type="fact")
memory_stats()
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:37737/> — dashboard, knowledge graph, token savings.

---

## Quick start

> **v11 default is `MEMORY_MODE=fast`.** No LLM, no Ollama, no network in the save/search/recall hot path. To restore v10.5 synchronous-LLM behaviour set `export MEMORY_MODE=deep`. Mode switching: [`LAUNCH.md` § Tuning](LAUNCH.md#tuning-v110).

Once installed, in any Claude Code / Codex CLI / Cursor session:

**1. Resume where you left off** (auto on session start, but you can also invoke)

```
session_init(project="my-api")
→ {summary: "yesterday: migrated auth middleware to JWT",
   next_steps: ["update OpenAPI spec", "notify frontend team"],
   pitfalls: ["don't revert migration 0042 — dev DB already migrated"]}
```

**2. Save a decision (agent does this automatically after hooks are registered)**

```
memory_save(
  type="decision",
  content="Chose pgvector over ChromaDB for multi-tenant RLS",
  context="WHY: single Postgres instance, per-tenant row-level security",
  project="my-api",
  tags=["database", "multi-tenant"],
)
```

**3. Recall across sessions / projects**

```
memory_recall(query="vector database choice", project="my-api", limit=5)
→ RRF-fused results from 6 retrieval tiers
```

**4. Predict approach before starting a task**

```
workflow_predict(task_description="migrate auth middleware to JWT-only")
→ {confidence: 0.82, predicted_steps: [...], similar_past: [...]}
```

**5. Check a file's risk before editing** (auto via hook, also manual)

```
file_context(path="/Users/me/my-api/src/auth/middleware.go")
→ {risk_score: 0.71, warnings: ["last 3 edits caused test failures in ..."], hot_spots: [...]}
```

**6. Get full stats**

```
memory_stats()
→ {sessions: 515, knowledge: {active: 1859, ...}, storage_mb: 119.5, ...}
```

---

## CLI: `lookup-memory` for sub-agents

**New in v9.** Bash-friendly memory search for sub-agent workflows where launching the full MCP server would be overkill (e.g. `Bash(lookup-memory "fix slow Wave query")` from inside a Claude Code agent prompt).

Two equivalent commands ship with the package (registered as `[project.scripts]` entries — installed automatically by `./install.sh` or `./update.sh`):

```bash
lookup-memory "Caroline researched"          # human-readable bullets
tam-lookup "Caroline researched"             # short canonical alias
ctm-lookup "Caroline researched"             # legacy alias (v11.x and earlier)

lookup-memory --project myproj --limit 5 "auth flow"
lookup-memory --type solution --tag reusable "fix bug"
lookup-memory --json "claude code hooks"     # structured stdout for piping
```

**How it works:** opens the same `$TAM_MEMORY_DIR/memory.db` (legacy: `$CLAUDE_MEMORY_DIR/memory.db`) the running MCP server uses → BM25 ranking via FTS5 → falls back to LIKE on older DBs. **Zero deps beyond the package.** No Ollama, no rag_chat.py, no ChromaDB required for the CLI path. Works on macOS, Linux, Windows.

```text
$ lookup-memory --project locomo_0 --limit 2 "adoption"
1. [synthesized_fact|locomo_0] Caroline is researching adoption agencies.
2. [synthesized_fact|locomo_0] Melanie congratulates Caroline on her adoption.
```

**Why three names?** `lookup-memory` matches the legacy bash script that older docs and sub-agent prompts reference (`~/claude-memory-server/ollama/lookup_memory.sh`, legacy install path). `tam-lookup` is the new project-prefixed canonical form (v12+). `ctm-lookup` is the v11.x prefixed name, kept as a legacy alias. All three call into `total_agent_memory.lookup:main` (v11.x and earlier: `claude_total_memory.lookup:main`, still importable via deprecation shim).

**Migration note:** v7/v8 docs that pointed at `~/claude-memory-server/ollama/lookup_memory.sh` should be updated — the bash version still works for users with a manual install, but `./install.sh` / `./update.sh` clients on v9+ now get `lookup-memory` (and `tam-lookup`) on PATH directly via the package's `[project.scripts]` entry.

## MCP tools reference (74 tools)

### Tool categories

**Core retrieval (9):** `memory_save`, `memory_recall`, `memory_get`, `memory_update`, `memory_delete`, `memory_history`, `memory_extract_session`, `memory_relate`, `memory_search_by_tag`

**Knowledge graph (8):** `kg_add_fact`, `kg_invalidate_fact`, `kg_at`, `kg_timeline`, `memory_graph`, `memory_graph_index`, `memory_graph_stats`, `memory_concepts`

**Episodic / session (6):** `memory_episode_save`, `memory_episode_recall`, `session_init`, `session_end`, `memory_timeline`, `memory_history`

**Procedural / workflows (4):** `workflow_learn`, `workflow_predict`, `workflow_track`, `classify_task`

**Task phases (4, v8.0):** `task_create`, `phase_transition`, `task_phases_list`, `complete_task`

**Decisions (1, v8.0):** `save_decision`

**Intents (3, v8.0):** `save_intent`, `list_intents`, `search_intents`

**Self-improvement (5):** `self_rules`, `self_rules_context`, `self_insight`, `self_patterns`, `self_error_log`, `rule_set_phase` (v8.0)

**Pre-edit guard / error learning (3):** `file_context`, `learn_error`, `self_error_log`

**Analogy / cross-project (2):** `analogize`, `ingest_codebase`

**Reflection / consolidation (4):** `memory_reflect_now`, `memory_consolidate`, `memory_forget`, `memory_observe`

**Stats / export (5):** `memory_stats`, `memory_export`, `memory_self_assess`, `memory_context_build`, `benchmark`

**Skills (3):** `memory_skill_get`, `memory_skill_update`, `file_context`

Total: **74 tools.** Each is documented below with input schema and example.

Every tool carries MCP behaviour annotations — 38 are marked `readOnlyHint`,
and `memory_delete` / `memory_forget` / `memory_update` / `kg_invalidate_fact`
plus the two rebuild tools are marked `destructiveHint`. Clients use these to
decide what may run without a confirmation prompt. Tools that answer in JSON
also return it as `structuredContent`, so you do not have to parse the text.

### Token-efficient 3-layer workflow

When you only know the topic but not which records matter, use progressive disclosure:

1. **Index** — `memory_recall(query="auth refactor", mode="index", limit=20)` → ~2 KB of `{id, title, score, type, project, created_at}` per hit. No content, no cognitive expansion.
2. **Timeline** — `memory_recall(query="auth refactor", mode="timeline", limit=5, neighbors=2)` → top-K hits padded with ±neighbours from the same session, sorted chronologically.
3. **Fetch** — `memory_get(ids=[3622, 3606])` → full content for ONLY the IDs you chose (max 50 per call, `detail="summary"` truncates to 150 chars).

**Typical saving:** 80-90 %% fewer tokens vs `memory_recall(detail="full", limit=20)` when you end up using 2-3 of the 20 hits.

## TypeScript SDK

For Node.js / browser / any TS project that isn't an MCP-native agent:

```bash
npm i @vbch/total-agent-memory-client
```

```ts
import { connectStdio } from "@vbch/total-agent-memory-client";

const memory = await connectStdio();

await memory.save({
  type: "decision",
  content: "Picked pgvector over ChromaDB for multi-tenant RLS",
  project: "my-api",
});

const hits = await memory.recallFlat({
  query: "vector database choice",
  project: "my-api",
  limit: 5,
});
```

Also ships LangChain adapter example, procedural-memory integration, and HTTP transport (for team / serverless setups).

## Dashboard (localhost:37737)

- **`/`** — live stats, queue depths, token savings from filters, representation coverage
- **`/graph/live`** — 3D WebGL force-graph (Three.js), 3,500+ nodes / 120,000+ edges, click-to-focus, type filters, search
- **`/graph/hive`** — D3 hive plot, nodes on radial axes by type
- **`/graph/matrix`** — canvas adjacency matrix sorted by type
- **`/knowledge`** — paginated knowledge browser, tag filters
- **`/sessions`** — last 50 sessions with summaries + next steps
- **`/errors`** — consolidated error patterns
- **`/rules`** — active behavioral rules + fire counts
- **SSE-pill in header** — live reconnect indicator

Screenshots → the dashboard is at `http://localhost:37737` once installed.

---

## Update

```bash
cd ~/total-agent-memory   # legacy clones: ~/claude-memory-server
./update.sh
```

**7 stages:**

1. **Pre-flight** — disk check + DB snapshot (keeps last 7)
2. **Source pull** (git) or SHA-256-verified tarball
3. **Deps** — `pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt` (only if hash changed)
4. **Full pytest suite** — aborts with snapshot if red
5. **Schema migrations** — `python src/tools/version_status.py`
6. **LaunchAgent reload** — reflection + backfill + update-check
7. **MCP reconnect notification** — in-app `/mcp` → `memory` → Reconnect

Manual equivalent:

```bash
cd ~/total-agent-memory   # legacy clones: ~/claude-memory-server
git pull
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
.venv/bin/python src/tools/version_status.py
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/
# in Claude Code: /mcp → memory → Reconnect
```

## Upgrading from v8.x to v9.0

v9 is **backward compatible**. Existing v8 calls and DB schema work unchanged — v9 is an infra release that adds pluggable backends, a public CLI for sub-agents, and LoCoMo benchmark wiring. Nothing is forcibly enabled.

### One-command upgrade

```bash
cd ~/total-agent-memory && ./update.sh   # legacy clones: ~/claude-memory-server
# pulls v9 src, installs new entry-points (tam, tam-lookup, lookup-memory; legacy: ctm-lookup),
# keeps existing memory.db untouched.
```

After upgrade, verify the new CLI is on PATH:

```bash
lookup-memory --limit 1 "any-query-from-your-history"
```

### What's new (no action required)

- **`lookup-memory` / `tam-lookup` / `ctm-lookup` (legacy)** CLI now installed alongside `total-agent-memory` MCP server (registered as `[project.scripts]` so `./install.sh` and `./update.sh` put them on PATH automatically). Sub-agent prompts that reference the legacy `~/claude-memory-server/ollama/lookup_memory.sh` script keep working; new prompts should prefer the package-installed name.
- **Embedding backends** stay on `fastembed` by default. Switch via `V9_EMBED_BACKEND=openai-3-large` (set `MEMORY_EMBED_API_KEY`) — costs ~$0.10/5k rows for re-embed, expected R@5 lift on conversational data.
- **Reranker backend** stays on `ce-marco` by default. `V9_RERANKER_BACKEND=bge-v2-m3` (or `off`) switches at runtime.
- **Subject-aware retrieval** is opt-in via `--subject-aware` in `benchmarks/locomo_bench_llm.py`. Future: surface as MCP tool flag.
- **No migrations.** Schema unchanged from v8.

### What requires manual action

- **Re-embed** (only if switching embedding model, otherwise skip):
  ```bash
  python -m scripts.reembed --backend openai-3-large --confirm
  ```
- **Old bash sub-agent prompts** that hardcode `~/claude-memory-server/ollama/lookup_memory.sh "query"` will keep working. To ride the new package install, replace with `lookup-memory "query"`.

### Breaking changes

None. All v8 MCP tools, env vars, hooks, and DB tables behave identically.

---

## Upgrading from v7.x to v8.0

v8.0 is **backward compatible** — your existing v7 installation keeps working unchanged. All new features are opt-in via MCP tool calls or env vars.

### One-command upgrade

```bash
cd ~/total-agent-memory && ./update.sh   # legacy clones: ~/claude-memory-server
# Applies migrations 011-013 idempotently, restarts LaunchAgents, updates dependencies
```

Then restart Claude Code: `/mcp restart memory`.

### What changes automatically

- **Migrations 011–013** apply on MCP startup (privacy_counters, task_phases, intents). Zero-downtime, idempotent.
- **Existing `memory_save`** calls keep working — they now additionally strip `<private>...</private>` sections if present.
- **Existing `memory_recall`** calls keep working — default mode is still `"search"`. New `mode="index"` is opt-in.
- **Existing `session_end`** calls keep working — `auto_compress=False` by default. Pass `auto_compress=True` to opt in.
- **Existing `self_rules_context`** calls keep working — default returns all rules (no phase filter).

### What requires manual setup

**1. Cloud providers** (only if you want to replace/augment Ollama):
```bash
export MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=openai       # or "anthropic"
export MEMORY_LLM_API_KEY=sk-...
export MEMORY_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini     # or "claude-haiku-4-5"
```
See [Cloud providers](#cloud-providers-optional) for OpenRouter / per-phase routing / Cohere examples.

**2. Install additional hooks** (for UserPromptSubmit capture + citation):
```bash
./install.sh --ide claude-code   # re-run installer; it now registers user-prompt-submit.sh hook
```
The hook is additive — existing hooks keep working.

**3. activeContext.md Obsidian integration** (if you want markdown projection):
```bash
export MEMORY_ACTIVECONTEXT_VAULT=~/Documents/project/Projects   # default
# Disable: export MEMORY_ACTIVECONTEXT_DISABLE=1
```
Each `session_end` writes `<vault>/<project>/activeContext.md`.

### Breaking changes

**None.** All v7 MCP tool signatures are preserved. New parameters are optional with safe defaults.

### Embedding dimension note

If you switch to a cloud embedding provider (`MEMORY_EMBED_PROVIDER=openai/cohere`), the server **will refuse to start** if existing DB embeddings have a different dimension than the new provider returns. This is deliberate — it prevents silent data corruption.

Either:
- Keep `MEMORY_EMBED_PROVIDER=fastembed` (default 384d) and only change the LLM provider, OR
- Re-embed the DB: `python src/tools/reembed.py --provider openai --model text-embedding-3-small`

### New MCP tools in v8.0

Quick reference — see full docs in [MCP tools reference](#mcp-tools-reference-74-tools):

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `classify_task(description)` | Returns {level 1-4, suggested_phases, estimated_tokens} |
| `task_create(task_id, description)` | Starts state machine in "van" phase |
| `phase_transition(task_id, new_phase, artifacts?)` | Moves task through van/plan/creative/build/reflect/archive |
| `task_phases_list(task_id)` | Chronological phase history |
| `save_decision(title, options, criteria_matrix, selected, rationale, ...)` | Structured decision with per-criterion indexing |
| `memory_get(ids, detail)` | Batched full-content fetch for IDs from `memory_recall(mode="index")` |
| `save_intent` / `list_intents` / `search_intents` | UserPromptSubmit-captured prompts |
| `rule_set_phase(rule_id, phase)` | Tag a rule for phase-scoped loading |

Extended tools:
- `memory_recall(mode="index"|"timeline", decisions_only=False, ...)` — 3-layer token-efficient workflow
- `session_end(auto_compress=True, transcript=None, ...)` — LLM-generated summary
- `self_rules_context(phase="build"|"plan"|...)` — phase filter
- `save_knowledge(...)` — now strips `<private>...</private>` sections automatically

### Rollback plan

v8.0 doesn't remove any v7 functionality. If you hit an issue, you can:

1. Set env var to revert behaviour:
   ```bash
   export MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama           # revert to local LLM
   export MEMORY_EMBED_PROVIDER=fastembed      # revert to local embeddings
   export MEMORY_ACTIVECONTEXT_DISABLE=1       # disable markdown projection
   export MEMORY_POST_TOOL_CAPTURE=0           # disable opt-in capture (default anyway)
   ```

2. Migrations 011/012/013 are additive (no `DROP` / `ALTER` on existing tables), so DB downgrade is not destructive — old code continues reading older tables.

3. Worst case: `git checkout v7.0.0 && ./update.sh --skip-migrations`.

---

## Ollama setup (optional but recommended)

**Without Ollama:** works fully — raw content is saved, retrieval via BM25 + FastEmbed dense embeddings.

**With Ollama:** you also get LLM-generated summaries, keywords, question-forms, compressed representations, and deep enrichment (entities, intent, topics).

```bash
brew install ollama     # or: curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama serve &
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b        # default — best quality/speed on M-series
ollama pull nomic-embed-text        # optional, alternative embedder
```

### Cloud providers (optional)

Use OpenAI, Anthropic, or any OpenAI-compat endpoint (OpenRouter, Together, Groq, DeepSeek, LM Studio, llama.cpp) instead of local Ollama.

**OpenAI:**
```bash
export MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=openai
export MEMORY_LLM_API_KEY=sk-...
export MEMORY_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

**Anthropic:**
```bash
export MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic
export MEMORY_LLM_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export MEMORY_LLM_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5
```

**OpenRouter (100+ models via one endpoint):**
```bash
export MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=openai
export MEMORY_LLM_API_BASE=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
export MEMORY_LLM_API_KEY=sk-or-...
export MEMORY_LLM_MODEL=anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5
```

**Per-phase routing** (cheap model for bulk, quality for compression):
```bash
export MEMORY_TRIPLE_PROVIDER=openai
export MEMORY_TRIPLE_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
export MEMORY_ENRICH_PROVIDER=anthropic
export MEMORY_ENRICH_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5
```

**Embeddings** (dimension must match existing DB or re-embed required):
```bash
export MEMORY_EMBED_PROVIDER=openai
export MEMORY_EMBED_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small  # 1536d
# or Cohere:
export MEMORY_EMBED_PROVIDER=cohere
export MEMORY_EMBED_API_KEY=...
```

### Model choice

| Model | Size | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `qwen2.5-coder:7b` | 4.7 GB | **default** — best quality/speed ratio |
| `qwen2.5-coder:32b` | 19 GB | highest quality, needs 32 GB+ RAM |
| `llama3.1:8b` | 4.9 GB | general-purpose alternative |
| `phi3:mini` | 2.3 GB | low-RAM machines |

---

## Configuration

Environment variables (all optional):

### v11.0 — Memory mode + multi-embedding-space

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MEMORY_MODE` | `fast` | `ultrafast\|fast\|balanced\|deep`. Selects hot-path profile. See [Performance tuning](#performance-tuning). |
| `MEMORY_USE_LLM_IN_HOT_PATH` | `false` | Master switch for sync LLM stages in `save_knowledge` / `Recall.search`. `MEMORY_MODE=deep` flips this to `true`. |
| `MEMORY_ALLOW_OLLAMA_IN_HOT_PATH` | `false` | Re-enables the silent FastEmbed → Ollama fallback ladder when FastEmbed is unavailable. |
| `MEMORY_NEGATIVE_RETRIEVAL` | `true` | `memory_answer` runs the contradiction-seeking second search (one inversion call + one batched scoring call over at most 5×5 pairs). `false` skips it. |
| `MEMORY_CONTRADICTION_POLICY` | `resolve` | What `memory_answer` does when that search finds a hard contradiction. `resolve` hands both sides, with their recording dates, to the reader, which answers with the latest value and names the one it replaced. `abstain` answers *Not enough information* without reading (the 14.1.0 behaviour). |
| `MEMORY_CONTRADICTION_SCORER` | `llm` | Who scores the (supporting, opposing) pairs of that search. `llm` uses the reasoning provider. `jev` sends every pair as one `noul` question in a single request to TypeSafe's System One API (model Jev); needs `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`. If the scorer fails, the pass reports *no contradiction* and the answer proceeds. |
| `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` | _unset_ | Key for `MEMORY_CONTRADICTION_SCORER=jev`. Empty keys and keys with control characters are rejected before any request, without echoing the key. |
| `TYPESAFE_BASE_URL` / `TYPESAFE_DEFAULT_MODEL` | `https://api.typesafe.ai` / `jev-latest` | Endpoint and model for the Jev scorer (self-hosted servers speaking `/v1/systemone` work too). |
| `MEMORY_RERANK_ENABLED` | `false` | Honour caller's `rerank=true`. When `false`, CrossEncoder rerank is hard-disabled even if a tool call requests it. |
| `MEMORY_ENRICHMENT_ENABLED` | `false` | Run the async enrichment worker. Default-ON in `balanced` / `deep`. |
| `MEMORY_TEXT_EMBED_MODEL` | `sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` | Model for `embedding_space=text` (every record that is not code, log or config). For an English-only store, `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` retrieves better (LoCoMo evidence in context 81.8% → 86.2%) but handles other languages poorly. Changing it on an existing store needs `python src/reembed.py --fastembed`. `FASTEMBED_MODEL` and `MEMORY_EMBED_MODEL`, the older names, still win when set. |
| `MEMORY_CROSS_RERANK` | `auto` | Local cross-encoder over the 50 fused candidates of `memory_recall`. `auto` re-ranks once the model has loaded in the background, `on` waits for it, `off` keeps the fused order. |
| `MEMORY_CROSS_RERANK_MODEL` | `Xenova/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` | English-only models are skipped for queries written mostly outside the Latin script; `jinaai/jina-reranker-v2-base-multilingual` covers other languages. |
| `MEMORY_CROSS_RERANK_CONTEXT` | `400` | Characters of the previous and next turn of the same session the cross-encoder also reads with each candidate, so an answer like "It was about acceptance" is found for "What was the poetry reading about?". `0` scores each record alone. |
| `MEMORY_CONTEXT_RESOLVE_DATES` | `on` | In `memory_recall(mode="context")`, follow relative date phrases with the date they denote, counted from the record's leading timestamp or its `created_at`: "last Thursday [Thu 14 December 2023]", "last week [the week before Sun 17 December 2023]". English and Russian phrases. `off` returns the records as stored. |
| `MEMORY_CODE_EMBED_MODEL` | _empty → falls back to TEXT model_ | Model for `embedding_space=code`. The row still records `space=code` so a future swap is config-only. |
| `MEMORY_LOG_EMBED_MODEL` | _empty → TEXT_ | Model for `embedding_space=log`. |
| `MEMORY_CONFIG_EMBED_MODEL` | _empty → TEXT_ | Model for `embedding_space=config`. |
| `MEMORY_DEFAULT_EMBEDDING_SPACE` | `text` | Space for unclassified content. |

### v10 + earlier

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MEMORY_DB` | `~/.tam/memory.db` (legacy installs: `~/.claude-memory/memory.db`) | SQLite location |
| `MEMORY_LLM_ENABLED` | `auto` | `auto\|true\|false\|force` — LLM enrichment toggle |
| `MEMORY_LLM_MODEL` | `qwen2.5-coder:7b` | Ollama model for enrichment |
| `MEMORY_LLM_PROBE_TTL_SEC` | `60` | Cache TTL for Ollama availability probe |
| `MEMORY_LLM_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `60` | Global fallback timeout for Ollama requests (s) |
| `MEMORY_TRIPLE_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `30` | Timeout for deep triple extraction (s) |
| `MEMORY_ENRICH_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `45` | Timeout for deep enrichment (s) |
| `MEMORY_REPR_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `60` | Timeout for representation generation (s) |
| `MEMORY_TRIPLE_MAX_PREDICT` | `2048` | `num_predict` cap for triple extraction |
| `OLLAMA_URL` | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama endpoint |
| `MEMORY_EMBED_MODE` | `fastembed` | `fastembed\|sentence-transformers\|ollama` |
| `DASHBOARD_PORT` | `37737` | HTTP dashboard port |
| `MEMORY_MCP_PORT` | `3737` | HTTP MCP transport port (Docker path) |
| `MEMORY_ASYNC_ENRICHMENT` | `false` | **v10.1** — move quality gate / contradiction / entity dedup / episodic / wiki to a background worker. See [Performance tuning](#performance-tuning) |
| `MEMORY_ENRICH_TICK_SEC` | `0.1` | Worker tick interval (clamp `0.01..5`) |
| `MEMORY_ENRICH_BATCH` | `5` | Rows claimed per tick (clamp `1..50`) |
| `MEMORY_ENRICH_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | `3` | Retries before flipping a row to `failed` |
| `MEMORY_ENRICH_STALE_AFTER_SEC` | `60` | Seconds before a `processing` row is reclaimed (worker crash recovery) |

> CPU-only / WSL hosts: if Ollama keeps timing out, lower `MEMORY_TRIPLE_MAX_PREDICT` before raising timeouts. `install-codex.sh` writes conservative defaults automatically. **For 30-40s save latency on WSL2 → set `MEMORY_ASYNC_ENRICHMENT=true`** — see below.

Full config: see `total_agent_memory/config.py`.

## Performance tuning

### v11.0 fast-mode hot path (default)

When `MEMORY_MODE=fast` (default):

| metric              |   p50 |   p95 |   p99 |
|---------------------|------:|------:|------:|
| `save_fast`         |  6.2  |  8.9  | 11.4  |
| `save_fast` cached  |  0.3  |  0.4  |  1.4  |
| `search_fast`       |  3.4  |  4.7  |  6.0  |
| `cached_search`     |  3.1  |  3.4  |  3.6  |

`llm_calls=0`, `network_calls=0`. Reproduce: `./bin/memory-bench`. Regression gate: `./bin/memory-perf-gate`. Architecture rationale and per-stage audit: [`docs/v11/audit.md`](docs/v11/audit.md). Raw bench artifact: [`docs/v11/benchmark.md`](docs/v11/benchmark.md).

If your numbers do not match the table, run `./bin/memory-bench --warmup` first — cold FastEmbed import dominates the first call.

### Legacy: v10.5 deep-mode `memory_save` latency

The synchronous v10 hot path runs five LLM-bound stages inline so a `drop` verdict can block the INSERT and a contradiction supersede commits in the same transaction. On macOS with a warm Ollama that's ~340 ms median; on a WSL2 box without GPU/CoreML each LLM round-trip can stretch the same call into 30–40 seconds.

v10.1 ships an opt-in **inbox/outbox worker** that moves the heavy stages out of band:

```
sync   : privacy → canonical_tags → INSERT → embed → enqueue → return
worker : quality_gate → entity_dedup_audit → contradiction → episodic → wiki
```

Enable it in your env:

```bash
export MEMORY_ASYNC_ENRICHMENT=true
# Optional knobs (defaults shown):
export MEMORY_ENRICH_TICK_SEC=0.1
export MEMORY_ENRICH_BATCH=5
export MEMORY_ENRICH_MAX_ATTEMPTS=3
export MEMORY_ENRICH_STALE_AFTER_SEC=60
```

Restart the MCP server. A background daemon thread now consumes `enrichment_queue`; you can watch it on the dashboard panel **⚡ v10.1 enrichment worker**.

### Bench v10.5 (10-record corpus × 2 rounds, with LLM stages on)

`memory_save` latency:

| | min | p50 | **p95** | **p99** | max | mean |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **sync** (default) | 17.5 ms | 25.3 ms | **2150.5 ms** | **2179.0 ms** | 2186.1 ms | 348.0 ms |
| **async** (`MEMORY_ASYNC_ENRICHMENT=true`) | 18.1 ms | 22.3 ms | **26.7 ms** | **27.4 ms** | 27.5 ms | 22.7 ms |

`memory_recall` latency: p50 ≈ 3-5 ms in both modes (steady state),
with cold-cache p95 outliers on the first warmup hit.

**p95 collapses 80×** with async (`2150 ms → 27 ms`). On WSL2 with a
slow Ollama, the same shape holds — sync p95 of 30-40 s becomes
async p95 of ~300-1000 ms (LLM moves out of the hot path entirely).

Reproduce: `./.venv/bin/python benchmarks/v10_5_latency.py --rounds 2 --with-llm`.
Full report: [`benchmarks/v10_5_results.md`](benchmarks/v10_5_results.md).

### Trade-off — soft drop semantic

When async is on, a `quality_gate` `drop` no longer prevents the INSERT (we already committed in the sync path). Instead the row is marked `status='quality_dropped'` after the worker scores it. `memory_recall` ignores that status (`idx_knowledge_status_quality` is added in migration 020). Audit history stays in `quality_gate_log` so nothing is lost.

If you need strict pre-INSERT gating (e.g. compliance), keep the default sync path.

### Crash recovery

Rows stuck in `processing` longer than `MEMORY_ENRICH_STALE_AFTER_SEC` (default 60 s) are flipped back to `pending` automatically — covers worker process kills mid-stage. The pre-existing `write_intents` outbox still covers a crash *before* INSERT.

## Roadmap

### Shipped in v13.0.0 (2026-08-27)
- ✅ **MCP SDK 2.x compatibility** — the blocker: every install created after
  `mcp` 2.0 shipped was dead on arrival. Tools register through either SDK era;
  dependency bounded `>=1.9,<3`.
- ✅ **Protocol revision 2026-07-28** — stateless era served end-to-end
  (`tools/list` / `server/discover` / `tools/call` with no handshake), legacy
  handshake era from the same process, `structuredContent` on JSON-answering
  tools, behaviour annotations on all 74.
- ✅ **Claude Code plugin** — `/plugin install total-agent-memory@vbcherepanov`
  wires the MCP server, the skill and seven hooks in one step.
- ✅ **Reproducible benchmarks** — `record_usage=False` stops runs from
  measuring their own history; category labels in the LoCoMo runner corrected.
- ✅ **BEAM (ICLR 2026)** added to the suite at 100K / 500K / 1M.
- ✅ **`tree-sitter-language-pack` is now an actual dependency** — AST ingest
  had been silently degrading to whole-file chunks for every user.
- ✅ **Enrichment worker owns its sqlite connection** — long ingests no longer
  die on `cannot start a transaction within a transaction`.

### Shipped in v11.0 (2026-04-27) — production memory engine
- ✅ **Default `MEMORY_MODE=fast`** — zero LLM, zero Ollama, zero network in save/search/recall hot path. Set `MEMORY_MODE=deep` to restore v10.5 behaviour.
- ✅ **Memory Core / AI Layer split** — `src/memory_core/*` is deterministic; `src/ai_layer/*` owns every LLM-bound code path. Enforced by `tests/test_no_llm_hot_path.py`.
- ✅ **4 modes**: `ultrafast` / `fast` / `balanced` / `deep`. Single env flag.
- ✅ **Multi-embedding-space contract** — every vector row records provider / model / dimension / space / content_type / language. Spaces: `text` / `code` / `log` / `config`. Single Chroma backend; per-space model swap is config-only.
- ✅ **Embed fallback ladder gated** — silent Ollama fallback in `Store.embed` requires `MEMORY_ALLOW_OLLAMA_IN_HOT_PATH=true`.
- ✅ **New MCP tools**: `memory_save_fast`, `memory_search_fast`, `memory_explain_search`, `memory_warmup`, `memory_perf_report`, `memory_rebuild_fts`, `memory_rebuild_embeddings`, `memory_eval_locomo`, `memory_eval_recall`, `memory_eval_temporal`, `memory_eval_entity_consistency`, `memory_eval_contradictions`, `memory_eval_long_context`.
- ✅ **Migrations 021 (embedding_spaces) + 022 (embedding_cache_v11)** — idempotent on next start.
- ✅ **Benchmark suite**: `bin/memory-bench` (artifact `docs/v11/benchmark.md`) + `bin/memory-perf-gate` for CI.

### Shipped in v10.5 (2026-04-27)
- ✅ **Universal `memory-protocol` skill** — single canonical SKILL.md + 4 references (tool cheatsheet for all MCP tools, workflow recipes for 15 common situations, hooks reference, per-IDE setup) + 4 templates (Claude Code settings.json, Codex config.toml, Cursor `.mdc`, Cline `.md`). Same content for every IDE; only the wiring differs.
- ✅ **`install.sh --ide` extended to 9 IDEs**: claude-code, codex, cursor, **cline**, **continue**, **aider**, **windsurf**, gemini-cli, opencode. New helpers: `register_mcp_cline / continue / aider / windsurf` + `_json_merge_mcp_nested` for the dotted-key case (`cline.mcpServers`).
- ✅ **Cross-platform hardening** — all bash scripts pass `bash -n` under macOS bash 3.2 (default). Replaced `${var,,}` lowercase bashism in `update.sh` with `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`. Verified with shellcheck.
- ✅ **Sub-agent memory protocol** — universal header for any sub-agent (`php-pro`, `golang-pro`, `vue-expert`, etc.) with mandatory `memory_recall` before / `memory_save` after. Full template in `skills/memory-protocol/references/subagent-protocol.md`.
- ✅ **v10.5 latency benchmark** — `benchmarks/v10_5_latency.py` with apples-to-apples sync vs async comparison. Demonstrates **80× p95 reduction** (`2150 ms → 27 ms`) when async is enabled with LLM stages on.

### Shipped in v10.1 (2026-04-27)
- ✅ **Async enrichment worker** — opt-in `MEMORY_ASYNC_ENRICHMENT=true` moves quality gate / entity dedup / contradiction detector / episodic linking / wiki refresh to a background thread. Drops max save latency 5.4× on macOS, 60–100× on WSL2. See [Performance tuning](#performance-tuning).
- ✅ **`enrichment_queue` table** with stale-processing recovery (rows stuck >60 s in `processing` flip back to `pending`).
- ✅ **Dashboard panel** for worker health: depth, throughput/min, p50/p95 ms per task, oldest pending age, recent failures.
- ✅ **`_binary_search` ValueError fix** — `np.argpartition` requires `kth STRICTLY < N`; tiny test projects (pool ≤ 50) used to silently break `contradiction_log`.
- ✅ **`coref_resolver` RU→EN translation fix** — prompt explicitly pins output language (`Do NOT translate`).

### Shipped in v10.0 (2026-04-27)
- ✅ **10 Beever-Atlas-inspired features in one push**: quality gate (Beever 6-Month Test), canonical tag vocabulary, importance boost in recall, opt-in coref resolution, contradiction auto-detection with supersede, write-intent outbox + reconciler, embedding-based entity dedup, episodic save events in the graph, smart query router (relational vs lexical), per-project Markdown wiki digest.
- ✅ 5 SQLite migrations (`015–019`) applied automatically on restart.
- ✅ 11 new env knobs, all with safe fail-open defaults.
- ✅ Tests: 971 → 1124 (+153).

### Shipped in v9.0 (2026-04-25)
- ✅ **`lookup-memory` / `tam-lookup` / `ctm-lookup` (legacy) CLI** — bash entry-point for sub-agents, registered as `[project.scripts]` and installed by `./install.sh` / `./update.sh` (replaces manual `~/claude-memory-server/ollama/lookup_memory.sh`)
- ✅ **Pluggable embedding backends**: `openai-3-small`, `openai-3-large` (3072d), `bge-m3`, `e5-large`, `locomo-tuned-minilm` (fine-tuned on user data)
- ✅ **Pluggable reranker backends**: `ce-marco`, `bge-v2-m3`, `bge-large`, `off` (env `V9_RERANKER_BACKEND`, hot-swap)
- ✅ **Subject-aware retrieval** — LLM extracts (subject, action) from question → SQL graph lookup → DIRECT FACTS prepended to context (LoCoMo cat 1/2 lift)
- ✅ **Judge-weighted ensemble** — category-aware scoring rubric + abstain logic for LoCoMo-style adversarial gold
- ✅ **Fine-tune embedding pipeline** (`scripts/finetune_embedding.py`) — mine triplets from your data, train on top of MiniLM via `sentence-transformers`
- ✅ **Few-shot pair mining** (`scripts/mine_locomo_fewshot.py`) — augment per-category prompts with held-in (Q,A) pairs
- ✅ **Schema-specific graph extractor** (closed canonical predicate vocabulary, optional)
- ✅ **SSL fix for macOS Python.org installs** — `urllib` requests now use certifi by default
- ✅ **HTTP retry with exponential backoff** for embedding providers (5xx/timeout)
- ✅ LoCoMo benchmark integration (`benchmarks/locomo_bench_llm.py` with 14 ablation flags)

### Shipped in v8.0 (2026-04-19)
- ✅ Task workflow phases (L1-L4 classifier + 6-phase state machine)
- ✅ Structured `save_decision` with criteria matrix + multi-representation criterion indexing
- ✅ Cloud LLM/embed providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, any OpenAI-compat)
- ✅ `session_end(auto_compress=True)` via LLM provider
- ✅ Progressive disclosure: `memory_recall(mode="index")` + `memory_get(ids)`
- ✅ `activeContext.md` Obsidian live-doc projection
- ✅ Phase-scoped rules via tag filter
- ✅ `<private>...</private>` inline redaction
- ✅ HTTP citation endpoints `/api/knowledge/{id}` + `/api/session/{id}`
- ✅ UserPromptSubmit + PostToolUse (opt-in) capture hooks
- ✅ Unified `install.sh --ide {claude-code|cursor|gemini-cli|opencode|codex}`

### Next — what the v13 numbers say to fix

The benchmarks point at specific gaps rather than a general "make retrieval
better", so the roadmap names them:

- **`instruction_following` R@5 = 0.075, `event_ordering` = 0.150 (BEAM).**
  These probes ask *whether a stated instruction was followed* or *in what
  order things happened*. Semantic similarity to the question does not find the
  message where the instruction was given — retrieval is the wrong primitive.
  Needs a directive index (statements of the form "always/never/from now on")
  and ordering-aware traversal over the episodic graph.
- **`multi-hop` R@5 = 0.413 (LoCoMo).** Weakest category, and the one where
  the leaders win. Query decomposition without putting an LLM back in the hot
  path is the open design question.
- **`single_session_preference` R@5 = 0.80 (LongMemEval), `preference_following`
  = 0.282 (BEAM).** The same weakness from two directions: preferences are
  stated once, in passing, and never restated.
- **BEAM-10M.** The 1M scale runs today; 10M is the interesting claim.
- **Search is linear in store size.** BEAM 1M measured p50 411 ms against 58 ms
  at 500K — `Store._binary_search` loads every active record's binary vector
  into numpy per query. An ANN index over those vectors is the obvious answer.
  This is the largest open performance item.
- ~~Profile the write path~~ — done in v13.0.1: `auto_link` constructed a
  `ConceptExtractor` per save and threw away its node cache, re-reading the
  whole `graph_nodes` table on every write.

### Planned
- GitHub Actions: install smoke tests + a nightly retrieval gate, so a
  regression in R@5 fails CI the way `bin/memory-perf-gate` already fails on
  latency.
- `has_llm()` per-phase provider caching.

### Under research
- "Endless mode" — continuous session without hard boundaries (virtual sessions by idle >N hours)
- MLX local LLM integration
- Speculative decoding for local path (+1.5-1.8× LLM speed)

## Philosophy

**MIT forever.** No commercial-license switch, no VC money, no dark patterns. The memory layer belongs to the developers using it, not to a SaaS vendor.

**Local-first is the product.** If you want a cloud memory service, mem0 and Supermemory are great. If you want your data on your disk, untouched by anyone else — this.

**Honest benchmarks.** Every number on this page is reproducible from the artifacts in `evals/` and the scripts in `benchmarks/`. If you can't reproduce a claim, open an issue — it's a bug.

## Contributing

- Open an issue before a large PR — saves everyone time.
- `pytest tests/` must stay green. Add tests for new tools.
- Update `evals/scenarios/*.json` if you change retrieval behavior.
- Docs-only / typo PRs welcome without discussion.
