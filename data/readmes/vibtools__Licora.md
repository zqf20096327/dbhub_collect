# Licora

**Licora** is an open-source, self-hosted PHP and MySQL/MariaDB central license management system for issuing software licenses, validating license access, binding licenses to API keys or application scopes, enforcing device limits, administering access, and auditing license activity.

Licora is maintained by **Vib Tools**. Vib Tools is a professional tools and digital services provider operating a secure online tools marketplace. The company provides secure online tools, license delivery, web services, marketing support, business consultation, and customer support for businesses and individuals.

> **Security notice:** this is security-sensitive server software. Review [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), [docs/SECURITY_DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/SECURITY_DEPLOYMENT.md), and [audit/FORENSIC_AUDIT_REPORT.md](audit/FORENSIC_AUDIT_REPORT.md) before exposing it to the internet.

## Key capabilities

- License creation with expiration periods, device limits, notes, application scopes, and optional API-key binding.
- API-key management with activation, expiry, request counters, and per-key metadata.
- License verification through a full API endpoint and a legacy/simple endpoint.
- Device registration, activity tracking, revocation, blacklist handling, and risk indicators.
- Role-aware admin panel for super administrators, managers, and viewers.
- Audit trail, operational logs, CSV exports, SQL backup generation, and health checks.
- Reload-free operational Dashboard with truthful license/device/API/expiration metrics, manual refresh, stale-data feedback, and source-separated API activity.
- CSRF tokens for admin mutations, prepared SQL statements, password hashing, rate limiting, and session hardening.
- Scheduled cleanup and expiring-license reporting through CLI cron scripts.
- Super-Admin-only Secure Update Center with signed GitHub release manifests, preflight, staged installation, persistent live logs, migration tracking, and rollback protection.
- Scoped server-to-server Admin License Control API for order-confirmation automation, exact app selection, validity/device limits, status/actions, key rotation and audited device revocation.

## Screenshots

Screenshots are intentionally left as release placeholders so deployments do not publish real license keys, API keys, device fingerprints, IP addresses, or admin identities.

```

The application is a server-rendered PHP project with no Composer runtime dependency. UI assets are loaded from public CDNs. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Requirements

- PHP 8.0 or later with `pdo_mysql`, `openssl`, and `json`. The in-app updater additionally requires `ZipArchive` and either cURL or HTTPS stream access (`allow_url_fopen`).
- MySQL or MariaDB with InnoDB and `utf8mb4` support.
- Apache with `.htaccess` enabled, or an equivalent Nginx configuration.
- HTTPS for every non-local deployment.
- A CLI scheduler for `cron/cleanup.php` and `cron/check_expiring.php`.

## Quick start

### Fresh installation

1. Place the project in a non-public staging environment.
2. Create an empty MySQL/MariaDB database and a database account with the schema privileges required by `database.sql`, including `TRIGGER`.
3. Open `install.php` or `/install` and complete the ten-step wizard.
4. Create the first administrator in the wizard; no default password is retained after successful wizard installation.
5. Confirm that `includes/config.local.php` and `includes/.licora-installed` were created and are not web-accessible.
6. Sign in at `admin/login.php`, open `admin/health.php`, and complete an API/license/device smoke test.
7. Configure HTTPS, cron, backups, and web-server deny rules before production use.

### Manual import

Importing `database.sql` directly creates a temporary local-only account:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `ChangeMe!2026`

Change that password immediately and create `includes/config.local.php` from `config.sample.php`.

Complete steps: [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

## API quick example

API v1 remains available for trusted/legacy integrations:

```bash
curl --request POST "https://example.com/license-system/api/verify.php" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  --data '{
    "license_key": "AAAAAAAA-BBBBBBBB-CCCCCCCC-DDDDDDDD",
    "device_hash": "stable-client-generated-device-id",
    "app_id": "desktop-client",
    "app_version": "1.0.0"
  }'
```

`X-API-Key` remains the API v1 authentication header. New desktop/public clients should use Secure API v2, which does not embed a shared Licora API key. See [docs/API.md](docs/API.md) and [docs/API_V2.md](docs/API_V2.md).

## Configuration

The application accepts deployment-specific values through environment variables. A private `includes/config.local.php` file can override the same constants and is excluded by `.gitignore`.

| Purpose | Preferred variable | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Database host | `LICENSE_DB_HOST` | `localhost` |
| Database port | `LICENSE_DB_PORT` | `3306` |
| Database name | `LICENSE_DB_NAME` | empty |
| Database user | `LICENSE_DB_USER` | empty |
| Database password | `LICENSE_DB_PASS` | empty |
| Application name | `APP_NAME` | `Licora` |
| Application URL | `APP_URL` | `http://localhost` |
| Application version | `APP_VERSION` | `5.8.4` |
| Environment | `APP_ENV` | `production` |
| Encryption key | `LICENSE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | empty fallback |
| API limit | `API_RATE_LIMIT` | `1000` |
| Allowed browser origin | `LICENSE_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` | `APP_URL` |

Full reference: [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

## Validation

```bash
bash scripts/validate.sh
```

The validation script checks PHP syntax, security behavior, compatibility invariants, installer parsing and lock behavior, release-version consistency, safe public errors, JavaScript syntax, public-release secret markers, and SQL seed scope. Database-backed behavior requires a disposable MySQL/MariaDB instance; GitHub CI supplies dedicated MySQL 8.4 API v2 and updater integration gates before source artifacts or tagged releases are produced. Tagged releases also require a signed updater manifest before publication.

## Production Python SDK (v5.8.4)

The copy-ready SDK under [`SDK/python`](SDK/python) implements the complete Secure API v2 public-client lifecycle: P-256 device proof, pinned RS256 token verification, secure OS-backed state, activation/status/refresh/deactivation recovery, local license-expiry enforcement, asynchronous login/logout and background validation. Configure only public endpoint/application/signing-key values in `licensing_public.py`; no API v1 or Admin API secret belongs in a distributed application.

## Admin License Control API (v5.8.3)

Licora v5.8.3 adds an isolated, least-privilege server-to-server API for external order websites. Admins create a dedicated key under **Settings → Admin License API**, restrict it to exact existing API v2 applications and granular license/device scopes, and can rotate, suspend or permanently revoke it. Requests use HTTPS, bearer authentication, HMAC-SHA256 proofs, timestamp/nonce replay protection and idempotent order creation. The feature does not expose an application-creation endpoint and does not change public API v1/v2 client behavior.

## Device icon compatibility hotfix (v5.8.2)

Licora v5.8.2 replaces every remaining Admin runtime `bi-devices` glyph with the Bootstrap Icons 1.8.1-compatible `bi-laptop` glyph. The fix covers the shared sidebar and all remaining device-related UI surfaces without changing navigation, Dashboard behavior, APIs, licensing/device enforcement or updater runtime. A shared UI regression gate rejects future reintroduction of the unsupported class.

## Developer Integration Guide (v5.8.1; introduced in v5.8.0 source candidate)

The verified v5.8.1 authenticated **API & Clients → Developer Guide** provides a compact Secure API v2 Quick Start, the exact P-256 device-proof canonical contract, detected endpoint URLs, stable error codes and downloadable lifecycle references for Python, PowerShell/CMD, C, C++, C#/.NET, Java, Flutter, React Native, PHP and Node.js. Public-client examples never embed an API v1 shared/master key. Production clients must keep the P-256 private key and rotated refresh credential in platform-secure storage and verify pinned `LICORA-V2`/`RS256` access-token signatures before trusting claims locally.

## Dashboard Phase 2 published corrective release (v5.7.1)

Licora v5.7.1 corrects the client-side refresh lifecycle found during forensic review of the v5.7.0 Phase 2 source baseline: stale refresh keeps `Retry`, `401 AUTH_REQUIRED` keeps refresh paused/disabled, synchronous transport errors are captured without leaving the request lock stuck, and the last-success timestamp advances only after a successful render. Phase 2 layout/data semantics, backend contracts, database schema, APIs, licensing/device enforcement, authentication, Cron behavior, updater protocol and shared shell remain unchanged.

## Dashboard Phase 2 source baseline (v5.7.0)

Licora v5.7.0 builds on the frozen/published v5.6.1 Phase 1 baseline. The Dashboard keeps its server-rendered initial snapshot but replaces the former full-page 30-second reload with authenticated 30-second AJAX refresh, manual Refresh, last-updated/stale/session feedback, request-overlap protection and in-place chart/KPI/activity updates. Phase 1 backend data semantics, database schema, APIs, license/device enforcement, authentication/roles, Cron mutation behavior and updater protocol remain unchanged.

## Phase 1 verification corrective update (v5.6.1)

Licora v5.6.1 is a no-migration corrective update over the applied v5.6.0 Phase 1 source baseline; v5.6.0 was not published as a GitHub tag/release and is superseded by v5.6.1. It fixes the MySQL integration-test foreign-key cleanup exposed by PR #8 CI, aligns the authenticated Dashboard JSON envelope with its documented top-level `recent_activity` field, and makes the Dashboard API v2 `Ready` status depend on a verified matching server signing key pair rather than the public key alone. Licora remains a browser-based PHP application and contains no Google Chrome installer/downloader dependency. At the v5.6.1 baseline, Phase 2 had not yet been implemented; the separately scoped v5.7.0 source baseline added that browser refresh layer without changing the Phase 1 backend contract.

## Dashboard data truth and read model (v5.6.0)

Licora v5.6.0 completes Phase 1 of the Dashboard production program without changing external API, license/device enforcement, database schema, Cron mutation or updater contracts. Dashboard initial rendering now uses a centralized read-only data model; an authenticated GET-only JSON endpoint exposes the same safe snapshot for the Phase 2 reload-free controller. API v1 `api_logs` and Secure API v2 `v2_audit_logs` are reported as distinct tracked sources, expiration data separates past from upcoming expirations, device reporting distinguishes active flags from five-minute recently-seen activity, and hardcoded operational-health claims are replaced by measured facts. The existing 30-second full-page Dashboard reload is intentionally retained until Phase 2.

## Settings and About UI finishing (v5.5.1)

Licora v5.5.1 is a no-migration UI corrective release over v5.5.0. Settings shortcuts use a balanced responsive grid, the integration area uses a dedicated API + Cron/Signing composition without forced blank card height, Settings child routes are available through a collapsible accessible submenu, and About Licora uses shared product/feature/company components instead of the previous sparse definition-list layout. Backend/API/license/device/cron/updater behavior remains unchanged.

## VibTools compact UI and Licora branding (v5.5.0)

Licora v5.5.0 refines the existing VibTools Light component architecture into the compact/no-growth presentation contract: full-width data tables, single-row toolbars, compact row actions, responsive Single/Bulk license creation, light themed scrollbars and reusable confirmation/feedback UI. Supplied Licora logos/icons/favicons are now tracked and used across the application shell, login, installer, root landing page and About page.

The Settings page is also made truthful. Only settings consumed by the current runtime remain editable; legacy stored-only values remain in the database for compatibility but are no longer presented as active controls. Runtime/API endpoints, limits, Cron CLI commands and Secure API v2 public-key metadata are read-only operational information. The API v2 private signing key remains server-only and is never displayed or downloadable. No database migration, API protocol change, license/device behavior change, cron behavior change or updater state-machine change is included.

## Updater recovery and scope integrity (v5.4.1)

Licora v5.4.1 is a no-migration corrective release for the v5.3.0 updater and v5.4.0 component UI scopes. It fixes the live updater DOM selector/runtime-resume defect, strengthens browser/runtime contract tests, bounded stream downloads, archive validation, backup/rollback verification and signed release builder/runtime parity. The signed release accepts direct updates from reviewed `5.3.0` and `5.4.0` updater baselines.

## VibTools Light component UI (v5.4.0)

Licora v5.4.0 adopts the audited **VibTools Web UI v2.1.2** structural, typography and spacing system while preserving Licora's light blue/purple visual identity. Authenticated administration now uses a fixed left sidebar plus compact utility topbar; primary menu items are no longer duplicated across a horizontal header. Tablet/mobile layouts use the same sidebar as an off-canvas drawer.

The UI is component-first. `admin/assets/css/admin-ui.css` delegates to the centralized Licora Light theme/layout/component engine, and `admin/includes/navbar.php` remains only as a compatibility entrypoint that renders the shared sidebar/topbar components. New page-specific design stylesheets and page `<style>` blocks are prohibited by the v5.4.0 UI contract tests. Existing routes, form names, CSRF fields, business logic and backend/API/updater contracts are unchanged. See [docs/UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](docs/UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md).

## Secure in-app updates (v5.3.0)

Licora v5.3.0 introduces **Admin → Updates** for future stable releases. The updater only accepts assets from the pinned official `vibtools/Licora` GitHub repository, verifies a dedicated RSA/SHA-256 signed manifest, validates the release ZIP and per-file checksums, runs server preflight, stages files outside the application tree, records a rollback backup, applies signed migrations through a migration ledger, updates files in resumable chunks, and performs post-install verification. A critical filesystem lock temporarily returns HTTP 503 to non-updater traffic only while schema/source changes are being applied.

The Update Center uses the VibTools Web UI v2.1.2 token foundation and a real persistent event stream for its deployment-log modal. Search, level filtering, Copy Logs, Download Diagnostics, pin-to-bottom, progress and stage state are backed by actual `update_events` rows; no demo deployment records or fake AI diagnostics are shipped. The normal cPanel/VPS updater path does not require Git, shell access, Composer, Python, `exec()`, or other command execution.

**Bootstrap note:** v5.2.2 cannot install the updater that it does not yet contain. v5.3.0 is therefore the one final manual source replacement. From v5.3.0 onward, compatible signed releases can be installed from the Update Center after preflight passes. See [docs/UPDATER.md](docs/UPDATER.md).

## Secure API v2 (v5.2.2)

Secure API v2, introduced in v5.2.0, hardened in v5.2.1, and given consistent Admin UI schema discovery in v5.2.2, provides `/api/v2/activate.php`, `/refresh.php`, `/status.php`, and `/deactivate.php` for public/desktop clients. It uses registered App IDs, P-256 device keys, RS256 server-signed short-lived access tokens, rotating hashed refresh tokens, nonce/timestamp replay protection, device revocation, matching server signing-key validation, and persistent refresh rate-limit enforcement. API v1 remains unchanged for existing integrations.

Fresh installations provision API v2 during the installer. In v5.2.2, the existing License app-scope selector and V2 Devices page use the same exact schema-discovery contract as API v2 runtime, preventing false-empty/false-provisioning states on compatible hosts. Existing cPanel/shared-hosting deployments can preserve private/runtime files, overwrite the source, then use **Admin → Client Apps → Initialize API v2** without shell access. CLI-capable deployments may instead run `php scripts/setup-v2.php`. Both paths reuse the same additive v5.2.0 schema and never silently replace existing signing key files. See [API v2](docs/API_V2.md), [security model](docs/API_V2_SECURITY.md), [client integration](docs/API_V2_CLIENT_INTEGRATION.md), and [migration](docs/API_V2_MIGRATION.md).

## Coolify Production Deployment

Licora is fully prepared for containerized production deployment via [Coolify](https://coolify.io). The official multi-container deployment stack leverages Docker Compose, hardens Nginx security, enforces read-only immutability, and supports seamless environment variable injection to safely bypass the legacy web installer.

For a comprehensive setup guide, please refer to the [Coolify Production Guide](COOLIFY_PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md).

## Known limitations

- The legacy `/api/check_license.php` endpoint remains unauthenticated for compatibility; new desktop/public clients should use Secure API v2.
- Several stored settings remain informational or only partially connected to runtime enforcement.
- The admin interface depends on public CDN assets unless a deployment vendors them locally.
- Nginx and LiteSpeed operators must reproduce the supplied Apache deny rules.
- The standard schema requires database privileges including `TRIGGER`; some free shared hosts do not provide them.
- Production-environment browser smoke testing and host-specific MySQL/MariaDB compatibility remain deployment responsibilities; the repository CI includes a disposable MySQL 8.4 API v2 integration gate.

Review [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), [docs/COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md](docs/COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md), and the forensic audit before production deployment.
