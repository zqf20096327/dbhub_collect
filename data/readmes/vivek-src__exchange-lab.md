## Try It Live

The hosted demo gives every visitor a virtual ₹50,000 balance, no signup required to browse, and no real money involved - the point is to practice against realistic order matching and slippage, not to risk anything.

Live markets: **RIL/INR** ([trade now](https://xchg.viveksahu.com/trade/RIL_INR)) · **TATA/INR** · **SOL/INR**

## Each terminal includes a live price ticker (24H high/low, volume), candlestick charts across four timeframes, limit and market order types, a live order book, a trade tape, and portfolio/wallet tracking once logged in.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to understand how a centralized exchange keeps order matching fast while keeping custodial account balances consistent under concurrent load. Unlike a DEX, there's no on-chain settlement or smart contract here — the platform itself holds user funds and matches orders server-side, the same model real exchanges like Binance or Coinbase run internally. That intersection of low-latency systems and correctness is genuinely hard to get right, and reading about it isn't the same as building it.

The focus areas were:

- Matching engine design (price-time priority, partial fills, maker/taker tracking)
- Event-driven architecture and service decoupling
- Concurrency-safe settlement (no double-spends, no lost updates)
- Real-time data delivery over WebSockets
- Time-series data modeling for financial tick data

## Features

- **Matching engine** - in-memory, price-time priority order book with partial fill support, operating in a fully custodial (CEX-style) model.
- **Event-driven core** - services communicate exclusively via Redis queue + Pub/Sub, no direct service-to-service calls.
- **Live market data** - WebSocket streaming for order book depth, trade tape, and ticker updates.
- **Async settlement** - a dedicated ledger worker persists trades under ACID transactions, off the matching engine's hot path.
- **Charting** - TradingView-style candlestick charts via Lightweight Charts, backed by TimescaleDB continuous aggregates.
- **Auth** - JWT-based session auth via NextAuth, with bcrypt password hashing.

## Architecture

![System Architecture Diagram](./image/architecture.svg)

**Order flow, step by step:**

1. User submits an order via the **Next.js** client
2. Request hits the **API** (an independent Express/Node process)
3. API pushes the order onto a **Redis queue**, tagged with a snowflake ID
4. The **Engine** (continuous while-loop) pops the order off the queue
5. Engine validates it against current balances/assets, then matches it against the in-memory order book
6. Engine publishes the result over **Redis Pub/Sub**
7. **API** (subscribed on that snowflake ID) resolves the original client request
8. **WebSocket server** (subscribed independently) broadcasts the update to connected clients
9. **Ledger Worker** (also subscribed independently) persists the trade to **PostgreSQL** under an ACID transaction
10. A **TimescaleDB worker** syncs trade data into a kline-optimized hypertable, which the **Chart Manager** consumes to drive live charts

**Why this shape:** steps 7, 8, and 9 all react to the _same_ published event, independently, with no awareness of each other. That's the core design choice - the API doesn't wait on the database, the WebSocket server doesn't wait on the ledger, and the ledger doesn't block client-facing latency. Each piece can be scaled, restarted, or replaced without touching the others.

**Auth path:** registration and login are handled by **Next.js** via NextAuth, writing user records to PostgreSQL - which the Engine reads from for balance/asset validation during order processing.

## Engineering Decisions

- **Redis queue for order intake, not a direct function call** - the API can acknowledge a submitted order immediately without waiting on the engine to finish matching it, keeping client-facing latency decoupled from matching throughput.
- **In-memory order book** - matching needs to happen without a database round-trip in the hot path; the book lives in the engine's memory, and persistence happens asynchronously afterward.
- **Snowflake IDs over UUIDs** - IDs need to be chronologically sortable without a timestamp column and generated without a database round-trip; a bit-shifted snowflake ID (timestamp + worker ID + sequence counter) gives both in one 64-bit `BigInt`, resolving in under a millisecond. ([`Snowflake.ts`](packages/engine/src/trade/Snowflake.ts))
- **Row-level locking in the ledger worker** - concurrent trades touching the same wallet could otherwise race; `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` inside an ACID transaction closes that gap. ([`ledgerWorker.ts`](packages/db/src/ledgerWorker.ts))
- **Pub/Sub fan-out instead of a shared callback** - the WebSocket server and ledger worker both need to react to the same trade event, but neither needs to know the other exists; Pub/Sub lets them subscribe independently rather than chaining calls.
- **Custodial balance integrity** - since this is a centralized exchange, the platform (not the user) holds and moves funds on every trade; any drift between the in-memory engine and the database becomes a real accounting problem, not just a UI bug.
- **TimescaleDB over plain PostgreSQL** - OHLCV/kline queries over large tick-data volumes are dramatically cheaper with continuous aggregates than computing candles on read from a raw trades table.

## Engineering Challenges

- **Maintaining price-time priority** while handling partial fills and maker/taker tracking correctly, without letting book state drift from what's been persisted.
- **Avoiding race conditions** in balance settlement when multiple trades against the same wallet can arrive concurrently - solved with row-level locking in the ledger worker rather than trusting application-level checks.
- **Keeping matching entirely in-memory** while still guaranteeing every trade eventually lands durably in Postgres - the two halves of the system (fast in-memory execution, slower durable persistence) had to stay correct independently.
- **Synchronizing live UI state** across order book depth, trade tape, ticker, and charts, all fed by the same event stream, without the frontend polling anything.
- **Preventing double-spending** during high-concurrency settlement - the same problem real exchanges solve with transactional guarantees, tackled here at a smaller scale.
- **BigInt serialization** - trade IDs and balances as `BigInt` don't serialize to JSON by default, which needed explicit handling across the API/WebSocket boundary.
- **A Prisma `DateTime` vs. `timestamptz` mismatch** that was silently producing future-dated trade timestamps until traced back to timezone handling in the schema.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v20+
- **Docker & Docker Compose**

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Install dependencies across all workspaces
cd packages && npm install

# 3. Start Postgres + Redis
docker compose up -d postgres redis
# (wait a few seconds for TimescaleDB to initialize)

# 4. Generate Prisma client and push schema
npm run db:generate --workspace=packages/db
npm run db:push --workspace=packages/db
```

Key environment variables (see `.env.example` for the full list):

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:secure_password_here@localhost:5432/exchange_lab?schema=public
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
PORT_WEB=3000
PORT_API=3001
PORT_WS=3002
```

### Running

**Development** (all services on the host):

```bash
cd packages && npm run dev:all
```

_(or `./packages/start.sh` to run built output for backend services alongside Next.js)_

**Production** (fully Dockerized):

```bash
docker compose build && docker compose up -d
```

## Deployment

The live demo runs on a self-managed **Linux VM**, with services orchestrated via **Docker Compose** and **Nginx** as the single public-facing reverse proxy (`nginx-sites.conf`, `nginx-upstream.conf`).

Nginx handles routing to the correct internal service, TLS termination, and upgrading/proxying WebSocket connections through to the `ws` service. Internal service ports are never exposed directly to the internet.

## Performance

The in-memory matching engine has been benchmarked in isolation to evaluate
throughput, latency, and scaling behavior as order-book depth increases.

![Matching engine benchmark — throughput degradation with increasing book depth](./image/throughput-decay.png)

|    Orders |            Throughput | p50 Latency | p99 Latency |
| --------: | --------------------: | ----------: | ----------: |
|     1,000 |  **1.10M orders/sec** |      0.6 µs |      1.7 µs |
|    10,000 | **253.7K orders/sec** |      3.6 µs |      9.7 µs |
|   100,000 |  **28.2K orders/sec** |     35.1 µs |     77.5 µs |
| 1,000,000 |  **2.06K orders/sec** |    441.9 µs |     1.77 ms |

- **Peak Throughput:** 1.06M orders/sec at 1,000 orders
- **Bottleneck Identified:** Full-book re-sorting during order insertion causes
  throughput to degrade as the resting book grows.
