## 📖 About This Repository

This is a **structured, beginner-to-advanced MySQL reference** built to pair with the video course. Every guide is written as a standalone lesson with clear explanations, copy-paste-ready SQL, and worked examples against a single, consistent sample database — so concepts build naturally from one part to the next.

Whether you're preparing for an interview, leveling up at work, or just starting out, work through the parts in order or jump straight to the topic you need.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Set up the sample database** — start with [Part 0: Sample Database](docs/00-sample-database.md) and run the schema + seed data in your MySQL instance.
2. **Follow along with the video** — each guide maps to a section of the [20-hour MySQL course video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwFu-cqVm7E).
3. **Practice** — every query in these docs runs against the sample database, so you can experiment as you learn.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/vivekpandey76/Mysql-course.git
cd Mysql-course

# Load the sample database into MySQL, then start with docs/00-sample-database.md
```

## 🧩 Interview Practice

Real-world SQL problems with datasets, expected output, and fully explained solutions — great for interview prep and self-testing.

|-----|-------|------|
| 1 | Anti-joins, delivery times, running balances, distinct users, cancellation rates | [Problem Set 1](interview-questions/problem-set-01.md) |
| 2 | Self-joins & interval overlaps, top-N per group, `HAVING`, `LEAD()`, conditional aggregation | [Problem Set 2](interview-questions/problem-set-02.md) |

| 4 | Multi-table joins, median (overall & per-group), gaps-and-islands streaks (2 methods), self-`UNION` win-percentage | [Problem Set 4](interview-questions/problem-set-04.md) |
| 5 | String parsing with `SUBSTRING_INDEX`, longest win streak, pivot & unpivot reshaping, first/last order per customer | [Problem Set 5](interview-questions/problem-set-05.md) |
| 6 | Consecutive-day orders, "bought all products", missing IDs, `NOT EXISTS` + theory: `GROUP BY` rules, `DELETE`/`TRUNCATE`/`DROP`, `IFNULL` vs `COALESCE` | [Problem Set 6](interview-questions/problem-set-06.md) |

## 🏆 LeetCode SQL 50

Full walkthroughs of the **complete** [LeetCode SQL 50](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/) study plan — all 50 problems, the fastest way to get interview-ready. Each problem includes the **original LeetCode link**, the schema and sample data, real verified output, a **"How to approach it"** breakdown, and the trade-offs behind the solution.

| Set | Problems | Focus | Link |
|-----|----------|-------|------|
| 1 | 1–10 | `WHERE` logic, `NULL` traps, `INNER` vs `LEFT JOIN`, anti-joins, `LAG()`, self-joins | [Set 1 — Select & Basic Joins](leetcode-problems/set-01-easy-basics.md) |
| 2 | 11–20 | `CROSS JOIN` scaffolding, `COUNT(*)` vs `COUNT(col)`, `HAVING`, conditional aggregation, rates & percentages, range joins | [Set 2 — Joins & Aggregation](leetcode-problems/set-02-joins-and-aggregation.md) |
| 3 | 21–30 | First-row-per-group with `ROW_NUMBER()`, `DENSE_RANK()` on ties, `LEAD()` retention, `COUNT(DISTINCT)`, relational division, inclusive date windows | [Set 3 — Window Functions & First-Row Logic](leetcode-problems/set-03-window-functions-and-first-rows.md) |
| 4 | 31–40 | Window frames (`ROWS` vs `RANGE`), running totals, 7-day moving averages, `LEAD(col, n)`, `UNION ALL` for zero-count buckets, anti-joins, `CASE` branching | [Set 4 — Advanced Windows & Conditional Logic](leetcode-problems/set-04-advanced-windows-and-conditional-logic.md) |
| 5 | 41–50 | String functions, word-boundary `LIKE`, `REGEXP` & case-sensitivity, `GROUP_CONCAT`, `DELETE` from a self-referenced table, top-N per group with `DENSE_RANK()` | [Set 5 — Strings, Regex & Set Operations](leetcode-problems/set-05-strings-regex-and-set-operations.md) |

## 🎁 Bonus Problems

Patterns the SQL 50 skips or only skims — the ones that actually come up in analytics and data-engineering interviews. Custom datasets, same format: schema, real verified output, approach, solution, and the failure modes to avoid.

| Set | Focus | Link |
|-----|-------|------|
| 1 | Rolling sums: aggregate-then-window, `PARTITION BY` frames, `ROWS` vs `RANGE`, recursive date spines for gappy time series | [Bonus Set 1 — The Rolling Sum Pattern](bonus-problems/set-01-rolling-sum-pattern.md) |
