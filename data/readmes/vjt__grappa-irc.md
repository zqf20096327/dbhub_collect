# grappa-irc

> An always-on IRC bouncer with a REST-first API and a browser PWA that looks like irssi.

**Live instance → [irc.sindro.me](https://irc.sindro.me)** — open it in any browser, or install it to a phone home screen (visitors need no password).

## What

Two components in one monorepo:

- **grappa** — the server. A persistent bouncer that terminates IRC at the server boundary and exposes a REST API plus a multiplexed WebSocket (Phoenix Channels) for real-time push. One supervised OTP process per `(user, network)` (Elixir/OTP + Phoenix). SASL bridging to upstream NickServ. Self-hostable on any VPS.
- **cicchetto** — the client. A PWA that speaks pure REST and **never parses IRC**. Installable on a phone home screen, visually irssi, with mobile ergonomics added on top — not instead. SolidJS + TypeScript + Vite + Bun; `phoenix.js` for the Channels client.

*Modern IRC — always-on, usable from a phone — without making it not-IRC.* For anyone who's been on IRC for a decade: it's irssi-in-tmux, reachable from a browser.

### Two facades, one store

grappa exposes one scrollback store through two facades:

1. **REST + WebSocket Channels** — the primary surface and the design center. REST for resources, Channels for event push. IRC is fully terminated server-side; cicchetto is IRC-protocol-ignorant end to end.
2. **IRCv3 listener** *(Phase 6, planned)* — an optional surface speaking `CAP LS` + SASL + `CHATHISTORY` to existing IRCv3 mobile clients (Goguma, Quassel…). A *view* over the same store — never a second source of truth.

**Read state is server-owned**: a per-`(subject, network, channel)` cursor (`last_read_message_id`), advanced by cic on focus-leave + browser-blur, exposed to the listener facade as `+draft/read-marker` MARKREAD lines.

## Why this exists

There are good bouncers already. [soju](https://soju.im/) + [gamja](https://sr.ht/~emersion/gamja/) is the closest shape — a persistent Go bouncer + JS web client.

grappa diverges on one deliberate axis: **the web client does not parse IRC.** soju/gamja put IRC-framing-over-WebSocket on the wire and re-implement IRC protocol state in the browser. grappa terminates IRC at the server; the web client sees only typed JSON resources (channels, messages, members, networks) and an event stream. Scrollback pagination, channel modes, nick changes, join/part — everything arrives as JSON.

Two consequences:

- grappa works against **vanilla ircds**. Upstream IRCv3 extensions are opportunistic bonuses where the ircd has them, never requirements. No upstream `CHATHISTORY` needed — the bouncer owns scrollback.
- grappa can still *expose* IRCv3 downstream (the second facade), so a mobile IRC client and cicchetto see the same store. It looks identical whichever you open.

```

- Each `(user, network)` has one persistent supervised GenServer (`Grappa.Session`) owning its upstream connection. A crash is isolated to that session; the supervisor restarts with fresh state and the sqlite scrollback survives.
- Events stream into a per-`(network, channel)` paginated scrollback (sqlite via Ecto), bounded by a retention policy.
- REST is a thin read/write layer: writes (send, join, part) translate to upstream IRC commands; reads return typed JSON.
- New events push over Phoenix Channels — one socket per browser tab, many topic subscriptions per socket. `phoenix.js` handles reconnect + replay; clients catch up via paginated scrollback.

Supervision-tree ordering and the load-bearing invariants live in `CLAUDE.md`; the chronological decision log is `docs/DESIGN_NOTES.md`, with the closed months archived verbatim under `docs/design_notes/`.

## Design principles

1. **No IRC parsing in the web client. Ever.** REST is cicchetto's contract; the browser never sees a raw `PRIVMSG`. (Mobile clients on the optional listener parse IRC by definition — that's what they are.)
2. **Upstream IRCv3 is opportunistic.** grappa works against any ircd that speaks `CAP LS` + SASL. *Downstream*, the listener will speak `CAP` + SASL + `CHATHISTORY` fully — that's the point of the second facade.
3. **Scrollback is bouncer-owned.** One store: paginated for REST, `CHATHISTORY`-mapped for the listener. No dependency on upstream `CHATHISTORY`.
4. **Auth is NickServ**, bridged via SASL; registration proxied through a dedicated endpoint.
5. **Self-hostable on any VPS**, with an operator-configurable allowlist for upstream networks.
6. **Irssi-shape on desktop and mobile.** Same visual grammar everywhere; mobile adds touch-ergonomic helpers, not a chat-app metaphor.
7. **Text only on the wire.** Media (images, video, files) is uploaded to and hosted by grappa and shared on IRC as a plain link — the wire stays text, never inline media. cicchetto opens that link in an in-app image/video viewer (video is transcoded client-side before upload); scrollback never auto-renders media. *Client-side* voice I/O (read-aloud + dictate) is a separate, in-scope accessibility feature — see below.
8. **No push infrastructure.** Use the browser PWA push API if present; otherwise no notifications. We don't run notification servers.
9. **Accessibility is a client concern.** The server stays protocol-clean; screen-reader support, TTS, STT, and touch helpers live in cicchetto.

### Client-side voice I/O

Optional, opt-in, per-channel — and **never touches grappa or the IRC wire**: TTS reads incoming messages aloud via the browser `SpeechSynthesis` API; STT composes by voice via `SpeechRecognition`; an optional Vosk/piper WASM drop-in gives an offline path. Server cost: zero. This unblocks the Android-IRC-with-voice ask that has no good native answer today.

## Usage

grappa runs as a single container against a sqlite DB. There is no config file — every `(user, network)` binding lives in the DB and is read by `Grappa.Bootstrap` at boot. The operator interface is `bin/grappa`.

> **Two different programs answer to that name.** Check which one you have before copying a command below. A **source checkout** carries the repo-root `bin/grappa`, a docker-compose wrapper with the full verb table. A **packaged release** carries a much smaller one: `mix release` moves the generated boot script aside and installs the dispatcher from [`infra/release/grappa.sh`](infra/release/grappa.sh) in its place (the `install_operator_cli/1` step in `mix.exs`), so the ghcr.io image, the `.deb`, the AUR package and a bastille / systemd install all get the **release CLI**. A release ships no Mix, so every `grappa.*` mix task — most of the verbs below — is simply not there, and asking for one gets you the boot script's own `ERROR: Unknown command …`.

**Source checkout** — run from the clone:

```sh
bin/grappa help                # every verb (boot-time + live-state + debug)
bin/grappa help <verb>         # per-verb usage
bin/grappa <verb> --help       # the same per-verb usage, as a flag (or -h)
bin/grappa create-user ...     # boot-time verb (mix task inside the container)
bin/grappa list-visitors       # live-state verb (RPC into the running BEAM)
bin/grappa remote-shell        # iex --remsh into the live node
```

Boot-time verbs run as mix tasks in the container; live-state verbs attach to the running BEAM over Erlang distribution, so they introspect or mutate the actual supervised state (no second BEAM, no port collision).

**Packaged release** — three account verbs, plus whatever the release boot script already knew:

```sh
grappa help                                        # the three verbs and their arguments
grappa create-user NAME [--admin] [--password PW]
grappa add-network USER NETWORK --server HOST:PORT --nick NICK --auth METHOD [...]
grappa remove-network USER NETWORK
grappa start | daemon | eval | rpc | remote | stop | pid | version
```

How you reach that program depends on the substrate: `sudo grappa …` on a `.deb` / AUR box, `docker exec -it grappa bin/grappa …` against the container `infra/docker/deploy.sh` installs (named `grappa` unless `GRAPPA_CONTAINER` says otherwise), `.../rel/grappa/bin/grappa …` in a jail or under systemd. Anything outside the list above — `list-visitors`, `add-server`, `set-network-caps`, `seed-scrollback`, `remote-shell` … — has **no verb here**: live state is reachable through the release's own `rpc` / `remote` (`grappa rpc 'Grappa.Operator.list_visitors_text!()'` is the twin of `bin/grappa list-visitors`), and the per-network caps live in the admin console's **Networks** tab.

Developer scripts — gates, tests, shells — live in `scripts/*.sh`; how to run the test suites is documented in `docs/TESTING.md`; the full operator + deploy runbook is `docs/OPERATIONS.md`. The design of per-client derived outbound source addresses — written for the staff of networks a grappa instance connects to, rather than for developers — is `docs/DERIVED_SOURCE_ADDRESSES.md` (not yet implemented; #454, #543).

### First deploy

**Self-hosting?** [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) is the one-command Docker install — `infra/docker/deploy.sh install` generates every secret, builds, brings up the single grappa container, and waits until `/healthz` is green (`update` and `stop` are the sibling verbs; the old `scripts/quickstart*.sh` still work as shims). It also covers exposing it with TLS (Caddy / nginx / mkcert). The workflow below is the **operator / hot-deploy path** used for the production host.

**Don't want to build?** Every `vX.Y.Z` release also publishes a self-contained, multi-arch image (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) to **`ghcr.io/vjt/grappa`** (`:<tag>` + `:latest`) — pull it instead of compiling from source. It bundles the ERTS + the cicchetto SPA and boots on its own. A one-liner brings it up on a host with only Docker + `curl` (no clone): `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vjt/grappa-irc/main/infra/docker/get.sh | bash` (append `-s -- update` to update an existing box), or copy [`compose.release.yaml`](compose.release.yaml) if you would rather not pipe a script into a shell. Those are two **different boxes**, not two ways to drive one, so the compose path updates with its own pair — `docker compose -f compose.release.yaml pull` then `docker compose -f compose.release.yaml up -d` — and the `-s -- update` recipe above does not reach it (it looks for a box it never installed, and the `install` it then recommends builds a second, empty one; [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) has the untangling). Note it is a *release* image: it has **no `Phoenix.CodeReloader`**, so it is not the hot-edit dev environment — the Docker Compose stack above stays the development runtime, and **updates on the image path are always cold** (pull + recreate; the data volume survives). The same release also publishes **`ghcr.io/vjt/grappa-shottino`** on the same tag scheme and the same two arches — the `shottino --ircd` bridge, for reaching grappa from irssi/weechat/hexchat/goguma without a checkout to compile it in. See [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) and `docs/OPERATIONS.md`.

**The release serves its own frontend AND owns its security headers (#485).** Phoenix's embedded web server publishes the built cicchetto bundle (`CIC_DIST_ROOT`, default `runtime/cicchetto-dist`), streams uploads, and emits the Content-Security-Policy + sibling security headers itself (`GrappaWeb.Plugs.SecurityHeaders`, the single source of truth — `register_before_send` so static hits and error pages carry them too). So a plain `bin/grappa start` on an HTTP port is a complete, header-hardened instance — no nginx in the box, no separate proxy required for the CSP that guards the localStorage bearer token. This is what makes a native (non-Docker) `systemd` / `rc.d` install stand up on its own; see `docs/OPERATIONS.md` for the release path. If you terminate TLS some other way (Caddy, a cloud LB, nginx), that front door is **only** for TLS — configure it as a dumb reverse proxy and let it forward grappa's headers untouched; it must **not** re-assert a CSP of its own (duplicate `Content-Security-Policy` headers are enforced as the *intersection*, a prod-only footgun). A plain-HTTP self-serve is fine for LAN / trusted-network use; a public deployment still needs TLS in front for the service worker + push (browsers gate those on a secure context).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vjt/grappa-irc /srv/grappa && cd /srv/grappa
cp .env.example .env

# Three required secrets — paste each into .env.
# The first bin/grappa call builds the image (~5-10 min, one-time); later calls reuse it.
bin/grappa gen-encryption-key     # GRAPPA_ENCRYPTION_KEY — encrypts upstream creds at rest (Cloak AES-GCM)
scripts/mix.sh phx.gen.secret     # SECRET_KEY_BASE
scripts/mix.sh phx.gen.secret 32  # SECRET_SIGNING_SALT

scripts/deploy.sh                 # build the cic bundle + start the grappa container
```

**Back up `GRAPPA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` separately — losing it means losing every stored upstream password.** On a fresh DB no IRC sessions spawn until you bind a network; Phoenix answers `/healthz` web-only.

On later deploys `scripts/deploy.sh` auto-detects hot-safe changes (running-module swap, sessions preserved) vs cold-required ones (mix.lock / supervision tree / long-lived GenServer struct shape → image rebuild + force-recreate); `--force-hot` / `--force-cold` override the heuristic. For cic bundle-only changes use `scripts/deploy-cic.sh` (no server restart; connected browsers get a refresh banner).

### Bind a network

**From a source checkout** — three verbs, all flags named:

```sh
bin/grappa create-user --name vjt --password "correct horse battery staple"
bin/grappa add-server  --network azzurra --host irc.azzurra.chat --port 6697 --tls
bin/grappa bind-network --user vjt --network azzurra \
  --nick vjt --password 'NICKSERV_PASS' --auth nickserv_identify \
  --autojoin '#italia,#hacking'
```

**On a packaged release** — the same thing in two verbs, because `add-network` creates the network and the server itself. `create-user` takes the name **positionally** and rejects a flag in that slot (`create-user --name vjt` errors with *"create-user needs an account name, got the flag --name"*):

```sh
grappa create-user vjt --password "correct horse battery staple"
grappa add-network vjt azzurra --server irc.azzurra.chat:6697 \
  --nick vjt --password 'NICKSERV_PASS' --auth nickserv_identify \
  --autojoin '#italia,#hacking'
```

- `--auth`: `auto | sasl | server_pass | nickserv_identify | none`, on both forms.
- TLS: explicit `--tls` on the checkout's `add-server`; on `add-network` it **defaults to on for port 6697** and off otherwise, with `--tls` / `--no-tls` to override.
- Omit `--password` on the release `create-user` and it prompts on the terminal, so the secret stays out of shell history — pass `-it` if you are going through `docker exec`.
- `--source <IPv4|IPv6>` (on the checkout's `add-server`, or `--source` on the release's `add-network`) pins a per-network fallback outbound IP; a per-subject vhost pin/selection (admin panel → Vhosts tab, #228) overrides it. The auto-rotation pool is DB-driven (curated `in_pool` vhosts), no env var.
- `bin/grappa set-network-caps --network azzurra --max-visitor-sessions N --max-user-sessions N` sets independent visitor/user admission caps (omit for unlimited; visitor saturation never blocks operator login). It is a mix task, so a packaged release has no such verb — set the caps from the admin console's **Networks** tab instead.

Re-run `scripts/deploy.sh` and Bootstrap picks up the binding on boot — or attach via `remote-shell` and drive the spawn orchestrator directly for no downtime.

### Admin console

Operators get a multi-tab admin pane in cicchetto, gated on `User.is_admin` (REST `/admin/*` 403s for everyone else, enforced BEAM-side by the `:admin_authn` pipeline):

- **Visitors** — list visitor sessions; delete to free cap slots.
- **Sessions** — every live `Session.Server` (user + visitor) with DB `connection_state` and live pid shown side by side; per-row disconnect (park) / terminate.
- **Networks** — per-network cap editor + live counters, plus reset-circuit and force-reap. `PATCH /admin/networks/:slug` flips the per-network **`visitor_enabled`** allowlist flag (visitors may attach only visitor-enabled networks, toggled live with no restart — the runtime replacement for the old compile-time visitor-network pin) AND **`visitor_autoconnect`** (the subset a visitor auto-connects at login: zero-friction multi-network from first login, no picker; `visitor_enabled`-but-not-autoconnect networks are offered on the home page for on-demand one-tap connect).
- **Events** — real-time admin-event tail over the `grappa:admin:events` topic; **disk-backed** (#215) so it survives a restart.
- **Session Log** — the persisted IRC session-lifecycle log (#215): connect / register / NickServ `+r` / disconnect (with reason + duration + clean-vs-error) / reconnect-backoff, per `(user|visitor, network)` session. Every lifecycle transition also lands as a greppable, structured Logger line (`session=<kind>:<uuid>:<network_id> event=disconnected reason=… duration_ms=… clean=…`), so a 2am `grep <nick>` of the server log finally explains a drop.

The admin UI's Promote button needs an existing admin, so bootstrap the **first** admin with `--admin` on `create-user` — in whichever of the two shapes your install has:

```sh
bin/grappa create-user --name vjt --password '…' --admin   # source checkout
grappa create-user vjt --admin                             # packaged release (prompts for the password)
```

After that, promote/demote everyone else from the **Admin → Users** tab. To promote an already-existing user from the shell, the expression is the same on both; only the way in differs — `bin/grappa remote-shell --batch -e '<expr>'` from a checkout, the release's own `rpc` on a packaged install:

```sh
grappa rpc 'Grappa.Accounts.get_user_by_name!("vjt") |> Grappa.Accounts.update_admin_flags(%{is_admin: true})'
```

### Themes

irssi-style theming as a first-class feature (Settings → themes):

- **Gallery** — browse the built-in curated schemes (solarized / gruvbox / nord / dracula / …, seeded by `mix grappa.seed_themes`) plus anything users **and visitors** publish. Each card is a derived palette-swatch preview (no stored screenshot) and shows how many people currently have it **in use**. **Tap a card** to apply it live and reveal its actions (copy / edit / publish / delete); the active theme is **server-owned** (`PUT /me/theme`) so it follows you across devices.
- **Day / night pairing** — flip *"use a different theme at night"* to pick a **day theme + a night theme**; cicchetto swaps the applied theme automatically on the OS `prefers-color-scheme` signal — the same one the base light/dark look already follows (no time-of-day scheduler, no geolocation). A single pick still applies in both modes. The pair is server-owned, so it follows you across devices too.
- **Editor** — a covering overlay with **live preview**: color pickers per token (base / mode / 16-slot nick palette), a curated font family, and a background image. Every change re-paints the app in real time; **Save** persists your own copy (create or edit), Cancel restores the pre-open theme. Editing always saves a copy — no copy-on-write, no shared state.
- **Everyone's a producer** — logged-in users AND anonymous visitors can create / copy / edit / publish / keep their own themes (visitors are capped at 50 owned themes; a visitor's published themes re-home to the house account when the visitor is reaped, so gallery contributions survive). A visitor-published theme is credited to a fixed **guest** label — never a nick.
- **Share** — **publish** your copy into the gallery for others to pick, or share a published entry by id (`/theme/<id>`); the recipient copies it into their own account. **Delete** your copies freely (everyone else already has their own). Owners edit/delete their own; admins moderate any entry.
- **Fonts** — a curated, **self-hosted** monospace set (JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, Source Code Pro, IBM Plex Mono, Cascadia Code, Hack). No runtime CDN/Google-Fonts fetch — the woff2 are served from our own origin (a remote webfont would be a per-render tracking beacon).
- **Background** — pick from a curated set of **built-in backgrounds** (system-owned, read-only, served as long-cached static assets) or upload your own image (or fetch by URL; re-encoded + re-hosted server-side — raster only, no SVG, EXIF stripped, SSRF-guarded). Either way it paints as a wallpaper behind the message list at a user-configurable opacity.

Security by construction: a theme is a **closed set of tokens** (palette + font-id + background), never raw CSS — the renderer only ever consumes the sanitized model, so a published theme can't smuggle CSS/JS or a tracking `url()`.

## REST + events surface

REST carries resources (id-addressed); state changes push over Channels. The main families: `POST /auth/login` + `/auth/logout`; `/me`; `/networks` (CRUD, plus `PATCH` to flip `connection_state` between `connected`/`parked` — subject-agnostic: users AND visitors park/reconnect each network the same way; `PATCH /networks/:id/identity` sets per-network IRC nick/ident/realname, live-applied via an internal reconnect); `POST /session/networks` (a visitor one-tap-connects an additional `visitor_enabled` network — accretion); `/networks/:id/channels` (join / part / topic); `/channels/:id/messages` (paginated `GET`, `POST` to send); `/channels/:id/members`; `/channels/:id/read-cursor`; `/networks/:id/archive`; `/settings`; `/uploads`; `/push/subscriptions`; and `WS /socket/websocket`. The router (`lib/grappa_web/router.ex`) is the source of truth; a published OpenAPI schema is a pre-PUBLIC-OPEN deliverable.

Events are typed JSON (`message`, `join`, `part`, `quit`, `nick`, `mode`, `topic`, `notice`, window-state transitions, mentions bundle…) on **user-rooted** Channel topics:

| Topic | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| `grappa:user:{user}` | session-wide: network connect/disconnect, mentions bundle |
| `grappa:user:{user}/network:{slug}` | per-network: motd, server notices, nick changes |
| `grappa:user:{user}/network:{slug}/channel:{chan}` | per-channel: message, join/part, mode, topic, notice |

The client updates local state from these; it never reasons about IRC framing. Reconnect and replay-on-resubscribe are handled by `phoenix.js`.

## Slash commands

Typed in cicchetto's compose box, parsed client-side, dispatched to REST or IRC. Unknown verbs surface as inline errors.

| Verb | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `/me <text>` | CTCP ACTION in the active channel |
| `/join <#chan>` | Join a channel |
| `/part [#chan] [reason]` | Part the active or named channel |
| `/cycle [#chan] [message]` | Part then re-join the active or named channel (irssi's `CYCLE`). Channel-scoped only — the network bounce is `/reconnect`. A first word without a channel sigil is the message, not a target. No key slot, so a `+k` channel needs `/part` + `/join #chan <key>` |
| `/topic <text>` · `/topic -delete` | Set / clear the channel topic |
| `/nick <newnick>` | Change nick (users and visitors) |
| `/msg <nick> <text>` | Private message — opens a query window (channel-shaped targets are rejected). When the target is a network service (NickServ/ChanServ/SeenServ/…), its replies land in that open query window rather than the server tab (#400); unsolicited service traffic with no open query still lands in the server tab |
| `/query <nick>` · `/q <nick>` | Open a query window without sending |
| `/whois <nick>` · `/whowas <nick>` | WHOIS / WHOWAS; reply renders as an inline card |
| `/who <#chan-or-mask>` · `/names <#chan>` | WHO (channel or host/nick mask) / NAMES; WHO opens a modal, NAMES a members refresh |
| `/lusers` | Network-stats card pinned in the current window |
| `/op` `/deop` `/voice` `/devoice` `<nick>…` | Channel `MODE ±o` / `±v` (chunked per ISUPPORT `MODES=`) |
| `/kick <nick> [reason]` | KICK on the active channel |
| `/kb <nick> [reason]` · `/kickban …` | Kickban: `MODE +b *!*@host` (offender's host verbatim, from the on-demand userhost lookup — no domain/octet wildcard; fail-closed if the host is unknown, "run /whois first") **then** KICK. Two frames, ban first (no rejoin window), both attempted |
| `/ban <nick-or-mask>` · `/unban <mask>` | `MODE +b` / `-b` (bare nick → mask via WHOIS cache) |
| `/banlist` | Open the ban-management modal: list the channel's `+b` masks (mask · set-by · time), **add** a ban via an easy mask builder (nick → `nick!*@*` / `*!*@host` / `*!user@host`, or paste a mask verbatim), **remove** a ban in one click. Op-gated as a hint (non-ops see a de-emphasised, still-clickable UI — the server's 482 is the real gate) |
| `/invite <nick> [#chan]` | INVITE (active channel by default) |
| `/umode <modes>` | Set own user modes (e.g. `/umode +i`) |
| `/umode` | With NO mode args: open the user-mode (umode) viewer/editor modal — your own umodes as retro toggle buttons; server/services-managed umodes (o/r/a/A/S) shown read-only. Also reachable via `/mode <yournick>` or by tapping the umode indicator on the network-header row |
| `/mode <#chan> <modes> [args]` | Apply channel `MODE` directly (e.g. `/mode #c +k key`) |
| `/mode [#chan]` | With NO mode args: open the mode viewer/editor modal (retro toggle buttons; chanop-gated editing; available modes from the network's ISUPPORT). Bare `/mode` targets the current channel; tapping the mode indicator next to the topic opens it too |
| `/ns <cmd>` · `/cs` `/ms` `/os` `/hs` `/rs` `<cmd>` | Send a command to a network service (NickServ / ChanServ / MemoServ / OperServ / HelpServ / RootServ); the reply shows inline in the server window |
| `/ns` · `/cs` `/ms` … (bare) | With NO args: open the dedicated **services console** modal (titled by the service) and fire `help` — the service's NOTICEs mirror into the modal (nick stripped, service in the title) with a `>` command prompt, instead of flooding the server window. The notices also stay in the server window (mirror, not move). Display-only: the modal never drives an auth action off notice content (the source nick is spoofable) |
| `/away [reason]` | Set away; bare `/away` clears explicit away |
| `/notify <nick>…` · `/watch <nick>…` | Watch nicks for presence (online/offline dots + toasts); bare opens the **watch lists** settings section |
| `/hilight <pattern>` · `/dehilight <pattern>` | Add / remove a highlight keyword (alias `/highlight`); bare opens the **watch lists** settings section |
| `/alias <name> <expansion>` · `/unalias <name>` | Define / remove your own slash-command alias (`/alias wii whois $1 $1` → `/wii foo` runs `/whois foo foo`). `$1`..`$9` positional, `$N-` the Nth arg and everything after it (`/alias k kick $1 $2-`), `$*` all args; with no placeholder the rest is appended. Server-synced per user; builtins can't be shadowed. Bare `/alias` opens the **aliases** settings section, where existing aliases are also editable in place (rename + change expansion) |
| `/credits` | Roll the end titles — the same modal as the **credits** entry at the bottom of the settings drawer, one verb deep instead of three taps |
| `/connect <network>` | Unpark + respawn a network |
| `/disconnect [network] [reason]` | Park one network (persists across reboots until `/connect`) |
| `/reconnect [network] [reason]` | Bounce one network — park, then unpark, in that order (irssi's `RECONNECT`). The one-command form of `/disconnect` + `/connect`, and the way to re-roll a vhost (the source address is picked per connect). Bare form targets the active window's network; the reason travels as the upstream QUIT |
| `/quit [reason]` | Park all networks, QUIT upstream, log out |

Per-window UI behavior — channel header, query/DM focus rule, archive section, the server-owned window-state machine, mobile layout, scrollback polish, the mention-aware scroll-to-bottom badge (jump to the next unseen mention below), mentions-while-away, auto-away, image upload, multi-line paste flood guard (a confirm dialog before pasting >3 lines, since each line sends as its own message) — is documented in `docs/DESIGN_NOTES.md`. cic mirrors server state; it never originates window state client-side.

## Scope

**In scope:** text chat on IRC (channels, queries, notices, CTCP ACTION); multi-network per user AND per visitor (visitors auto-connect the admin-flagged set at login + one-tap-connect more from the home page, park/reconnect each network independently, persistent across reboot); persistent paginated scrollback; NickServ auth bridging (including a guided in-app "📝 Register nick" wizard that walks non-technical users through NickServ registration — Azzurra networks, via the emailed confirmation code — and auto-saves the password so the nick auto-identifies thereafter); a per-network **on-connect perform list** (raw IRC commands run server-side automatically at every (re)connect, at 001 before channels are joined — auto-identify, `/oper`, `+x`, auto-rejoin — edited in a settings panel, with `$nickserv_pass` / `$oper_pass` variables so passwords stay out of the text and encrypted at rest, plus `$nick` for the configured nick so an identify still names the account when the session landed on an alt nick; NOT slash-commands or aliases); media sharing — images, video, and files uploaded to and hosted by grappa, surfaced on IRC as a plain link (📸/🎬/📄), opened in cicchetto's in-app image/video viewer, with client-side video transcode before upload; **receiving** a file a peer offers over `DCC SEND` (grappa connects OUT, holds the offer for the user's consent, spools the bytes into an authenticated DCC inbox — never the public upload route — and posts a 📥 link in the conversation the offer arrived in; it never listens, so passive/reverse DCC is refused); a PWA that works on phones without an app-store detour; self-hosting for individuals and small groups.

**Out of scope:** **offering** a file over DCC from grappa (DCC SEND outbound — the upload store already hands out an HTTPS URL, so a second transport for the same bytes buys nothing; grappa does RECEIVE an offered file, see In scope, and refuses passive/reverse DCC precisely so it never has to listen); real-time voice / video calls and audio messages; inline auto-rendering of media in scrollback (media is a click-to-view link, never an autoplay/preview card); hosted multi-tenant SaaS (self-hosted only); push notification servers (PWA push only if the browser provides it).

## Status & roadmap

Pre-alpha, late stage. Phases 1–3 (server skeleton, multi-user auth, client skeleton) and most of Phase 4 (irssi-shape UI) have shipped and run in production — a FreeBSD bastille jail on `m42`, live at [`irc.sindro.me`](https://irc.sindro.me) for `it-opers` people since 2026-05-27. Phase 5 hardening is in flight.

The road to **PUBLIC OPEN** (self-hostable by anyone, not just a single operator) is a sequence of clusters, each shipped to the live operator before the next begins:

1. **Voice TTS+STT** — on-device Web Speech, per-channel toggle.
2. **UI polish** — a real mobile-first pass (breakpoints beyond 768px, touch-target sizing, sidebar ergonomics, scroll behavior).
3. **PUBLIC OPEN** — gated on Phase 5 hardening (TLS verification replacing `verify: :verify_none`, scrollback eviction, NickServ REGISTER proxy), self-hoster docs, and a published OpenAPI schema.

Phase 6 (the IRCv3 listener facade — `CHATHISTORY`, `server-time`, `batch`, `labeled-response`, drop-in for Goguma/Quassel) is long-tail work beyond PUBLIC OPEN. The full backlog lives in GitHub issues; design decisions in `docs/DESIGN_NOTES.md`.

## Prior art

Read for behavior, not imported — grappa is greenfield: [soju](https://soju.im/) (the reference for correct bouncer behavior: SASL, scrollback, reconnect/backoff), [gamja](https://sr.ht/~emersion/gamja/) (web-login + PWA flows), [The Lounge](https://thelounge.chat/) (canonical manifest + service-worker), [IRCCloud](https://www.irccloud.com/) (the mobile-IRC UX north star), [ZNC](https://znc.in/) (every bouncer exists in dialogue with it).

## Why "grappa" and "cicchetto"

"Grappa" is Italian distillate — the direct homologue of Korean *soju*. "Cicchetto" is the small glass of wine served at a Venetian *bàcaro*, parallel to *gamja*. A deliberate riff on soju/gamja. It's also a tribute: **Italian Grappa!** has been the call-sign of the [Italian Hackers' Embassy](https://events.ccc.de/camp/2019/wiki/Village:Italian_Hackers'_Embassy) at European hacker camps since 2001. This repository isn't affiliated with the [association](https://italiangrappa.it/) that carries the name today; it borrows the reference in the spirit it was intended — Italian hackers showing up somewhere with a bottle.

## Backstory

grappa has a motive, not just an architecture. Three posts tell it:

- **2002 — [Forking Bahamut for Azzurra IRC](https://sindro.me/posts/2026-04-13-bahamut-fork-azzurra-irc-ipv6-ssl/)** — a 21-year-old forking an IRC server to add IPv6 + SSL because the Italian network he'd fallen for needed it. Why IRC, and why Azzurra.
- **2002–2005 — [Sux Services](https://sindro.me/posts/2026-04-14-suxserv-multithreaded-sql-irc-services/)** — writing SQL-backed IRC services from scratch in C, because the off-the-shelf ones weren't good enough. Same instinct grappa runs on: if the existing thing is almost right, write the thing.
- **2026 — [Claude walks into #it-opers](https://sindro.me/posts/2026-04-17-claude-walks-into-it-opers/)** — twenty-four years later, the same crew on the same network in the same channel, with a Claude Code session bridged into IRC as `vjt-claude`. The evening that surfaced "we should just do this."

The throughline: **nostalgia, honestly admitted** — Azzurra is still alive, preserved across network "earthquakes" by people who still want it there; the spirit carries on, and *the network* (not any single nick) is the persistence worth investing in. A **preference for self-hosted chat** that keeps working when this year's SaaS pivots or dies. And a **preference for text only** — no unfurls, no reactions on reactions, no presence surveillance. Just text, the thing the brain wants at 23:00 after a day on Teams. grappa isn't a product; it's a tool for people who still want IRC on a phone in 2026 and would rather self-host it than rent it.
