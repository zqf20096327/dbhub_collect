### What is it?

- A lightweight, snappy tool for everyday queries
  - Quick startup: loads up in less than a second in my machine.
  - Small memory footprint
  - Small bundle size
- Most importantly, pgpad is _free_, and will always be. That includes not ever having a "Community Edition", pop-ups that ask you for an upgrade, or anything of the sort.

### What is it _not_?

- A fully-fledged professional DB management system like DBeaver.
