# HAR Capture Suite

Auto-capture network traffic from Chrome — including requests Chrome DevTools itself misses — view requests live in a desktop app with virtualized timeline, persist sessions to SQLite, and export to **HAR** or **ZIP** — with optional sensitive-data redaction.

Captures across **cross-origin iframes (OOPIFs)** and **workers** via flat CDP sessions, so traffic from embedded captchas, payment iframes (Stripe 3DS), and navigating form-POST signups (which the default DevTools Network view drops) is recorded too.

Two pieces:

- **`extension/`** — Chrome MV3 extension. Uses `chrome.debugger` (CDP) with `Target.setAutoAttach` flat sessions to read Network events from a tab **and all its child frames/workers**. Streams them over a paired local WebSocket.
- **`desktop-app/`** — Electron + React + TypeScript app. Runs a token-authenticated WebSocket server (`127.0.0.1:9876`), persists captures to SQLite, manages sessions, and exports.

## What's captured

- **Capture scope** — _Data + navigations_ (default): XHR, Fetch, WebSocket, **Document** (page loads & form-POST signups), Ping/beacon, EventSource, and other API traffic — excluding static assets. _Everything_: adds images, CSS, fonts, scripts. Toggle in the desktop toolbar or extension popup.
- **OOPIF + worker traffic** — cross-origin iframe and (service/dedicated) worker requests, via recursive flat-session auto-attach. This is what makes captcha endpoints and same-tab third-party flows visible.
- **Flow capture (sticky tabs)** — once a tab starts capturing (allowlist match **or** the popup's _Capture this tab_ button), it keeps capturing across **every navigation in that tab**, including to non-allowlisted domains (e.g. `chatgpt.com → stripe.com` during checkout). Stops when the tab closes, capture is turned off, or you click _Stop capturing this tab_.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (LTS)
- Google Chrome / Chromium / Edge
- Windows / macOS / Linux

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

This installs all workspaces (root, `extension/`, `desktop-app/`, `shared/`).

## Build the Chrome extension

```bash
npm run build:extension
```

Output goes to `extension/dist/`. Then load it in Chrome:

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select `extension/dist/`
5. Pin the extension

## Run the desktop app

```bash
npm run dev
```

Electron starts in dev mode (Vite HMR for the renderer). The bridge server starts on `127.0.0.1:9876`.

Production build:

```bash
npm run build:desktop
npm start
```

Distributable installers:

```bash
npm run dist    # full installer for current OS
npm run pack    # unpacked binary, no installer
```

## Pairing (first run)

1. Start the desktop app. The status bar shows a **truncated pairing token** (click it to view full).
2. Click the token → **Copy**.
3. Open the extension popup → **Pairing** tab → paste → **Pair**.
4. The status bar dot turns green: **"Extension paired"**.

The token persists between runs. You can regenerate it at any time.

## Usage

1. Add domains in the extension popup or the desktop app's **Allowlist** dialog.
2. Visit an allowlisted page in Chrome. The extension attaches the Chrome debugger (yellow info bar appears — **leave it open**, closing it detaches the debugger).
3. The desktop app fills with live requests. Click a row to inspect; right-click for actions.
4. **Export HAR** or **Export ZIP** to save the current filter result.

## Dynamic response decoding

Response decoding is best-effort and does **not** require uploading a `.proto` file for ordinary captures. The shared decoder receives retained bytes from the Chrome extension and desktop MITM (app/CLI) paths:

1. Known text-like responses are decoded as strict UTF-8. Complete JSON is pretty-printed; malformed JSON remains text with a diagnostic.
2. `gzip`, `deflate`, and Brotli (`br`) are supported when the runtime provides Node's built-in `zlib`. Gzip/deflate magic bytes are also detected when no encoding header is available. Encoding chains are applied in reverse order.
3. Binary MIME types, invalid UTF-8, invalid compression, and unsupported encodings never discard the response. The decoder returns bounded diagnostics plus raw base64 and a hexadecimal preview.
4. Protobuf-like binary responses are parsed without a schema for wire types 0, 1, 2, and 5. The Decoded view shows field numbers, wire types, readable embedded strings, nested-message candidates, or opaque values as base64/hex. This is explicitly schema-less output; it does not claim universal semantic protobuf decoding.
5. Named protobuf fields appear only when a caller supplies validated descriptor metadata from the bounded passive registry. The registry accepts structurally recognized `FileDescriptorSet` bytes, keys entries by host/service, caps the registry at 32 entries and 512 KiB per descriptor, and never executes schema code or issues reflection requests.

### Binary-response workflow

1. Enable normal browser capture, **App Capture**, or **Capture all new terminals (global)** for a CLI. For Global capture, open a new terminal after enabling it, as described in [CLI capture](#cli-capture-terminal-only).
2. Select the captured request in the desktop app. `Response`/`Decoded` shows text, JSON, or the schema-less protobuf tree when available.
3. Use `Raw` for the captured base64 representation, `Hex` for the bounded byte preview, and `Metadata` for format, MIME type, content encoding, response size, truncation, and diagnostics.
4. Binary response rows retain the real MIME type and set an explicit base64 flag. HAR export writes `response.content.encoding: "base64"` for those rows, and ZIP request JSON retains the captured row and decoder metadata.

### Limits and unsupported cases

- The decoder retains at most 5 MiB per response. The renderer caps text output at 100,000 characters and visible protobuf fields at 512; protobuf parsing also caps recursion depth at 16 and fields at 1,024.
- Unknown or proprietary formats, encrypted payloads, malformed protobuf, and compression unavailable in the current runtime remain raw binary with diagnostics. No key recovery or universal semantic decoding is attempted.
- Descriptor discovery is passive. The current capture/UI path does not upload `.proto` files or probe gRPC reflection automatically; without validated descriptor metadata, field names are intentionally omitted.
- WebSocket binary frames preserve direction, opcode, size, and base64 fidelity for HAR/ZIP export. The Decoded/Hex response panels apply to HTTP response bodies; per-frame protobuf decoding is not automatic.

## CLI capture (terminal-only)

The desktop command box is for **non-interactive** commands only; it does not
provide a TTY. Run Claude Code, Gemini, and other interactive CLIs in your own
terminal:

1. Open **Capture CLI** and enable **Capture all new terminals (global)**.
2. Close existing PowerShell, CMD, or Git Bash windows. They keep the
   environment they inherited when they started.
3. Open a new terminal and verify the generated environment before starting
   the CLI:

   **PowerShell**

   ```powershell
   $env:HTTPS_PROXY
   $env:NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS
   ```

   **CMD**

   ```cmd
   echo %HTTPS_PROXY%
   echo %NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS%
   ```

4. Run the interactive CLI in that new terminal. Tools that honor standard
   proxy and CA environment variables are captured by the desktop app.
5. Disable Global capture when finished. The exact user-environment values
   from before enablement are restored.

Global mode only affects processes started after the new terminal is opened.
It cannot force a tool that ignores proxy environment variables, and
certificate-pinned clients are not capturable through this mode. Java also
needs the generated CA imported into its truststore with `keytool`.

## Sessions

Each desktop-app launch creates a new session by default. Sessions are persisted to SQLite:

- **Sidebar** lists all past sessions with request counts.
- Click a session to load it (current session is closed first).
- **Double-click** a session to rename it inline.
- Right-click a session in the sidebar to delete.
- **New session** button: opens a name dialog and starts fresh without losing previous captures.

SQLite DB location: `<userData>/har-suite/capture.db`.

## Allowlist matching

A tab **starts** capturing when its top-level host equals an allowlisted entry **or** ends with `.<entry>`.

| Allowlist entry   | Matches                                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `example.com`     | `example.com`, `www.example.com`, `api.example.com` |
| `api.example.com` | `api.example.com`, `v2.api.example.com`             |
| `localhost`       | `localhost` only (no subdomains)                    |

Once a tab has started capturing, **flow capture (sticky tabs)** keeps it recording across every subsequent navigation in that same tab — including to domains not on the allowlist (the root domain, another subdomain, or a third party like a payment provider). This means you do **not** need to pre-add every domain in a multi-step flow. Capture for a sticky tab stops only when the tab closes, capture is turned off, or you click _Stop capturing this tab_ in the popup. You can also start sticky capture on any tab with the popup's **Capture this tab** button, regardless of the allowlist.

## Export formats

- **`.har`** — Standard HAR 1.2. Open in Chrome DevTools (Network → drop file) or any HAR viewer.
- **`.zip`** — Contains:
  - `capture.har` — full HAR
  - `summary.json` — flat list of requests with timing/status
  - `metadata.json` — export timestamp, tool version, redaction flag
  - `requests/` — one JSON file per request with raw captured data (including WebSocket frames)

> **RAR not supported**: pure-JS RAR creation is not freely available. ZIP is recommended; open the ZIP and re-archive with WinRAR if you specifically need RAR.

## Sensitive-data redaction

Open the **Redaction** dialog from the toolbar to mask values at export time:

- **Header patterns** (substring, case-insensitive): default `authorization`, `cookie`, `set-cookie`, `x-api-key`, `x-auth-token`, `proxy-authorization`.
- **Body JSON keys**: default `password`, `secret`, `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `id_token`.

Matched values become `<redacted>` in the exported HAR/ZIP. Captured data in memory and SQLite is unchanged — toggle redaction off and re-export to get the original values back.

## CAPTCHA detection

When an allowlisted page triggers or renders a CAPTCHA, the suite extracts the **provider** and **sitekey** and surfaces them in the **CAPTCHAs** panel (toolbar button + status-bar pill).

Because the extension auto-attaches into **cross-origin iframes**, captcha widgets that render in their own frame (the common case for reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, Turnstile, Arkose) now have their network requests captured, so the network path below detects them reliably instead of intermittently.

Three detection paths run in parallel:

1. **Network URL parsing** — every captured request URL is matched against known endpoints:
   - reCAPTCHA v2/v3/Enterprise: `www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/*`, `/recaptcha/enterprise/*` (sitekey in `k=`)
   - hCaptcha: `*.hcaptcha.com/getcaptcha/<sitekey>` or `sitekey=`
   - Cloudflare Turnstile: `challenges.cloudflare.com/...?sitekey=`
   - Arkose Labs / FunCaptcha: `*.arkoselabs.com/v2/<PUBLIC_KEY>/...`
   - GeeTest v3 (`gt=...&challenge=...`) and v4 (`captcha_id=...`)
   - DataDome: `captcha-delivery.com`, `datadome.co`
   - AWS WAF Captcha: `*.awswaf.com`

2. **DOM scan** (content script on allowlisted tabs) — looks for `.g-recaptcha[data-sitekey]`, `.h-captcha[data-sitekey]`, `.cf-turnstile[data-sitekey]`, Arkose script tags, and generic `[data-sitekey]`. Re-scans on DOM mutations.

3. **Page-world hook** (injected `<script>`) — wraps `grecaptcha.execute`, `grecaptcha.render`, `grecaptcha.enterprise.*`, `hcaptcha.execute/render`, and `turnstile.render/execute`. Captures the sitekey + `action` (for v3) at call time, even when no obvious DOM marker exists.

Detections are deduplicated by `(type, sitekey, pageHost)` and persisted to SQLite alongside requests. Use **Copy** in the panel to copy a sitekey to the clipboard.

Supported labels in the UI: `reCAPTCHA v2`, `reCAPTCHA v3`, `reCAPTCHA Enterprise`, `hCaptcha`, `Cloudflare Turnstile`, `Arkose Labs / FunCaptcha`, `GeeTest`, `GeeTest v4`, `DataDome`, `AWS WAF Captcha`, `Unknown` (generic `[data-sitekey]` fallback).

```

- Allowlist is the **single source of truth** in extension storage. Desktop app sends `set-allowlist` over the bridge; extension echoes back `allowlist-sync` so both sides stay in sync.
- Captures are written to SQLite in batches (500 ms flush) to avoid disk thrash under burst traffic.
- WebSocket frames are captured live and shown in the **Messages** tab of the request detail.
- The bridge requires `auth` as the first message with the matching token; otherwise the connection is dropped after a 5s grace period.

## Development

Watch the extension while iterating:

```bash
npm run dev:extension
```

After each rebuild, click **Reload** for the HAR Capture Suite entry on `chrome://extensions`. (Tip: install **Extensions Reloader** and pin its toolbar button for one-click reload.)

Run the renderer with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Renderer changes hot-reload automatically. Main-process changes require restarting `npm run dev`.

### Code quality

```bash
npm run lint        # ESLint
npm run format      # Prettier --write
npm test            # Vitest run
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
```

## Caveats

- The `chrome.debugger` API forces a yellow info bar in Chrome ("being debugged"). Closing that bar detaches the debugger and stops capture — keep it open while recording.
- Only one client (DevTools **or** this extension) can attach the debugger to a tab at a time. Close DevTools on tabs you want to capture.
- Response bodies for very large or streamed responses may be unavailable from CDP. The HAR entry will still be present without the body.
- MV3 service workers idle out after ~30 s. We use a `chrome.alarms` heartbeat (every 25 s) and event-driven re-attach to keep capture working, but you may briefly see a "disconnected" status during the wake.

## Changelog

### 0.1.2

Capture reliability fixes.

**Desktop app (native-app / MITM capture)**

- `Clear` now deletes the active session's persisted requests from SQLite (previously they reloaded when the session was reopened).
- Copy as cURL / fetch now applies the same redaction as export when redaction is enabled (secrets no longer copied in cleartext). Copy URL remains raw.
- The global Capture toggle now also gates native-app/CLI (MITM) ingestion — turning capture off stops app traffic too, and the status reflects it.
- Native-app WebSocket traffic through the MITM proxy is now captured (connection row + sent/received frames), matching the browser path.

**Chrome extension (CDP capture)**

- Request and WebSocket durations are now computed from a single monotonic time base — previously every extension-captured entry exported `time: 0` (epoch/monotonic mismatch).
- Fixed a race in debugger `attach()` where two concurrent attach attempts on one navigation could delete a live attachment (hung debugger banner / re-attach loop).
- Long-lived WebSockets: their in-flight entry is exempt from the generic eviction cap (frames no longer silently dropped on busy pages), and per-request `wsMessages` are bounded (`MAX_WS_MESSAGES`).
- Binary/base64 fidelity: responses keep their real content-type with a separate base64 flag, and binary WebSocket frames are marked `encoding: base64` in the HAR (`_webSocketMessages`); legacy captures remain readable.
- Extension manifest version aligned with the app version.
