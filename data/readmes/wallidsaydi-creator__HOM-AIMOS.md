# HOM-AIMOS

**A local-first security and long-term memory backend for AI agents.**

[![CI](https://github.com/wallidsaydi-creator/HOM-AIMOS/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wallidsaydi-creator/HOM-AIMOS/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Agents become more useful when they remember—and more dangerous when nobody can
explain who wrote a memory, where it came from, why it changed, or what it later
caused. HOM-AIMOS makes those questions part of the memory system itself.

It gives an agent one governed path to remember, one governed path to recall,
and a cryptographic trail across identity, origin, provenance, mutation, tool
use, and durable outcomes. It runs on the user's Mac, keeps its canonical brain
in PostgreSQL, and does not require a hosted HOM-AIMOS account or control plane.

**Current release:** `v1.0.5` · macOS 14+ · Node.js 20/24/26 · PostgreSQL 18 ·
AGPL-3.0-or-later

## What HOM-AIMOS gives your agent

| Need | What the system provides |
|---|---|
| Memory that survives sessions and restarts | Persistent sessions, canonical SAVE, native hybrid/graph RECALL, and signed terminal outcomes. |
| Evidence about where memory came from | Native Origin Binding derives and commits source, family, principal, and action evidence with the memory. |
| Protection against unsafe recalled context | Provenance verification, epistemic classification, Canary traversal controls, disclosure policy, and signed recall receipts. |
| Learning without silent rewriting | Content remains immutable while governed retrieval weight can change through signed, bounded, reversible transitions. |
| Autonomous upkeep without impersonating the user | A separate Housekeeper identity owns maintenance, scheduling, dreams, and authorized mutation. |
| A history that can be inspected later | Append-only ledgers retain attempts, denials, failures, supersession, and successful durable effects. |
| A clean reset when a project truly ends | One explicit, offline, all-or-nothing brain purge; no selective forgetting disguised as maintenance. |

## Why it is different

- **Security is inside memory, not bolted on afterward.** Identity, origin,
  authorization, retention, provenance, and terminal evidence participate in
  the same SAVE and RECALL lifecycles.
- **One memory system means one authority path.** HTTP, MCP, sessions,
  autonomous work, and tool results converge on canonical owners instead of
  maintaining parallel stores or privileged shortcuts.
- **Full retention is structural.** Suspicious, contradicted, or superseded
  observations remain auditable. Policy may change how evidence is used; it
  cannot quietly erase history.
- **Agent identity is not a model subscription.** Provider/model choice is an
  optional signed policy. An enrolled identity remains independent of the
  provider used for a particular task.
- **Claims are bounded honestly.** HOM-AIMOS can prove that retained bytes,
  authority, ordering, and transitions verify. It cannot prove that an
  authorized source told the truth.

## Start locally

Clone the repository on a supported Mac, inspect the prerequisites, and run the
single public installer:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wallidsaydi-creator/HOM-AIMOS.git
cd HOM-AIMOS
./install-macos.sh --check
./install-macos.sh
```

First launch creates the database, restricted runtime role, autonomous
Housekeeper, signed Guide corpus, operator root, and one ordinary agent selected
by the user. It then installs HOM-AIMOS as a persistent user service. The
operator enters one passphrase for the complete onboarding flow.

Confirm that it is running:

```sh
npm run service:status
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:9100/healthz
```

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for the exact signed SAVE/RECALL workflow,
additional agent enrollment, upgrades, recovery, and the whole-brain purge
boundary.

## The product boundary

This repository is the HOM-AIMOS backend and developer integration surface. It
is not a hosted model, a model provider, or a graphical agent application. It
exposes signed local HTTP and MCP surfaces so an agent or application can use
the same memory and security owners without direct database access.

## Under the hood: the retrieval-memory substrate

HOM-AIMOS is a complete persistent-memory backend, not a provenance layer
attached to a vector store. Its source-derived architecture binds a
current 295-service census and declares six critical pipelines containing 115
service connections. SAVE exposes one fixed 15-stage owner; RECALL exposes its
eight principal native execution boundaries.

### SAVE — 15 fixed stages

`services/write/canonical-save-owner.js` owns:

```text
AUTH → RECEIPT → CANARY → SE → ALADDIN → VALIDATOR → QUALITY
→ SECRET_BOUNDARY → EMBEDDING → PERSISTENCE → PROVENANCE → LINEAGE
→ GRAPH → EPISTEMIC → TERMINAL
```

The signed terminal is inserted in the same restricted transaction as a
successful memory/provenance/lineage/graph/epistemic commit. Failed or rejected
operations retain a non-success terminal and cannot return success.
External transports preserve their verified request or tool authority.
Autonomous services call a separate typed entrypoint that first appends a
Housekeeper-signed action commitment over the exact SAVE projection. A bare
`housekeeper` field is not authority, and public routes cannot mint autonomous
Housekeeper actions.

### Recall — 8 stages

| # | Stage | Native owner |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Query understanding and path selection | `services/retrieval/native-recall-pipeline.js` |
| 2 | Embedding and candidate opening | `services/core/embeddings.js` |
| 3 | Similarity statistics | `services/retrieval/similarity-stats.js` |
| 4 | Trust scoring | `services/learning/trust-score.js` |
| 5 | Permanent dense, sparse, temporal, entity, QuIM, internal QMD candidates, HyDE, and concept gears plus one bounded Reconstructed-Graph G2 family channel with central deterministic RRF | `services/retrieval/native-recall-pipeline.js`, `services/retrieval/native-retrieval-fusion.js`, `services/retrieval/reconstructed-graph-native-candidate.js` |
| 6 | Verified epistemic projection and selection | `services/retrieval/epistemic-trust-retrieval.js` |
| 7 | Pre-disclosure calibration | `services/retrieval/recall-calibrator.js` |
| 8 | Bounded evidence and signed receipt | `services/retrieval/native-recall.js` |

### Native retrieval gearbox

Recall is a cooperative gearbox, not a competition in which one retriever
replaces the memory system. The native fusion owner combines vector, BM25,
lexical, temporal, QuIM, QMD, HyDE, entity, Concept/PPR, and one bounded graph
family channel. Every outer channel has one vote in deterministic reciprocal
rank fusion; a graph subgear cannot multiply its voting mass or remove the
admitted baseline.

QMD is internal candidate logic under canonical recall authority. Its former
standalone route, MCP tool, parser, and planner were removed after live proof
showed that the separate surface could disclose memory without the canonical
origin-aware recall receipt. Historical plans and audits retain that record.

MAGMA is retained as dormant research. Its paper adaptation, principal-scoped
reader, pure kernel, tests, and signed historical artifacts remain reviewable,
but canonical recall does not call it, accept its discoveries, or give it a
rank vote. This boundary follows a current-stack utility/latency failure and is
represented explicitly in recall metadata rather than hidden behind a flag.

Reconstructed Graph G2 is the sole bounded subgear in the live family channel.
Additional graph candidates are evaluated one at a time as marginal additions
to the complete gearbox; they are not advertised as active merely because a
service or isolated test exists.

### Cognitive mutation — retained, bounded, reversible

HOM-AIMOS does not treat memory as static after admission. It keeps canonical
content immutable while allowing its retrieval weight to move bidirectionally
within `[0.1, 3.0]` as signed evidence changes. A low weight means lower
retrieval frequency, never deletion or ineligibility.

Three native mutation lanes converge on one certified database writer:

- outcome adaptation appends signed positive or negative evidence to
  `services/governance/valence-ledger.js`, computes an age-neutral cumulative
  valence through `services/governance/valence-judge.js`, and applies the
  bounded reference-point update in `services/learning/stdp-kernel.js`;
- SPICED consolidation may strengthen eligible retained memories through
  `services/dream/spiced-consolidator.js`; and
- optional Hebbian consensus may elevate supported hubs or attenuate divergent
  evidence through `services/dream/hebbian-consensus.js`. This lane is
  shadow-first and disabled until its signed governor flag is enabled.

Every changed target passes through
`services/governance/governor-provenance.js`, which appends a housekeeper-signed
`REWEIGHT` node and creates a distinct fixed-width transition signature. The
`apply_signed_cognitive_reweight` function in migration 091 verifies the exact
tenant, memory, signer epoch, old and new milliscaled weights, provenance hash,
continuity, and no-fork predecessor before it atomically appends the projection
and updates only `retrieval_weight`. A quantized no-op retains its signed
outcome evidence without inventing a transition.

`verify_cognitive_weight_chain()` and `verify_all_cognitive_weight_chains()`
replay the database evidence, while
`services/security/cognitive-weight-verifier.js` independently verifies the
same baseline, provenance, signature, continuity, terminal-state, and corpus
proof-root contracts. The normative byte layout and invariants are published
in [`docs/security/cognitive-weight-chain-SPEC.md`](docs/security/cognitive-weight-chain-SPEC.md).

The save manifest declares 15 critical service connections; recall declares
34 spanning exact-identifier, semantic, temporal, graph, procedural, and
lineage paths. The service census contains retrieval 61, orchestration 43,
security 51, temporal 22, learning 23, observe 22, core 15, write 15, context
9, integrations 9, governance 7, dream 5, ingestion 4, shared 4, answering 2,
runtime 2, and caching 1.

`services/pipeline-manifest.js` is the source of truth for the six critical
connection maps. Its validator dynamically imports all 115 declarations and
checks their named exports; architecture tests and the release-source gate fail
when the declared topology and public documentation diverge.

## Security is the architecture

The save and recall paths are a working memory system on their own. The
cryptographic layer enters at explicit boundaries:

- SAVE stage 14 assigns each retained memory a signed, reversible epistemic
  label bound to its live content hash.
- Recall stages 6–8 verify and consume the epistemic projection, apply a
  verified calibration snapshot, and return bounded evidence under an
  RFC 6962-style domain-separated Merkle receipt.
- Cognitive mutation changes retrieval weight within a constitutional interval
  only through housekeeper-authorized signed transitions. Each transition binds
  the terminal provenance node, signer epoch, quantized old and new weights,
  and no-fork predecessor.
- Ed25519 verification runs in the database mutation boundary and in an
  independent portable verifier.

Security is not a filter placed after retrieval. It is composed into identity,
save, recall, mutation, tools, graph selection, and evidence output:

- **Signed authority:** protected requests bind the certificate identity,
  method, path, body, nonce, and timestamp. Runtime policy comes from verified,
  append-only configuration—not request fields or environment variables.
- **Native Origin Binding:** the server derives each SAVE origin and typed
  classification family from verified ingress, retained inputs, and action
  evidence. The binding commits atomically with memory, propagates
  conservatively through derived values, appears in signed RECALL evidence,
  and is consumed before consequential tool execution. A caller, model, or
  Housekeeper signature cannot silently upgrade input integrity.
- **Retention-preserving poison evidence:** potentially poisoned content is
  retained and receives a signed, reversible epistemic label. Recall consumes
  that label before active-context disclosure.
- **Canary traversal controls:** explicit generated markers are inspected at
  `PERSISTED`, `RELAYED`, `EXECUTED`, and `EXPOSED` boundaries. Marked memory is
  retained under quarantine; marked relay, tool input, or tool output is kept
  out of the downstream execution context. Canary detects its explicit marker
  family, not arbitrary unmarked poisoning.
- **Governed graph retrieval:** the source-bound Reconstructed Graph G2
  adaptation is the sole live subgear inside one structural family channel,
  fused with dense, sparse, temporal, entity, QuIM, QMD, HyDE, and concept
  evidence. It cannot replace the admitted baseline. MAGMA is retained dormant
  with zero runtime execution or rank contribution. The caller's
  verified identity/grant scopes its reads; provenance, epistemic, Canary,
  Aladdin-retention, and signed-recall owners retain final disclosure authority.
- **Signed self-red-teaming:** the SABER-inspired operational harness commits a
  fixed manifest, one native signed decision per case, and signed terminal or
  failed campaign evidence. Validation and reports reconstruct from verified
  event IDs; callers cannot submit their own security aggregate.

Canonical memory is never selectively removed, decayed, expired, suppressed,
or deactivated. The sole erasure path is an offline, master-signed,
all-or-nothing whole-brain purge that emits a signed terminal receipt.

## Published benchmark snapshot (historical)

The following values are the retained MutMem V2 publication snapshot. They are
preserved for reproducibility and comparison, not used as a version lock or a
release gate for the evolving system.

| Result | Value |
|---|---:|
| LongMemEval, LLM-judged | 459/500 — 91.8% |
| LoCoMo, LLM-judged | 1472/1986 — 74.12% |
| LoCoMo, separate upstream-compatible token F1 | 58.20 |
| PoisonedRAG N=100, poison in attacked top-5 disclosures | 0/100 |
| Same target set, epistemic policy bypassed | 94/100 |
| Mutation authorization rejection cases | 7/7 |
| Cognitive tamper cases detected | 4/4 |
| SQL/portable cognitive verifier parity | 9/9 records |
| Signed cognitive-transition latency, median | 4.865 ms |
| MAGMA retained research proof (historical) | 20/20 signed recalls; 8/20 graph-discovery observations; candidate p95 218.941 ms under its fixed 250 ms gate |
| MAGMA current-stack ruling | Dormant: later Gate50 evidence recall −0.028 and judged accuracy −0.04, candidate p95 430.081 ms; no canonical recall caller or rank vote |
| Reconstructed Graph G2 additive proof | 840/840 exact fixed-corpus rows; multi-hop nDCG@20 +0.012325; evidence recall@20 +0.021237 |
| Reconstructed Graph G2 canonical live proof | 20/20 signed recalls; incremental p95 27.023 ms under its unchanged 50 ms gate; canonical roots unchanged |
| SABER-inspired live operational campaign | 27/27 attacks blocked or retained-quarantined; 0/28 benign false positives; 0 indeterminate |

These are distinct protocols and are not averaged. The utility, poisoning, and
mutation figures regenerate from the sanitized, self-hashed aggregate in
[`eval/publication/verified-benchmark-results.json`](eval/publication/verified-benchmark-results.json),
which binds the promoted publication runs by SHA-256. MAGMA's retained
historical artifacts and the operational red-team campaign are separate from
that aggregate; dormant MAGMA evidence is not presented as current runtime
performance.

The central security distinction is **integrity, not omniscience**. AIMOS can
prove that an authorized identity asserted a specific memory at a particular
ledger position and that the retained evidence has not been silently rewritten.
It cannot prove that the asserted content is factually true. The threat model
names this failure class **Authenticated-But-False (ABF)**.

## Release and research lineage

This repository contains the HOM-AIMOS 1.0.5 source release. It advances the
system beyond the published MutMem V2 snapshot with complete native Origin
Binding: typed family classification, atomic SAVE binding, conservative
producer propagation, origin-bearing RECALL evidence, and exact
consequential-action authority. Current releases are qualified against current
runtime, security, installer, dependency, and clean-Genesis behavior. Historical
paper artifacts and benchmark aggregates remain available as dated research
records but do not constrain current source bytes.

The architecture manifest mechanically binds the current 295-service census.
That number is an inventory fact, not a performance claim.

## Security and retention invariants

- External save, recall, credential, authorization, and mutation actions are
  bound to signed certificate envelopes.
- Secrets and identity keys use macOS Keychain custody. `.env` files and
  environment-owned credentials are rejected as runtime authority.
- Canonical memory is never selectively deleted, decayed, expired, suppressed,
  or deactivated. Contradictions and corrections are retained through signed
  supersession and cognitive transitions.
- The sole erasure mechanism is an offline, master-signed, all-or-nothing
  whole-brain purge that emits a signed receipt.
- Security quarantine remains retained and recallable under its enforced
  clearance and cognitive policy.
- Retained reference memories carry a separate, signed, reversible epistemic
  label. Poison suspicion changes evidence handling without rewriting or
  deleting the underlying observation; later evidence may refute the label.
- Explicit Canary markers are tracked across persistence, relay, tool-input,
  and tool-output boundaries without being represented as a universal poison
  detector.
- SABER-inspired campaign evidence is diagnostic and evaluation-only. It has
  no runtime save, recall, ranking, quarantine, or disclosure authority and is
  not a DARPA certification claim.
- Native implementation only: no placeholder services, fake controls, runtime
  wrappers, or bypass hooks.

deploying or integrating AIMOS.

## Platform and prerequisites

The AIMOS 1.0.5 source release supports Intel and Apple silicon Macs running
macOS 14 or later. A clean installation requires:

- Apple Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`), including `git`, `curl`,
  a compiler, and `make`;
- Node.js 20, 24, or 26 with `npm`; the clean installer prefers Node 26;
- PostgreSQL 18;
- pgvector built for the selected PostgreSQL 18 server;
- libsodium and `pkg-config`/pkgconf; and
- macOS Keychain access.

Homebrew is the supported dependency provisioner for a clean source install,
but it is not AIMOS runtime authority and is not required when compatible
dependencies already exist. GPG is not required to install or run AIMOS. The
Genesis installer verifies or builds the checksum-locked pgsodium 3.1.11 source
and artifacts before database creation. Other operating systems and PostgreSQL
majors are not claimed as supported by this release.

## Install and start

Do not create the AIMOS database manually. Genesis owns database creation,
migrations, restricted-role custody, housekeeper enrollment, and signed Guide
ingestion.

Download the release source archive or clone the repository, then run from its
root:

```sh
cd HOM-AIMOS
./install-macos.sh --check
./install-macos.sh
```

The installer displays its plan and asks before Homebrew or Genesis changes
machine state. It uses the repository `Brewfile`, installs the locked npm graph,
hands control to native Genesis, and then performs generic first-launch
onboarding. Genesis creates the autonomous Housekeeper and Guide corpus first;
onboarding then asks you to choose an ordinary agent identity and one operator
passphrase. You may optionally select a provider/model or leave that policy
unset for later. No benchmark identity or workload is installed. The installer
does not download or execute the Homebrew installer itself.

For an explicit manual dependency path:

```sh
xcode-select --install              # only when Command Line Tools are absent
# Install Homebrew from https://brew.sh when no compatible toolchain exists.
brew bundle --file Brewfile
brew services start postgresql@18
npm ci
npm run genesis:install -- --aimos-db aimos --aimos-port 9100
node scripts/identity/onboard-agent.mjs --aimos-db aimos --aimos-port 9100
```

The installer completes Genesis, generic agent onboarding, and persistent user
service installation.
Check it with:

```sh
npm run service:status
```

Verify the live service:

```sh
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:9100/healthz
```

AIMOS owns port 9100. Other runtimes are outside this repository's supported
deployment boundary.

The complete enrollment, signed save/recall proof, upgrade, and purge ceremonies
are documented in [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

Release packages include SHA-256 checksums, a CycloneDX SBOM, and GitHub keyless
build provenance. GPG is not required. See [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) for online
and offline verification boundaries.

## Reproducibility has two layers

The **source-install layer** starts from a clean checkout. `install-macos.sh`
checks the supported toolchain, and Genesis creates the database, applies the
migrations, provisions the restricted runtime role and autonomous housekeeper,
generates machine-local authority, and ingests the manifest-bound Guide corpus
through the real signed save path. This proves that the released source can
construct the declared architecture without a pre-existing brain.

The **operator-ceremony layer** proves live security behavior without sharing
private keys. The installer has already created the operator root and first
ordinary agent. An operator may enroll an additional audit agent, append its
master-signed read/write grant, exercise signed save and recall, and run the
disposable security ceremony:

```sh
node scripts/identity/enroll-agent.js <audit-agent-id> --validity-days=30
node scripts/identity/authorize-recall.js <audit-agent-id> \
  --clearance=10 \
  --data-class=confidential \
  --reason="Local reproducibility ceremony" \
  --write
npm run test:security:isolated
```

Reproduction creates new signer epochs, nonces, event identifiers, and artifact
hashes; it verifies the protocol and invariants rather than attempting to copy
the original operator's signatures. Source-only and isolated tests remain
separate from deliberately authorized live ceremonies. Exact signed-envelope
examples and the whole-brain purge boundary are in
[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) and
[Guide/connect-to-aimos-cert-envelope.md](Guide/connect-to-aimos-cert-envelope.md).

## Architecture and agent guidance

- [ARCHITECTURE-MAP.md](ARCHITECTURE-MAP.md) describes the implemented runtime.
- [hom-architecture-manifest.json](hom-architecture-manifest.json) is the
  mechanically verified service inventory.
- [architecture-authority.template.json](architecture-authority.template.json)
  is the portable authority used to generate machine-local runtime authority.
- [Guide/AGENTS.md](Guide/AGENTS.md) is the LLM-agnostic boot and truth-hierarchy
  index. `Guide/` is also the cryptographically manifest-bound Genesis corpus.

## Verification

The ordinary source suite never touches a live database:

```sh
npm test
npm run lint
npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high
```

Benchmark contract tests require the public datasets, which are downloaded from
immutable upstream revisions and verified by SHA-256:

```sh
bash eval/data/download.sh
node eval/prepare-canonical-corpus.mjs
npm run test:benchmark:contracts
```

The complete release-source gate is:

```sh
npm run test:release:source
```

The isolated Genesis and signed live-fire ceremony uses a disposable database
and must be run with AIMOS 9100 stopped because it temporarily exercises the
machine-local housekeeper certificate cache:

```sh
npm run test:security:isolated
```

## Benchmark boundary

Benchmark data is never distributed under the AIMOS source license and is
never ingested into the canonical user brain. The isolated runner creates a
fresh Genesis-installed scratch brain and preserves signed save, session,
recall, model, judgment, and purge evidence separately.

Retrieval metrics and judged answer accuracy are reported independently. A
retrieval hit is not presented as a correct answer.
