🤖 You started the new management role about two months ago, and your sleep got worse around the same time — you mentioned staying up past 1am several times. The headaches might be linked. How's the work pressure been?

<sub>Causal chain: job change → sleep disruption → headaches. Timeline-aware, personally weighted.</sub>

## Quick Start

```bash
mkdir jkriver && cd jkriver
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wangjiake/JKRiver/main/docker/docker-compose.yaml
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
docker logs jkriver-jkriver-1 2>&1 | grep "Token:"
```

Open `http://localhost:1234`, enter the token, set your API key in **System**. Done.

| Service | URL | What it does |
|---------|-----|--------------|
| **JKRiver** | http://localhost:1234 | Web chat + system config |
| **RiverHistory** | http://localhost:2345 | Profile viewer |
| **API Docs** | http://localhost:8400/docs | REST API reference |

## What's New (May 2026)

### Family multi-user mode

JKRiver now supports multiple family members on a single deployment, each with their own isolated chat history, profile, memory, and finance/health data — sharing one Postgres database. Set up via **System → 家庭成员**:

- **Accounts** — `accounts` table maps an internal name (e.g. `wife`) to a numeric `owner_id`. Every business row (observations, profile, memory, finance, etc.) is namespaced by this id.
- **Devices** — `access_tokens` table stores per-device session tokens (SHA-256 hashed). Each family member can have multiple devices (their phone, your iPad, etc.).
- **Invite flow** — admin creates a one-time invite URL (with optional QR code) in the System page. Family member opens it on their device → names the device → cookie is set → logged in. Admin approval optional via `family.require_admin_approval` in settings.yaml.
- **IM mappings** — `channel_identities` maps Telegram/Discord user_id → owner_id, so messages from your wife's Telegram get routed to her account, not yours.
- **Per-owner sleep** — the sleep pipeline now loops over each owner with unprocessed conversations, so everyone's memories get extracted into their own profile without cross-contamination.
- **Per-owner token usage** — LLM API spend is tracked per owner so you can see who used how many tokens.

### UI improvements

- **Centered "zero-state" chat** — fresh chat sessions show a Gemini-style centered input with a soft blue radial glow, instead of an empty bottom-anchored area.
- **Gemini-style send button** — neutral pill that turns blue when the input has content, with the Material `send` icon. Stop button still red when a response is streaming.
- **Server-side i18n** — language is now rendered on the server (driven by a `jk_lang` cookie), so navigation between pages no longer flashes English text before client-side JS swaps it.
- **No-flicker first paint** — sidebar collapse state, zero-state mode, and theme (light/dark) are all applied via a synchronous `<head>` script before the first paint.

### Schema migrations

12 SQL migrations under `migrations/` cover the multi-owner roll-out: `005_multi_owner.sql` adds `owner_id` columns to 27 business tables (default 1 for existing rows); 006-007 fix UNIQUE constraints; 008 drops the legacy `hypotheses` table (functionality merged into `user_profile.layer`); 009 hashes device tokens and adds device metadata; 010-012 cover geoip, admin approval, and clean-up. Migrations are idempotent and run automatically at startup.

## Memory Engine

After each conversation, Riverse runs an offline consolidation pipeline (Sleep) that builds a structured personal profile:

- **Multi-type extraction** — facts, relationships, and time-bounded events are each tracked separately with their own lifecycle
- **Confidence progression** — facts start as `suspected`, get promoted to `confirmed` then `established` through multi-turn verification
- **Time decay** — each fact carries a `decay_days` TTL; stale facts expire automatically without manual cleanup
- **Invalidation** — when a fact changes, the old record is closed with an `end_time` and superseded by the new one; the full history is preserved
- **Contradiction resolution** — conflicting facts are detected and resolved through LLM arbitration
- **Evidence chains** — every fact links back to the conversations that produced it
- **Knowledge graph** — facts connect to each other through typed edges (causal, temporal, hierarchical)

All data lives in a local PostgreSQL database. Nothing leaves your machine.

### The Sleep Pipeline — 14 Steps

The entire pipeline runs atomically inside a single database transaction. If any step fails, everything rolls back.

| Phase | Step | What it does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Extract** | 1. Load initial | Load existing profile and life trajectory |
| | 2. Extract sessions | LLM extracts observations, tags, relationships, and events from each unprocessed conversation |
| **Analyze** | 3. Analyze behavior | LLM infers behavioral patterns from observations (e.g. "sends messages late at night" → "night owl"); generates clarification strategies |
| | 4. Classify & integrate | LLM classifies each observation as `support`, `contradict`, `evidence_against`, or `new` relative to existing facts; integrates results into the profile |
| | 5. Cross-verify | Suspected facts with `stated` source + mention count ≥ 2 auto-confirm; remaining suspected facts undergo LLM cross-verification with timeline and conversation history |
| | 6. Resolve disputes | LLM arbitrates contradicting fact pairs (supersede chains) — accept new or reject new |
| **Maintain** | 7. Extract edges | Build knowledge graph edges between affected facts |
| | 8. Expire facts | Close facts past their `expires_at` date; generate verification strategies for next conversation |
| | 9. Maturity decay | Adjust `decay_days` based on fact age and evidence count — long-standing, well-evidenced facts live longer (up to 2 years) |
| **Output** | 10. User model | LLM analyzes communication style dimensions from conversations |
| | 11. Trajectory | Update life-phase trajectory when significant changes are detected |
| | 12. Consolidate | Deduplicate the profile |
| | 13. Snapshot | Pre-compile a memory snapshot (profile + model + events + relationships + knowledge graph) for fast context injection |
| | 14. Finalize | Mark conversations as processed |

After the transaction, non-critical post-processing runs: vector embedding and memory clustering.

### Algorithm-First Design

Riverse's memory pipeline is architecturally designed beyond what current general-purpose LLMs can fully deliver. The 14-step Sleep consolidation requires precise structured judgment at each stage — observation extraction, fact classification, cross-verification, contradiction resolution — and cascading errors from imprecise LLM outputs are currently the primary accuracy bottleneck, not the algorithm itself.

No LLM today is purpose-trained for personal memory consolidation. The ideal path would be a dedicated memory LLM optimized for structured profile extraction and multi-fact reasoning. The author has a clear design for what that model should look like, but training it requires compute and data resources beyond what an individual can access.

If your company is building a memory-focused model or working on personal AI and you have a role that fits — I'd love to hear from you: [mailwangjk@gmail.com](mailto:mailwangjk@gmail.com)

Until then, the algorithm rides on general-purpose models and improves automatically with each stronger generation, with zero code changes required. The pipeline is also a practical benchmark: if extraction errors are high, the cause is almost always LLM capability, not a bug. Try a stronger model and watch the difference.

## REST API

Query memory from any external system, agent, or LLM:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /profile` | Current confirmed profile (category, field, value) |
| `GET /hypotheses` | Full profile with confidence levels and status |
| `POST /chat` | Send a message; response uses full memory context |
| `POST /sleep` | Trigger memory consolidation manually |
| `GET /health` | Service health |

Authentication: `X-Device-Token: <token>` header on every request.

## Why Not RAG?

| | RAG / Existing AI Memory | Riverse |
|---|---|---|
| **Retrieval** | Vector similarity — finds text that "looks similar" | Profile weighting — ranked by relevance to *you* |
| **Timeline** | No timeline — 3 years ago and yesterday weigh the same | Temporal evolution — facts have momentum and decay |
| **Reasoning** | No causal inference — facts stay as isolated fragments | Causal chains — connects related facts automatically |
| **Confidence** | All facts have equal weight | suspected → confirmed → established |
| **Invalidation** | No mechanism — old facts persist forever | Facts expire, get superseded, or are rejected |
| **Data ownership** | Cloud-dependent, platform-owned | Local-first — your device, your data |
