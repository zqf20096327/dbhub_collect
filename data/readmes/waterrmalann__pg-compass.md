# PG Compass

A fast, minimal desktop database viewer for **PostgreSQL**, inspired by the usability of [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass).

**Yet another PostgreSQL GUI?**

> Most PostgreSQL tools are either bloated IDE-style apps (pgAdmin, DataGrip) with features you never use, or primitive CLI wrappers. PG Compass sits in the sweet spot — a focused, fast tool for the thing developers actually do most: _inspecting data_.

## Features

- 🐘 **Built for PostgreSQL** — schema-first navigation with first-class support for schemas, tables, views, indexes, and constraints.
- ⚡ **Fast & lightweight** — Electron + React, optimized for instant data loading and minimal resource usage.
- 🔌 **Multiple connections** — save, label, and color-code connections. Favorite the ones you use most.
- 📊 **Table data viewer** — paginated row browsing (25/50/75/100 per page) with a card view for JSONB-heavy tables.
- 🏗️ **Structure inspector** — view columns, data types, indexes, and constraints at a glance.
- 📥 **Export** — export query results and table data as CSV or JSON.
- 🔍 **SQL query editor** — run ad-hoc queries with inline result previews.
- 🌓 **Dark/Light mode** — dark by default, because we're not animals.
- 🛟 **Type-safe** — fully written in TypeScript with type-safe IPC between Electron processes.
- 🔓 **Open source** — MIT licensed, no accounts, no telemetry, no nonsense.
