![Paperlight overview: a tile per document type, the list below and a PDF preview](docs/screenshots/overview.png)

## Why

Documents pile up everywhere: Downloads, Desktop, project folders, old drives. You remember
what a file was about, not where you saved it. Paperlight indexes them all once, keeps up as
they change, and finds any of them in milliseconds.

## Features

- **Search inside documents.** Names, folders and the text of PDFs, Word, Excel and PowerPoint
  files, typo-tolerant, with the matching passage highlighted.
- **Buckets.** One tile per document type: PDFs, Word documents, Spreadsheets, Presentations,
  each with its own search.
- **Quick search from anywhere.** <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> in any app, then <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open.
- **Always current.** New, renamed, moved and deleted files show up within a second.
- **Organise without touching files.** Favourites, tags, recently opened, previews.
- **Duplicates and storage.** Find byte-identical copies and see what takes space.
- **You choose what's indexed.** Pick the file formats and folders; skip the rest.
- **Updates itself, if you want.** New versions install from inside the app in a few seconds,
  keeping your index, favourites and tags. Paperlight works offline either way.
- **At home on Windows.** A native look, light and dark themes (title bar included) and a
  short welcome that sets everything up on first run.

## Install

1. Download `Paperlight_x.y.z_x64-setup.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/webKing021/paperlight/releases/latest).
2. Run it. Windows 10/11, 64-bit; no admin rights needed. SmartScreen may warn because the
   installer isn't code-signed yet: *More info → Run anyway*.
3. The welcome screens walk you through setup: pick the drives or folders to index, choose a
   few preferences and press **Start indexing**. Paperlight is usable while the first scan runs.

You only download the installer once. Updating is optional: when a new version with new
features comes out, Paperlight tells you and installs it from inside the app (**Update now**),
keeping your index, favourites and tags. If you don't, it keeps working as it is.

## Private and light

- **Works offline.** Paperlight never needs the internet to index, search or open your files.
  No telemetry, no account. It only goes online to check for a new version, and updating is
  optional: skip it, or turn the check off in Settings → About.
- **Read-only.** Your files are never modified, moved or deleted.
- **Tiny.** ~5 MB installer, ~6 MB of memory in the tray, zero CPU when idle.

## Keyboard

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> search · <kbd>Enter</kbd> open · <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> show in folder ·
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> favourite · <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> tag ·
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> sidebar · <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> details

## Build from source

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev      # run
npm run tauri build -- --config '{"bundle":{"createUpdaterArtifacts":false}}'
                       # installer → src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis
```

Official releases are also signed for the in-app updater, which needs the project's private
key; the `--config` override above builds an unsigned installer without it.

Needs Node.js 20+, Rust (MSVC) and the Visual Studio C++ Build Tools. Built with
[Tauri 2](https://tauri.app), Rust, SQLite FTS5 and React.
