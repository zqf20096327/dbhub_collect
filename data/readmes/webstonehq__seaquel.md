### Self-host (Docker)

Seaquel ships a single container image at `ghcr.io/webstonehq/seaquel`,
multi-arch (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64). It runs SvelteKit + Better Auth on
the public port and a loopback-only Rust database service as a subprocess
in the same container — one artifact, one `docker run`. A Seaquel subscription
license key is required at first signup, the same as Cloud.

#### `docker run`

```bash
docker run \
  --name seaquel \
  -p 8787:8787 \
  -v seaquel-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/webstonehq/seaquel:latest
```

That's it. Visit <http://localhost:8787>. The first user to sign up
presents an owner license key from a Seaquel subscription — that key
registers this install with seaquel.app and binds the user as Owner.
Subsequent teammates sign up by pasting their own member license key
from the same subscription's seat pool.

Persistent state lives in `/data`: `auth.db` for identity, one
`users/<userId>/meta.db` per user, and an auto-generated `auth-secret`
file the container uses to sign sessions. Back up that volume and you
back up everything.

#### `docker compose`

```bash
# From a checkout of this repo:
docker compose -f deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

The compose file pulls the pre-built image by default; flip to building
from source by uncommenting the `build:` block. The `.env.example` file
in `deploy/docker/` documents the optional knobs below — copy it to
`.env` only if you need to override something.

#### Configuration

The defaults work out of the box: port `8787`, data at `/data`, talks to
`https://seaquel.app` for licensing, and auto-generates a session-signing
secret at `/data/auth-secret` on first boot. Set the variables below only
when the default doesn't fit your deployment.

| Variable                  | Set this when…                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SEAQUEL_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | Deploying on a real domain. Localhost variants are always trusted. Comma-separated origins Better Auth's CSRF check allows. |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL`         | Sitting behind a reverse proxy that rewrites `Host`, or silencing the boot warning below. Sets Better Auth's canonical URL. |
| `SEAQUEL_AUTH_SECRET`     | Running multiple replicas. All replicas must share a session key; single-container installs don't need to set this. |
| `SEAQUEL_COOKIE_DOMAIN`   | Sharing sessions across subdomains, e.g. `.example.com`.                                |
| `SEAQUEL_TRUSTED_PROXIES` | Running behind a reverse proxy or load balancer. Comma-separated proxy IPs/CIDRs (e.g. `10.0.0.0/8`). Without it, sign-in rate limits key on the socket address and `X-Forwarded-For` is ignored, so every client behind the proxy shares one limit. |
| `SEAQUEL_CONTROL_URL`     | Pointing at a staging control plane, or `http://127.0.0.1:1` to test offline mode. Default `https://seaquel.app`. |
| `PORT` / `DATA_DIR`       | Overriding `8787` / `/data`.                                                            |

Internal tuning knobs (`SEAQUEL_LICENSE_SOFT_TTL`, `SEAQUEL_LICENSE_GRACE_TTL`,
`SEAQUEL_BUNDLE_TRUSTED_PUBKEY`) have sensible defaults documented inline
in the source; set them only when you need to.

With `BETTER_AUTH_URL` unset, every boot logs:

```
WARN [Better Auth]: [better-auth] Base URL could not be determined. Please
set a valid base URL using the baseURL config option or the
BETTER_AUTH_URL environment variable. Without this, callbacks and
redirects may not work correctly.
```

This is expected and harmless for a single-host install reached at its
own `Host` — signup, sessions and cookies all work, since the relevant
requests are same-origin. Set `BETTER_AUTH_URL` to the instance's public
URL to silence it, and do set it whenever anything rewrites `Host` or you
rely on absolute links (e.g. emailed callbacks).

#### Air-gapped / offline mode

Self-hosted Seaquel can run without any outbound calls to seaquel.app. The
owner downloads a signed license bundle from the seaquel.app dashboard and
uploads it to the instance. From that point, all license checks happen
locally against the bundle; the seaquel.app control plane is never
contacted.

**Workflow:**

1. Subscription owner signs in to seaquel.app and visits
   `https://seaquel.app/dashboard/<slug>/airgap` (the "Offline bundle" tab
   appears for self-hosted tenants).
2. Owner reviews seat assignments and revocations, then clicks "Download
   offline license bundle". A signed `.bundle` file downloads.
3. Owner transfers the file to the self-hosted instance (USB, SCP, etc.)
   and uploads it via `/settings/airgap` (or `/airgap-setup` if no user
   is bound yet).
4. The instance verifies the bundle's signature, walks any
   revocations, and switches to offline mode. The control plane is no
   longer called.

**Renewal:**

- Bundles expire `currentPeriodEnd + 30 days`. Owners download a fresh
  bundle each billing cycle from the same dashboard page.
- Revocations are cumulative — each new bundle carries the full
  revocation list for the subscription.
- A subscription cancellation in seaquel.app automatically adds all of
  that subscription's license keys to the revocation list (so the *next*
  bundle the owner downloads carries the revocations).
- If the bundle isn't refreshed before `not_after`, the install enters
  a read-only revalidate state until a fresh bundle is imported.

**Return to online mode:**

- An owner can remove the offline bundle via `/settings/airgap` →
  "Remove offline bundle". The instance will resume calling seaquel.app
  on the next license check. Make sure connectivity is restored before
  removing the bundle.

**Trust anchors:**

A bundle is verified against the public half of the signing keypair. The
private half — a 32-byte Ed25519 seed — lives only on the control plane,
as the `SEAQUEL_BUNDLE_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` secret on seaquel-app. The
public half is compiled into this repo, as `PROD_TRUSTED_PUBKEYS` in
`src/lib/server/airgap/bundle-store.ts`.

To derive that public half from a seed without minting anything, pass
`--only-derive`:

```bash
node scripts/mint-airgap-bundle.ts --only-derive --seed-hex=<64-hex>
```

stdout carries just the `SEAQUEL_BUNDLE_TRUSTED_PUBKEY=…` line, so it can
be piped or captured; stderr prints the fingerprint and pubkey separately,
plus a paste-ready `PROD_TRUSTED_PUBKEYS` entry. Omit `--seed-hex` and it
generates a fresh keypair and prints the seed as well — the seed is the
private half, so it belongs in the control-plane secret and nowhere else.

The fingerprint is the first 16 bytes of `SHA-256(pubkey)`, and the
verifier looks keys up by it, so an anchor whose fingerprint does not
match its pubkey rejects every real bundle instead of erroring. The
`ships a well-formed built-in production set` test in
`bundle-store.test.ts` guards against exactly that.

Because `PROD_TRUSTED_PUBKEYS` is a list, a key rotation can ship a
release carrying both the old and new anchors, switch the control-plane
secret, then drop the old entry in a later release.

**Optional dev override:**

- `SEAQUEL_BUNDLE_TRUSTED_PUBKEY` — comma-separated list of
  `<fingerprint>:<hex-pubkey>` entries to trust additional signing keys
  (for testing with a dev keypair). Production releases ship with the
  seaquel.app production fingerprint baked in.

#### Test Docker image locally

Two smoke-test flows are documented below: **Online mode** (against the
real licensing control plane) and **Air-gapped mode** (with a dev-minted
bundle, no outbound network). Both build the same image.

##### Build the image

```bash
cd path/to/seaquel
docker build -t seaquel:test .
```

The first build takes ~5 min (Rust + Node); subsequent builds reuse layers.

##### Online mode

A dedicated volume (`seaquel-test-data`) keeps the smoke-test isolated from
any production container on the same machine.

```bash
docker run \
  --name seaquel-test \
  -p 8787:8787 \
  -v seaquel-test-data:/data \
  seaquel:test
```

No env vars needed for a localhost smoke test — `127.0.0.1:8787` is
auto-trusted by the CSRF gate and the session secret auto-generates on
first boot. Wait for the health check to pass (~20 s), then probe it:

```bash
docker ps --filter name=seaquel-test --format '{{.Status}}'
curl http://localhost:8787/health
```

In the browser at <http://localhost:8787>:

1. `/signup` — the first user becomes the tenant Owner. Paste an
   owner-tier subscription license key when prompted.
2. Create a project, add a connection (try a Postgres/MySQL you have
   access to, or a local SQLite path like `/data/test.db`).
3. Save the password on the connection — the credential-vault setup
   dialog should appear. Pick a passphrase; credentials are encrypted
   in the browser before they ever reach the server (zero-knowledge).
4. Run a query, browse the schema, verify everything works.

Cleanup:

```bash
docker rm -f seaquel-test
docker volume rm seaquel-test-data
```

##### Air-gapped mode

Exercise the offline flow with a locally-minted bundle. Air-gapped mode
itself is purely bundle-driven: once a bundle is imported, the dispatcher
in `licensing.ts` routes every call to local helpers and never touches
the network. **A real air-gapped deployment just imports the bundle —
there's no env var that turns offline mode "on."**

**1. Mint a bundle with a dev keypair.**

```bash
node scripts/mint-airgap-bundle.ts \
  --owner-key=DEV-OWNER \
  --member-key=DEV-MEMBER \
  --out=/tmp/seaquel-test.bundle
```

The script prints to stderr a line like:

```
SEAQUEL_BUNDLE_TRUSTED_PUBKEY=c6cf6554…:6fecf261…
```

Copy that line — the container needs it as an env var so its verifier
trusts the dev keypair just generated. The baked-in
`PROD_TRUSTED_PUBKEYS` anchor only covers bundles signed by seaquel.app,
so this override is always required for locally minted bundles. To mint
many bundles with the same trust anchor across runs, capture the
`--seed-hex=…` line the script also prints and pass it back on
subsequent invocations — or re-derive the anchor from that seed later
with `--only-derive` (see "Trust anchors" above).

**2. Run the container.**

```bash
TRUSTED_PUBKEY='c6cf6554…:6fecf261…'   # the line from step 1's stderr

docker run \
  --name seaquel-airgap-test \
  -p 8787:8787 \
  -v seaquel-airgap-data:/data \
  -e SEAQUEL_BUNDLE_TRUSTED_PUBKEY="$TRUSTED_PUBKEY" \
  seaquel:test
```

> **Optional test scaffold:** if you want to prove the airgap path
> doesn't leak any network calls, also pass
> `-e SEAQUEL_CONTROL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1`. That points the would-be
> control-plane URL at a closed port, so any bug in the dispatcher that
> accidentally tried to call out would surface as a loud transport
> error instead of silently reaching real seaquel.app. **It does
> nothing for normal operation** — air-gapped mode skips the network
> regardless of where this URL points. Real air-gapped deployments,
> where the host has no outbound network at all, can leave the default
> in place.

**3. Import the bundle.**

Visit <http://localhost:8787> in the browser. The layout redirects
unauthenticated visitors to `/airgap-setup` whenever (a) no tenant is
yet bound and (b) no bundle is loaded. Upload `/tmp/seaquel-test.bundle`
there. On success you'll see tier/seats/expiry; the page then offers a
"Continue to signup" link.

**4. Sign up with the bundle's owner key.**

At `/signup`, use `DEV-OWNER` as the license key. The dispatcher routes
through `airgap.registerInstallLocal` (because a bundle is loaded), the
owner's `member_license` row is written with `is_owner=1`, and a session
cookie comes back. No network call to `seaquel.app` happened.

**5. Try signing up with a key the bundle doesn't know.**

Open a private window, hit `/signup`, paste any random string as the
license key. Expect a `license_not_found` rejection from
`verifyLocalMembershipLicense`.

**6. Sign up the member.**

Use `DEV-MEMBER` as the license key. Should succeed.

**7. Confirm the install is in offline mode.**

Settings → Offline license bundle → the badge reads `AIRGAP` and lists
tier, seats, expiry, and the truncated pubkey fingerprint. Or via the
CLI:

```bash
docker exec seaquel-airgap-test node -e \
  'console.log(require("better-sqlite3")("/data/auth.db", { readonly: true })
    .prepare("SELECT mode FROM install_cache WHERE id = 1").get().mode)'
```

`airgap` confirms the dispatcher is in bundle-driven mode.

(The image has no `sqlite3` binary — query the file through the
`better-sqlite3` module the server itself uses.)

**8. Test the revocation walk.**

Mint a fresh bundle that revokes the member's key (note: the new bundle
must have an `issued_at` strictly newer than the current one and the
same `subscription_id`):

```bash
node scripts/mint-airgap-bundle.ts \
  --seed-hex=$LAST_SEED   # the --seed-hex line from step 1's stderr
  --owner-key=DEV-OWNER \
  --member-key=DEV-MEMBER \
  --revoked-keys=DEV-MEMBER \
  --out=/tmp/seaquel-test-v2.bundle
```

Upload the new bundle at `/settings/airgap` as the owner. The endpoint
walks `member_license`, stamps `revoked_at` on the member's row, and
deletes their Better Auth session in one transaction. The member's next
request returns 403 and they're bounced back to login.

**9. Test offline → online transition.**

Still as the owner, click "Remove offline bundle" at `/settings/airgap`.
The instance clears the bundle and flips `install_cache.mode` back to
`online`. `member_license` bindings are kept, so both users stay signed
in.

You will **not** land on `/revalidate` right away — not even with the
`SEAQUEL_CONTROL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1` scaffold from step 2. The
license state is cached: `last_validated_at` was stamped when the bundle
was imported, so for the next 24 h (`SEAQUEL_LICENSE_SOFT_TTL`) the
install is "soft fresh" and makes **no** control-plane call at all. Once
that lapses it attempts a refresh, and if the call fails it keeps working
until `grace_until` — also stamped at import, default 14 days
(`SEAQUEL_LICENSE_GRACE_TTL`) — before dropping to `revalidate`.

Both windows are stored as absolute timestamps at import time, so
changing those two env vars afterwards does not move them. To reach the
`revalidate` state now, age the stored timestamps directly:

```bash
docker exec seaquel-airgap-test node -e '
  const db = require("better-sqlite3")("/data/auth.db");
  const past = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) - 3 * 24 * 3600;
  db.prepare("UPDATE install_cache SET last_validated_at = ?, grace_until = ? WHERE id = 1")
    .run(past, past);
'
```

The next request then logs `license refresh failed` (the closed-port
scaffold proving the call was actually attempted), redirects to
`/revalidate`, and returns 403 from `/api/*` until a fresh bundle is
imported. Without the scaffold the call reaches real seaquel.app and
fails with a 4xx, since this dev container was never registered
upstream.

Cleanup:

```bash
docker rm -f seaquel-airgap-test
docker volume rm seaquel-airgap-data
```
