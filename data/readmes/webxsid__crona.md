Crona is a local-first work tracker for developers. It combines a terminal UI, a scriptable CLI, and a background local daemon into one workflow for planning work, tracking focus sessions, reviewing momentum, and exporting structured artifacts.

Managed package installers are the preferred distribution path:
- Homebrew on macOS and Linux
- Scoop on Windows
- GitHub Releases as the canonical binary source

Use [docs/install.md](docs/install.md) for installation and [docs/migration.md](docs/migration.md) when you need to switch install methods or release channels.
Destination-specific migration guides live in the migration section of the docs.

The repository is a Go monorepo with four main modules:
- `kernel`: internal source tree for the background daemon, SQLite store, timer, IPC, and update checks
- `tui`: Bubble Tea terminal UI
- `cli`: scriptable commands and local daemon control flows
- `shared`: shared types, config, protocol, and utilities

## Quick Start

See the full installation guide in [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

If you are migrating from the install script, another package manager, or a beta channel, use [docs/migration.md](docs/migration.md) before reinstalling.

Runtime notes:
- local alerts are emitted by the background daemon, not the TUI process
- scheduled reminders only fire while the background daemon is running
- the `Summary` view and `crona summary` are read-only at-a-glance surfaces; the TUI Summary also includes focus stats and an interactive score calendar via `[c]`; use `Daily` when you want to plan or make changes interactively
- the Daily view adapts cleanly to smaller terminals with compact issue rendering and shorter pane hints
- the Wellbeing view includes Momentum detail with current bucket metadata and contributor breakdowns
- the TUI owns the terminal tab title while it is running and shows active session context when focused
- PDF export depends on local renderer tooling; see [docs/install.md](docs/install.md)

Launch the TUI:

```bash
crona
```

Get a quick read-only summary from the CLI:

```bash
crona summary
crona summary --week
crona summary --last-x-days 7
```

Inspect the daemon from the CLI:

```bash
crona daemon attach --json
crona daemon status --json
crona daemon info --json
```

The command group is named `daemon` because it controls the internal daemon process. User-facing docs generally call it the daemon or local daemon.

Generate shell completions:

```bash
crona completion zsh
crona completion bash
crona completion fish
```

## macOS Companion

The [Crona macOS companion](https://github.com/webxsid/crona-macos) is a native menu-bar app that connects to your local Crona daemon. It’s still in beta and changing quickly, so expect rough edges and occasional changes to the UI, APIs, and installation process.
