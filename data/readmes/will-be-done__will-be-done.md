# Will Be Done

**An offline-first, self-hosted task planner built around a visual weekly timeline.**

The workflow is short. Collect tasks, place them on a weekly timeline, and keep the few you care about right now in Stash. It is also local-first. Your tasks stay available offline, changes apply without a round trip to the server, and sync catches up across devices when your server is back.

I want it to feel fast in the same way Linear feels fast. The app should open straight into your tasks, without a big loading spinner first. It reads from local persistent storage on demand, so startup should stay quick even after years of saved tasks.

Under the hood, Will Be Done runs on [HyperDB](https://github.com/will-be-done/hyperdb), my own local-first database layer. I built it after more than two years of researching what kind of database would actually fit the apps I want to make: offline-first, reactive, fast at startup, and able to share the same typed data logic between the browser and the server.

## Why Will Be Done?

Will Be Done is for people who want a fast, private task manager aimed at planning rather than capture.

- **Plan the week visually.** Each day is a column, so you can see what is realistic and rebalance by dragging tasks around.
- **Keep it instant.** The app should open directly into your tasks, without a blocking spinner or a full database load first.
- **Stay useful offline.** The app keeps a full local database in the browser, so you can read and write tasks without waiting on the network.
- **Start fast, even with years of tasks.** Will Be Done reads data on demand from local storage, so it can stay useful as a lifelong task archive.
- **Own the data.** Self-host the sync server with Docker, store data in SQLite, and avoid handing your task history to a third-party task app.
- **Move fast from the keyboard.** Vim-style navigation. Create a task, move it between projects, stash it, schedule it, or run any task action without leaving the keyboard.
- **Keep focus visible.** Stash is a persistent focus list available from any page for the tasks you want close at hand this week or month.

## Try it

- **Live demo:** [demo.will-be-done.app](https://demo.will-be-done.app). No sign-up required.
- **Cloud app:** [app.will-be-done.app](https://app.will-be-done.app/signup). Try it before self-hosting.
- **Desktop app:** [download the latest release](https://github.com/will-be-done/will-be-done/releases) for Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Mobile:** install the web app as a PWA. App store builds that package the same web app for iOS and Android are planned.

## How Will Be Done will make money

The hosted cloud version will make money through paid plans. Self-hosting will never have a paywall. I promise that no feature in the self-hosted version will require payment to Will Be Done.

The self-hosted version will have the same features as the cloud unless a cloud feature cannot reasonably run without hosted infrastructure. In those cases, I will provide a self-hosted alternative when possible. For example, a self-hosted AI assistant will let you use your own OpenRouter API key.

I will also keep the self-hosted infrastructure as simple as I can. The standard setup will use SQLite and a directory for uploaded attachments. It will not require Redis, an external database service, or S3.

## HTTP API

Will Be Done has an HTTP API for your tasks, projects, schedules, and
other data.

- **Will Be Done Cloud:** [read the API documentation](https://app.will-be-done.app/api/docs).
- **Self-hosted with Docker:** open `/api/docs` on your server, for example
  [http://localhost:3000/api/docs](http://localhost:3000/api/docs).

### Create an API token

1. Sign in and open a space.
2. Open **Space Settings**, select **Tokens**, and click **Create token**.
3. Copy the new token and store it securely. Tokens remain active until you
   delete them from the same settings page.

Send the token as a Bearer credential:

```bash
curl \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://app.will-be-done.app/api/v1/spaces
```

Open the Scalar documentation in the same browser and on the same server
where you signed in, and it reuses the session token the web app already
stored. If there is no current token, enter one through Scalar's
**Authentication** controls.

## Self-host with Docker

Run the server:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v will_be_done_storage:/var/lib/will-be-done \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/will-be-done/will-be-done:latest
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

The Docker server hosts the web app, stores server-side data under `/var/lib/will-be-done`, and syncs browser, PWA, and desktop clients. SQLite is the default; the API can optionally use Turso Cloud or the local Rust tursod service. See [the API database configuration](apps/api/README.md#database-engines) for setup instructions.

## Keyboard shortcuts

### Global quick add on Wayland

Electron's global shortcut portal may report a successful registration on some Wayland
compositors without delivering shortcut events. In that case, let the compositor handle
`Ctrl+Shift+A` and invoke the installed Will Be Done application with
`--show-quick-add`.

Use the command that matches the installed package:

- deb, rpm, or snap: `will-be-done --show-quick-add`
- Flatpak (optimized): `flatpak run --command=will-be-done-quick-add app.willbedone.WillBeDone`
- AppImage: `/absolute/path/to/will-be-done.AppImage --show-quick-add`

To quickly open or focus the main window from a Flatpak installation:

```bash
flatpak run --command=will-be-done-show app.willbedone.WillBeDone
```

For example, with a deb, rpm, or snap installation, add this entry to the `binds`
section of the niri configuration:

```kdl
Ctrl+Shift+A {
    spawn "will-be-done" "--show-quick-add";
}
```

Validate the niri configuration after editing it:

```bash
niri validate
```

Niri reloads valid configuration changes automatically.

For Hyprland using Lua configuration:

```lua
hl.bind(
    "CTRL + SHIFT + A",
    hl.dsp.exec_cmd("will-be-done --show-quick-add")
)
```

Replace the command portion of either compositor example when using Flatpak or AppImage.
The command starts Will Be Done when necessary. If it is already running, it forwards the
request to the existing process. Starting with `--show-quick-add` keeps the main window
hidden. Closing the main window also keeps Will Be Done running in the system tray, where
you can reopen the app, show Quick Add, or quit it completely.

Not planned for now:

1. Multi-user spaces or projects
1. Shared tasks, projects, or spaces

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the API and web app in separate terminals:

```bash
pnpm dev:server
pnpm dev:client
```

Or run the combined terminal UI. When `WBD_DB_ENGINE=tursod`, it also starts
the Rust database service and configures the API to use it:

```bash
pnpm all
WBD_DB_ENGINE=tursod pnpm all
```

Useful checks:

```bash
pnpm ts
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm test:e2e
```

## Why another task manager?

I am building Will Be Done as the task manager I want to use for the rest of my life.

That means it needs to stay fast with years of task history, start quickly without waiting on a full database load, work even when the internet disappears, and keep sensitive task data under my control. It also needs to fit the way I work: weekly planning, keyboard-first navigation, a persistent focus stash, desktop quick add, and an API that can connect to tools like Telegram or an MCP server.

Super Productivity came closest of the self-hosted apps I tried, but I wanted something more opinionated about weekly planning, local-first sync, visual customization, and Vim-style keys.

## Comparison

## Note on AI usage

I have been developing this project for more than a year, and this is my third attempt in three years. The first two attempts failed because the technology for fast offline-first apps was not ready for the experience I wanted.

This version uses my own local-first development approach and a database that works across the frontend and backend, so the same domain logic can run in both places. I have more than 10 years of development experience, including 4 years specializing in offline-first apps. I use Claude Code to help with development, but I review the code manually.
