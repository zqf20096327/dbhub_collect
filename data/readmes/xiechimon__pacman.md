# pacman

A self-hosted, open-source **agent workspace**: a task board where you write the tasks and AI agents build them on your own machines.

English | [简体中文](./README.zh.md)

## What

You file a task on a kanban board. An agent picks it up, checks out a worktree and a branch, and streams its work back to the UI as a conversation — plan cards, diffs, tool calls, all in real time. The run pauses at review so a human decides what merges.

- **Tasks & phases** — kanban board with numbered tasks, tags, and schedules that re-run a task on a cycle.
- **Agents** — execution roles configured with a model, responsibilities, skills, MCP servers, secrets, and memory. A per-user "chief" agent dispatches work.
- **Machines** — register any host by running the daemon on it; builds execute there under supervision. Your laptop, your box, your rules.
- **Providers** — model access via API key, OAuth (GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex), or a custom endpoint.
- **Repos** — git repositories hosted by the server itself (push/pull with an API key) or connected from GitHub.
- **Live everything** — SSE streams for board and conversation updates, notifications, token-usage accounting per build and model.

## Why

- **Gated by design.** Every run stops for you twice — at the plan and at the diff — and the AI reviewer can block, not just comment. The only open-source, self-hostable agent workspace that does this today.
- **Honest lineage.** pacman began as a clean-room study of todos.dev's public interface (see [Origins](#origins)) and is now an independent product; its roadmap diverges from real usage, not from anyone else's spec.

## Quickstart

Requirements: Node.js 22 or 24 (LTS lines ship prebuilt `better-sqlite3` binaries; other versions may fall back to source compilation and need a build toolchain).

```sh
npx @xiechimon/pacman
```

One command: download, start, and serve on **http://127.0.0.1:8787/app**. The first boot creates the database under `~/.pacman`, runs migrations, and seeds a default team.

Use a different port with `PORT=9000 npx @xiechimon/pacman`.

### Run builds on your own machines

The UI is fully usable without a daemon; register a machine when you want agents to actually run builds on it. On each machine that executes builds:

```sh
npm i -g @xiechimon/pacman-cli
# One-time enrollment: create an API key in the web UI (/app/api-keys, plaintext shown once), then
pacman start --api-key <pacman_...> --team <teamId>
# Daily use (credentials persisted in ~/.pacman/machine.json):
pacman start        # also: stop / restart / logs -f / status
```

Both packages install a `pacman` bin: installing both globally on the same machine means whichever came last wins the name. The clean split is running the server where you browse and `pacman-cli` where agents build.

### Develop from source

Requires Node.js >= 22.19 and pnpm (e.g. via `corepack enable`).

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm start        # builds the web UI and starts the server hosting it on the same origin
```

The watch-mode dev stack, one process each: `pnpm dev:web`, `pnpm dev:server`, `pnpm dev:daemon` (`pnpm dev` runs all three together).

## Configuration

Server environment variables (all optional):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PACMAN_TOKEN` | unset | Bearer token guarding `/api/*`. Set to enable authentication — the web UI asks for the token on first visit; unset means auth off (default). The two SSE stream endpoints additionally accept `?token=` (EventSource cannot set headers). Always set this when binding the server to a non-localhost interface. |
| `PORT` | `8787` | HTTP listen port. |
| `HOST` | unset (all interfaces) | HTTP bind address. For split deployment (server on an always-on host, daemon on another machine pointing `PACMAN_SERVER` at it), set this to that host's LAN address and set `PACMAN_TOKEN` alongside. Explicit `0.0.0.0`/`::` with `PACMAN_TOKEN` unset logs a startup warning. |
| `PACMAN_HOME` | `~/.pacman` | Data root. Server state lives under `<PACMAN_HOME>/server/` (`server.db`, `secretbox.key`, hosted bare repos); the daemon keeps `machine.json`, `daemon.log`, and `workspaces/` at the root. **Backup = copy the whole directory** — the db alone is useless without the keyfile, since secrets are stored encrypted. |
| `PACMAN_GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`<br>`PACMAN_GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | unset | Credentials of a self-registered GitHub OAuth App, enabling OAuth provider sign-in. Set both or neither — the server refuses to start on a half-configured pair. |
| `PACMAN_WEB_DIR` | `apps/web/dist` if present | Override for the SPA static-hosting root; unset with no build output = API-only mode. |
| `PACMAN_SKILLS_DIR` | `~/.agents/skills` | Skills root. Each immediate subdirectory containing a `SKILL.md` is one skill (id = its frontmatter `name`, falling back to the directory name). Scanned live on every request — skills are never stored in the database; add a skill by dropping a folder in, remove one by deleting the folder. |

Daemon environment variables (alternatives to the CLI flags above): `PACMAN_SERVER` (default `http://127.0.0.1:8787`), `PACMAN_API_KEY`, `PACMAN_TEAM`, `PACMAN_WORKSPACES_DIR` (default `<PACMAN_HOME>/workspaces`).

## Development

```sh
pnpm dev:server   # API server with hot reload on http://127.0.0.1:8787 (first boot: db + migrations + seed)
pnpm dev:web      # vite dev server on http://localhost:5173, proxying /api and /git to 8787
```

The vite dev server runs with `strictPort`: a taken port fails startup instead of silently
shifting to the next free one. The shift is the dangerous case, not the clash — the proxy
target stays fixed, so a shifted UI would drive whichever stack owns the port, not yours.
Override with `PACMAN_DEV_WEB_PORT` / `PACMAN_DEV_SERVER_PORT`.

Quality gates before committing:

```sh
pnpm lint         # biome ci
pnpm typecheck    # tsc across all packages
pnpm test         # vitest
```

### Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `CONTEXT.md` | Domain model & glossary — canonical terminology (Chinese interface terms ↔ English ↔ internal names) |
| `apps/web` | Web UI (React + vite) |
| `apps/server` | Server: Hono REST + SSE + SQLite (package `@xiechimon/pacman` — directory name differs from package name) |
| `apps/daemon` | Executor daemon (package `@xiechimon/pacman-cli` — directory name differs from package name) |
| `packages/shared` | Protocol vocabulary, record shapes, brand-slot single source (`@pacman/shared`) |
| `docs/spec/` | Implementation canon, volumes 00–06 (Chinese) |
| `docs/research/` | r1–r8 replication-era site inventories and evidence (historical archive) |
| `parity/` | Pixel-parity harness against `docs/research/assets/` baselines (now a regression tool) |
| `scripts/` | Build-time tools (incl. `generate-icons.mjs`) |

## Origins

pacman began as a clean-room study of todos.dev's public interface and protocols — an exploration of agent-workspace design. It is now an independent project with its own roadmap, and uses no code or assets from todos.dev.
