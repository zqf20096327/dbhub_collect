## 🚀 About

**Hotel Management System** is a full-featured, production-oriented platform currently live and used by **Cactus Hotel** ([lecactushotel.bj](https://lecactushotel.bj)).

It covers both the **public-facing hotel website** for customers and a **secured back-office dashboard** for hotel staff, handling the entire operational lifecycle from room search to checkout.

> ✅ Currently running in production. Not a demo project.

---

## 🔄 Business Workflow

The system models a real hotel front-desk process end-to-end:

```
Customer searches room
        ↓
Staff creates reservation
        ↓
Customer checks in
        ↓
Stay is tracked (housekeeping, restaurant, extras)
        ↓
Payment is recorded
        ↓
Customer checks out → Room status resets automatically
```

This workflow guarantees **room availability consistency** and full **operational traceability**.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a strict **MVC pattern**:

```
app/
├── Models/          → Database entities (Room, Reservation, Customer, Payment)
├── Controllers/     → Business operations (one controller per domain)
└── Views/ (Blade)   → Staff dashboard + Public website

database/
├── migrations/      → Schema versioning
└── seeders/         → Demo & test data
```

> ⚠️ **Critical operations** (reservation creation, payment recording, check-in/out) are wrapped in **database transactions** to prevent inconsistent hotel states.

An **ERD diagram** is included in the repository root (`erd.PNG`).
