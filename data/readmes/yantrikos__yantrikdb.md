# YantrikDB — A Cognitive Memory Engine for Persistent AI Systems

Your agent starts every session as a stranger. Bolting a vector store onto it
doesn't fix that: nothing is ever forgotten, near-duplicate memories pile up,
and two contradictory facts come back ranked side by side with no signal that
they disagree.

YantrikDB is the engine that manages memories instead of just storing them —
temporal decay, autonomous consolidation, contradiction detection, and a
knowledge graph, in an embeddable Rust library with Python bindings.

Want a server instead of a library? [yantrikdb-server](https://github.com/yantrikos/yantrikdb-server) wraps this engine with an HTTP API, a live demo, and multi-node HA — same decay, consolidation, and contradiction detection, reachable over REST instead of an import.

## Get Started in 60 Seconds

### For AI agents (MCP — works with Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot)

```bash
pip install yantrikdb-mcp
```

Add to your MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "yantrikdb": {
      "command": "yantrikdb-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

That's it. The agent auto-recalls context, auto-remembers decisions, and auto-detects contradictions — no prompting needed. See [yantrikdb-mcp](https://github.com/yantrikos/yantrikdb-mcp) for full docs.

### As a Python library

```bash
pip install yantrikdb
```

`record_text()` / `recall_text()` work out of the box — **no
`sentence-transformers` install, no ONNX runtime.** Just one
`pip install`.

> **Never open the store with a second SQLite library in the same
> process.** The engine bundles its own SQLite; `sqlite3.connect()` on
> the same file from the same process (for a helper `UPDATE`, a raw
> `INSERT` into `claims`, your own scan) corrupts the store silently:
> POSIX locks are per process, so that connection's unlock releases the
> engine's and the two writers interleave WAL commits. Use the engine API
> (`correct()`, `ingest_claim()`, `attach_claims()`, `think()`) or a
> separate process; sequential use after `close()` is fine. On Linux the
> engine detects the second instance and refuses to write from then
> until it is reopened (`ForeignSqliteInstance`,
> `stats()["foreign_sqlite_*"]`), and on every platform a commit that
> did not come through the engine queues an integrity check; see
> CONCURRENCY.md Rule 9.

A new file-backed store opens on `potion-base-8M` (256-dim), fetched
once (~28 MB, SHA-256 pinned, cached under your user cache dir) and
self-hosted from `yantrikos/yantrikdb-models` — no HuggingFace
dependency. If it cannot be fetched (offline), the store is created on
the bundled `potion-base-2M` (64-dim, ~7 MB, no download ever) and a
warning is logged. **An existing database always reopens at the
dimension it already holds**, so upgrading the library never strands
your data.

```python
import yantrikdb

# New store: potion-base-8M @ 256 dims (downloads once).
# Existing store: reopened at whatever dimension it already has.
db = yantrikdb.YantrikDB.with_default("memory.db")

db.record("Alice is the engineering lead", importance=0.8, domain="people")
db.record("Project deadline is March 30", importance=0.9, domain="work")
db.record("User prefers dark mode", importance=0.6, domain="preference")

results = db.recall("who leads the team?", top_k=3)
# → [{"text": "Alice is the engineering lead", "score": 1.0}, ...]

db.relate("Alice", "Engineering", "leads")
db.get_edges("Alice")

db.think()  # consolidate, detect conflicts, mine patterns

db.close()
```

#### Why the default is the 256-dim model

The embedder choice is measured on real agent memory, not a leaderboard.
Public benchmarks rank on Wikipedia-shaped text; agent memory is dense
operational notes with heavy internal vocabulary and near-duplicate
records that supersede one another, and it ranks the models differently.

Measured on **5,035 real production memories** with 12 questions whose
correct record was pinned by id, retrieved through the engine's own
`recall()` (not raw cosine — the engine's hybrid lexical lanes and
composite scoring are part of what you actually get):

| Embedder | Dim | MRR | Correct record absent from the top 100 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `potion-base-2M` (bundled fallback) | 64 | 0.120 | **4 of 12** |
| `potion-base-8M` (default) | 256 | **0.312** | **1 of 12** |

The miss rate is the reason, not the MRR. Under the smaller model a
third of real questions had no correct answer *anywhere* in the first
hundred results — which to a user is indistinguishable from the memory
not being there at all.

Two honest caveats. Twelve probes is a small set, enough to separate
0.120 from 0.312 but not to rank models a few points apart. And the gain
is **corpus-specific**: on conversational-paraphrase benchmarks the two
models are indistinguishable at every `k` from 2 to 80. Expect the
benefit on dense, vocabulary-heavy stores; do not assume it transfers.

#### Other embedder options

```python
# Larger still — 512-dim, ~121 MB, downloads on first call.
db = yantrikdb.YantrikDB("memory.db", embedding_dim=512)
db.set_embedder_named("potion-base-32M")

# Bring your own (sentence-transformers, fastembed, custom object).
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
db = yantrikdb.YantrikDB("memory.db", embedding_dim=384)
db.set_embedder(SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2"))

# Force the bundled model — no download, works fully offline.
db = yantrikdb.YantrikDB("memory.db", embedding_dim=64)
```

| Path | Dim | Size on disk | Install network |
|---|---|---|---|
| `with_default` on a new store | 256 | ~28 MB (cached) | first run only |
| Bundled fallback (`embedding_dim=64`) | 64 | ~7 MB (bundled) | none, ever |
| `set_embedder_named("potion-base-32M")` | 512 | ~121 MB (cached) | first call only |
| `set_embedder(MiniLM)` | 384 | ~80 MB | sentence-transformers' own download |

**A store's dimension is fixed when it is created.** Switching models
later means re-embedding — `db.reembed("potion-base-8M")` does it in
place, preserving graph edges, consolidation state and conflict
metadata.

### As a Rust crate

```toml
[dependencies]
yantrikdb = "0.7"

# NOTE: the crate defaults differ from the pip package on purpose.
# `embedder-download` is OFF here, so a default cargo build has NO
# network code path at all and `with_default()` uses the bundled
# 64-dim potion-base-2M. The Python wheel enables it, so pip users get
# the 256-dim potion-base-8M default described above.
#
# To get that default (and set_embedder_named) in Rust, opt in:
# yantrikdb = { version = "0.7", features = ["embedder-download"] }
#
# Why not on by default: it pulls ureq + sha2 + dirs + tar + flate2
# into every build of an embedded database. See the measured retrieval
# difference above and decide for your deployment.

# Slim build (no bundled embedder, no network code path):
# yantrikdb = { version = "0.7", default-features = false }
```

## The Problem

Current AI memory is:

> Store everything → Embed → Retrieve top-k → Inject into context → Hope it helps.

That's not memory. That's a search engine with extra steps.

Real memory is hierarchical, compressed, contextual, self-updating, emotionally weighted, time-aware, and predictive. YantrikDB is built for that.

## Why Not Existing Solutions?

| Solution | What it does | What it lacks |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Vector DBs** (Pinecone, Weaviate) | Nearest-neighbor lookup | No decay, no causality, no self-organization |
| **Knowledge Graphs** (Neo4j) | Structured relations | Poor for fuzzy memory, not adaptive |
| **Memory Frameworks** (LangChain, Mem0) | Retrieval wrappers | Not a memory architecture — just middleware |
| **File-based** (CLAUDE.md, memory files) | Dump everything into context | O(n) token cost, no relevance filtering |

### Benchmark: Selective Recall vs. File-Based Memory

| Memories | File-Based | YantrikDB | Token Savings | Precision |
|----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| 100 | 1,770 tokens | 69 tokens | **96%** | 66% |
| 500 | 9,807 tokens | 72 tokens | **99.3%** | 77% |
| 1,000 | 19,988 tokens | 72 tokens | **99.6%** | 84% |
| 5,000 | 101,739 tokens | 53 tokens | **99.9%** | 88% |

At 500 memories, file-based exceeds 32K context windows. At 5,000, it doesn't fit in any context window — not even 200K. YantrikDB stays at ~70 tokens per query. Precision *improves* with more data — the opposite of context stuffing.

### Evidence (reproducible)

Every claim here points at a runnable harness — not a static number. Each is
gated in CI ([`.github/workflows/benchmark.yml`](.github/workflows/benchmark.yml)) so a regression fails the build.

- **Recall doesn't degrade as the corpus grows, and stays fast.**
  [`python -m yantrikdb.eval.benchmark`](src/yantrikdb/eval/benchmark.py) holds a fixed
  signal corpus while adding distractors and measures recall + latency at each scale.
  Sample run: recall@k `0.938 → 0.929` as memories grow 7×, with p95 recall latency
  under 3 ms. `regression_check()` is the CI gate.
- **The knowledge graph earns its keep on connected data.**
  [`python -m yantrikdb.eval.graph_lift`](src/yantrikdb/eval/graph_lift.py) measures recall
  with entity-expansion ON vs OFF. Verdict on the connected corpus: **+2.5% recall, +1.7% MRR**
  — graph expansion helps where memories are actually linked.
- **Apples-to-apples vs other memory systems.**
  [`python -m yantrikdb.eval.competitors`](src/yantrikdb/eval/competitors.py) scores YantrikDB,
  mem0, Zep, and Letta on the same corpus, same queries, same metrics, no per-system
  tuning. (Competitors run once their libraries are installed; results are not
  pre-tuned.)

These run dependency-free on the bundled embedder, so anyone can reproduce them with
one command.

### LongMemEval-S — retrieval, scored mechanically

[LongMemEval](https://github.com/xiaowu0162/LongMemEval) asks a question against a
haystack of ~48 chat sessions per user, most of them near-identical distractors, and
names the sessions that actually hold the evidence. This measures **retrieval only** —
no answerer, no LLM judge, so there is nothing to disagree about. A query counts as
`all@k` only if *every* gold session is in the top k (queries average 1.7 golds, so
missing one scores zero).

| top&nbsp;k | at least one gold | **every** gold |
|-----:|------:|------:|
| 5 | 96.0% | 85.0% |
| 10 | 98.5% | 92.9% |
| 20 | 99.6% | 98.3% |
| **40** | **99.6%** | **98.7%** |

479 of 500 queries scored, 0 errors. **k=40 is the shipped default**, and it is
load-bearing rather than generous: a paired 400-query BEAM run measured k=40 → k=20
costing 3.4 rubric points across 8 of 10 categories.

The whole curve is published rather than the best row, because "recall@5" is not a
well-defined quantity without saying what pool it was selected from — retrieving 40
and keeping the best 5 documents scores 85.0%, while retrieving 5 directly scores
72.9%, on the same queries with the same metric.

Reproduce: [`python lme_recall_multik.py 500 24`](https://github.com/yantrikos/agent-memory-benchmark)
(one retrieval per query at k=40, every prefix scored).

## Architecture

### Design Principles

- **Embedded, not client-server** — single file, no server process (like SQLite)
- **Local-first, sync-native** — works offline, syncs when connected
- **Cognitive operations, not SQL** — `record()`, `recall()`, `relate()`, not `SELECT`
- **Living system, not passive store** — does work between conversations
- **Thread-safe** — `Send + Sync` with internal Mutex/RwLock, safe for concurrent access

```

1. **Vector Index (HNSW)** — semantic similarity search across memories
2. **Graph Index** — entity relationships, profile aggregation, bridge detection
3. **Temporal Index** — time-aware queries ("what happened Tuesday", "upcoming deadlines")
4. **Decay Heap** — importance scores that degrade over time, like human memory
5. **Key-Value Store** — fast facts, session state, scoring weights

### Decoupled Write Path (v0.6.6+)

The vector index is structured as a **two-tier LSM**: a small mutable
delta and an immutable HNSW cold tier swapped atomically via
`ArcSwap`. Foreground writes only touch the delta (brief lock,
O(1) push); HNSW work amortizes on a dedicated compactor thread.
This is what eliminated the production wedge where sustained writes
starved readers — see [CONCURRENCY.md](CONCURRENCY.md) and
[docs/decoupled_write_path_rfc.md](docs/decoupled_write_path_rfc.md).

```

**The structural invariant.** Foreground (P1) and background (P3) do
not share a lock primitive that holds for non-O(1) work. The cold
tier is read lock-free via `ArcSwap`; the delta's `RwLock` is held
for the O(1) push only. This is what makes "no single background
task can wedge reads, writes, or recovery" enforceable — see
[CONCURRENCY.md](CONCURRENCY.md) Rules 2 and 3 for the names and
failure modes if violated.

### Cluster Mode (RFC 010 + Phase 6 RYW)

For multi-node deployments, [yantrikdb-server](https://github.com/yantrikos/yantrikdb-server)
wraps the engine with [openraft](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft)
for leader-elected replication. The four cluster-mutation primitives
take the openraft commit-log index as their `seq`, so all nodes
agree on a single global monotonic sequence — read-your-writes works
across the cluster, not just within a node.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    L["Leader<br/>HTTP request"]
    LR["Leader engine<br/>record_with_rid(seq=Some(log_idx))"]
    OR["openraft<br/>commit log"]
    F1["Follower 1 applier<br/>record_with_rid(seq=Some(log_idx))"]
    F2["Follower 2 applier<br/>record_with_rid(seq=Some(log_idx))"]
    R["Reader on any node<br/>recall_with_seq(min_seq=log_idx)"]

    L --> LR
    LR --> OR
    OR -->|replicate + apply| F1

    F1 -.->|"visible_seq[ns] reaches log_idx"| R
    F2 -.->|"visible_seq[ns] reaches log_idx"| R
    LR -.->|"visible_seq[ns] reaches log_idx"| R
```

Each `record_with_rid` / `tombstone_with_rid` /
`upsert_entity_edge_with_id` / `delete_entity_edge_with_id` accepts
an optional `seq: Option<u64>`. Single-node callers pass `None` and
the engine allocates; cluster appliers pass `Some(commit_log_index)`
and the engine ratchets `vec_seq` up to at least that value via
`fetch_max`. After apply, `visible_seq[namespace]` reaches the
log index, so any subsequent `recall_with_seq(min_seq=N)` blocks
just long enough for the local node to have applied through index
N — and no longer.

### Memory Types (Tulving's Taxonomy)

| Type | What it stores | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **Semantic** | Facts, knowledge | "User is a software engineer at Meta" |
| **Episodic** | Events with context | "Had a rough day at work on Feb 20" |
| **Procedural** | Strategies, what worked | "Deploy with blue-green, not rolling update" |

All memories carry **importance**, **valence** (emotional tone), **domain**, **source**, **certainty**, and **timestamps** — used in a multi-signal scoring function that goes far beyond cosine similarity.

## Key Capabilities

### Relevance-Conditioned Scoring

Not just vector similarity. Every recall combines:

- **Semantic similarity** (HNSW) — what's topically related
- **Temporal decay** — recent memories score higher
- **Importance weighting** — critical decisions beat trivia
- **Graph proximity** — entity relationships boost connected memories
- **Retrieval feedback** — learns from past recall quality

Weights are tuned automatically from usage patterns.

### Conflict Detection & Resolution

YantrikDB detects contradictions between structured or recognized
single-valued claims, including polarity and temporal conflicts, and
records them for review. It is not a general natural-language
contradiction checker: arbitrary sentence pairs and multi-valued
relations are intentionally not flagged.

```
"works at Google" (recorded Jan 15) vs. "works at Meta" (recorded Mar 1)
→ Conflict: identity_fact, priority: high, strategy: ask_user
```

Free-text claims beyond the structured/graph layer go through an
opt-in, English-only copular extractor (off by default; enable with
`ThinkConfig.extract_attribute_claims`), which is disabled
automatically for encrypted stores.

Resolution is conversational: the AI asks naturally, not programmatically.

### Semantic Consolidation

After many conversations, memories pile up. `think()` runs:

1. **Consolidation** — merge similar memories, extract patterns
2. **Conflict scan** — find contradictions across the knowledge base
3. **Pattern mining** — cross-domain discovery ("work stress correlates with health entries")
4. **Trigger evaluation** — proactive insights worth surfacing

### Proactive Triggers

The engine generates triggers when it detects something worth reaching out about:

- Memory conflicts needing resolution
- Approaching deadlines (temporal awareness)
- Patterns detected across domains
- High-importance memories about to decay
- Goal tracking ("how's the marathon training?")

Every trigger is grounded in real memory data — not engagement farming.

### Multi-Device Sync (CRDT)

Local-first with append-only replication log:

- **CRDT merging** — graph edges, memories, and metadata merge without conflicts
- **Vector indexes rebuild locally** — raw memories sync, each device rebuilds HNSW
- **Forget propagation** — tombstones ensure forgotten memories stay forgotten
- **Conflict detection** — contradictions across devices are flagged for resolution

### Sessions & Temporal Awareness

```python
sid = db.session_start("default", "claude-code")
db.record("decided to use PostgreSQL")  # auto-linked to session
db.record("Alice suggested Redis for caching")
db.session_end(sid)
# → computes: memory_count, avg_valence, topics, duration

db.stale(days=14)    # high-importance memories not accessed recently
db.upcoming(days=7)  # memories with approaching deadlines
```

**Importing history.** `created_at` (epoch seconds) records an event at the
time it *happened* rather than the time it was loaded — so a bulk import
keeps its real timeline and every temporal surface stays meaningful:

```python
db.record("joined the observatory team", created_at=1_600_000_000.0)
db.record_batch([{"text": "...", "created_at": ts} for ts in anchors])

db.recall_as_of(march, query="where do they work")  # what was true then
```

Without it, every imported record shares the ingest wall-clock: decay and
recency become insertion-order noise, and `recall_as_of` / `time_window`
filter on a timeline that never existed. Omit it and the engine stamps
`now()`, exactly as before.

For timelines assembled from evidence across sessions, keep `created_at` as
the time the synthesized item became available and store the earliest evidence
time in `metadata.first_mention_at`. Recall still selects the relevant top-k;
`order="first_mention"` (or `order="chronological"`) then presents those items
oldest-first. Records without `first_mention_at` fall back to `created_at`.

Query-independent topic and concern organization is available from
`yantrikdb.organize`. `organize_evidence` accepts an application-owned topic
discovery callback, completes bounded evidence assignments deterministically,
and persists evidence-versioned rollups. `organize_concerns` applies the same
trust boundary to answer-sized `ConcernItem` values: every item must cite known
evidence, evidence reuse is bounded, and `persist_concerns` records the full
first-mention timeline through `record_synthesis`. `recall_organized` returns
rollups for summary queries and expands them to concern or evidence items for
list and timeline queries. Its default `order="auto"` uses
`first_mention_turn` for questions about when something was brought up in
conversation, while real-world timelines use `first_mention_at` and then
`created_at` as a fallback.

For applications that need a complete consolidation checklist after their raw
evidence, `load_persisted_topic_cards` enumerates every active topic handle by
namespace without similarity top-k loss. `topic_card_document` renders each
handle with its evidence-backed recorded date and turn span. This path is
explicit: callers retain control over when the extra summary context is useful.

Organized recall also records a local rollup outcome ledger. A
surfaced rollup gets an immutable impression ID with its hashed query, rank,
score, namespace, requested item count, and coarse query shape; expansion
records the ordered children actually returned and their serve-time scores.
Applications can explicitly mark a returned child as `selected` or `corrected`
with `note_rollup_selection`, then close the interaction with
`finalize_rollup_outcome`. Finalization supplies the complete selected/corrected
set; only then can an omitted returned child count as an explicit non-selection.
Consumers may also pass `omitted_child_rids` when the user explicitly identifies
an answer item retrieval failed to return. These are stored separately as
`caller_false_negative` observations: they must have been active, same-namespace
records available when the impression was served, and they never rewrite served
history. The organizer cannot infer these labels itself; the application that
observes the user's correction must finalize the interaction.
Generic point reads, unfinished interactions, and ordinary corrections never
infer a rollup outcome. `rollup_outcome_report` is a read-only, namespace/time
scoped coverage report. `rollup_outcome_examples` exports bounded finalized
per-child examples for offline calibration, with hashed queries and immutable
serve-time rank/score features only; it never exposes query text or rebuilds
features from mutable memory state. The stable query hash is a local linkage
identifier, not anonymization, so exported artifacts should remain scoped and
must not be published as de-identified data. Unselected means only that a
returned child was omitted from the exact finalized set, not that an unseen
memory was globally irrelevant. The readiness gate requires enough finalized queries,
rollups, positive and negative children, at least 80% telemetry completion, and
no dominant query or rollup. `ready_for_offline_evaluation` means only that an
offline test is credible: these observations remain measurement data and are
not ranker labels until their predictive value has been validated.
`rollup_membership_report` has an independent readiness gate for false-negative
rescue. `rollup_membership_examples` emits complete impression groups, including
returned and explicit omitted-positive rows, bounded by finalization time so a
later correction cannot leak into an earlier evaluation window. Its query key is
namespace-scoped but remains linkable and must not be treated as anonymized.

## Look inside a store

Two read-only tools ship with the engine. Neither needs a running server, and
neither changes the store it reads.

**Terminal explorer** — `yantrikdb-tui` opens one store in three panes:
namespaces with live counts, memories newest-first or by semantic search, and
an inspector with the text, metadata, linked entities, the claims that memory
backs, its revision history, and the namespace's tasks.

```bash
yantrikdb tui /path/to/memory.db
```

It is safe to point at a store an agent is writing to right now. An ordinary
engine open is not a read — it can switch the journal to WAL, migrate the
schema and backfill — so the explorer never opens the source with the engine.
It takes a consistent SQLite online-backup copy through a read-only connection
into a private temporary directory, builds the engine on the **copy**, and
removes it on exit, on refresh (`r`) and on every failure path. Search uses the
model the store recorded, verified by digest; anything short of a verified
match disables search and says why.

`yantrikdb tui` launches the binary if it is installed. Download it for your
platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/yantrikos/yantrikdb/releases)
(each asset has a `.sha256` sidecar; linux-amd64, linux-arm64, windows-amd64,
macos-arm64, macos-amd64) or build it with
`cargo install --path crates/yantrikdb-tui`.

**Memory Atlas** — a static page that renders the whole store as a graph:
namespaces as spheres, memories as dots, stored entity links as lines, with
claims, revisions and tasks in the inspector.

```bash
yantrikdb atlas /path/to/memory.db      # exports, then serves it on 127.0.0.1
```

The export runs in a child process that never loads the engine, hashes the file
before and after reading and refuses if it changed underneath, makes zero model
calls, and writes exactly three artifacts. Encrypted stores are refused: it
reads raw rows and cannot decrypt them. [Sample atlas and guide →](https://yantrikdb.com/guides/memory-atlas/)

## Worked example: Wirecard (RFC 008 substrate — with honest limits)

For nearly a decade, Wirecard's filings and EY's audit attested to €1.9B in Philippine escrow accounts. In June 2020 both banks and the central bank formally denied the accounts existed.

When the `source_lineage` fields are hand-populated — EY as `[wirecard, ey]` to capture audit dependence on Wirecard-provided documents, BSP as `[bsp, bpi, bdo]` to capture restatement of the commercial banks — RFC 008's `⊕` discounts the dependent claims, and the contest operator's temporal split distinguishes present-tense contradictions from historical state changes. On this hand-populated data, the substrate produces useful annotations.

**Honest limits** (surfaced by Phase 2 empirical testing, Apr 2026):

- On naturalistic evidence where a real agent populates the fields, the substrate's gates don't reliably fire. Cases B and C of the Phase 2 eval need an extractor/canonicalizer (not yet built) to work; Case A exposed that `⊕` is mathematically incapable of flipping decisions at realistic N, regardless of coefficient tuning.
- **Current claim**: structured schema for evidence provenance/temporal/conflict annotation, useful for audit and inspection. The dependence-discount operator works on curated inputs but needs replacement before it can drive decisions.
- **Not a current claim**: "decision-improvement substrate for AGI-capable agents." That framing is withdrawn pending RFC 009.

See **[docs/showcase/wirecard.md](docs/showcase/wirecard.md)** for the full walkthrough including the Phase 2 negative result and the gold-state ablation that partitioned operator failure from extraction failure. Run the hand-populated demonstration directly:

```bash
cargo run --example showcase_wirecard
```
