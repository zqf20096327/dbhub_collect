# Admin Panel

This is a boilerplate project that implements the functionality of the admin panel.
Think of it as a set of reusable solutions combined into a finished project.
The project is built using microservices architecture.
To run it, you will need to install [Docker](https://github.com/docker).

## Project Launch

### Preliminary Setup

Before running, you will need to copy and (optionally during testing) edit
the `.env` file (based on `.env.example`) and the passwords set
in the `secrets` folder (based on `secrets.example`).

If you plan to use Google OAuth 2.0 for authorization, you need to update
the list of allowed origins and redirect URIs in your app settings
in Google Cloud Console and specify the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` variable in the `.env` file.

If you run your project in different modes sequentially, it is recommended
to delete the images and volumes for the `api`, `mailer`, `panel-react`
and `panel-vue` containers, as they contain different startup schemes.

### Development

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f dev.yml up -d
```

This launch option allows you to associate microservice folders with containers
and opens ports for monitoring Postgres, Redis, and RabbitMQ.

To debug the `api` container on port `9229` and the `mailer` container on port `9239` using VS Code:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f dev.yml -f debug.yml up -d
```

### Production

If this is your first time running a project using this command, you'll need to temporarily enable
synchronization of the database structure with the ORM models on the backend:
set `cfg.postgres.synchronize = true` in the `apps/backend/api/config/configuration.ts` file.
In a production environment, synchronization is disabled to prevent accidental data corruption in the database.

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f prod.yml up -d
```

This startup option leaves a minimal build and does not track changes in microservices folders.

### Shutting Down

```sh
docker compose down --remove-orphans
```

### Additional Commands

For local development, you can install all dependencies from the root repository directory:

```sh
npm ci # for clean install
# or
npm i # for install with update
```

Run linting for all apps:

```sh
npm run lint
# or
npm run lint:fix
```

## Microservices

### Apps

#### Frontend

##### React

![Sign In Screen image](docs/images/preview-sign-in.png "Sign In Screen preview")
![Profile Screen image](docs/images/preview-profile.png "Profile Screen preview")
![Role Screen image](docs/images/preview-roles.png "Role Screen preview")

This microservice provides a graphical interface for administration.
In it, you can set a list of protected links, create roles with rights for links, manage registered users.
The service is written in [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)
and [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) with FSD-like structure.
[Material UI](https://github.com/mui/material-ui) is used as the UI kit.
[Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) is used as the application state manager.
[TanStack Query](https://github.com/TanStack/query) is used for API requests.
Service folder: `apps/frontend/panel-react`.

##### Vue

Implements the same functionality as the first frontend, but instead of React, [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/core) is used,
and instead of Next.js, [Nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt) is used.
Instead of [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs), the container uses [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun).
State manager - [Pinia](https://github.com/vuejs/pinia).
UI kit - [Vuetify](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify).
Service folder: `apps/frontend/panel-vue`.
Since this UI variant is a functional copy of the React version, it is disabled by default to save resources.
If you want to use this option, you will need to uncomment `panel-vue` in the `docker-compose.yml`,
`dev.yml`, `prod.yml`, and `infrastructure/nginx/templates/default.conf.template` files.

#### Backend

##### API Server

The main server that provides the client's interaction with databases,
authorization (JWT), creation of requests for sending emails.
When registering the first user, creates standard API-endpoints,
roles and assigns administrator role to the first registered user.
Written in [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest).
Service folder: `apps/backend/api`.

##### Mail Server

This service is engaged in sending emails.
It is built using the same technologies as the main API-server.
If the mailer is running in testing mode, then links to view the contents
of sent emails are available in the container console.
Service folder: `apps/backend/mailer`.

### Infrastructure

#### Proxy

[Nginx](https://github.com/nginx/agent) is used as a proxy server and provides the HTTPS protocol.
In the `infrastructure/nginx/html` folder you can change the default nginx response pages.
The `infrastructure/nginx/ssl` folder is used to store the SSL certificate files.
Reusable blocks (do not support environment variables) are located in the `infrastructure/nginx/snippets` folder.
In the file `infrastructure/nginx/templates/default.conf.template` you can set routing rules.

#### Database

[PostgreSQL](https://github.com/postgres/postgres) is used as the main database of the project.
In the file `infrastructure/postgres/postgresql.conf` you can set the parameters of PostgreSQL.

#### Cache Store

[Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis) is used to store user sessions.
In the file `infrastructure/redis/redis.conf` you can set the parameters of Redis.

#### Message Broker

[RabbitMQ](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-tutorials) is used to send requests for sending emails.
In the file `infrastructure/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf` you can set the parameters of RabbitMQ.

#### Monitoring

[Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) collects metrics from infrastructure services
(RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx) via their respective exporters.
Parameters can be set in `infrastructure/prometheus/prometheus.yml`.

[Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) provides a unified UI for metrics and traces.
The `infrastructure/grafana/provisioning` folder contains datasource and dashboard settings,
and `infrastructure/grafana/dashboards` contains pre-installed dashboards.

[Alloy](https://github.com/grafana/alloy) receives OTLP data (traces and metrics) from all application containers.
Its configuration is in `infrastructure/alloy/config.alloy`.

[Tempo](https://github.com/grafana/tempo) stores distributed traces from applications.
Frontend (Next.js) and backend (NestJS API, Mailer) sends traces to Alloy, which forwards them to Tempo.
You can search traces in Grafana Explore using the Tempo datasource.
Parameters can be set in `infrastructure/tempo/tempo.yaml`.

> **Note:** Distributed tracing for the Nuxt frontend (`panel-vue`) is currently not working
> because Bun does not have full OpenTelemetry support — its native HTTP implementation
> bypasses the Node.js instrumentation hooks used by `@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node`.
> A workaround is being explored.

#### Custom Entry Points

If you needed to perform some actions before each `CMD`/`ENTRYPOINT` call,
one option is to extend the original container entry point.
For example, if you need to open some service for external requests,
it will be safer to define the password for it in a secret file instead
of declaring it in environment variables, as is usually the case.

As an example, I will consider a similar case for RabbitMQ.
This image has by default `ENTRYPOINT["docker-entrypoint.sh"]` (the original entry point)
and `CMD["rabbitmq-server"]` (the original argument passed).
Let's assume we have a secret file with a password `/secrets/rabbitmq.txt`
(`/run/secrets/rabbitmq` after passing it from Docker Secrets)
and `./rabbitmq.conf.template` with the line `default_pass = ${RABBITMQ_PASSWORD}` inside.
Now let's create our own entry point `./custom-entrypoint.sh`:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# set command logging and error policy
set -eux

# some actions
# for example, read the password from a file and create a configuration from a template
RABBITMQ_PASSWORD="$(cat /run/secrets/rabbitmq)"
envsubst < /etc/rabbitmq/templates/rabbitmq.conf.template > /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf
unset RABBITMQ_PASSWORD

# optinal: pass the call arguments if none were specified
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
  set -- rabbitmq-server
fi

# execute original image entry point
exec /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh "$@"
```

Copy the new entry point into the container and call it:

```dockerfile
FROM rabbitmq:management-alpine
COPY ./custom-entrypoint.sh .
COPY ./rabbitmq.conf.template /etc/rabbitmq/templates/rabbitmq.conf.template
RUN chmod +x ./custom-entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["./custom-entrypoint.sh"]
```

## Other Folders

The `shared` folder is intended to store common types, utilities, and dictionaries between the frontend and backend.
Currently, containers are configured to use this folder (adding the dependency to `package.json`
and mounting volumes for Docker) using `npm workspaces`.

The `scripts` folder currently contains only a hook for `git`, which is configured to run
tests and linters in applications before commit, and a small script for installing it.

## Subdomain Setup

If you want to use subdomains instead of subsections for your project's container URLs,
you'll need to edit the `.env` file. For example:

```sh
# ...
# api
API_URL="api.${NGINX_URL}"
# ...
# panel-react
PANEL_REACT_URL="${NGINX_URL}"
# ...
# panel-vue
PANEL_VUE_URL="vue.${NGINX_URL}"
# ...
```

An example configuration for proxying subdomains can be found
in the file `infrastructure/nginx/templates.example/subdomains.conf.template`.

It is important to note that if you want to run a local project with subdomains,
you will need to map the local IP address to any convenient address,
since `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` addresses do not support subdomains:

```sh
# C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts on Windows
# or
# /etc/hosts on Linux
127.0.0.1 localhost.com
127.0.0.1 vue.localhost.com
127.0.0.1 api.localhost.com
```

Without a certificate, a project with subdomains may not work correctly (CORS policy).
You must add the self-signed certificate to your browser as a certificate authority
(in this case, it is the `infrastructure/nginx/ssl/myCA.pem` file).
Or just use your own purchased domain and certificate for it.

### SSL Update

The standard certificate is registered for address `localhost.com`
and all subdomains (`*.localhost.com`). It has a limited duration.
To create a new certificate, you can use the following commands:

1. Launching a Docker container to create a certificate:

   ```sh
   docker run --rm -v ./infrastructure/nginx/ssl:/usr/ssl -w /usr/ssl -it --entrypoint /bin/ash frapsoft/openssl
   ```

2. Generate SSL bundle:

   ```sh
   HOST=localhost.com && \
   openssl genrsa -out myCA.key 2048 && \
   openssl req -x509 -new -key myCA.key -sha256 -days 825 -out myCA.pem -subj "/CN=My Root CA" && \
   openssl genrsa -out ${HOST}.key 2048 && \
   openssl req -new -key ${HOST}.key -out ${HOST}.csr -subj "/CN=${HOST}" && \
   printf "authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer\n\
   basicConstraints=CA:FALSE\n\
   keyUsage=digitalSignature,nonRepudiation,keyEncipherment,dataEncipherment\n\
   subjectAltName=@alt_names\n\
   \n\
   [alt_names]\n\
   DNS.1=${HOST}\n\
   DNS.2=*.${HOST}\n\
   IP.1=127.0.0.1\n" > ${HOST}.ext && \
   openssl x509 -req -in ${HOST}.csr -CA myCA.pem -CAkey myCA.key -CAcreateserial -out ${HOST}.crt -days 825 -sha256 -extfile ${HOST}.ext
   ```

3. Exit from the container:

   ```sh
   exit
   ```

## Conclusion

I tried to implement the most common use cases of technologies,
trying to follow the solutions from their documentation as much as possible.

Since this is not a CMS but an example of a custom admin panel,
to add a certain functionality you need to create a controller for it, etc. in the `api`,
add the `resource` through the UI and display it there when needed.

Hope this will be useful for someone.
