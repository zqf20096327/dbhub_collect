# SQLite3.gd

This project provides SQLite3 integration for the Godot Engine using GDExtension.

It focuses on being a low-level yet complete wrapper, designed as a solid foundation for building higher-level interfaces while still accounting for rare edge cases.

All standard SQLite extensions are included except for Unicode (ICU) support. ICU is excluded to avoid increasing the final build size by more than 10×, but it can still be loaded separately at runtime if needed.

## ✨ Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs on desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), mobile (Android, iOS), and web (threads, no threads) platforms.
- **Demo Project**: includes [demo project](demo/) to get you started quickly, which [you can run in your browser](https://yeicor-gd.github.io/sqlite3.gd/gdext-tests.html).
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: includes [class references](doc_classes/) for seamless Godot editor integration.
- **High Performance**: leverages C++ for optimized performance and low-level access.
- **Easy Integration**: drop-in [GDExtension](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdextension/index.html) with simple Godot API bindings.
- **Automated Builds**: uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration, including tests and prebuilt binaries.
- **Dependency Management**: integrated [VCPKG](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) for hassle-free library management.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Download**: [latest release](https://github.com/yeicor-gd/sqlite3.gd/releases) or [nightly builds](https://github.com/yeicor-gd/sqlite3.gd/actions) (look for `...-addon.zip`).
2. **Extract**: the downloaded `...-addon.zip` into your project's root.
3. **Profit**: check out [demo/tests](demo/tests) for examples showing how to use the library.

## 🧩 Using this project as a template for other GDExtensions

1. **Rename the Project**: update `project({old-name} CXX)` in [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt), and rename [demo/addons/{old-name}/](demo/addons/sqlite3.gd/) to match your new addon name.
2. **Update Dependencies**: modify [vcpkg_ports/gdext/vcpkg.json](vcpkg_ports/gdext/vcpkg.json) to include your required libraries, and link them in [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) following VCPKG instructions.
3. **Customize Builds**: edit [vcpkg_ports/](vcpkg_ports/) and [vcpkg_triplets/](vcpkg_triplets/) as needed to ensure compatibility across platforms.
4. **Implement Your Logic**: add your C++ bindings in [src/](src/), document classes in [doc_classes/](doc_classes/), and create tests/demos in [demo/](demo/) (refer to existing examples).
5. **Update Metadata**: replace placeholders in this README (e.g., [Your Project Name], [YourGitHubUsername]) with your project's details and links.
