### RxDB

> "A fast, local first, reactive Database for JavaScript Applications"

🔗 [Website](https://rxdb.info/) | `</>` [Github](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb)

Maintenance Status: ✅ Actively Maintained

📋 License: `Apache 2.0`, `SSPL`, `proprietary`

✅ Feature rich and "complete"

✅ Supports Full Text Search and Client Side Encryption (Premium)

✅ The author of RxDB has interesting [articles](https://rxdb.info/articles/local-first-future.html) about offline first which are worth reading even if you do not want to use RxDB.

⚠️ Be aware that for many essential features like IndexedDB Adapter (better performance in Web Applications), SQLite Adapter (better performance in Electron / Mobile applications) you need to pay for RxDB Premium

❌ A bit over-complicated structure, may be overkill for small projects

❌ Even if you use the RxServer backend you still have to do a bit to make it work as its not "batteries included".

💵 Pricing: 

- Core Package: Free & Open Source (Apache 2.0, SSPL)
- Premium: Including Features like IndexedDB & SQLite Adapter, Encryption, Server Adapters for Koa & Fastify for native apps 300€-1800€ yearly

### Dexie

> "Dexie.js is a wrapper library for indexedDB - the standard database in the browser"

📋 License: `Apache 2.0` (Client), `Proprietary` (Backend)

✅ Docs for usage with React, Svelte, Angular, Vue and Vanilla JS.

⚠️ Even though the docs seem complete, navigating through it can be a hassle as the Table of Contents is not well-structured, documentation, API reference and Roadmap are not differentiated and there is no search functionality. Anyway, [this](https://dexie.org/docs/Tutorial/) is a good starting point if you want to use Dexie.js

❌ The backend is not Open Source

💵 Pricing:
* Hosted SaaS solution: 0.12ct/user/month (in 25 user packs at 3$)
* On Prem (self-hosted): 3495$ with five years of updates and 1 year support
* On Prem (self-hosted with source code access): 7995$ with five years of updates and 1 year support
