![autodb terminal UI](docs/media/autodb-tui.gif)

autodb is a keyboard-driven SQL editor for your terminal, your browser and
Neovim, and it never keeps a DSN in plain text: every connection is encrypted
under your passphrase. It is also a **PostgreSQL-wire proxy**. Put it in front
of production and nobody needs the database password again: developers,
contractors and AI agents each get their own account, a role, and a
**personal access token** for the one connection they are allowed to use.
Every statement they run is checked and written to an audit log with their
name on it.

## Features

**One binary, four frontends:** a terminal UI (`autodb --ui`), the same UI in a native window (`autodb --gui`), the same UI in a browser (`autodb --web-ui`), and a Neovim plugin

**A production front door:** `psql`, DataGrip, your app or an AI agent connects to autodb with an ordinary PostgreSQL DSN; production only has to trust one host

**Personal access tokens, not passwords:** one per person, laptop, app or agent, each with its own expiry and IP allowlist, revoked instantly

**Role-based access:** `reader`, `editor` and `admin`, plus a grant per connection, so access is decided per database, not per shared login

**Read-only means read-only:** readers run inside transactions PostgreSQL itself keeps read-only, so a write hidden in a function still fails

**Guards against the classic accidents:** `UPDATE` or `DELETE` with no `WHERE` is blocked, and so is a second statement smuggled after a `;`

**An audit trail you can query:** who ran what, against which connection, how long it took, how many rows, and why it was refused

**Secrets stay sealed:** connection passwords are encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM, argon2id-derived key) and never leave the server

**Vim-style editing:** modal editor, vim motions everywhere, a `Space` leader menu, and `?` for the keys that work right here

**Themes:** Dark, Light, Mono and Retro

**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite

## Motivation

I live in Neovim and in terminal apps for my dev work, and I could never find a
database tool that stored my credentials safely. Every option ended with a
plain-text DSN tucked away in a dotfile, a `.env` or an editor config. So I
started my own small project: a SQL editor that encrypts every connection under
a master passphrase, never writes a DSN in the clear, and runs natively inside
Neovim as well as in the terminal.

The front door came next, and it changed how I work with AI agents. Instead of
handing an agent a password, I mint it a personal access token (kept in
[`pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org/)), and the agent can do only what that
token's account is allowed to do, on the one connection it was given, with
every statement audited under its name. The same holds for co-workers: each
gets their own account and token, and nobody holds the production password.

I built it for myself first. I hope it helps someone in my shoes.

## Installation

autodb is a single binary. On Linux the plain download is static, with no
runtime dependencies, and runs anywhere. The native window (`--gui`) is a
separate `linux-<arch>-gui` download, because it links the window system's
libraries (Wayland/X11/EGL) and needs them to run. The macOS build carries the
window itself and needs only macOS.

| Platform | Install |
|---|---|
| macOS, Linux | [Homebrew](https://brew.sh): `brew install yongjohnlee80/tap/autodb` |
| Linux, macOS | [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev): `mise use -g github:yongjohnlee80/autodb` |
| Linux, macOS | The install script, below |
| Linux, macOS | A [release archive](https://github.com/yongjohnlee80/autodb/releases/latest) (`amd64` and `arm64`, with SHA-256 checksums; on Linux, the `-gui` archive adds `--gui`) |
| Windows | Use [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install) and any Linux method. A native Windows build is not published yet. |
| Any, with Go 1.25+ | Build from source, below |

**Install script.** It downloads the release for your platform, checks its
SHA-256, and falls back to building from source when there is no prebuilt
binary. It never uses `sudo`, and it installs to `~/.local/bin` by default.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yongjohnlee80/autodb/main/install.sh | sh
```

Read [`install.sh`](install.sh) first if you prefer; it is short. It takes
`--prefix <dir>`, `--version <tag>`, `--source` and `--binary`.

**From source.**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yongjohnlee80/autodb && cd autodb && make build   # → bin/autodb
```

Use `make build` rather than `go install`: the Makefile stamps the version,
which autodb uses to notice when a running server is older than the client.

### In Neovim

The plugin drives the same `autodb` binary. With
[lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "yongjohnlee80/autodb",
  dependencies = {
    "yongjohnlee80/auto-core.nvim",          -- required
    -- "yongjohnlee80/auto-finder.nvim",     -- optional: hosts the database drawer in its panel
  },
  build = "make build",                      -- optional: compile a binary matched to the plugin (needs Go)
  opts = {},
}
```

Without `build`, the plugin uses the `autodb` on your `PATH` from any method
above. Restart Neovim, then:

```vim
:checkhealth autodb
```

It reports which binary it found and where, the endpoint, and whether you are
signed in. Nothing starts until you use it: `<leader>Dl` signs in (the first
time, it creates your root user and passphrase), `<leader>Dc` picks a
connection, and `<leader>Dr` runs the SQL buffer. `:AutodbDrawer` opens the
database explorer. The rest is in [docs/neovim.md](docs/neovim.md).

## Quick start

```sh
autodb --ui
```

That is the whole setup. The first run creates the root user and your master
passphrase. There is no config file to write: the server listens on a
per-user unix socket (mode `0600`) and keeps its own data in SQLite under
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/autodb/`. Nothing listens on a TCP port until you ask it to.

Then:

1. `SPC c` → `a` to add a connection. The DSN is encrypted as soon as you save it.
2. Write SQL in the editor and press `SPC r` to run it.
3. `SPC H` shows the history: everything run, by whom, and how it went.

```sh
autodb --serve                # just the server (the UI starts one for you if needed)
autodb --gui                  # the same UI in a native window (golib/gui; macOS, Linux)
autodb --web-ui --port=7010   # the same UI in a browser, on 127.0.0.1
autodb --version
```

## The front door: production behind one gate

This is what autodb is for in an organisation. autodb speaks the PostgreSQL
wire protocol, so an unmodified client connects **through** it:

```
postgres://<user>:<personal-access-token>@autodb.example.com:5432/<database>?sslmode=verify-full&sslrootcert=ca.pem
```

Close production's firewall to everything except the autodb host. Your tools
keep working, and the only way in knows who you are.

- **Developers** use `psql`, DataGrip or DBeaver with their own token. A
  laptop that changes IP never touches the certificate, only the allowlist.
- **Applications and CI** get an `editor` account and token of their own, so
  the app's traffic is audited under its own name.
- **AI agents** get a `reader` account and a token for one connection. Any
  PostgreSQL client or MCP server works, and the database itself refuses a
  write.
- **Contractors** get a token that expires when their engagement does (up to
  365 days), limited to their IP, and revocable at any moment.

Minting a token (`SPC T` → `c`) opens a **connection card**: a ready DSN and
JDBC URL, the host, port and database, the `sslmode` and CA file to pin, and
the limits that apply, ready to paste into a client or hand to a colleague.
`SPC k` shows the CA certificate itself. The token is shown once; the server
keeps only its hash.

**Walk through the whole setup in the [front door tutorial](docs/front-door/tutorial.md).**
The commands, for quick access:

```sh
# Download the scripts. Read them before you run them: they run as root,
# install a systemd unit and write TLS material.
base=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yongjohnlee80/autodb/main
curl -fsSL -O "$base/provision_vm.sh" -O "$base/install_frontdoor.sh" -O "$base/update_frontdoor.sh" -O "$base/uninstall.sh"

sh provision_vm.sh --check --host 127.0.0.1                  # see the plan; changes nothing
sudo sh provision_vm.sh --apply --host 127.0.0.1             # provision THIS machine
sh provision_vm.sh --apply --user root --host 203.0.113.10   # provision a fresh VM over SSH

sudo sh update_frontdoor.sh      # update to the newest release (rolls back if it does not start)
sudo sh uninstall.sh --apply     # remove it (archives the meta store first)
```

Every script takes `--check`, which changes nothing, and `--help`. The
[operator reference](docs/front-door/operations.md) explains what each one does
and why.

## Keys

`Space` opens the leader menu, which lists every command with its key. `?`
shows the keys that work in the panel or dialog you are in.

| Key | Does |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl-h/j/k/l` | move between panes |
| `SPC r` / `SPC R` | run the buffer / run the selection |
| `SPC C` | choose the connection the query runs against |
| `SPC c` · `SPC w` · `SPC u` | connections · workspaces · users and grants |
| `SPC H` | script history |
| `SPC T` · `SPC i` | your access tokens · your allowed IPs |
| `SPC k` | the front door's CA certificate, as text you can copy |
| `SPC n` · `SPC s` | new note · save note (per-workspace `.sql` files) |
| `/` · `n` · `N` | search the focused panel |
| `SPC z` | zoom the focused pane |
| `y` · `Y` | copy a selection · copy everything, in any read-only view |
| `SPC A` | about: version, backend, and where state lives |
| `Ctrl-q` | quit (the server keeps running for your other frontends) |

The editor is vim-modal (`jk` escapes). Copying uses OSC 52, so it reaches
your system clipboard over SSH and inside tmux.
