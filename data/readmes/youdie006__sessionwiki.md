<img src="docs/demo-cli.webp" width="780" alt="Terminal recording: sessionwiki scans 47 GB of sessions across three tools, searches every message at once, jumps to related sessions, tags them, and resumes one in its original tool">

</div>

**sessionwiki turns the sessions your AI coding tools already wrote to disk into one durable history you can read, search, and trace &mdash; every file back to the conversation that wrote it, and nothing lost when a tool prunes the original.** Every tool at once. No daemon, no cloud, no logging habit to build &mdash; it works retroactively over the history you already have.

```console
$ sessionwiki scan
TOOL            SESSIONS       SIZE  OLDEST       NEWEST        PATH
claude-code         1763     1.1 GB  2026-03-27   2026-06-12    ~/.claude/projects
codex               2340    45.9 GB  2025-08-21   2026-06-12    ~/.codex/sessions
gemini                50     1.2 MB  2026-04-02   2026-06-10    ~/.gemini/tmp

4153 sessions across 3 tools, 47.0 GB on disk.
```

That is one real machine. Run it on yours &mdash; the number is usually a surprise. That conversation where Claude fixed your CORS bug three weeks ago is still on your disk, you just can't find it: each tool writes its sessions in its own format and folder, on every machine you use, and after a few months that is thousands of solved problems with no way back to any of them.

## What you can do with it

- **[Trace](#trace-code-back-to-its-session)** a file back to the conversations that wrote it &mdash; the link between your code and your sessions, across every tool, retroactively.
- **Blame** a line back to the session behind it &mdash; `git blame` for the AI era; best-effort, falls back to file-level `trace`.
- **[Keep](#nothing-gets-lost-archive-mode)** every session &mdash; archived when a tool prunes it, so `search` and `trace` never go dark; delete the bulky originals and still search them.
- **Read & resume** any session &mdash; reopen it in its original tool, or `brief` it into another.
- **Search** every message of every tool at once &mdash; substring + CJK, zero setup.
- **Curate** &mdash; tag, note, jump to [related](#session-engineering) sessions, and see where your agent time goes.

And a web UI for reading and browsing, not just grepping &mdash; live search, rendered transcripts, and each session's files as clickable provenance chips. `sessionwiki web`:

<img src="docs/demo-search.webp" width="820" alt="The sessionwiki web UI: typing a partial word into the search and seeing matches from Codex and Claude Code at once">

## Install

**Homebrew** (macOS / Linux):

```console
brew install youdie006/tap/sessionwiki
```

**Prebuilt binary** (no toolchain needed). macOS / Linux / WSL:

```console
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youdie006/sessionwiki/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows** (native PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youdie006/sessionwiki/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

Each script downloads the right archive for your platform from the
[latest release](https://github.com/youdie006/sessionwiki/releases/latest),
verifies its checksum, and installs the binary (`~/.local/bin`, or
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\sessionwiki` on Windows). **WSL is Linux** &mdash; use
the shell one-liner above; it installs the Linux binary and reads the session
stores in your WSL home.

**With Rust** (stable):

```console
cargo install sessionwiki
```

Either way it is a single binary with no runtime dependencies.

### Claude Code plugin (long-term memory)

Give Claude Code long-term memory of a project: its SessionStart hook makes it
recall your past sessions automatically. Install the `sessionwiki` CLI first
(above), then add the plugin from this repo:

```console
/plugin marketplace add youdie006/sessionwiki
/plugin install sessionwiki@sessionwiki-marketplace
```

Now Claude pulls in prior work when you start a task, and `/sessionwiki:recall
<topic>` searches your history on demand. The plugin shells out to the local
`sessionwiki` binary &mdash; fully offline. If the binary isn't on `PATH`, the
plugin degrades gracefully and Claude just works without recall.

### MCP server (any agent)

Expose your cross-tool session history as tools any MCP client can call, all
read-only and 100% local (stdio, no sockets):

- **`search_sessions`**, **`trace_file`**, **`get_session_brief`** &mdash; find a session and read a briefing of it.
- **`recent_sessions`**, **`related_sessions`**, **`session_window`** &mdash; how one agent reads what a sibling session is doing: list who is around, find the relevant one, then pull its recent turns as a bounded, versioned JSON window (with a per-turn drill-down).

```console
claude mcp add sessionwiki -- sessionwiki mcp
```

For Cursor, add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "sessionwiki": { "command": "sessionwiki", "args": ["mcp"] } } }
```

## Quick start

```console
sessionwiki scan                # where are my sessions?
sessionwiki search "jwt retry"  # full-text search across every tool
sessionwiki show 3f9c           # read the matching conversation
sessionwiki web                 # or browse everything in a local web UI
```

The first `search` or `list` builds the index; expect a few minutes per
gigabyte of history (a one-time cost &mdash; heavy Codex users can have tens of
GB). After that, updates are incremental and take seconds.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `scan` | Discover session stores on this machine. Pure filesystem walk, instant. |
| `list` | Recent sessions across all tools in one timeline. `--tool codex`, `--project api`, `--tag spike`, `-n 50`, `--all` (include subagent transcripts). |
| `search <query>` | Full-text search over every message of every tool. Minimum 3 characters. |
| `recall <query>` | Search, list the matches, and brief the top one in a single command &mdash; the fastest way back into a past session. `--tool`, `--project`, `-n`, `--json` (for agents). |
| `show <id>` | One session as a readable transcript. `--full` expands tool calls, `--json` emits the parsed session, `--outline` prints a digest: every question you asked plus how it ended. |
| `summarize [id]` | 1&ndash;2 sentence synopses via **your own LLM CLI** (`claude -p` default; `--cmd` / `SESSIONWIKI_SUMMARIZER` to change), cached in the index and shown in `show`, `--outline`, and the web sidebar. Without an id, batches the `--recent N` newest. |
| `resume <id>` | Reopen the session in its original tool: `claude --resume` / `codex resume`, run in the right project directory. Subagent transcripts resume their parent. `--print` to just show the command. |
| `migrate <id> <dir>` | Make a session resumable from a different project directory: Claude Code copies the transcript into `<dir>`'s store, Codex resumes by id from anywhere, Gemini copies the chat over. The original is never touched. `--config-dir <DIR>` writes into a specific store instead of the default one - for a machine where each account has its own (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is honoured when the flag is absent). |
| `brief <id>` | Emit the session as a markdown briefing (head and tail, middle omitted) to carry context into any tool &mdash; including across tools. `--max-chars`, `--tools`. |
| `web` | Local viewer on `127.0.0.1:7575`: day-grouped sessions, live search with highlighted snippets, rendered transcripts with outlines/tags/related, resume commands, light/dark, UI auto-localized (en/ko/ja/zh). Reads the existing index; `web --sync` refreshes first. Never leaves localhost. |
| `sync [--tool]` | Build or refresh the index on demand. Pair with `--no-sync` (below) so queries skip the store walk. Handy from a cron to keep the index warm. |

Every query command (`search`, `list`, `recall`, `show`, `brief`, `resume`, `trace`) takes `--no-sync` to query the already-built index without re-walking the stores &mdash; the fast path when something else (e.g. a cron running `sessionwiki sync`) keeps the index current.

### Session engineering

A session is a unit of context, and once you have hundreds they need curating
and managing &mdash; not just searching. These commands turn the flat archive into
a navigable, maintained one. They read the index, so they are instant.

<img src="docs/demo-tags.webp" width="820" alt="Filtering the session list down to a single tag in the web UI">

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `related <id>` | Sessions about the same thing: same project first, then sessions that edited the same files, then anything sharing a tag. The "see also" for your work. |
| `files <id>` | The files a session edited or created &mdash; its side of the provenance link. |
| `trace <path>` | The AI sessions that touched a file, newest first. Matches a relative path against the absolute one on disk, so `trace src/auth.rs` just works. See [below](#trace-code-back-to-its-session). |
| `blame <path>` | git blame for the AI era: attributes each line to the AI session most likely behind the commit that last changed it, by joining `git blame` with the index. `-L 40,80` for a range. Best-effort, not proof of authorship &mdash; `ambiguous`/`unattributed` are normal, and it falls back to file-level `trace`. |
| `tag <id> <tag>...` | Tag a session (`--rm` to remove). No id lists every tag in use. Filter with `list --tag`. Tags are stored in the index and survive reindexing &mdash; the original session files are never touched. |
| `note <id> "text"` | Pin a freeform note on a session; omit the text to read it back. |
| `forget <id>` | Permanently drop a session from the index and archive. The escape hatch for [archive mode](#nothing-gets-lost-archive-mode) when you want a kept session gone. |
| `projects` | One row per project: session count, message volume, last activity. A page per codebase. |
| `stats` | Totals plus a breakdown by tool, by month, files linked to sessions, and how many sessions were kept after the tools deleted them. |
| `digest [--since 7d]` | A markdown rollup of recent sessions grouped by project &mdash; what you worked on, the files each touched, and any cached synopsis. `--since 2w`/`24h`/`90m`, `--project`, `--tool`, `--json`. The standup / PR-body / "what did I ship this week" view, assembled from the index. |

### Trace code back to its session

AI writes most of the code now, so the question is no longer "who wrote this
line" but "which conversation produced it, and why." sessionwiki reads the file
edits out of each session's tool calls &mdash; Claude's `Edit`/`Write`, Codex's
`apply_patch` &mdash; and links every session to the files it changed.

<img src="docs/demo-trace.webp" width="820" alt="A session's files listed as provenance chips, and the sessions that touched one of those files">

```console
$ sessionwiki trace src/middleware/mod.rs
2 session(s) touched "src/middleware/mod.rs", newest first:
35a59790  claude-code  2026-06-09  Fix CORS preflight failing on /auth routes
4fd0ce37  claude-code  2026-06-08  Add retry with backoff to the payment webhook handler
```

It works retroactively, with no hooks or setup, over every session already on
disk &mdash; nothing to install before the fact. The honest scope: this points
you at the conversations that *touched* a file, not at line-level authorship; a
later edit may have replaced the code, so `trace` is a way back to the relevant
discussion, not a claim that a given line came from one session. In the web UI,
the files a session touched are chips in its header &mdash; click one to see
every other session that touched it.

### Nothing gets lost (archive mode)

Claude Code and Codex prune old sessions over time. The first time `trace`
comes up empty for a file you *know* an agent wrote &mdash; because the session
behind it was deleted &mdash; the whole link is worthless. So once sessionwiki
has indexed a session, it keeps it: when a tool deletes the original, the
session is **archived**, not dropped, and `search`, `trace`, and `brief` keep
working for it.

```console
$ sessionwiki list          # after Claude pruned an old session
archived 1 session(s) the tool removed (1 kept that your tools have deleted)
...
a1b2c3d4  claude-code  3w ago  12  …/api-server  Fix CORS preflight…  [archived]
```

It is automatic and reversible: `forget <id>` drops an archived session for good,
and a session that reappears on disk un-archives itself. The original tool can no
longer reopen it, but you can still read, `brief`, and `trace` it. This is the
part a generation-time hook can't do &mdash; it works for the sessions that
already exist, and the ones the tool deleted while you weren't looking.

**It also reclaims disk.** The index keeps only a distilled copy of each session
(the conversation and its file links, minus bulky tool output), so it is far
smaller than the raw stores &mdash; roughly 7&times; on the machine above (47 GB
&rarr; ~7 GB). Delete the old raw sessions to free the space and `search`,
`trace`, `brief`, and reading still work from the index. The tradeoff: an
archived session is the distilled transcript, not the byte-exact original &mdash;
which is exactly the part you want when you are hunting for the conversation that
solved something.

## Pick up where you left off

Finding an old session is half the point; the other half is continuing it.

<img src="docs/demo-open.webp" width="820" alt="Opening a session in the web UI: its tags, its files, the command that resumes it in the original tool, and the transcript rendered underneath">

```console
$ sessionwiki search "rate limiter"
76a614028a63 codex 2026-06-11 13:00 .../projects/api-server [assistant]
  ...the bucket invariant 0 <= tokens <= capacity holds after every step...

$ sessionwiki resume 76a6           # reopens that conversation in Codex

$ sessionwiki brief 76a6 | claude -p \
    "Continue this work: add the missing edge-case tests"

$ sessionwiki summarize --recent 20  # synopses for your latest sessions
```

`resume` uses each tool's native mechanism, so it needs the original session
file to still exist. `brief` works even across tools. `summarize` runs your
LLM, on your machine, at your command &mdash; sessionwiki itself never makes a
network call.

### Which account was that? (swapdex)

If [swapdex](https://github.com/youdie006/swapdex) manages your Claude/Codex
accounts, `list` and `search` badge every session with the account profile
that was active when it ran (`@work`, `@personal`), and `--json` carries an
`account` field. Attribution joins swapdex's switch timeline (read-only)
with each session's start time; sessions that predate your first switch stay
unbadged &mdash; a missing badge, never a guess. The other direction works
too: after switching in `swapdex ui`, it lists this machine's recent sessions
and hands off to `sessionwiki resume`.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph stores["Already on your disk"]
        A["~/.claude/projects"]
        B["~/.codex/sessions"]
        C["~/.gemini/tmp"]
    end
    A & B & C --> AD["adapters<br>(one small file per tool)"]
    AD --> IDX[("SQLite FTS5 index<br>trigram tokenizer")]
    IDX --> CLI["CLI<br>scan / list / search / show<br>summarize / resume / brief"]
    IDX --> WEB["web viewer<br>127.0.0.1 only"]
```

- `scan` walks the filesystem and reports; it touches no index.
- Everything else maintains an incremental index at
  `~/.local/share/sessionwiki/index.db` (platform equivalent; override with
  `SESSIONWIKI_DATA`). Only files whose mtime or size changed are re-parsed.
- Original session files are never modified &mdash; the index is a disposable
  cache. Cached summaries survive schema upgrades on purpose: rebuilding an
  index is cheap, re-running an LLM over your history is not.
- Noise is filtered deliberately: repeated harness boilerplate and bulky tool
  outputs stay out of the index so search results stay signal.

<details>
<summary><b>FAQ: why not just grep the session folders?</b></summary>
<br>

You can, but the files are JSONL event streams with escaped text in three
different schemas. grep gives you raw matching lines out of context; the
trigram index gives ranked results with snippets in milliseconds, joined to
session metadata, including nested subagent transcripts, across all tools at
once &mdash; and the id it returns plugs straight into `show`, `resume`, and `brief`.
</details>

## Privacy

Sessions contain your code and your conversations, so the bar is simple: **not a
single network call in the codebase** (small enough to verify with one grep), no
telemetry, no accounts. The index is local; originals are opened read-only. The
one feature that touches an LLM is `summarize`, and it does so by running a CLI
*you* chose, locally, only when you invoke it.

## Supported tools

| Tool | Session store | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` (incl. nested subagent transcripts) | supported |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl` | supported |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats/*.json` | supported |
| OpenCode | `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` (SQLite; also the legacy `storage/**` JSON) | supported |
| Cline, Roo Code, Kilo Code | VS Code `globalStorage/<ext>/tasks/<id>/` (one parser, three tools) | supported |
| gajae-code (& Pi) | `~/.gjc/agent/sessions/**/*.jsonl` | supported |
| Continue | `~/.continue/sessions/*.json` | supported |
| gptme | `~/.local/share/gptme/logs/<session>/conversation.jsonl` | supported |
| prodex (ChatGPT Pro consults) | per-repo `.bridge/tasks|results` via the `~/.local/share/prodex/bridges.json` registry (prodex >=0.11.0); `resume` opens the ChatGPT thread | supported |
| aider | per-repo `.aider.chat.history.md` (markdown) | supported |
| Cursor, Zed, ... | | planned &mdash; PRs welcome |

**Using a wrapper like oh-my-claudecode or oh-my-openagent?** Those run on top of
Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode, so their conversations already live in those
tools' stores and get indexed automatically. When the harness's `.omc` / `.omo`
directory is present in a project, sessionwiki tags the session so `list --tag
oh-my-claudecode` works &mdash; a filesystem signal, so a session that merely
*discusses* a harness is never mislabeled.

### How it compares

Searching and browsing AI session history is an active &mdash; and now crowded &mdash;
space. Each of these is good at what it does; sessionwiki's bet is a **durable,
browsable home** for your history: read it in a web UI (not just grep), trace any
file back to the conversation that wrote it, and keep every session even after the
tool prunes the original.

| | Great at | What sessionwiki adds |
|---|---|---|
| [deja-vu](https://github.com/vshulcz/deja-vu) | Fast cross-agent recall as an MCP memory layer (SSH sync, handoff, redaction) | A web UI to read and browse, not just query; and archive mode &mdash; history survives after the tool deletes the original |
| [Claudia](https://github.com/getAsterisk/claudia) | A polished Claude Code GUI | Cross-tool, CLI *and* web, and `trace` links code back to its conversation |
| [SpecStory](https://specstory.com) | Capturing chat history as you work | Works retroactively over the sessions you already have &mdash; no capture step |
| [claude-code-log](https://github.com/daaain/claude-code-log) | Rendering one tool's transcripts to HTML | Every tool at once, full-text search, and provenance |
| [cass](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search) | Fast cross-tool + cross-machine search | File&rarr;conversation provenance, archived deleted sessions, curation, web UI |

**`trace <file>`** goes from a file to the AI conversations that edited it
&mdash; retroactively, no hooks, across every tool, [even for sessions your tool
has since deleted](#nothing-gets-lost-archive-mode). A generation-time hook can't
do that for the sessions you already have; a single-tool viewer can't do it
across tools.

Honest tradeoff: a dedicated single-tool viewer will have more tool-specific
polish than sessionwiki's adapter for that one tool. The bet is the cross-tool
spine plus code provenance, over [twelve tools today](#supported-tools) and
growing &mdash; adapters are the #1 thing [PRs](#adding-an-adapter) help with.

## Adding an adapter

If your agent writes sessions to disk, it belongs here. An adapter is
one small Rust file implementing four methods:

```rust
pub trait Adapter {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;               // "my-tool"
    fn root(&self) -> Option<PathBuf>;            // where it keeps sessions
    fn discover(&self) -> Vec<PathBuf>;           // every session file
    fn parse(&self, path: &Path) -> Result<Session>; // tolerant; skip bad lines
}
```

Look at [`src/adapters/gemini.rs`](src/adapters/gemini.rs) for the smallest
example (~100 lines), register your type in [`src/adapters/mod.rs`](src/adapters/mod.rs),
and open a PR. Parsers must never panic on malformed input &mdash; session formats
drift between tool versions, so parse defensively and return what you can.

## Roadmap

- more adapters &mdash; Cursor, Zed, ... the #1 thing PRs
  help with (see [adding an adapter](#adding-an-adapter))
- `merge` &mdash; combine indexes from multiple machines into one
- `clean` &mdash; reclaim disk from huge old session stores, safely
- prebuilt binaries for every platform

Shipped recently: [provenance](#trace-code-back-to-its-session) (`trace` /
`files`) and [archive mode](#nothing-gets-lost-archive-mode).

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome. The most valuable contributions right now:

1. **Adapters** for tools you use (see [Adding an adapter](#adding-an-adapter))
2. **Format fixes** when a tool update changes its session schema
3. **Bug reports** with the first few lines of a session file that fails to parse (redact freely)
