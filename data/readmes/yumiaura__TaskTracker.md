Claude Code keeps a task list while it works - and that list dies with the session.<br>
TaskTracker mirrors it onto a board per project, and gives Claude MCP tools to read the queue back next time.<br>
The board is a web panel: projects, then three columns - **QUEUE**, **IN PROGRESS**, **DONE**.<br>
A project appears the moment you start Claude in it; the panel refreshes itself.

**Codex is supported too:** its native plan is mirrored through lifecycle hooks,
and the same MCP server reads the queue. See [Codex setup](#-codex).

How it runs - a real Claude Code session, the panel never reloaded: Claude plans the work
and the tasks land in **QUEUE** (1), each one moves to **IN PROGRESS** before Claude starts on
it (2), and to **DONE** when it is finished (3).

Click a task - a card on the board or a row in the table - to open it: edit the title and the
detail, change the status, or delete it. Cards can also be dragged between columns.

## 🚀 Quick start

**1. Start the board** - the panel and the MCP server, in one container:

```bash
cd TaskTracker
docker compose up -d
```

The panel is at http://127.0.0.1:8787. Where the cards come from is set in `.env` - see
[below](#-where-the-cards-come-from).

**2. Install the Claude Code plugin** - once, from the same directory; it works in every project.
For Codex, use the [Codex steps](#-codex) instead:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ./
claude plugin install tasktracker@tasktracker
```

**3. Restart Claude Code.** From then on every project you open Claude in is on the board,
and its cards follow Claude's work.

**4. Check it works** - in Claude Code:

- `/mcp` - `plugin:tasktracker:tasktracker` is listed as connected.
- `/tasktracker:tasks` - Claude reports this project's queue (empty on a new board).
- Ask Claude to *"make a todo list of three steps for …"*, then open http://127.0.0.1:8787 -
  the project is there, with the three cards marked `TODO`.

**Updating** - after pulling changes, from the checkout:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
claude plugin marketplace update tasktracker
claude plugin uninstall tasktracker@tasktracker
claude plugin install tasktracker@tasktracker
```

Then restart Claude Code.

## 🤖 Codex

After starting the board, run these from the checkout (Python 3.11+ on the host;
Linux, macOS or WSL):

```bash
codex mcp add tasktracker --url http://127.0.0.1:8787/mcp
python3 hooks/install-codex.py
```

Restart Codex, open `/hooks` and review and trust the TaskTracker hooks; Codex
requires that review before they run. Check the connection in `/mcp`.
The installer keeps your other hooks and backs up a changed `hooks.json`.

With `TASKTRACKER_CARDS=claude` (the existing default, shared by both clients),
Codex's `update_plan` steps become `CODEX` cards and follow their native status.
With `TASKTRACKER_CARDS=prompts`, a prompt is in IN PROGRESS until Codex stops,
then DONE. Claude and Codex share the board; their sessions remain separate.

After updates, rebuild the container, rerun the installer and restart Codex.
[Full setup, checks and limitations](docs/CODEX.md).

## 🃏 Where the cards come from

One setting, `TASKTRACKER_CARDS` in `.env` beside `docker-compose.yml`
(copy [`.env.example`](.env.example)). After changing it, rebuild and restart Claude Code.

```bash
TASKTRACKER_CARDS=claude    # the default
TASKTRACKER_CARDS=prompts
```

- **`claude`** - the cards are Claude's own tasks. The plugin tells Claude, at the start of
  every session and again with every prompt, to plan any work of more than one step as tasks
  and keep their status current; each task is a card, marked `TODO`, that moves as Claude
  works. If Claude still does work - Bash, Edit, Write - without a single task, the prompt
  itself lands in **DONE**, marked `PROMPT`. If it tracked the work with one of the tracker's
  MCP tasks instead, the prompt is glued to that task: one card, marked `MCP` + `PROMPT`, with
  the prompt under **MERGED CARDS**. A question answered by reading makes no card.
- **`prompts`** - every prompt you send is a card, marked `PROMPT`: its first line is the
  title, the whole prompt the detail. It is in **IN PROGRESS** while Claude answers and in
  **DONE** when it stops. Slash commands make no card, and Claude's own tasks are not shown.

## 🔗 Duplicate cards

Claude/Codex compares card meaning through `tasks_review` and applies its
decisions with `tasks_reconcile`. For example, a prompt asking for version
0.0.2 and an MCP task recording that release can become one card. Different
subtasks, releases and uncertain matches stay separate.

After work, the Stop hook requests one review when cards from different sources
have changed. It includes DONE cards. The surviving card shows all source
badges; open **MERGED CARDS** in its dialog to read the originals and the reason.
Repeated hooks resolve to that same card. A completed prompt never completes
an unfinished task just because they were merged.

For existing duplicates, run `/tasktracker:reconcile` in Claude Code, or ask
Codex to reconcile this project's TaskTracker cards. Update the container and
installed hooks first. [How the LLM review works](docs/RECONCILIATION.md).

## 🧪 Development

```bash
pip install -e '.[dev]'
pre-commit install              # ruff and the test suite before every commit
pytest --cov                    # the suite, with coverage and the lines it missed
```

`ruff check` and `ruff format` keep the style; the settings are in `pyproject.toml`.
GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs ruff and `pytest --cov` on Python 3.11 and
3.12 for every pull request and every push to `main`.

The panel has no build step: `src/tasktracker/www` is served as it is, and every library is
vendored there. The version stays **0.0.4** between releases - see [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for why, and for
how a change reaches an installed plugin.
