## ✨ Features 

- **SQLite Integration**: WordPress is pre-configured to use SQLite as the database, thanks to the [SQLite Database Integration Plugin](https://github.com/WordPress/sqlite-database-integration). No extra setup required!
- **Automated Builds**: Docker images are automatically built and pushed to the GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`) whenever new WordPress tags are released.
- **Multi-Architecture Support**: Images are built for multiple architectures ensuring compatibility across a wide range of systems.
  - `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm/v7`, `linux/arm64/v8` 
- **Minimalistic**: Only WordPress and the SQLite plugin are included—nothing extra. Lightweight and efficient!

## 🚀 Usage
To run the container, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/yunussandikci/wordpress-sqlite:6.9.1-php8.5-apache
```

This will start a WordPress instance with SQLite as the database, accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
