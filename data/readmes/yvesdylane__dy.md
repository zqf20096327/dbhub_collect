> **Leveling up one command at a time** — A Telegram bot + mini app for managing attendance, tasks, notes, and announcements.

Meet **[dy](https://t.me/dyDMCBOT)** — a side project that started as "let me play with the Telegram Bot API" and grew into a full assistant for my institute. It doesn't reply to random chit-chat (only commands — clean, focused, minimal).

## 🚀 Local Setup

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yvesdylane/dy.git
cd dy
```

### 2. Environment

Create `.env` at the project root:

```
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_bot_token
TELEGRAM_GROUP_ID=-1001234567890
MINI_APP_URL=http://localhost:8000
DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./dy.db
```

The bot must be added as a member of the Telegram group used for file storage. Its ID can be obtained from any message forwarded to the bot.

### 3. Install & Run

```bash
uv sync
uv run python main.py
```

The app will be at `http://localhost:8000`, bot webhook at `/telegram`, dashboard at `/app`.

### 4. Deploy (Render)

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| **Build Command** | `uv sync --frozen && uv cache prune --ci` |
| **Start Command** | `uv run python main.py` |
| **Env vars** | Same as `.env` above (set `MINI_APP_URL` to `https://your-app.onrender.com`) |

## 💾 Sync & Backup

- **`/sync`** — Upload a `.db` file. The bot merges users, attendance, tasks, submissions, notes, info, creation codes, complaints, and leave requests. After merging, it re-uploads every file found in the old DB (profile images, task attachments, submission files, note/info attachments) to the current storage group and updates all `file_id` references automatically.

- **`/db`** — Download the current live database for manual backup.

---

## 💡 Philosophy

- **Commands only.** No noise. The bot doesn't reply to every message — it waits for instructions.
- **Minimal.** Every feature has a reason. I'd rather ship fewer things well.
- **Play-driven.** This whole project is me messing around with the Telegram Bot API, async Python, and webhooks. It's messy, it's fun, and it's getting better every commit.
