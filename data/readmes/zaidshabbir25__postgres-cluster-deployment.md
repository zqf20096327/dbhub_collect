# postgres-cluster-deployment

Deploy an **n-node PostgreSQL cluster** with [Spock](https://github.com/pgEdge/spock)
multi-master replication and [Patroni](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/) high
availability, onto machines you already have, over SSH.

Answer five questions and you get a cross-wired multi-master cluster with
per-node failover, passwordless `psql` access everywhere, an HTML report of
exactly what happened, and a live health dashboard.

```console
$ ./pg_deploy_cluster.sh
1) Which machines should the cluster run on?
2) How should PostgreSQL and Spock be installed?
3) How many Spock nodes should the cluster have?
4) Which PostgreSQL version?
5) Should any node get a Patroni standby?   (default: no)
```

The first question writes `configuration/inventory.json` for you, so there is
nothing to edit by hand before the first run.

---

## What it builds

Two different replication layers do two different jobs, and keeping them
straight is the key to understanding this tool.

**Spock** gives you *multi-master*: every Spock node accepts writes and
replicates logically to every other Spock node, in both directions. Nodes are
cross-wired into a full mesh.

**Patroni** gives you *high availability within one node*: each Spock node is
the leader of its own Patroni scope, and its standbys are physical replicas of
that node alone. If `n1` dies, Patroni promotes `n1s1` — it never promotes `n2`,
because `n2` is a peer holding different data, not a copy.

```
                Spock multi-master mesh — logical, bidirectional
        ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
        │                                                           │
   ┌────▼───┐                  ┌────────┐                   ┌───────▼┐

   scope demo-n1               scope demo-n2               scope demo-n3
   (leader + standby)          (leader + standby)          (leader only)
```

Every Spock node is its own scope, so a failover is always contained: it changes
which machine serves `n1`, never which data `n1` holds.

### Placement

One Spock node per host. If you ask for more nodes than you have hosts, the
surplus is packed onto the least-loaded hosts on separate ports (5432, 5433, …)
— useful for a single-VM test cluster, and reported as a shared failure domain
so nobody mistakes it for HA. A standby is always placed on a *different* host
from its leader when one is free; when it cannot be, the plan says so.

`etcd` (the store Patroni elects leaders through) is sized from the host count:
three or more hosts get a 3-member cluster that survives losing a machine, fewer
get a single member that is flagged as a single point of failure.

---

## Requirements

**Control machine** (where you run these scripts) — Python 3.9+ and network
reach to your hosts. `./pg_deploy_cluster.sh` creates a virtualenv and installs
`paramiko`, `PyYAML` and `Flask` on first run.

**Target hosts** — a RHEL-family (RHEL, Rocky, AlmaLinux, Oracle Linux) or
Debian-family (Debian, Ubuntu) machine, reachable over SSH, with a login user
that has **passwordless sudo**. Every step runs through `sudo -n`.

Hosts must reach each other on the PostgreSQL ports (5432+), the Patroni REST
ports (8008+) and etcd's ports (2379/2380). On AWS that means a security group
allowing those ports between the instances.

---

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <this repo> && cd postgres-cluster-deployment

# 1. Deploy. Asks for your machines, then the topology, then shows the plan
#    and waits for confirmation.
./pg_deploy_cluster.sh

# ...or describe the machines up front and skip that question.
cp configuration/inventory.example.json configuration/inventory.json
$EDITOR configuration/inventory.json

# 2. Watch it.
./pg_cluster_status.sh
./pg_dashboard.sh          # http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

### The inventory

The inventory lists **hosts only** — how many nodes land on them is decided per
deployment. That separation is what lets one inventory serve a 2-node and a
6-node cluster.

```json
{
  "defaults": { "cluster_name": "pgedge", "pg_major": "17", "spock_major": "50" },
  "hosts": [
    { "name": "node-a", "host": "10.0.1.11", "username": "rocky",  "enabled": true },
    { "name": "node-b", "host": "10.0.1.12", "username": "rocky",  "enabled": true },
    { "name": "node-c", "host": "10.0.1.13", "username": "ubuntu", "enabled": false }
  ]
}
```

`defaults` supplies fallbacks for anything you do not pass on the command line.
Set `"enabled": false` to park a host without deleting it.

The interactive run's first question offers to write this file: keep the hosts
already listed, type in new ones (address, SSH user, SSH port, key file), or
pick "this machine only" for a localhost cluster with no SSH. The previous file
is kept as `inventory.json.bak`, and the `defaults` block is carried over.

List each machine **once**. A machine carrying several instances separates them
by port — `5432, 5433, ...` for PostgreSQL and `8008, 8009, ...` for the Patroni
REST API — and that counting is per machine, not per inventory entry, so two
entries pointing at the same address do not collide on 5432. When the run
detects instances sharing a machine it also asks which ports to start from, in
case something already owns 5432.

**SSH keys.** Leave `key_file` empty and `ssh-add` your key — that is the
default and nothing sensitive touches the repo. Otherwise set
`PG_CLUSTER_SSH_KEY`, or put a key in `keys/` (gitignored) and `chmod 600` it.
`configuration/inventory.json` is gitignored too, because it names your
machines.

### Rehearse without touching anything

```bash
./pg_deploy_cluster.sh --dry-run --nodes 3 --standby n1,n2
```

```
NODE       ROLE      HOST             ADDRESS          PG      API    SCOPE       FOLLOWS
n1         spock     node-a           10.0.1.11        5432    8008   demo-n1     -
n2         spock     node-b           10.0.1.12        5432    8008   demo-n2     -
n3         spock     node-c           10.0.1.13        5432    8008   demo-n3     -
n1s1       standby   node-b           10.0.1.12        5433    8009   demo-n1     n1
n2s1       standby   node-a           10.0.1.11        5433    8009   demo-n2     n2

Standby placement:
  n1s1 follows n1: node-b vs leader on node-a — survives host loss
  n2s1 follows n2: node-a vs leader on node-b — survives host loss
```

```

The `aspects/` and `deployment/` split is the point of the design: `aspects`
knows *how* to do things to a host, `deployment` decides *what* to do. Nothing
in `aspects` imports from `deployment`.

---

## Deployment modes

### Native packages (default)

Installs from the pgEdge repository. Spock is installed **first** on purpose: it
pulls in the matching pgEdge PostgreSQL server as a dependency, which guarantees
the two were built against the same tree. `contrib` is installed separately
because zodan's cross-wiring calls `dblink`.

Community PGDG repositories are disabled during prerequisites. Both PGDG and
pgEdge ship `postgresql<major>-*` packages, and if PGDG is enabled the resolver
can satisfy Spock's dependency from PGDG — which installs cleanly and then fails
to load `spock.so`.

```bash
./pg_deploy_cluster.sh --nodes 3 --pg-major 17 --spock-major 50 --channel release
```

### Manual build from source

Builds PostgreSQL and Spock on every host. Spock needs core patches, so the
order is fixed: the PostgreSQL tree is patched from `spock/patches/<major>/`
**before** it is configured, then Spock is built against the result with
`USE_PGXS=1`. A Spock built against an unpatched server compiles and then fails
at load time.

Needs an exact version, because it downloads a release tarball. Expect 20–40
minutes per host.

```bash
./pg_deploy_cluster.sh --mode source --pg-version 17.11 --spock-branch main
```

Patroni and etcd are *not* built from source: Patroni goes into its own
virtualenv (so it cannot break the system interpreter) and etcd is installed
from its official static release. Neither benefits from a source build, and
pulling in a Go toolchain for etcd would double the prerequisites.

---

## What a deployment does

```
 1  Connect to hosts               SSH, and probe each platform
 2  Install prerequisites          base tools, apt lock released, PGDG muted
 3  Configure pgEdge repository    (packages mode)
 4  Install PostgreSQL and Spock   spock first, then contrib for dblink
 5  Install Patroni and etcd
 6  Set up passwordless psql       .pgpass, pg_service.conf, pg_hba
 7  Configure and start etcd       1 or 3 members, then wait for quorum
 8  Write Patroni configuration    one config and one systemd unit per node
 9  Bootstrap Spock nodes          each becomes leader of its own scope
10  Add standby nodes              clone from their leader via pg_basebackup
11  Validate Patroni cluster       every scope has a leader, all members stream
12  Create Spock extensions        spock and dblink
13  Load zodan procedures          the cross-wiring library
14  Cross-wire Spock nodes         spock.add_node joins each node to every peer
15  Enable DDL replication         schema changes propagate automatically
16  Verify replication             node visibility and subscription state
17  Collect health snapshot        seeds the dashboard and the report
```

Steps 3–5 are replaced by a single source-build step in `--mode source`.

Every step is recorded whether it passes or fails, so a deployment that dies
half way still leaves a report that says how far it got and a per-node
transcript of every command.

### Cross-wiring

Cross-wiring goes through zodan's `spock.add_node` rather than raw
`node_create`/`sub_create`. `add_node` is cluster-aware — it discovers every
node already registered with the source and wires the newcomer to all of them in
both directions, with the sync-event handshakes that make joining a *live*
cluster safe. So adding the Nth node is always one call against node 1:

```
n1                       first node — nothing to wire
add_node(n1 -> n2)       n1 <-> n2
add_node(n1 -> n3)       n1 <-> n3, and n2 <-> n3
add_node(n1 -> n4)       ... and so on
```

`add_node` exits zero even when individual phases fail, so its
`Success rate: %100` line is checked explicitly. See
[`configuration/spock/README.md`](configuration/spock/README.md) for which zodan
revision goes with which Spock major, and why it matters.

### Passwordless psql

After a deployment, `psql` works from any host to any node without a password,
while the wire still uses `scram-sha-256` rather than `trust`:

```bash
psql -h 10.0.1.11 -p 5432 -U postgres -d postgres
psql service=n2          # named connections from pg_service.conf
```

`.pgpass` carries **every** node, not just the local one, because zodan's
cross-wiring and the health collector both connect outward from whichever node
they run on. `pg_hba` lists each node's address explicitly rather than opening a
wide CIDR, so the rule set stays as narrow as the cluster is.

---

## Commands

### Deploy

```bash
./pg_deploy_cluster.sh                                    # interactive
./pg_deploy_cluster.sh --nodes 3 --pg-major 17 --standby n1,n2
./pg_deploy_cluster.sh --mode source --pg-version 17.11
./pg_deploy_cluster.sh --clean --nodes 2                  # wipe a previous run first
./pg_deploy_cluster.sh --dry-run --nodes 4                # plan only
./pg_deploy_cluster.sh --help
```

Passing **any** flag turns off the prompts, which is what CI should do.

### Status

```bash
./pg_cluster_status.sh                            # most recent cluster
./pg_cluster_status.sh --cluster demo
./pg_cluster_status.sh --cluster demo --json      # machine-readable
./pg_cluster_status.sh --cluster demo --report    # also write an HTML report
./pg_cluster_status.sh --list                     # what has been deployed
```

Exits non-zero when the cluster is not fully healthy, so it works directly as a
monitoring or CI check.

### Add a standby later

```bash
python3 -m deployment.cli add-standby --cluster demo --leader n2
python3 -m deployment.cli add-standby --cluster demo --leader n2 --host node-c
```

This is more than starting another Patroni instance: the new member's permanent
replication slot is added to the **live** DCS configuration (a slot declared in
the leader's `bootstrap` block would never be created, because bootstrap already
ran), and `.pgpass` and `pg_service.conf` on every host learn the new node.

### Tear down

```bash
python3 -m deployment.cli remove --cluster demo             # data, configs, etcd state
python3 -m deployment.cli remove --cluster demo --purge     # also uninstall packages
```

`remove` stops Patroni before touching anything, so no surviving member tries to
fail over into a data directory that is being deleted. Hosts that cannot be
reached are reported and left untouched rather than aborting the teardown.

When there is no cluster state to remove — a deployment that failed halfway, or
a state file that was deleted — clean the machines themselves instead:

```bash
./pg_deploy_cluster.sh --cleanup                 # ask first, then scrub every host
./pg_deploy_cluster.sh --cleanup --purge --yes   # also uninstall packages, no prompt
```

`--cleanup` works from the inventory rather than from saved state: it finds the
`patroni-*` units on each host, stops and deletes them, kills anything still
serving out of the data root, purges etcd, and removes the data directories,
`/etc/patroni`, the generated `.pgpass` and `pg_service.conf`, and any saved
cluster state that described only those hosts. It asks you to type `wipe`
before doing any of it unless `--yes` is given.

---

## Source builds and pre-releases

A source build fetches one tarball from the PostgreSQL mirror, so it needs an
exact version. The prompt asks the mirror what exists rather than guessing:

```
4) Which PostgreSQL version?
   Major version (16, 17, 18 or 19) [17]: 19
   A source build downloads an exact release tarball.
   Published for 19: 19beta1 19beta2 19beta3

   Exact version to build [19beta3]:
```

A major that has not reached release has only pre-releases — there is no
`19.0` to download — so `19beta3` is as exact as it gets and is accepted
everywhere a version is: it installs to `/opt/pgedge/pg19`, and version
comparisons order it correctly (`19beta1 < 19beta3 < 19.0`). A version the
mirror does not carry is refused at the prompt, and again before the download
on the host:

```
PostgreSQL 19.0 is not published at https://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/source/...
Available for 19: 19beta1, 19beta2, 19beta3 — the newest is 19beta3.
```

Without a network on the control machine the prompt accepts what you type and
the check on the host still catches it.

---

## Synchronous or asynchronous standbys

A standby replicates asynchronously by default: commits never wait, and a
failover can lose the last few. Synchronous replication holds each commit until
a standby confirms it, at the cost of a round trip per write. The deployment
asks once a standby is requested, and `--add-node --role standby` asks again for
that scope:

```
   Synchronous replication to the standby? (y/n) [n]: y
   How many standbys must confirm each commit [1]: 1
   Refuse writes when no standby is available? (y/n) [n]: n
```

or, without the prompts:

```bash
./pg_deploy_cluster.sh --nodes 2 --standby n1,n2 --sync-mode sync --sync-count 1
./pg_deploy_cluster.sh --add-node n1s1 --role standby --leader n1 --sync-mode sync
```

The answers become Patroni's own settings, in the DCS of the scope they apply
to:

```yaml
synchronous_mode: on          # off (default), on, or quorum
synchronous_node_count: 1     # standbys that must confirm each commit
synchronous_mode_strict: false
```

Patroni computes `synchronous_standby_names` from these — never set it by hand.

Three things worth knowing:

- **It is per scope.** Each Spock node leads its own Patroni scope, so the mode
  belongs to one node and its standbys. A scope with no standby is left
  asynchronous whatever you ask for: under `synchronous_mode_strict` such a
  scope would refuse writes forever.
- **Without `--sync-strict`, synchronous degrades to asynchronous** when no
  standby is available, so writes continue but are no longer guaranteed to be
  replicated. With it they block instead — durability over availability.
- **These live in the DCS, not in a file.** A new scope gets them from
  `bootstrap.dcs`; a running one is changed through `patronictl edit-config`,
  which is what `--add-node --role standby --sync-mode ...` does for you, after
  the standby is streaming.

`quorum` (Patroni's quorum-based commit, where any N of the standbys may
confirm) is accepted wherever `sync` is.

---

## Growing a running cluster

```bash
./pg_deploy_cluster.sh --add-node n3                        # asks role and version
./pg_deploy_cluster.sh --add-node n3 --role leader --pg-version 17.11
./pg_deploy_cluster.sh --add-node n1s1 --role standby --leader n1
./pg_deploy_cluster.sh --add-node n3 --host node-d --source n2
```

It asks two questions, unless the flags answer them:

**What should the node be?** A *Spock node* (`--role leader`) is a multi-master
peer: prepared, bootstrapped as the leader of its own Patroni scope, and
cross-wired to every existing node in both directions, so it accepts writes like
any other. A *standby* (`--role standby --leader n1`) is a physical replica of
one existing node, which Patroni can promote if that node fails; it never
replicates a different node's data, so the leader it follows must be a Spock
node.

**Which PostgreSQL version?** It defaults to the cluster's. A newer version is
allowed — Spock replicates logically, so a newer node can read an older peer's
stream — but an *older* one is refused, at the prompt and again before any
package is installed:

```
PostgreSQL 17.4 is older than the cluster's 17.11. A new node must run the
same version or newer — pass --pg-version 17.11 or later.
```

The same check runs against whatever is already installed on the target host, so
adding a node onto an existing machine running an older server fails before it
touches anything. A standby is not asked: a physical replica is a byte-for-byte
copy and runs its leader's version, so `--pg-version` is rejected there.

Binaries are found per major (`/usr/pgsql-18/bin`, or `/opt/pgedge/pg18/bin` for
a source build), so asking for a newer major on a host that already runs the
cluster's installs that major alongside the existing one rather than reusing it.
**Which Spock?** It defaults to the cluster's major, and a source-built cluster
also asks which branch or tag of [spock](https://github.com/pgEdge/spock) to
compile — defaulting to the branch that major is developed on (`v5_STABLE` for
spock50, `main` for spock60), or to the branch the cluster itself was built from
when the major is unchanged — useful for trying a fix or a release candidate on one node.

The zodan procedures come from the same branch as the node's Spock:
`samples/Z0DAN/zodan.sql` out of the source checkout when there is one, else
fetched from that branch on GitHub, else the copy bundled in
`configuration/spock` so an air-gapped host still works. A spock60 node
therefore loads zodan from `main` and a spock50 node from `v5_STABLE`, matching
the replication API those procedures call.

That pairing is what makes a **mixed-version add** work: a spock60 node can
join a spock50 cluster, because the zodan on `main` allows a new node to run
the same or a newer major.minor than every existing node — its sync worker can
read an older provider's stream, not the other way around. The reverse is
refused up front, as is any add where an existing node runs Spock older than
5.0.9. So a cluster migrates majors one node at a time; until the rest follow,
it is mixed, and the run says so. (The `v5_STABLE` zodan requires an exact
major.minor match, which is why the branch the script comes from matters.)

Spock lives inside a PostgreSQL prefix, so a node cannot change the Spock of a
prefix that running nodes are already using — give it its own `--pg-version`,
or take the cluster's Spock.

A source-built cluster compiles the major it needs: PostgreSQL and Spock are
built into `/opt/pgedge/pg<major>` alongside the existing installation, which
takes 20-40 minutes and leaves the other nodes untouched. That path needs an
exact version to fetch a tarball for, so `--pg-version 18` is refused where
`--pg-version 18.6` works. The cluster's own `PATH`, client symlinks, Patroni
and etcd stay pointed at its original major; only the new node uses the new
one, through its own `bin_dir`.

Every existing node's `pg_hba` and `.pgpass` learn about the newcomer and are
reloaded in place — the cluster stays up throughout.

`--host` takes a name from the inventory, including one the cluster has never
used: a machine that is not part of the cluster yet is prepared from scratch.
Without it the node lands on a host that has no Spock node, or — if they all do
— on the least loaded one, on its own port. `--source` picks the node the join
runs through (the first Spock node by default); it must be a Spock node, not a
standby.

This is the same operation as `./pg_cluster_ctl.sh node add`, which also lets
the name default to the next free `nN`.

## Tests

[![Regression](https://github.com/zaidshabbir25/postgres-cluster-deployment/actions/workflows/regression.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zaidshabbir25/postgres-cluster-deployment/actions/workflows/regression.yml)

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

Around 230 unit tests, two seconds, no machine touched: every module reaches
hosts through an executor, so a recording stand-in for it drives the whole
deployment and the tests assert on the commands that would have run. The shell
script is covered too — `tests/test_deploy_script.py` runs it with its `exec`
hand-offs stubbed, checking each prompt against the `deployment.cli` command
line it produces. See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md).

Every pull request runs the same suite on Python 3.9 (what Rocky 9 ships) and
3.12, checks the shell scripts parse and are intact, and imports every module —
see [.github/workflows/regression.yml](.github/workflows/regression.yml).

## Operating a deployed cluster

Deployment is `pg_deploy_cluster.sh`; everything afterwards is
`pg_cluster_ctl.sh`. It covers the same ground as the (now deprecated)
[pgEdge CLI](https://github.com/pgEdge/cli), reimplemented against
native-package clusters — see [pgEdge CLI parity](#pgedge-cli-parity) for the
command-by-command mapping.

```bash
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh --help              # the whole tree
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh <group> --help      # one group's commands
```

Add `--cluster NAME` to target a specific cluster (the most recently deployed
one is the default) and `--json` to any read-only command for machine output.

### node — membership and access

```bash
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh node list
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh node add --host node-d          # a new multi-master peer
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh node remove n3 --wipe-data
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh node command 'df -h /var' --on all
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh node command 'SELECT count(*) FROM orders' --sql --compare
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh node ssh n2                     # interactive shell
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh node psql n1                    # interactive psql
```

`node add` grows the mesh: the new node bootstraps into its own Patroni scope,
every existing node's `pg_hba` and `.pgpass` learn about it, and zodan's
`add_node` cross-wires it to all peers. Its schema and data arrive through the
source-to-new subscription, which zodan creates with `synchronize_structure` and
`synchronize_data` both true — no backup infrastructure involved. That differs
from the pgEdge CLI, which restored the new node from a pgBackRest physical
backup: logical sync needs nothing extra but is slower on a large dataset.

`node remove` detaches in both directions before deregistering — every peer
drops its subscription *from* the node and the node drops its subscriptions *to*
every peer. Dropping only one side leaves orphaned slots retaining WAL forever.
It also waits for the node's outbound replication to drain first, so writes made
on it are not lost; `--force` overrides that and says what it cost.

`node command --compare` groups nodes by identical output, which turns "run this
on six nodes" into a one-line answer when they agree and an obvious split when
they do not.

### spock — replication sets, subscriptions, DDL

```bash
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh spock sub-show-status            # across every node
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh spock lag
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh spock no-primary-key             # see the warning below
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh spock replication-begin          # add all tables to a repset
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh spock repset-add-table default public.orders
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh spock sub-resync-table sub_n1_n2 public.orders --truncate
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh spock replicate-ddl 'ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN note text'
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh spock sequence-convert           # to Snowflake sequences
```

> **Tables without a primary key.** Spock replicates `INSERT` for them but
> silently drops `UPDATE` and `DELETE` — there is no stable key to identify the
> row. This is the most common cause of a cluster that looks healthy and quietly
> diverges. `spock no-primary-key` lists them and exits non-zero, so it works as
> a CI gate.

> **Sequences.** Plain PostgreSQL sequences hand out the same values on every
> node, so a multi-master cluster generates colliding keys. `sequence-convert`
> moves them to Snowflake sequences, which embed a node id.

### db — databases, settings, read-only mode

```bash
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh db list
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh db tables                       # with PK status and sizes
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh db guc-show --pattern 'spock%'
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh db guc-set max_connections 200
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh db set-readonly on --all-nodes
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh db test-io                      # fio on the data directory
```

`guc-set` goes through `patronictl edit-config` by default, because Patroni
renders `postgresql.conf` from the DCS — an `ALTER SYSTEM` setting is reverted at
the next reload. Going through the DCS also applies the value to every member of
the scope, which is almost always what was meant. `--local-only` does it the
other way and says so.

Read-only mode is how you drain a node before maintenance without detaching it:
it keeps applying incoming replication (the apply worker is not subject to the
GUC) while refusing new local writes.

### service — Patroni, PostgreSQL and etcd

```bash
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh service status
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh service restart --node n1 --component postgres
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh service switchover --node n1
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh service logs --node n1 --lines 100
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh service reinit n1s1
```

You cannot stop PostgreSQL directly on a Patroni-managed node — Patroni owns the
postmaster and would treat it as a crash, restarting it or failing over. So
`--component postgres` routes restarts and reloads through `patronictl`, and
stopping postgres directly is refused with an explanation rather than attempted.

### package — the CLI's `um`, over dnf and apt

```bash
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh package list                    # per host, drift flagged
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh package upgrade
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh package install pgedge-snowflake_17
```

`package list` exits non-zero when versions differ between hosts. A cluster
where one node runs a different Spock build can fail in ways no single-node test
reproduces, so that is worth catching. `upgrade` installs the packages and then
tells you the restart is still outstanding — it does not restart anything behind
your back.

### app — workloads to exercise replication

```bash
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh app install --app pgbench --scale 10
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh app run --node n1 --clients 8 --duration 60
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh app counts                      # row counts per node
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh app concurrent-index public.orders customer_id
```

Only the first node is seeded; the others receive the data through replication,
which is a genuine end-to-end test that replication works. `pgbench_history` has
no primary key of its own, so a primary key is added after initialisation —
without it a pgbench run against a multi-master cluster diverges and the cause
is very hard to see.

`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` cannot run in a transaction, so Spock cannot
replicate it; `concurrent-index` issues it on every node directly.

### diff — do the nodes actually agree?

```bash
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh diff spock                      # replication metadata
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh diff repset                     # repset membership
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh diff schema                     # columns, indexes, constraints
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh diff table public.orders        # the data itself
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh diff all
./pg_cluster_ctl.sh diff repair public.orders --source n1
```

All four exit non-zero when they find a difference, so they work directly as CI
gates or monitoring checks.

`diff table` does not stream tables to the control machine. Each node hashes its
own rows into buckets keyed off the primary key, and only the bucket digests
cross the network — so comparing a 100M-row table costs a few dozen integers per
node. Buckets that disagree are then drilled into to name the individual keys:

```
Row counts:
  n1           1200
  n2           1201

  n2 only_on_node: 9999
  n2 different_values: 1001

2 finding(s):
  - n2: 1 of 64 buckets differ from n1 (1201 rows vs 1200)
  - n2: rows only on n1: 0, only on n2: 1, same key but different values: 1
```

A full-table hash would be simpler but can only answer "same or not" — it cannot
tell you which rows, which is the answer you actually need.

`diff repair` resyncs a table through Spock's own `sub_resync_table`, so the copy
goes over the existing subscription rather than a side channel. It **overwrites**
the target nodes' copy, and asks for confirmation before doing so. In a
multi-master cluster there is no authoritative node, so you choose the source.

## Dashboard

```bash
./pg_dashboard.sh                              # http://127.0.0.1:8080
./pg_dashboard.sh --port 9000 --interval 10 --cluster demo
```

Shows every node's Patroni role, whether it accepts writes, its Spock
subscription count, replication slots and retained WAL, plus etcd health and
per-host load, memory and disk.

Health collection walks every host over SSH, which takes seconds — far too slow
for a request. A background poller refreshes on the interval and the web layer
only ever serves the cached snapshot, so a browser refresh never blocks on SSH
and ten open tabs cost the same as one. A collection that fails after a good one
shows the last known state and says the refresh is failing, rather than blanking
the page.

## Reports and logs

Every run writes `reports/runs/<run-id>/`:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `report.html` | Self-contained page — no CDN, opens from a `file://` URL |
| `report.json` | The same data, for CI to assert on |
| `summary.txt` | The terminal recap, for when the run has scrolled away |

`reports/index.html` lists every run, newest first, and rebuilds itself — a
history of deployments accumulates with nobody maintaining it.

Logs live in `logs/<run-id>/`: `deploy.log` is the full transcript,
`<node>.log` is every command and its output for that node (this is where
zodan's very verbose cross-wiring output goes), and `steps.json` is the step
timeline, written incrementally so a run that dies still leaves a usable record.

Values that arrive from remote hosts — node names, package versions, command
output — are HTML-escaped, so nothing a host emits can inject markup into a page
you open. Passwords and SSH key paths are never written to a report, a state
file, or the dashboard API.

## Operational notes

### After a Patroni failover, retarget the peers

This is the one manual step, and it is inherent to combining Spock with Patroni
rather than a gap in the tooling.

When Patroni promotes `n1s1`, the Spock node identity `n1` stays the same but it
now answers on a **different address and port**. `n1`'s peers still hold the DSN
they were given at cross-wire time, so they keep replicating from an address
that is now a read-only replica. Spock has no VIP concept, so somebody has to
move them:

```bash
./pg_cluster_status.sh --cluster demo --repair-failover n1
```

That disables each peer's subscription to `n1`, adds an interface pointing at the
promoted address, switches the subscription to it and re-enables it. The status
output and the dashboard both flag the condition when they see a Spock node
reporting a non-leader Patroni role, so you are told before you have to go
looking.

### Version pins

`configuration/config<major>.env` records the versions a deployment expects.
These are reference points, not gates — the deployment installs whatever the
selected channel offers and records the result, so a report can answer "was this
run the same as last week's?". Change what gets installed with `--channel` or a
source build, not by editing a pin.

### output_plugin_libraries

PostgreSQL 16.15 / 17.11 / 18.5 / 19.0beta3 began requiring logical decoding
output plugins to be allow-listed before the server will load them. Spock's
`spock_output` is not in the default list, so on those releases every
cross-wired subscription fails until the GUC is set — and *older* point releases
refuse to start when it is present. The GUC is therefore gated on the server's
actual version, never applied unconditionally.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`sudo: a password is required`** — the inventory user needs passwordless sudo.
Every command runs through `sudo -n`.

**A node never becomes leader** — read `logs/<run-id>/<node>.log`, then
`journalctl -u patroni-<node>` on the host. The usual cause on a redeploy is
stale DCS state from a previous cluster with the same scope name; `--clean`
clears it.

**etcd has no quorum** — members must reach each other on 2380 and clients on
2379. Check the security group or firewall between hosts.

**Cross-wiring reports less than 100%** — the full zodan output is in
`logs/<run-id>/<node>.log`. A common cause is `dblink` missing, which means the
`contrib` package did not install.

**`Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock`** — handled: background apt timers are
stopped and the locks waited out during prerequisites. If it still appears,
something outside the deployment is holding dpkg.
