* TL;DR

anvil.el is a workbench for AI agents.  Optional modules (memory / orchestrator / session / http / …) each add their own tools when you enable them.
Claude Code, Codex CLI, Claude Desktop, GPT, local LLMs via Ollama — anything
that speaks [[https://modelcontextprotocol.io/][Model Context Protocol]] can edit files, navigate org-mode,
run elisp, query SQLite, and more *through Emacs primitives* instead
of generic =sed= / =grep= / =read-whole-file= round-trips.  That
swap is where the token savings come from.

v1.3.0 turns the 2026-05/06 develop line into a release: codebase
graph analysis in =anvil-defs=, structured mail tools for mu4e and
Wanderlust/Maildir, CAD DXF/SVG read/edit tools, fusion/long-run
evaluation helpers, and Headroom-style reversible context compression.
The older v1.0 architecture milestone still matters: anvil can run
through a normal Emacs daemon or through the NeLisp standalone runtime.

[[file:STORY.org][STORY.org]] ([[file:STORY.ja.org][日本語]]) tells the longer "why this exists" story.

* Current Release Highlights

The 2026-07 wave (post-v1.3.0, on master) adds a verified fusion stack
and a measured token-thrift layer — usage guide: [[file:docs/FUSION-GUIDE.org][docs/FUSION-GUIDE.org]]:

| Area | What changed |
|------+--------------|
| Verifier-grounded fusion | =anvil-fusion-verify= extracts contested claims from panel answers, checks them against a local KB (grep evidence + adversarial skeptic vote + mechanical checkers), and feeds verdicts to a judge that may not adopt refuted claims. Acceptance run: 0/10 hallucination adoptions; hard-task gold recall 79% (single) → 100% (fusion+verify). |
| Cascade router | =anvil-fusion-route-ask= answers once, risk-probes its own answer with a haiku-tier call, and escalates to panels only when risky — the 4-8x fusion multiplier is paid deliberately, not by default. |
| Execution verification | =anvil-fusion-exec= runs each candidate code patch in a disposable git worktree and gates on a check command; failing candidates are excluded from synthesis. |
| Plan fusion + agentic long-runs | =anvil-fusion-plan= merges implementation plans with repo-reality checks (files/APIs named by a plan must exist); long-run quests can execute distiller-flagged hard steps as panels (=:step-panel=) with a claim-verification gate between steps (=:verify-steps=). |
| Trajectory library | =anvil-fusion-traj= stores verified wins (admission gate: ≥1 confirmed claim, zero refuted) and prepends retrieved exemplars to future panel prompts — self-improvement without weight updates. |
| Token thrift (measured) | Per-tool volume telemetry (=metrics-token-report=), distilled test runs (=ert-run-distilled=, ~120-char results), diff-first re-reads (=file-read-delta=, ~126x smaller re-reads), search snippet clamps (~87% smaller), verdict cache + sequential skeptics, judge-input dedup, and an opt-in response budget with continuation fetch (=disclosure-fetch=). |

v1.3.0 highlights (previous wave):

| Area | What changed |
|------+--------------|
| Codebase graph | =anvil-defs= now indexes call edges for Elisp, Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript, traces caller/callee paths, detects blast radius from changed lines, and ranks architecture clusters. |
| Semantic retrieval | =anvil-semantic= now lands on develop/master as a local-first FTS5 search module with optional vector embeddings through ollama-local by default, plus opt-in Gemini/OpenAI providers. |
| Context compression | New =anvil-context= adds =context-compress= / =context-retrieve= / =context-stats= for JSON, diffs, logs, code excerpts, and prose. Raw text is stored by ccr-id so agents can recover exact context when needed. |
| Mail workflows | =anvil-mu4e= and =anvil-wl= expose structured read/search/compose/send surfaces over local mail stores. The WL path is Maildir-first and CJK-friendly; sends are gated. |
| CAD workflows | =anvil-cad= reads and edits ASCII DXF/SVG through a shared entity IR, with outline, extract, annotate, batch-update, and generate tools. |
| Long-running evaluation | The fusion modules add panel, async, long-run store, and MCP surfaces for comparing agent outputs and keeping only compact summaries in the parent context. |
| Client setup | README now documents both Claude Code and Codex CLI MCP registration, plus AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md guidance for compression tools. |

* Why does this save tokens?

LLM agents pay per token.  A naive =Read file → Edit file= loop
ships the whole file twice across the wire.  Anvil's primitives
operate on regions, headings, buffer state — only diffs cross.

| Scenario                                                | Reduction | What's happening                      |
|---------------------------------------------------------+-----------+----------------------------------------|
| Inserting/deleting one line in a large file             | *~90%+*   | No full-file Read+Write                |
| 3+ edits to the same file                               | *~70%*    | One round trip + atomic write          |
| Adding N key/value pairs to a JSON / config dictionary  | *~73%*    | i18n, feature flags, etc.              |
| Bulk-adding translations to TS/JS ={ ja: "..." }= data  | *~78%*    | Mapping JSON sent once                 |
| Extracting repeating structured records from huge files | *~50%*    | Legacy migration, ETL                  |
| Bulk docstring change across N files                    | *~60-80%* | All files in a single call             |

Numbers are measured; case studies in [[https://github.com/zawatton/anvil.el#efficiency--why-anvil-saves-ai-tokens][the Efficiency section]].
A typical refactoring session saves *15,000-25,000 tokens*.

#+end_example

The AI client speaks MCP to anvil.el.  anvil.el dispatches to a
running Emacs daemon (default — full feature set) or to the NeLisp
Rust runtime (=--no-emacs= path — smaller surface, no Emacs install
needed).

* Components

The anvil project is split across four repos so each part stays
small and has its own release cadence:

| Repo | Role | Required? |
|------+------+-----------|
| [[https://github.com/zawatton/anvil.el][anvil.el]]      | The AI brain — MCP server, ~40 tools by default (each optional module adds its own) | yes |
| [[https://github.com/zawatton/anvil-ide.el][anvil-ide.el]]  | Human IDE layer — treesit nav, dashboard, info-look | optional, Emacs users |
| [[https://github.com/zawatton/anvil-pkg][anvil-pkg]]     | Nix-backed pkg manager — lets the AI install its own dependencies | optional |
| [[https://github.com/zawatton/nelisp][NeLisp]]        | Rust runtime — runs Elisp without Emacs | optional, =--no-emacs= path |

* Installation

Pick a path based on what you want.

** Path A — no Emacs install required (NeLisp Rust runtime)

For users who want the MCP tool surface without an Emacs daemon —
CI runners, ephemeral containers, or "I don't use Emacs but want to
cut Claude Code / Codex CLI token use."

#+begin_src bash
# 1. Clone NeLisp + build the Rust runtime
git clone https://github.com/zawatton/nelisp.git
cd nelisp/nelisp-runtime
cargo build --release
cd ../..

# 2. Clone anvil.el (provides the Elisp source loaded by the runtime)
git clone https://github.com/zawatton/anvil.el.git

# 3. Run the MCP server (no Emacs daemon spawned)
ANVIL_EL_DIR="$(pwd)/anvil.el" \
  ./nelisp/bin/anvil mcp serve --no-emacs
#+end_src

The Rust binary reads + evaluates Elisp itself; the Emacs C core is
not invoked.  Surface today via this path: =file-*= / =shell-*= /
=data-*= / =anvil-host-*= / =directory-list= (42 tools).

** Path B — Emacs integrated (recommended for Emacs users)

For day-to-day Emacs users.  Pin to v1.3.0 via your favourite
package manager.

*** Quick install (one command)

#+begin_src bash
# Linux / macOS
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zawatton/anvil.el/master/install.sh | bash
#+end_src

#+begin_src powershell
# Windows
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zawatton/anvil.el/master/install.ps1 | iex
#+end_src

The installer auto-installs Emacs (=apt= / =dnf= / =brew= /
=winget=), clones the repo, starts the daemon, drops the MCP bridge
into =~/.emacs.d/=, and registers the server in =~/.claude.json=.
Add =--skip-emacs= (or =-SkipEmacs= on Windows) if Emacs is already
installed.

*** Manual via Emacs package manager

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; async-installer
(async-installer-git-add "https://github.com/zawatton/anvil.el.git"
                         :tag "v1.3.0"
                         :main "anvil.el")

;; or straight.el
(straight-use-package
 '(anvil :type git :host github :repo "zawatton/anvil.el"
         :branch "v1.3.0"))

;; or elpaca
(elpaca (anvil :host github :repo "zawatton/anvil.el"
               :ref "v1.3.0"))
#+end_src

After installing:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'anvil)
(anvil-enable)
(anvil-server-start)
#+end_src

** Path C — anvil-pkg for Nix-backed AI tooling (optional)

Lets the AI install its own system dependencies (=ripgrep=, =fd=,
language servers, anything in nixpkgs) via one Lisp form.  Requires
Nix on the host.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(async-installer-git-add "https://github.com/zawatton/anvil-pkg.git"
                         :main "anvil-pkg.el")
(require 'anvil-pkg)
(require 'anvil-pkg-dsl)        ; for `pkg-define' macro
(anvil-pkg-enable)              ; registers pkg-* MCP tools
#+end_src

Now the agent can call =(pkg-install "ripgrep")= or define custom
builds with =(pkg-define ...)=.  Repo: [[https://github.com/zawatton/anvil-pkg][zawatton/anvil-pkg]].

** Path D — anvil-ide.el for the Emacs IDE layer (optional)

Adds the human-side IDE features (treesit navigation, the worker
dashboard, =info-lookup-symbol=).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(async-installer-git-add "https://github.com/zawatton/anvil-ide.el.git"
                         :main "anvil-ide.el")
(require 'anvil-ide)
#+end_src

Repo: [[https://github.com/zawatton/anvil-ide.el][zawatton/anvil-ide.el]].

* Quick Start

After installing via Path B:

1. Start the daemon — ~M-x anvil-enable~ then ~M-x anvil-server-start~
2. Print the MCP config snippet — ~M-x anvil-describe-setup~
3. Paste the snippet into =~/.claude.json= (or your client's MCP
   config file)
4. Restart your AI client; you should see =anvil-*= tools in its
   tool-list

Full walkthrough including Claude Code / Claude Desktop config:
[[file:docs/QUICKSTART.org][docs/QUICKSTART.org]].

* Why anvil?

- *LLM-agnostic* — works with any MCP-compatible client
- *Token-efficient* — primitives operate on regions, headings,
  buffer state, not whole files
- *Multi-agent coordination* — fan out to five AI CLIs in parallel
  with consensus and a meta-LLM judge, all from inside Emacs
- *Safe by design* — long-running tasks dispatched to a background
  Emacs, so the interactive Emacs is never blocked
- *Org-mode native* — first-class org read / write / refactor
- *Large file safe* — handles 1.2 MB+ files without truncation
- *Cross-platform* — Linux, macOS, Windows, WSL
- *Modular* — load only what you need, extend with your own modules

* For non-Emacs users — what setup costs you

Anvil runs in the background as an MCP server.  Your day-to-day
editor (VSCode / Cursor / Neovim / Claude Code / Codex CLI itself) does not
change.

#+begin_example
  AI client ──MCP──▶ Anvil (Emacs daemon, headless) ──▶ file ops
  (VSCode / Cursor /                                    (only diffs cross)
   Claude Code / Codex CLI, …)
#+end_example

You don't have to open an Emacs window or write =init.el=.

*Honest costs:*

- *15-30 minutes of first-time setup* on Path B (install Emacs,
  clone anvil, wire up MCP) — or zero on Path A (no Emacs at all)
- *Resident memory* — Path B keeps an Emacs daemon at ~50-200 MB
  idle; Path A's Rust runtime stays under ~50 MB
- *One more dependency to maintain* — Emacs updates and OS
  migrations include it (Path B only)

For 30+ minute agent sessions a few times a month, the one-time
setup pays itself back almost immediately via the token savings
above.

* Feature Highlights

Anvil's default install exposes *~40 MCP tools* (=anvil.el= core modules).  Each optional module you enable adds its own tools — anvil-memory ~22, anvil-orchestrator ~23, anvil-http ~9, anvil-defs ~7, anvil-session ~6, etc.  Pick what you actually want; you don't have to load everything
(=anvil.el= core + the [[https://github.com/zawatton/anvil-ide.el][anvil-ide.el]] split + the [[https://github.com/zawatton/anvil-pkg][anvil-pkg]]
sister package).  Highlights:

| Capability | What it does |
|------------+--------------|
| =bin/anvil mcp serve --no-emacs= (v1.0) | *Standalone path — no Emacs install required.*  The =anvil-runtime= Rust binary reads + evaluates Elisp and serves anvil's MCP tools over stdio.  Existing Emacs users keep =bin/anvil mcp serve= unchanged |
| =anvil-pkg= (v1.0) | Elisp-DSL package manager backed by the Nix store.  =(pkg-install "ripgrep")= for nixpkgs attributes; =(pkg-define …)= macro for custom builds (=stdenv= / =rust= / =python= / =go= / =emacs-package= build systems).  Same idea as Guix in Scheme — but in Elisp, integrated with anvil's MCP surface so an AI agent can install its own dependencies in one Lisp form.  Lives in [[https://github.com/zawatton/anvil-pkg][zawatton/anvil-pkg]] |
| =anvil-ide.el= split (v1.0) | Emacs-only IDE layer (treesit nav, =worker-ui= dashboard, =info-lookup-symbol=) moved out to [[https://github.com/zawatton/anvil-ide.el][zawatton/anvil-ide.el]].  Install both for the original feature set; install only =anvil.el= if you want the AI-side workbench without the human IDE surface |
| Treesit subprocess fallback (v1.0) | Doc 38 Phase F + G — =anvil-ts= / =-js= / =-py= structural ops keep working on hosts without an Emacs tree-sitter (e.g. NeLisp standalone) via Python =ast= / acorn subprocess fallback.  Token-efficient AST queries preserved on the Rust substrate |
| =anvil-orchestrator= | Fan out one prompt to up to five AI CLIs (=claude= / =aider= / =gemini= / =ollama= / =codex=) in parallel. Jaccard consensus + meta-LLM judge + DAG dependencies + =anvil-cron= integration for nightly PDCA loops |
| =anvil-memory= (v0.4.0 + 2026-05) | Auto-memory engine with Bayesian TTL + FTS5 full-text search.  Scans multi-provider =.md= memories, supports DB-primary =memory-add= / =memory-get= / =memory-export-md=, WHISPER session deltas, contradiction scans, static HTML export, and review-only memory harvesting.  Designed for one per-machine SQLite DB plus text export, not binary DB merges |
| =anvil-memory-bridge= (2026-05) | Local JSON bridge in front of =anvil-memory= and =anvil-worklog=.  Adds read/write memory endpoints, event stream, read-replica pull, worklog search/list/get endpoints, configured-origin CORS, a side-load browser extension for Claude.ai / ChatGPT / Gemini, and a static mobile thin client with offline save queue |
| =anvil-autoresearch= (2026-05) | Safe self-improvement primitives: scan local Web/X/YouTube/design notes for implementation candidates, rank weak MCP docstrings, propose / harvest / apply descriptions behind eval+holdout gates, route provider-mapping experiments through the orchestrator, scaffold NeLisp Phase 47 codegen tasks, and watch progress in a tabulated-list dashboard |
| =anvil-defs= codebase graph (v1.3.0) | SQLite-backed definitions, references, call graph, change detection, trace path, callers/callees ranking, dead-code hints, and architecture clustering across Elisp / Python / JS / TS projects |
| =anvil-semantic= (v1.3.0) | Local-first semantic retrieval over org/text/code.  FTS5 + CJK LIKE fallback stay fully local; optional =semantic-embed-index= adds cosine retrieval using ollama-local by default or opt-in Gemini/OpenAI providers |
| =anvil-context= (v1.3.0) | Headroom-inspired reversible context compression.  Compress JSON / diff / log / code / prose before handing it back to the model; retrieve raw context later by =ccr-id= when exact wording matters |
| =anvil-mu4e= / =anvil-wl= (v1.3.0) | Structured mail tools for local mu4e and Wanderlust/Maildir workflows.  Read/search/compose surfaces are structured; send tools are gated so agent-driven mail cannot transmit silently |
| =anvil-cad= (v1.3.0) | DXF/SVG outline, extract, annotate, batch-update, and generate tools through a format-agnostic entity IR |
| =anvil-fusion= stack (2026-07) | Verified multi-model answers: named panels (=opus-solo= / =claude-pair= / =sovereign=), claim extraction + KB/skeptic/execution verification, a judge barred from adopting refuted claims, cascade routing, plan fusion, panelized long-run steps with inter-step verify gates, and a verified-trajectory exemplar library.  Usage: [[file:docs/FUSION-GUIDE.org][docs/FUSION-GUIDE.org]] |
| =anvil-tools-by-intent= + =anvil-manifest= (v0.4.0 + 2026-05) | Intent-based tool discovery plus =ANVIL_PROFILE= filter.  The 2026-05 update adds Tool Attention: dynamic query-based ranking, optional embedding backends, state preconditions, schema trimming, warm LRU full-schema retention, recovery suggestions, and a Doc43 bridge for docstring rewrite candidates |
| =anvil-worklog= (2026-05) | SQLite-backed AI worklog index.  Old org logs can be scanned, new entries are DB-primary via =worklog-add=, and bridge endpoints expose read-only search/list/get to other AI clients.  The DB handle self-recovers after file replacement/unlink events and uses short write transactions for =worklog-add= |
| =anvil-claude-watchdog= (2026-05) | Linux procfs/jsonl watchdog for Claude Code TUI hangs.  Detects State=R stalls and the State=S spinner/MCP-child-IO variant, records events, notifies the desktop, and offers confirmation-gated manual recovery via =claude --resume= staged in tmux |
| =anvil-sexp= / =sexp-cst= / =py= / =ts= / =js= (v0.4.0) | Language-aware structural edits.  Reader-based Elisp edits, tree-sitter CST for Python / TypeScript / TSX / JavaScript — AST-level refactors without touching whole files |
| =anvil-session= + Claude Code hooks (v0.4.0) | Session snapshot / resume + 5 lifecycle hooks (PreCompact / SessionStart / PostToolUse / UserPromptSubmit / SessionEnd).  Captures branch + task summary with 14-day TTL so session restarts don't re-cold |
| =anvil-shell-filter= (v0.4.0) | Shell output compression — 20 bundled filters for git / rg / pytest / ert-batch / docker-logs etc.  Raw output stashed with TTL so callers can still recover full text when needed |
| =file-batch= | Apply multiple edits to the same file atomically in one round trip (up to ~90% token reduction) |
| =org-read-outline= / =org-read-headline= | Read just the headings or a single subtree, even on a 13,000-line org. No full-file read needed |
| =anvil-worker= | Dispatch long-running tasks (OCR, PDF conversion, batch file scans) to a separate background Emacs. The interactive Emacs never freezes |
| Large org file editing | Edit org files of 1.2 MB or more without truncation (avoids the Windows file-mount issue) |
| LLM client agnostic | Claude Code / Codex CLI / Claude Desktop / GPT / local LLMs via Ollama — all speak through MCP |
| =anvil-modes-allow-buffer-modify= | Configure major modes where Anvil tools modify live buffers directly rather than visiting files, preserving unsaved changes. |

* Architecture α — NeLisp delegate active

Several anvil modules now delegate their core helpers to NeLisp
when available (=fboundp= guard + fallback for standalone usage).
Modules ported as of 2026-04-25 architecture α:

- =anvil-http= — 25 helpers (~467 LOC) delegate to =nelisp-http=
- =anvil-state= — 5 pure helpers delegate to =nelisp-state=
- =anvil-defs= — SQLite Elisp index delegates to =nelisp-defs-index=
  (Doc 25)
- =anvil-org-index= — 2 functions delegate to =nelisp-org-index=
  (Doc 26)

Total ≈ 37 helpers / ~573 LOC delegated.  Behaviour with NeLisp
absent is unchanged (tests cover both paths).

* Efficiency — why Anvil saves AI tokens

LLM agents pay per token, and every Read/Edit round trip costs
both bytes on the wire and orchestration overhead. Anvil's tools
are designed to keep the agent's context budget free for reasoning,
not bookkeeping.

** Orchestrator measurements (v0.3.0, 2026-04-19)

First publishable numbers from [[file:benchmarks/][=benchmarks/=]]
— one production daemon on Debian 13, n=1 per cell, scenario S1
(recursive fibonacci via =claude-haiku-4-5= / =codex-gpt-5.4= /
=ollama-llama3.2:3b=).  Reproduce with the checked-in harness.

| Condition                                              | Wall   | Cost   |
|--------------------------------------------------------+--------+--------|
| Solo =claude-haiku=                                    | 14.2 s | $0.030 |
| 3× =claude-haiku= in parallel                          | 15.1 s | $0.087 |
| 3-way consensus (claude + codex + ollama)              | 12.5 s | $0.029 |
| 3-way consensus + meta-LLM judge                       | 34.6 s | $0.041 |

Three parallel Claude tasks finish in *1.07×* the solo-task
wallclock — the orchestrator's pool dispatches them concurrently
with near-zero overhead.  A three-provider fan-out with consensus
is *both faster and cheaper than three Claudes* on the same
prompt: the codex (ChatGPT Plus OAuth) and ollama (local) calls
have no per-token cost, and the pool overlaps the slowest.

Codex on Plus scaled to *eight concurrent* requests with zero 429s
on this account; the concurrency ramp (levels 1 / 3 / 6 / 8 @
5.5 s / 6.6 s / 9.8 s / 6.8 s wallclock) is in the same CSV.
Full methodology and caveats in
[[file:benchmarks/results/report-2026-04-19.org][benchmarks/results/report-2026-04-19.org]].

** Manifest profile — session-prompt manifest cost (v0.4.0)

Doc 26 =anvil-manifest= lets each client connect under a virtual
server-id (=emacs-eval-ultra= / =-nav= / =-core= / =-agent= / =-edit=)
that filters the =tools/list= response.  Handlers stay live — hidden
tools are still callable via explicit =tools/call= — but the
manifest prelude that Claude Code parses at session start shrinks:

| Profile | Advertised tools | Approx tokens | Use case                             |
|---------+------------------+---------------+---------------------------------------|
| =full=  | 198              | ~20,400       | All capabilities                      |

Measure your own profile cost at any time via the =manifest-cost=
MCP tool (returns ={:profile :advertised-count :registered-count
:approx-tokens}=).

The 2026-05 update extends this into a Tool Attention layer.  Set
=ANVIL_PROFILE=dynamic= and optionally =ANVIL_ATTENTION_QUERY= to
rank tools by the current intent; tools whose =:preconditions= do
not match =ANVIL_STATE_TAGS= are filtered out.  When schema trimming
is enabled, only the Top-K focused tools, manifest self-tools, and
recent warm-LRU tools keep full schemas; the rest advertise compact
name/type-only schemas.  =manifest-recovery-suggest= explains why a
tool is hidden or unfocused, and =manifest-docstring-candidates=
hands weak descriptions to Doc43 autoresearch.

*Orchestrator child sessions* (Doc 26 Phase 1b, extended in Doc 34
Phase B) auto-inject =--mcp-config= pointing at =emacs-eval-PROFILE=
when =anvil-orchestrator-manifest-profile= is set.  Typical benefit:
a 20-provider consensus run with 200 total child sessions on
=full= spends ~4 M tokens just advertising tools; the same run
on =ultra= spends ~550 k — *~87% reduction on manifest alone*,
before the agent says a word.

** Operate on regions, not whole files

Generic file tools force a Read-then-Edit pattern that ships the
whole file each time. Anvil exposes targeted operations that send
only the delta:

| Task | Generic flow | Anvil flow |
|------+--------------+------------|
| Replace one string in a 1.2 MB org file | Read 1.2 MB → Edit (sends old + new) | =anvil-file-replace-string= (pattern + replacement only) |
| Read one heading from a 30k-line =init.org= | Read & paginate | =anvil-org-read-headline= (subtree only) |
| Insert near the end of a large file | Read whole file → rewrite | =anvil-file-insert-at-line= (delta only) |

For org-mode refactors specifically, MCP-backed operations
(section move, refile, split) run *10–20× cheaper in tokens* than
their Read + Write equivalents.

** Batch edits into one round trip

When an agent makes several edits to the same file, each becomes a
separate tool call with its own request/schema/response overhead.
=anvil-file-batch= applies a vector of edits in a single
transaction — *up to ~90% token reduction* versus issuing the
edits one at a time.

** Web fetch caching (anvil-http + anvil-browser)

=anvil-http-get= and =anvil-browser= ship with an in-process
TTL cache keyed on URL + auth preset.  Measurement
([[file:benchmarks/results/http-browser-report-2026-04-19.org][=http-browser-report-2026-04-19.org=]]):
within the default TTL, *second and subsequent fetches cost 0–2 ms
wallclock and send zero bytes over the network* — the response
plist's =:from-cache= is =t=.  An agent that fetches the same
docs page / GitHub PR / Wikipedia article twice during a session
pays for it exactly once.

=anvil-browser= returns an accessibility-tree snapshot instead
of raw HTML, which shrinks the payload for rendered pages.
Measured on four URLs:

| URL                             | http bytes | browser bytes | reduction |
|---------------------------------+-----------:+--------------:+----------:|
| =en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs=   |    276 082 |        25 122 |    11.0×  |
| =news.ycombinator.com/=         |     35 098 |        13 597 |     2.6×  |
| =example.com/=                  |        528 |            73 |     7.2×  |

Raw-text endpoints (e.g. =raw.githubusercontent.com/…/README=)
degenerate to a placeholder snapshot; use =anvil-http-get= for
those, not browser.  Smaller payload means smaller prompt when
the agent quotes the fetch back to the LLM.

** Heavy work runs out of band

Slow operations (large tangles, full-tree org scans, byte-compile)
are dispatched to a worker daemon pool so the agent's main
connection stays responsive.

Measured impact: =org-babel-tangle= on a ~1 MB =init.org= runs
~30 s in-process but ~2 s when worker-dispatched — *~15× faster
end-to-end*, and the agent's main session is never blocked.

** Scales to large org databases

Naïve approaches that walk a temp buffer time out on org files
past ~50 KB inside an MCP request. Anvil's org tools use streaming
regex scanners, so heading lookups and outline reads stay fast on
multi-megabyte org trees (the kind of monolithic =init.org= or
journal file power users actually maintain).

** Standalone runtime — no Emacs daemon startup cost (v1.0)

NeLisp Doc 44 ships =bin/anvil mcp serve --no-emacs=, which spawns
the =anvil-runtime= Rust binary instead of an Emacs daemon.  For
short-lived MCP sessions (CI runs, one-shot agent dispatches,
ephemeral containers), this skips Emacs's daemon cold-start
entirely and keeps the resident process much smaller than a
fully-loaded Emacs daemon.

Architecture α (anvil-http / anvil-state / anvil-defs /
anvil-org-index delegating their core helpers to NeLisp via
=fboundp= guard + fallback) makes the same MCP tool surface
reachable from either substrate:

| Deployment    | Tool surface                                    |
|---------------+--------------------------------------------------|
| Bundled-Emacs | full =anvil.el= + =anvil-ide.el=                |
| Rust-only     | full =anvil.el= (IDE via subprocess fallback)    |

Existing Emacs users keep =bin/anvil mcp serve= as before.
Containers / ephemeral runners / "I just want the AI workbench
without learning Emacs" users get the same MCP tools through the
Rust path with no =apt install emacs= step.

** Case study: TypeScript refactoring at scale

Anvil isn't just theory, and it isn't org-mode-only. It was
validated on a real large-scale TypeScript migration project —
the [[https://github.com/zawatton/newDTW.github.io][newDTW]] repository, which ports a decompiled HSP application
to TypeScript:

- *16,000+* lines of TypeScript across *1,400+* modules
- Massive type-definition files (thousands of lines) tightly
  coupled with implementation files
- High frequency of multi-point edits within the same file

The same Anvil tools that help with org-mode delivered
measurable wins here too.

*** =anvil-file-batch= — multiple edits to one file

TypeScript refactoring routinely means several simultaneous
edits to one file: adding imports, modifying type defs,
replacing implementation, renaming methods.

Measured: 6 edits to a 130-line source file.

| Method                | Tokens   | Round trips |
|-----------------------+----------+-------------|
| Generic =Edit= ×6     | ~4,800   | 6           |
| =anvil-file-batch=    | ~1,500   | 1           |
| Reduction             | *~70%*   | *83%*       |

*** =anvil-file-replace-regexp= — bulk type/identifier renames

Tasks like changing =Promise<T>= → =AsyncResult<T>= across the
codebase, or renaming a globally-used variable, finish in *one
command*. The conventional flow (grep across hundreds of files,
read each, edit individually) is many round trips of the same
mechanical work.

*** =anvil-file-insert-at-line= / =-delete-lines= — localized ops on large files

Use case: adding a single field to a 4,000+ line type-definition
file, or to a global state interface.

| Method                       | Tokens     |
|------------------------------+------------|
| Read full file + Edit        | thousands  |
| =anvil-file-insert-at-line=  | tens       |
| Reduction                    | *~90%+*    |

*** =anvil-json-object-add= — i18n & config dictionaries

For workflows that append many key/value pairs to a JSON object
(language dictionaries, feature flags, configuration maps), the
generic =Edit= tool requires a long anchor string in every
round trip.

Measured: adding ~200 i18n keys in batches of 40.

| Method                       | Tokens   | Calls |
|------------------------------+----------+-------|
| Generic =Edit= ×5            | ~30,000  | 5     |
| =anvil-json-object-add= ×5   | ~8,000   | 5     |
| Reduction                    | *~73%*   | 0     |

Handles trailing commas, closing-brace placement, indent
detection, and duplicate-key policy automatically.

*** =anvil-file-ensure-import= — idempotent import insertion

Adding =import= lines across many source files is one of the
most repetitive edit patterns. =file-ensure-import= checks
whether the line is already present and inserts after the last
matching header line only if needed. Works with any
=:after-regex= so it applies equally to Emacs =(require ...)=
blocks.

*** =anvil-file-batch-across= — coordinated multi-file edits

For a refactor that touches N files in similar ways (docstring
updates, renames, import additions), pair this with
=file-batch='s per-file op lists to complete the whole
refactor in one MCP call.

*** =anvil-code-extract-pattern= — structured data extraction from huge files (read-only)

For legacy data extraction and ETL, the usual flow is "read the
whole file then assemble with regex." This tool replaces that
with a single MCP call. =:block-start= matches each block header,
=:block-end= picks the closing strategy (=brace-balance= skips
braces inside strings), =:fields= regexps capture per-field
values; the result comes back as a list of plain-data records.
For =brace-balance=, =:block-start= should stop before the opening
={=; the matcher then finds that brace and balances from there.
The file body itself is never sent back to the agent.

Measured: extracted 347 item definitions from =func492.ts= in
newDTW (3,407 lines of legacy if-blocks).

| Method                              | Tokens         |
|-------------------------------------+----------------|
| Whole-file Read + extractor script  | ~8,000 + α     |
| =anvil-code-extract-pattern= ×1     | ~3,000-5,000   |
| Reduction                           | *~50%*         |

Useful anywhere repeating structured text appears: legacy
migrations, data migrations, i18n inventories.

*** =anvil-code-add-field-by-map= — bulk field add to TS/JS object literals

For i18n-style work — "add =add-key: \"...\"= to every
={lookup-key: \"...\"}= in the same file" — this collapses the
whole loop into a single call that takes only a mapping JSON.
Default is dry-run (=:apply= defaults to nil), so the typical
flow is: preview first, then re-call with =:apply t= to write —
two-step safety with no extra plumbing.

Measured: 8 data files in newDTW (25-100 entries each), adding
=en= translations.

| Method                                            | Tokens   |
|---------------------------------------------------+----------|
| Per-file Read + full-rewrite Write                | ~16,000  |
| =anvil-code-add-field-by-map= (mapping only)      | ~3,200   |
| Reduction                                         | *~78%*   |

Existing add-key handling is governed by =:on-existing= (default
=error= for fail-loud), preventing silent overwrites.

*** Why TypeScript benefits especially

| TypeScript characteristic                       | Why Anvil helps                                  |
|-------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------|
| Type defs + implementations coexist in one file | Many edits per file → =file-batch= shines        |
| Massive type-definition files                   | Localized ops avoid full-file reads              |
| Frequent import additions                       | =file-insert-at-line= handles routine insertion  |
| Global state interfaces                         | Field additions follow patterns, easy to script  |
| Legacy if-block / switch extraction             | =code-extract-pattern= removes the full-file read |
| Bulk i18n translations on object literals       | =code-add-field-by-map= folds it into one mapping |

Per refactoring session in newDTW, the cumulative saving was
*15,000 to 25,000 tokens* (after =code-extract-pattern= and
=code-add-field-by-map= landed) — context the agent then
spent on actual reasoning instead of file-shuttling.

** When to reach for Anvil

| Scenario                                      | Anvil benefit                       |
|-----------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------|
| 3+ edits within the same file                 | ◎ Major token reduction             |
| Localized additions to large files            | ◎ Avoids full-file Read             |
| Bulk renames (types, identifiers)             | ◎ Completes in one command          |
| Adding imports / type fields                  | ○ Fewer round trips                 |
| Heavy Emacs ops during agent work             | ◎ Worker dispatch (~15× faster)     |
| Creating new files from scratch               | △ Generic =Write= is fine           |
| File or repository exploration                | × Glob / Grep are better fits       |

** What this looks like in practice

A typical agent session that touches a large config file, refactors
a few org headings, and runs a tangle would otherwise be dominated
by file-shuttling overhead. With Anvil:

- Each edit ships only the *changed bytes*, not the file.
- Multi-step refactors collapse into *one* batched call.
- Slow Emacs ops execute in a *worker*, not the agent's thread.

The result is more useful work per token — the agent's context
budget goes to reasoning about your code, not re-reading it.

** Buffer-first editing — anvil-modes-allow-buffer-modify

By default, anvil's org-modifying tools (update-todo-state, add-todo,
rename-headline, edit-body) use a *disk-first* policy: they read
the file into a temporary buffer, apply the edit, write the result
to disk, and refresh any visiting buffers.  If any buffer has unsaved
modifications, the operation is refused — anvil will not clobber
your in-progress edits.

When =anvil-modes-allow-buffer-modify= is set to a list of major
modes, anvil switches to a *buffer-first* policy for files whose
open buffers match one of those modes:

1. Locate the first buffer visiting the file (following indirect
   buffers to their base buffer).
2. Note whether the buffer already has unsaved modifications.
3. Make the edit directly in the live buffer.
4. Only save the buffer if it did *not* have unsaved modifications
   before the edit — preserving any in-progress user work.

This means an AI agent and a human can collaborate on the same
file without the agent forcing a save that would commit half-finished
edits.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Enable buffer-first editing for org files only
(setq anvil-modes-allow-buffer-modify '(org-mode))

;; Or enable it for every open buffer (fundamental-mode is a
;; special case that matches any major mode)
(setq anvil-modes-allow-buffer-modify '(fundamental-mode))

** User config — Emacs vs NeLisp standalone

Two entry paths, two config locations:

| Entry path                                | Config source                |
|-------------------------------------------+------------------------------|
| Emacs (~emacs --daemon~ + ~emacsclient~)  | your existing ~init.el~      |
| NeLisp standalone (~bin/anvil mcp serve~) | ~$ANVIL_CONFIG_DIR/config.el~ |

Under regular Emacs nothing changes — keep putting your =setq=
overrides in =init.el=.  Under the NeLisp standalone path (= the
Rust =anvil-runtime= binary spawned by =bin/anvil=, no =init.el= to
read) anvil resolves a config file from these env vars in order:

1. =$ANVIL_CONFIG_DIR=
2. =$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/anvil=  (XDG default)
3. =~/.config/anvil=          (POSIX fallback)

The file inside that directory is always =config.el=.  Missing file
is silent (= optional).  Parse / eval failure is surfaced via
=display-warning= but never aborts the MCP server — a broken user
config must not wedge bootstrap.

Example =~/.config/anvil/config.el=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Codex tasks need write access for any non-trivial dispatch.
(setq anvil-orchestrator-codex-sandbox "workspace-write")
;; Truncate gain summary lines aggressively.
(setq anvil-shell-filter-default-truncate-lines-at 200)
#+end_src

The branch on which path is in effect is fully automatic — anvil
detects it via =(featurep 'nelisp)= which is true only after the
NeLisp interpreter bootstrap.  See =anvil-config.el= for the
implementation.

** Browser module (optional)

The =browser= module wraps the [[https://agent-browser.dev/][agent-browser]] CLI so an MCP
client can fetch an accessibility-tree snapshot of a page in a
single tool call (typically 25× fewer tokens than a raw DOM dump).

#+begin_src shell
npm install -g agent-browser
agent-browser install   # downloads Chrome for Testing if needed
#+end_src

Then add =browser= to =anvil-optional-modules= as shown above. The
registered tools are =browser-fetch=, =browser-interact=,
=browser-capture=, =browser-screenshot=, and =browser-close=.  Captured
pages go to =anvil-browser-capture-dir= (defcustom). Same-URL
fetches within =anvil-browser-cache-ttl-sec= seconds (default 300)
are served from the in-memory cache.

On Windows, the agent-browser Rust binary is occasionally flagged
by Defender; whitelist =%APPDATA%\npm\node_modules\agent-browser\bin\=
if you hit that.

** Orchestrator module (optional)

The =orchestrator= module spawns several agentic AI CLI subprocesses
in parallel and exposes a terse submit / status / collect API, so the
parent Claude session only spends context on task ids and final
summaries — not on the intermediate tool calls each sub-task makes.

Add =orchestrator= to =anvil-optional-modules=.  The registered tools
are:

- =orchestrator-submit= — queue a batch of tasks (JSON array); each
  task is a plist with =name=, =provider=, =prompt= (plus optional
  =model=, =budget_usd=, =timeout_sec=, …).  Returns a batch id
  without blocking.
- =orchestrator-status= — return counts + slim per-task plist for a
  batch (or a single task).
- =orchestrator-collect= — return the list of slim task results for a
  batch; with =wait="t"= blocks until every task is terminal.
- =orchestrator-cancel= — SIGTERM / SIGKILL a running or queued task.
- =orchestrator-retry= — re-submit a task under a new id.

Phase 1a ships the =claude= provider (hard dependency on the
=claude= CLI on =exec-path=).  Phase 2 adds the =aider= provider —
use =:provider 'aider= with =:model "<vendor>/<model>"= (e.g.
=openai/gpt-4o-mini=, =anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-latest=,
=gemini/gemini-2.0-flash=, =ollama/llama3=) to route a single
=aider --message= shot through the multi-vendor aider CLI.
gemini / ollama native adapters land in Phase 3+.  Concurrency caps
(=anvil-orchestrator-concurrency=,
=anvil-orchestrator-per-provider-concurrency=) protect against
draining a Claude MAX plan's 5-hour window; the default is 3 global
and 3 per-provider.

=M-x anvil-orchestrator-dashboard= opens a =tabulated-list= view of
every task: keys =g= refresh, =RET= open stdout file, =k= cancel,
=r= retry.

Task state is persisted to =anvil-state= (ns=orchestrator) so the
queue survives a daemon restart.  Running tasks at shutdown are
marked =failed= with a clear error on reload, since the OS pids no
longer belong to Emacs.

Phase 1b adds:

- *Git worktree isolation*.  When a task's =:cwd= is inside a git
  repo and =anvil-orchestrator-worktree-auto= is on (default), the
  claude provider receives =--worktree NAME= so N parallel tasks
  never stomp on the same working tree.  Providers without native
  worktree support fall back to an =anvil-git worktree add= under
  =anvil-orchestrator-work-dir/worktrees/=; =:cwd= is rewritten to
  that path before spawn.  Opt out per task with =:no-worktree t=.
- *DAG scheduling*.  A task may name sibling-in-batch dependencies
  via =:depends-on ("other-name" …)=.  The pool only starts a task
  once every dep has reached =done=; if any dep =failed= or
  =cancelled=, dependents are flipped to =failed= with a
  "dependency X did not succeed" error.  Batch-level cycle and
  unknown-name detection happens at submit time.
- *stdout / stderr overflow*.  Per-task output files over
  =anvil-orchestrator-output-size-cap= (default 1 MB) are rewritten
  as =head 256 KB= + truncation marker + =tail 256 KB=; the
  original byte count survives on the task record as
  =:stdout-bytes-original= so the dashboard and the parent session
  can see that a log was slimmed down.

Phase 2 adds:

- *aider provider*.  =:provider 'aider= routes the prompt through
  =aider --message --yes-always --no-stream --no-check-update= with
  the target model selected by =:model=.  Optional task fields:
  =:files= (positional args aider is allowed to edit),
  =:read-only-files= (become =--read FILE= pairs),
  =:subtree-only=, =:no-auto-commits=.  The parser extracts the
  last =Commit <sha>= line into =:commit-sha= and the trailing
  non-diff paragraph into =:summary=.  Since aider has no native
  worktree flag, anvil creates a =git worktree add= under
  =anvil-orchestrator-work-dir/worktrees/= and rewrites =:cwd=
  before spawn (same fallback path Phase 1b uses for every
  non-claude provider).  Persistent extra flags go in
  =anvil-orchestrator-aider-extra-args=.

- *Scheduled batches via anvil-cron*.  Register a dispatcher
  function that calls =anvil-orchestrator-submit=, then schedule
  it with =anvil-cron-register :time "02:00"= for autonomous
  overnight runs.  See =examples/nightly-orchestrator.org= for
  four end-to-end patterns (dispatch-only, dispatch-then-collect,
  hook-based batch-id logging, multi-provider mix) and the
  worker-vs-main-daemon trade-off.

Requires Emacs 29+ (via =anvil-state=).

** Autoresearch module (optional)

=anvil-autoresearch= is the safe, review-gated version of the
"agent improves itself" loop.  It does not run unbounded experiments
on its own.  Instead, it provides small MCP primitives that make each
step inspectable:

- =autoresearch-scan= — rank implementation candidates from local
  Web/X/YouTube summaries and =docs/design=.
- =autoresearch-docstrings= / =-plan= / =-patch= — find weak MCP tool
  descriptions and produce dry-run rewrite candidates.
- =autoresearch-docstring-apply= / =-run= / =-harvest= — apply
  reviewed candidates behind eval and holdout gates, reverting on
  failure.
- =autoresearch-routing-*= — evaluate, propose, harvest, and review
  orchestrator provider-routing improvements.
- =autoresearch-nelisp-codegen-*= — scaffold NeLisp Phase 47 codegen
  implementation tasks without editing the NeLisp repo from the MCP
  tool itself.

=M-x anvil-autoresearch-dashboard= opens a =tabulated-list= view of
current =autoresearch-*= orchestrator tasks.  The dashboard is
observational: =g= refreshes, =RET= opens the task plist; harvest,
apply, and memory promotion remain explicit tool calls.

** Claude Code watchdog (optional, Linux)

=anvil-claude-watchdog= watches Claude Code sessions from outside the
TUI using Linux =/proc= counters and jsonl mtimes.  It detects the
classic "stream still alive but UI/jsonl stopped" stall, plus the
State=S spinner variant where tracked MCP child processes stop
advancing both =rchar= and =wchar=.  Events are recorded through
=anvil-state= and can trigger desktop notification.

Recovery is manual by design.  =M-x anvil-claude-watchdog-recover=
asks for confirmation, sends =SIGKILL= to the selected stuck process,
derives =claude --resume <session-id>= from the jsonl basename, and
stages that command in the matching tmux pane without pressing Enter.

** Memory module (optional) — indexing auto-memory across AI CLIs

The =memory= module is an opt-in, provider-agnostic index over
every =.md= auto-memory file on disk, so any MCP client (Claude
Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Continue, Aider, Cline, Cursor, …)
can share the same long-term context.

Enable it:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'anvil-optional-modules 'memory)
(anvil-enable)   ; reload the module set
#+end_src

Then index everything currently on disk:

#+begin_src text
;; From Emacs:
M-x anvil-memory-scan

;; From an MCP client:
call the `memory-scan' tool (no args)
#+end_src

=memory-scan= walks every directory matched by
=anvil-memory-provider-paths= (default below), inserts one row per
=.md= (=MEMORY.md= index files are skipped), and refreshes the FTS5
body index.  It is idempotent — existing =access_count= /
=validity_prior= rows are preserved on conflict, so you can rerun
it anytime.

Default provider map (edit to add your own):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq anvil-memory-provider-paths
      '((claude   . "~/.claude/projects/*/memory")
        (codex    . "~/.codex/memories")
        (gemini   . "~/.gemini/memories")
        (continue . "~/.continue/memories")
        (aider    . "~/.aider/memories")
        (cline    . "~/.cline/memories")
        (cursor   . "~/.cursor/memories")
        (windsurf . "~/.windsurf/memories")
        (zed      . "~/.config/zed/memories")))
#+end_src

Patterns may contain =*= globs.  Non-existent expansions are
dropped silently, so adding a provider you have not installed
costs nothing.  Set =anvil-memory-roots= to a fixed list when you
want to override auto-detection entirely (tests / sandboxes use
this).

Once indexed, all of the normal tools operate across providers in
a single SQLite DB (=~/.emacs.d/anvil-memory-index.db=):

- =memory-search QUERY= — FTS5 full-text across every provider's
  memory body (=:limit=, =:type= keyword filters supported).
- =memory-audit= — TTL check; =:with_urls t= pings reference
  URLs via =anvil-http-head=.
- =memory-list= — all rows with optional =:with-decay t
  :sort 'decay= ranking.
- =memory-save-check SUBJECT BODY= — Jaccard top-N duplicate
  candidates before you write a new memory (provider-agnostic).
- =memory-duplicates= — cross-provider near-duplicate pairs.
- =memory-promote OLD NEW-TYPE= — rename + re-index, useful
  when a row that started as =project_= matures into =user_=.
- =memory-regenerate-index= — emit a fresh =MEMORY.md= body
  sorted by decay-score (read-only output; the caller decides
  whether to write).
- =memory-add= / =memory-get= / =memory-export-md= — DB-primary
  write/read/export path.  New memories can be inserted straight
  into SQLite, fetched without reading the backing =.md= file, and
  rendered back to a Markdown file when another AI needs file-based
  interchange.
- =memory-session-delta= / =memory-stop-sync= — WHISPER session
  context.  The first call returns a full decay-ranked index; later
  calls return only added / changed / removed memory rows until the
  delta grows too large.
- =memory-harvest-candidates= — review-only extraction of durable
  memory candidates from session text or transcripts.  It never
  persists by itself; the caller decides which candidates to save.

Non-Claude clients reach these by connecting to the same anvil
MCP server.  The ordinary scan/search/list/audit path is read-only
against provider-managed =.md= files; mutations are explicit
(=memory-promote= rename, =memory-add= DB insert, or
=memory-export-md= caller-driven Markdown export).

*** DB location and cross-machine sharing

The metadata DB defaults to =<user-emacs-directory>/anvil-memory-index.db=.
You can redirect a machine to a notes repo-local DB without symlinks:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq anvil-memory-shared-db-roots
      '("~/Cowork/Notes"))
#+end_src

When =anvil-memory-db-path= is left at its default, the open path
is resolved on first DB access by checking, in order:

1. =ANVIL_MEMORY_DB= environment variable
2. =anvil-memory-db-path= (when explicitly customized)
3. First entry of =anvil-memory-shared-db-roots= containing
   =.anvil-memory/anvil-memory-index.db=
4. Default =<user-emacs-directory>/anvil-memory-index.db=

Use =(anvil-memory-effective-db-path)= to confirm which path the
module is using.

Do not merge one SQLite file between multiple machines through git.
The current operational model is:

- keep the =.anvil-memory/*.db= files per machine and gitignored;
- use =memory-export-md= when a DB-direct memory should become a
  file-based artifact for other AIs;
- let =memory-scan= re-index those exported files on another
  machine.

This avoids binary merge conflicts and stale open SQLite handles in
long-lived Emacs daemons.

*** Memory bridge — cross-AI and mobile access

The =memory-bridge= optional module puts a small localhost JSON API in
front of =anvil-memory= and =anvil-worklog=.  This is for clients that
cannot speak the Emacs MCP server directly: browser chat UIs, mobile
thin clients, another machine over Tailscale, or a read replica.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'anvil-optional-modules 'memory)
(add-to-list 'anvil-optional-modules 'worklog)
(add-to-list 'anvil-optional-modules 'memory-bridge)
(anvil-enable)
(anvil-memory-bridge-start)
#+end_src

Default binding is =127.0.0.1:8730=.  Read endpoints include
=/memory/search=, =/memory/list=, =/memory/get/<name>=,
=/memory/events=, =/worklog/search=, =/worklog/list=, and
=/worklog/get=.  Mutating memory endpoints require
=Authorization: Bearer <token>=; rotate the token with
=M-x anvil-memory-bridge-rotate-token=.

Two thin clients live under =extensions/=:

- =extensions/memory-bridge/= — Manifest V3 browser extension for
  Claude.ai, ChatGPT, and Gemini.  =Ctrl+Alt+M= searches/injects
  memory; =Ctrl+Alt+S= saves selected text.
- =extensions/mobile-bridge/= — dependency-free static mobile app.
  It stores bridge URL/token in =localStorage= and queues failed
  saves for replay when back online.

Read-replica mode is intentionally single-writer: replicas can pull
primary =memory_event= rows, but local mutating endpoints return =409=
so two machines do not silently diverge.

** Worklog module (optional)

The =worklog= module indexes AI work logs separately from long-term
memory.  It can scan legacy =capture/ai-logs-*.org= archives, but new
entries are DB-primary via =worklog-add= rather than manual org
appends.  Search/list/get are exposed as MCP tools and also through
=memory-bridge= for non-Emacs clients.

Like =memory=, =worklog= is intended to use a per-machine SQLite DB.
Use =worklog-export-org= when you want a human-readable org snapshot
for git or cross-machine interchange.  The 2026-05 develop branch also
teaches the long-lived daemon to detect when its SQLite file was
replaced or unlinked and reopen it automatically before the next DB
operation.

Typical use:

#+begin_src text
worklog-add(title, body)
worklog-search("Doc43 autoresearch")
worklog-get("anvil-worklog:db:linux-debian:2026", 1779295660)
worklog-export-org(machine, year)
#+end_src

** Git helpers

The =git= module is part of the default =anvil-modules= list.  It
exposes read-only git inspection tools under the shared
=emacs-eval= server id:

- =git-repo-root= — top-level directory for a directory path, nil
  outside a repo.
- =git-head-sha= — full or abbreviated HEAD commit.
- =git-branch-current= — current branch name, nil for detached.
- =git-log= — recent commits as =(hash, date, author, subject)=
  objects, capped at =anvil-git-log-default-count=.
- =git-diff-names= — paths changed between FROM and TO.
- =git-diff-stats= — structured =(files, insertions, deletions)=
  counts.
- =git-status= — branch / upstream / ahead / behind + buckets of
  staged / modified / untracked / unmerged paths.
- =git-worktree-list= — attached worktrees with =(path, head,
  branch, bare, detached)=.

The Elisp API adds =anvil-git-worktree-add= and
=anvil-git-worktree-remove= (write operations, deliberately not
exposed via MCP — =anvil-orchestrator= uses them to isolate
parallel tasks).  Every call runs =git --no-pager -c
core.quotepath=false ...= so Japanese paths round-trip cleanly
and pager-configured repos don't leak terminal escapes.

** HTTP module (optional)

The =http= module is a thin wrapper around Emacs' built-in
=url-retrieve-synchronously= that adds a SQLite-backed ETag/TTL cache
(via =anvil-state=).  It is the right tool for static HTTP/JSON
resources where a full browser session would be wasteful — REST APIs,
=.json= endpoints that JS-challenge Chrome, RSS feeds, public docs
polling.

Add =http= to =anvil-optional-modules=.  The registered tools are:

- =http-fetch= — GET with cache awareness.  Within
  =anvil-http-cache-ttl-sec= (default 300 s) the response is served
  without any network call; otherwise a conditional GET with
  =If-None-Match= / =If-Modified-Since= is issued and a =304= refreshes
  the cached entry with zero body transfer.  Retries =5xx= / =408= /
  =429= with exponential backoff (=Retry-After= honoured on 429).
- =http-head= — HEAD probe for cheap metadata checks; never cached.
- =http-cache-clear= — drop a single URL or flush the whole http
  namespace.

Scheme guard: only =http= / =https= are accepted
(=anvil-http-allowed-schemes=), so =file://= / =javascript:= are
refused.  =url-max-redirections= is clamped to 5 per call, well below
Emacs' default 30.

Requires Emacs 29+ (for the built-in =sqlite-*= used by =anvil-state=).

* Client setup — connecting your AI to Anvil

After Anvil is running inside Emacs, you need to register it as
an MCP server in your AI client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code CLI, Codex CLI,
or any other MCP-compatible client).

The bridge is a small shell script (=anvil-stdio.sh=) that speaks
JSON-RPC on stdio and forwards calls to your running Emacs daemon
via =emacsclient=. Install it once per machine:

#+begin_src
M-x anvil-server-install
#+end_src

By default this places =anvil-stdio.sh= in your =user-emacs-directory=
(typically =~/.emacs.d/=). You can change the destination with
=M-x customize-variable RET anvil-server-install-directory=.

*Prerequisite:* Emacs must be running as a daemon
(=server-start= or =emacs --daemon=). Anvil connects to it via
=emacsclient=.

** Claude Desktop

Config file location:

| OS                | Path                                                                                        |
|-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| macOS             | =~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json=                           |
| Linux             | =~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json=                                               |
| Windows (regular) | =%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json=                                               |
| Windows (UWP)     | =%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Claude_<id>\LocalCache\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json= |

Anvil currently registers tools under *two* MCP server-ids
internally — =anvil= (eval / IDE) and =emacs-eval= (file, org,
buffer, worker, ...). Most clients show one tool list per
=mcpServers= entry, so you need *two entries* pointing at the
same script with different =--server-id= values to expose every
tool. (A future release will collapse these into a single
server-id; for now, two entries is the supported setup.)

*** macOS / Linux

#+begin_src json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anvil": {
      "command": "/path/to/.emacs.d/anvil-stdio.sh",
      "args": [
        "--server-id=anvil",
        "--init-function=anvil-enable",
        "--stop-function=anvil-disable"
      ]
    },
    "anvil-emacs-eval": {
      "command": "/path/to/.emacs.d/anvil-stdio.sh",
      "args": [
        "--server-id=emacs-eval"
      ]
    }
  }
}
#+end_src

The second entry connects to the already-running daemon and
exposes the file/org/buffer/worker tools. =--init-function= is
only needed on one entry — the first connection enables anvil
and registers tools under both server-ids.

If your Emacs daemon uses a non-default socket directory, add
=--socket=/path/to/server= to the =args= of *both* entries.

*** Windows

Windows needs Git Bash to execute the shell script:

#+begin_src json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anvil": {
      "command": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe",
      "args": [
        "C:/Users/<you>/.emacs.d/anvil-stdio.sh",
        "--server-id=anvil",
        "--init-function=anvil-enable",
        "--stop-function=anvil-disable"
      ]
    },
    "anvil-emacs-eval": {
      "command": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe",
      "args": [
        "C:/Users/<you>/.emacs.d/anvil-stdio.sh",
        "--server-id=emacs-eval"
      ]
    }
  }
}
#+end_src

Restart Claude Desktop after editing the config.

** Claude Code (CLI)

The CLI stores its config in =~/.claude.json= mixed with chat
history and other state — *do not overwrite the whole file*.
Use the =claude mcp add= command to add the server entries.
Run *both* commands to expose all tools:

#+begin_src sh
claude mcp add -s user -t stdio anvil -- \
  ~/.emacs.d/anvil-stdio.sh \
  --server-id=anvil \
  --init-function=anvil-enable \
  --stop-function=anvil-disable

claude mcp add -s user -t stdio anvil-emacs-eval -- \
  ~/.emacs.d/anvil-stdio.sh \
  --server-id=emacs-eval
#+end_src

On Windows, replace the script path with the Git Bash invocation
shown above (=command= = bash.exe, first =arg= = the script path).

** Codex CLI

Codex CLI can use the same MCP stdio bridge. Register both server
entries, mirroring the Claude Code setup: one =anvil= entry that
initializes the daemon, and one =anvil-emacs-eval= entry that exposes
file/org/buffer/worker plus optional tools such as =shell-run=,
=shell-filter=, =context-compress=, =context-retrieve=, and
=context-stats=.

If you manage Codex MCP servers through =codex mcp add=:

#+begin_src sh
codex mcp add anvil -- \
  ~/.emacs.d/anvil-stdio.sh \
  --server-id=anvil \
  --init-function=anvil-enable \
  --stop-function=anvil-disable

codex mcp add anvil-emacs-eval -- \
  ~/.emacs.d/anvil-stdio.sh \
  --server-id=emacs-eval
#+end_src

If your Codex version uses project/global =config.toml= instead,
create equivalent stdio MCP entries with the same command and args.
The important part is that the =emacs-eval= entry is present; the
compression tools live there.

** Optional: register the worker pool too

For workloads that benefit from out-of-band execution (large
tangles, multi-MB org scans, byte-compile), Anvil's worker module
runs sub-Emacs daemons. You can register one as a separate MCP
server so the AI client can address it directly:

#+begin_src json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anvil": { ... main daemon ... },
    "anvil-worker": {
      "command": "/path/to/.emacs.d/anvil-stdio.sh",
      "args": [
        "--socket=/path/to/.emacs.d/server/anvil-worker",
        "--server-id=anvil-worker"
      ]
    }
  }
}
#+end_src

Most users do not need this — Anvil's =worker= module dispatches
heavy ops automatically over the main connection.

** Verifying the connection

Inside Emacs:

| Command                       | What it shows                                  |

In your AI client: ask the agent to list its tools, or invoke a
read-only one like =anvil-host-info=. If the call returns, the
bridge is working.

* Teaching your AI to use Anvil — AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md guidance

Connecting Anvil only exposes the tools — your AI agent still
needs to *prefer* them over its built-in =Read= / =Edit= / =Write=
to realize the token savings described above. Most LLM clients
read a project-level instructions file (Codex uses =AGENTS.md=,
Claude Code uses =CLAUDE.md=, Cursor uses =.cursorrules=, etc.).
Drop the snippet below into yours.

** Recommended snippet (=AGENTS.md= / Claude Code =CLAUDE.md=)

#+begin_src markdown
## File editing

Prefer Anvil MCP tools over the built-in Read/Edit/Write
whenever they apply. They ship only the delta, batch multiple
edits in one round trip, and avoid full-file reads.

- `anvil-file-batch` — 3+ edits to the same file (collapse into one call)
- `anvil-file-replace-string` / `anvil-file-replace-regexp` —
  pinpoint replacement; no need to read the whole file first
- `anvil-file-insert-at-line` / `anvil-file-delete-lines` /
  `anvil-file-append` — localized line-level operations

Use the built-in `Edit` only for small one-off changes. For 3 or
more edits to the same file, always use `anvil-file-batch`.

## org-mode

For section moves, refile, splits, or reading a single heading
from a large org file, use `anvil-org-*` tools instead of
Read+Write. They are 10–20× cheaper in tokens.

- `anvil-org-read-headline` — read a single subtree
- `anvil-org-read-outline` — outline view without bodies
- `anvil-org-edit-body` / `anvil-org-rename-headline` /
  `anvil-org-update-todo-state` — targeted org edits

## Heavy operations — worker dispatch

Long-running Emacs ops (large tangles, byte-compile, multi-MB
org scans, full-tree searches) must not run on the main daemon —
they block every other tool call. Dispatch them through the
worker pool instead.

- Elisp called from inside Anvil: prefer `anvil-worker-call` over
  raw `eval` for anything that may exceed ~1s.
- If the worker is registered as its own MCP server (see README
  "Optional: register the worker pool too"), heavy `eval` calls
  should target `mcp__anvil-worker__eval` directly so the main
  session stays responsive.

Symptom that you should have used the worker: the main MCP
session stops accepting tool calls for several seconds.

## Scheduled tasks (cron)

If `anvil-cron` tasks are configured (lint, health checks, batch
indexers, etc.), do not re-implement their work ad hoc. Inspect
and trigger them through the cron MCP tools:

- `anvil-cron-list` — what tasks exist and their schedules
- `anvil-cron-status` — last run time, status, recent failures
- `anvil-cron-run` — fire a registered task on demand

Before writing a new ad-hoc script, check `anvil-cron-list` —
the job may already be defined.

## Context and output compression

When command output or retrieved context is long, compress it before
feeding it back into the main reasoning loop.

- Use `shell-run` for shell commands whose stdout can be filtered
  automatically. It returns compressed stdout plus a `tee-id`; recover
  the raw output with `shell-tee-get` only when the compressed view is
  insufficient.
- Use `context-compress` for non-shell text: API JSON, RAG snippets,
  web/article extracts, logs from another tool, diffs, or code
  excerpts. Set `store=true` when the raw text may be needed later;
  recover it with `context-retrieve` and the returned `ccr-id`.
- Use `context-stats` / `shell-gain` to inspect savings instead of
  guessing whether the compression layer is helping.

Do not use compressed views as the only source of truth for legal,
financial, safety-critical, or exact numeric work. Retrieve the raw
context before making claims that depend on exact wording or values.

** Self-reinforcement rule (optional)

To keep the agent on track over long sessions, add a
self-correction trigger:

#+begin_src markdown
## MCP tool self-reinforcement

If during a task you notice any of the following, switch to
the appropriate Anvil tool before continuing:

- The same elisp pattern is being written twice in one session
- Three or more `anvil-eval` calls were issued for one logical edit
  (a single `anvil-file-batch` would have sufficed)
- Repeated full-file Reads of the same large file
- A heavy elisp op blocked the main session — should have been
  routed via `anvil-worker-call` / `mcp__anvil-worker__eval`

Course-correct mid-task — do not wait until the end.
#+end_src

** Why this matters

Without explicit guidance, agents default to the lowest-common-
denominator tools (=Read=, =Edit=, =Write=) regardless of which
MCP servers are connected. The savings table at the top of this
README assumes the agent actually *picks* the Anvil tool — and
that decision is driven by your instructions file, not by Anvil
itself.

* FAQ — how does this compare to…?

** …claude-code-ide?

They solve different problems and coexist well. =claude-code-ide=
brings Claude Code's interactive UI /into/ Emacs via eat; its MCP
surface is primarily IDE-oriented (xref / diagnostics / buffer
metadata). For file edits it leans on Claude Code's built-in Read /
Edit / Write against the filesystem.

Anvil goes the opposite direction: it's a standalone MCP server
exposing /Emacs itself/ — file ops, org primitives, worker dispatch,
elisp introspection — to any MCP client. In practice I run both:
claude-code-ide for the inline Claude session inside Emacs, and anvil
as a separate MCP server that both claude-code-ide /and/ the
standalone ~claude~ CLI can call into.

** …an "arbitrary elisp eval" MCP?

Single-eval MCPs (e.g. [[https://github.com/steveyegge/efrit][efrit]]) are philosophically pure: zero
client-side intelligence, the agent writes elisp for every task. The
trade-off is /permission granularity/ — a single eval tool can't be
marked =:read-only=, so you can't auto-approve reads while gating
writes.

Anvil's default install exposes ~40 named primitives.  Optional modules add their own when enabled (max upper bound depends on which modules you load)., each registered with an explicit
=:read-only= hint where applicable. In Claude Code that maps cleanly
onto =/permissions=: auto-approve ~org-read-outline~, ~file-read~,
~elisp-describe-function~; force a prompt on ~file-batch~,
~org-edit-body~, ~file-replace-string~. Anvil still ships
~emacs-eval~ and ~emacs-eval-async~ as escape hatches — they just
aren't the 80% path.

** …calling =emacsclient= from bash?

That was my starting point too. Reasons I moved off it:

- *No permission granularity.* Every =emacsclient -e '...'= is opaque
  to =/permissions= — it's all "Bash". With MCP each named tool
  registers a =:read-only= hint so the client can auto-approve reads
  and prompt on writes.
- *No schema.* The agent has to remember the elisp surface from
  prompt; MCP publishes the tool list in the system schema so the
  right tool gets picked without being reminded each turn.
- *Escape hell.* Multi-line elisp through bash quoting is famously
  fragile, especially with Japanese paths or regex.
- *Structured returns.* MCP tools return typed JSON; =emacsclient=
  returns a printed sexp you have to parse.

Same Emacs underneath; the MCP layer is just a typed, permissioned
facade.

** …org-mcp?

[[https://github.com/laurynas-biveinis/org-mcp][Org-mcp]] focuses tightly on org editing primitives over MCP. Anvil
bundles those primitives (with extensions and bug fixes) and adds the
file / subprocess / heavy-op / worker-pool layers, so a single MCP
server covers an entire workflow rather than just org. If you're
already happy with org-mcp on its own, anvil isn't a replacement —
it's the same idea wearing a bigger coat.

** …I've never touched Emacs before. Is that OK?

Yes. Anvil is an MCP server that runs as a background daemon — you
never have to open an Emacs window. Keep using whatever editor you
already use (VSCode / Cursor / Neovim / Claude Code / Codex CLI itself).

What you actually need:

- Install Emacs once and confirm =emacs --version= works
- Run it as =--fg-daemon= (a launcher script ships with the repo)
- Add a single block to your AI client's MCP config

A full walkthrough lives in [[https://github.com/zawatton/anvil.el#for-non-emacs-users--what-setup-costs-you][For non-Emacs users]]. No Emacs Lisp
knowledge required to capture the AI-token savings.

* How to help shape what comes next

If something in this README resonates with you, the most useful signals are these four:

- A *Star* on the repo — it lets me see what kind of context lands.
- An *Issue* describing your concrete org / MCP workflow — that decides which primitives I add next.
- Honest comparisons with [[https://github.com/laurynas-biveinis/org-mcp][org-mcp]] or any existing MCP shim I might have unknowingly reinvented.
- Tool naming and granularity feedback — is there "too many small ops," or is it "about right"? Your gut take helps a lot.
