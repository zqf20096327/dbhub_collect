# 1. Introduction to PHP

Basic PHP syntax:

```php
<?php

// Body of code

?>
```

### Important Points

- `echo` is used to display a message on the screen.
- `<br>` can be used to add a line break.
- `//` is used for a single-line comment.
- `/* */` is used for a multiline comment.
- PHP files can contain:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - PHP
- In supported editors, typing `!` and pressing `Tab` can generate HTML boilerplate code.

# 2. Variables in PHP

A variable is a reusable container that stores data.

Variables can hold:

- String
- Integer
- Float
- Boolean

### Boolean Values

When a Boolean value is displayed:

- `true` is displayed as `1`
- `false` displays nothing

Boolean values are commonly used inside:

- Conditional statements
- Loops

### Escape Sequence

Use the escape sequence `\` when you need to display a dollar sign inside a message involving variables.

# 3. Operators in PHP

## Arithmetic Operators

```text
+
-
*
/
**
%
```

## Increment and Decrement Operators

```text
++
--
```

## Operator Precedence

PHP evaluates operators in the following order:

```text
()
**
* / %
+ -
```

---

# 4. GET & POST

`$_GET` and `$_POST` are special variables used to collect data submitted through HTML forms.

Example:

```html
<form action="some_file.php" method="get">
```

---

## $_GET

With GET:

- Data is appended to the URL.
- It is not secure for sensitive information.
- There is a character limit.
- URLs can be bookmarked with their values.
- GET requests can be cached.
- GET is useful for search pages.

---

## $_POST

With POST:

- Data is packaged inside the body of the HTTP request.
- It is more secure than GET for sending data.
- There is no data limit mentioned in these notes.
- Requests cannot be bookmarked with submitted values.
- Requests are not cached.
- POST is better suited for submitting credentials.

# 5. Math-Related Functions

PHP provides several built-in mathematical functions.

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `abs($x)` | Returns the absolute value of `$x` |
| `round($x)` | Returns the rounded value |
| `floor($x)` | Rounds a value down |
| `ceil($x)` | Rounds a value up |
| `pow($x, $y)` | Returns `$x` raised to the power `$y` |
| `sqrt($x)` | Returns the square root |
| `max($x, $y, $z)` | Returns the maximum value |
| `min($x, $y, $z)` | Returns the minimum value |
| `pi()` | Returns the value of Pi |
| `rand()` | Returns a random value |
| `rand(min, max)` | Returns a random value between the given range |

---

# 6. If Statements

An `if` statement executes code when a specified condition is true.

If the condition is false, the associated code is not executed.

### Important Points

- The order of `if` and `else` conditions matters.
- Conditional statements can work with Boolean variables.

> 💻 **Click Here to See the Code:** [View Code](https://github.com/zeeshan020dev/4-Hours-Of-PHP/blob/main/07.%20If%20Statements/7.%20If%20Statements.php)
---

# 7. Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

There are three main logical operators.

| Operator | Symbol | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AND | `&&` | True when both conditions are true |
| OR | `\|\|` | True when at least one condition is true |
| NOT | `!` | Reverses the Boolean value |

### NOT Operator

```text
true  → false
false → true
```

---

# 8. Switch Statements

A `switch` statement can be used as an alternative to writing many `elseif` statements.

Benefits mentioned in the notes:

- Requires less code
- Can make multiple-condition logic easier to manage

---

# 9. For Loop

A `for` loop repeats a block of code a specified number of times.

It is useful when you already know approximately how many times the code should execute.

> 💻 **Click Here to See the Code:** [View Code](https://github.com/zeeshan020dev/4-Hours-Of-PHP/blob/main/10.%20For%20Loop/10.%20For%20Loop.php)
---

# 10. While Loop

A `while` loop also repeats code.

Its purpose is similar to a `for` loop, but its syntax and control structure are different.

The syntax is similar to loops commonly used in languages such as C++.

> 💻 **Click Here to See the Code:** [View Code](https://github.com/zeeshan020dev/4-Hours-Of-PHP/blob/main/11.%20While%20Loop/11.%20While%20Loop.php)
---

# 11. isset() Function

`isset()` checks whether a variable exists and is not `NULL`.

Example:

```php
isset($var)
```

It returns:

- `true` if `$var` has been declared and is not `NULL`
- `false` otherwise

---

## Multiple Variables

You can check several variables at once:

```php
isset($a, $b, $c)
```

The function returns `true` only if all variables:

- Exist
- Are not `NULL`

---

## Checking Array Elements

Example:

```php
isset($_POST["stop"])
```

This returns `true` only when:

- The `stop` key exists
- Its value is not `NULL`

---

## Important Note

`isset()` does not determine whether a value is empty or false-like.

Values such as:

```text
0
""
false
```

are still considered set because they are not `NULL`.

Think of `isset()` as a:

> Presence + non-null check

---

# 12. Arrays

An array is a variable that can hold more than one value at a time.

Arrays can be declared using:

```php
array()
```

---

## Common Array Functions

### array_push()

Adds one or more elements to the end of an array.

```php
array_push($array, $value);
```

---

### array_pop()

Removes the last element.

```php
array_pop($array);
```

---

### array_shift()

Removes the first element.

```php
array_shift($array);
```

---

### array_reverse()

Reverses the order of an array.

```php
array_reverse($array);
```

The returned array can be stored inside another variable and traversed using a `foreach` loop.

---

### count()

Returns the number of elements inside an array.

```php
count($array);
```

> 💻 **Click Here to See the Code:** [View Code](https://github.com/zeeshan020dev/4-Hours-Of-PHP/blob/main/12.%20Arrays/12.%20Arrays.php)
---

# 13. Associative Arrays

An associative array stores information using:

```text
key => value
```

Examples:

```text
country => capital
id      => username
item    => price
```

---

## Useful Associative Array Functions

### array_pop()

Removes the last element.

```php
array_pop($array);
```

---

### array_shift()

Removes the first element.

```php
array_shift($array);
```

---

### array_keys()

Returns the keys of an associative array.

```php
array_keys($array);
```

Store the result in a variable and traverse it using a `foreach` loop.

---

### array_values()

Returns the values of an associative array.

```php
array_values($array);
```

---

### array_flip()

Swaps keys and values.

```php
array_flip($array);
```

# 15. Radio Buttons

When multiple radio buttons belong to the same group, their `name` attribute should be the same.

This allows the user to select only one option from that group.

> 💻 **Click Here to See the Code:** [View Code](https://github.com/zeeshan020dev/4-Hours-Of-PHP/blob/main/17.%20Radio%20Buttons/17.%20Radio%20Buttons.php)
---

# 16. Checkboxes

Basic checkbox syntax:

```html
<input type="checkbox" name="" value="">
```

To work with multiple checkbox values as an array, assign the same name and add `[]`.

Example structure:

```html
<input type="checkbox" name="items[]" value="">
```

# 17. Functions

Functions allow you to:

> Write code once and reuse it whenever needed.

A function is invoked by writing its name followed by parentheses.

Example:

```php
add();
```

# 21. Cookies

A cookie stores information about a user inside the user's web browser.

Cookies may be used for:

- Browsing preferences
- Targeted advertisements
- Other non-sensitive information

PHP uses the `setcookie()` function to create cookies.

Cookies can be accessed through the `$_COOKIE` superglobal.

---

## Cookie Syntax

```php
setcookie(
    "key",
    "value",
    expiration_time,
    file_path
);
```

Expiration time can be calculated using:

```php
time()
```

---

## Inspecting Cookies in the Browser

Cookies can usually be inspected through browser developer tools.

Typical process:

```text
Right Click
    ↓
Inspect
    ↓
Application
    ↓
Storage
    ↓
Cookies
```

You can also open developer tools using:

```text
F12
```

and navigate to the Application section.

---

## Expiring a Cookie

The expiration time can be changed to expire a cookie.

Cookies can be accessed using:

```php
$_COOKIE
```

The values can also be traversed as:

```text
$key => $value
```

using a `foreach` loop.

---

# 22. Sessions

A session is used to store information about a user across multiple pages.

For example:

```text
User Login
    ↓
Session Created
    ↓
Session ID Assigned
    ↓
User moves between pages
    ↓
User remains logged in
```

A common example is remaining logged into a website while navigating between different pages.

---

## Starting a Session

```php
session_start();
```

---

## Session Superglobal

```php
$_SESSION
```

It can be used to store session information such as user credentials.

---

## Redirecting to Another Page

```php
header("Location: filename.php");
```

---

## Destroying a Session

```php
session_destroy();
```

This can be used when a user logs out.

> 💻 **Click Here to See the Code:** [View Code](https://github.com/zeeshan020dev/4-Hours-Of-PHP/tree/main/24.%20Sessions)
---

# 23. Server Variables

`$_SERVER` is a PHP superglobal containing information related to:

- Headers
- Paths
- Script locations
- Web server environment

It behaves like an associative array.

Example:

```php
$_SERVER[]
```

---

## PHP_SELF

```php
$_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]
```

Represents the location of the current PHP page.

When used inside a form action, it can automatically reflect the current filename.

The notes recommend enclosing it with `htmlspecialchars()` to help avoid cross-site scripting issues.

---

## REQUEST_METHOD

```php
$_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"]
```

This can be used to determine whether the current request uses:

```text
GET
```

or:

```text
POST
```

By default, a page request is GET.

After a form configured with the POST method is submitted, the request method becomes POST.

---

# 24. Hashing

Hashing transforms sensitive information, such as passwords, into a different representation consisting of letters, numbers, and symbols through a mathematical process.

Hashing is technically different from encryption.

It can be used to help prevent the original password from being directly exposed.

---

## password_hash()

Use:

```php
password_hash($string, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);
```

### Parameters

**First parameter**

The original string or password.

```php
$string
```

**Second parameter**

The hashing algorithm or algorithm-related constant.

```php
PASSWORD_DEFAULT
```

---

## password_verify()

Used to compare a plain-text password against its stored hash.

```php
password_verify();
```

It returns either:

```text
true
```

or:

```text
false
```

depending on whether the password matches.

# 25. Connecting PHP to MySQL

There are two commonly used approaches mentioned in the notes:

1. MySQLi Extension
2. PDO — PHP Data Objects

For this beginner course, the notes use **MySQLi**.

---

## phpMyAdmin

When using XAMPP, phpMyAdmin can typically be accessed from:

```text
localhost/phpmyadmin
```

It can also be opened through the **Admin** option in the XAMPP Control Panel.

---

## mysqli_connect()

Used to connect PHP with the database.

```php
mysqli_connect(
    $db_server,
    $db_user,
    $db_password,
    $db_name
);
```

### Parameters

```php
$db_server
$db_user
$db_password
$db_name
```

---

## Reusing the Database Connection

The connection file can be included inside another PHP file.

```php
include("Connection Filename.php");
```

This avoids rewriting the connection logic.

# 26. Creating a Table Using phpMyAdmin

phpMyAdmin provides a graphical interface for creating and managing MySQL databases and tables.

Follow these steps to create a table, configure its columns, insert data manually, and manage records.

---

## Step 1: Open phpMyAdmin

1. Start **Apache** and **MySQL** from the XAMPP Control Panel.
2. Open your browser.
3. Navigate to:

```text
http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
````

4. phpMyAdmin will open in your browser.

---

## Step 2: Create or Select a Database

1. Click **Databases** from the top navigation bar.
2. If you already have a database, select it.
3. If you do not have one:

   * Enter a database name.
   * Click **Create**.
   * Select the newly created database.

```text
phpMyAdmin
    ↓
Databases
    ↓
Create / Select Database
```

---

## Step 3: Create a New Table

After selecting the database:

1. Enter the **table name**.
2. Specify the **number of columns** required.
3. Click **Create**.

Example:

```text
Table Name: users
Number of Columns: 5
```

---

## Step 4: Configure Table Columns

phpMyAdmin will display a form where you can define each column.

In the **Name** field, enter the name of each column.

Example structure:

| Column       | Type       | Length | Index     | A_I |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------ | --------- | --- |
| `id`         | `INT`      | —      | `PRIMARY` | ✅   |
| `username`   | `VARCHAR`  | —      | —         | —   |
| `password`   | `CHAR`     | `255`  | —         | —   |
| `email`      | `VARCHAR`  | —      | —         | —   |
| `created_at` | `DATETIME` | —      | —         | —   |

---

## Step 5: Configure the ID Column

For an ID column:

1. Set the column name, for example:

```text
id
```

2. Set its type to:

```text
INT
```

3. Set the **Index** to:

```text
PRIMARY
```

4. Enable:

```text
A_I
```

`A_I` stands for **Auto Increment**.

This automatically increases the ID whenever a new row is inserted.

Example:

```text
1
2
3
4
5
...
```

---

## Step 6: Select Appropriate Data Types

Different types of data require different MySQL data types.

### VARCHAR

`VARCHAR` is used for storing characters or strings.

Examples:

```text
username
email
name
address
```

Example:

```text
VARCHAR
```

---

### INT

`INT` is used for storing integer numbers.

Examples:

```text
id
age
quantity
```

Example:

```text
INT
```

---

### CHAR

In this project, `CHAR` is used for storing the password after applying a hashing algorithm.

Example:

```text
CHAR(255)
```

The length is set to:

```text
255
```

---

### DATETIME

`DATETIME` is used for storing both date and time.

Example:

```text
DATETIME
```

For the default value, use:

```text
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
```

This can automatically store the current date and time when a new row is created.

---

## Step 7: Preview the SQL Query

Before creating the table:

1. Click **Preview SQL**.
2. phpMyAdmin will display the SQL query that will be executed.

This allows you to review the SQL statement before applying it.

Example structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(255),
    password CHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

---

## Step 8: Save the Table

After configuring all columns:

1. Review your settings.
2. Click **Save**.
3. phpMyAdmin will create the table.

The table will now appear under your selected database.

---

## Step 9: View the Table

To view the newly created table:

1. Select the table.

The index file can include it using:

```php
include("connection.php");
```

---

## mysqli_close()

Used to close the database connection.

```php
mysqli_close($connection);
```

---

## mysqli_query()

Used to submit an SQL query to the database.

```php
mysqli_query($connection, $query);
```

Parameters:

```text
$connection → Database connection
$query      → SQL query
```

# 28. Retrieve Data from MySQL

The SQL `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data.

Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user = 'Zeeshan';
```

---

## mysqli_num_rows()

Used to check how many rows were returned by a query.

```php
mysqli_num_rows($result);
```

---

## mysqli_fetch_assoc()

Used to retrieve the next row from a result as an associative array.

```php
mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);
```

---

## Retrieving Multiple Rows

A `while` loop can be used with:

```php
mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);
```

to process multiple rows.

---

## Database Retrieval Flow

```text
Write SQL Query
      ↓
Execute Query
      ↓
Receive Result Object
      ↓
Fetch Row
      ↓
Process Data
```

For multiple rows:

```text
SQL Query
    ↓
mysqli_query()
    ↓
$result
    ↓
while loop
    ↓
mysqli_fetch_assoc()
    ↓
Display each row
```
