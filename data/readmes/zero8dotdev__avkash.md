# Avkash

> **v2.0.0 — June 2026.** Complete rewrite. Bun + Hono + Drizzle + OpenFGA. The v1 Next.js app is preserved on the [`v1`](../../tree/v1) tag. v2 is API-only; the UI is in Avkash Cloud.

Open-core HR infrastructure for teams that need control over:

- Leave
- Attendance
- People data
- Organisation structure
- HR policies
- Field-level access

Avkash is built for companies where HR rules are not simple. Shifts, alternate Saturdays, location rules, probation, approvals, transfers, and access control all matter.

The public repo is the self-hostable core. Avkash Cloud is the commercial product with hosted UI, payroll, compliance, performance, and other private modules.

## Why Avkash

Most HR software is closed SaaS.

That can be a problem when:

- Employee data needs to stay under your control
- Company policies do not fit a generic workflow
- Attendance depends on shifts, devices, sites, or supervisors
- Leave rules vary by level, location, probation, or business unit
- You need to build custom HR workflows on top of a real backend

Avkash gives you a programmable HR core instead of a black box.

## What Is Open

The open core includes:

- **People** - employees, profiles, teams, roles, departments, business units, org levels
- **Leave** - requests, approvals, balances, accruals, comp-off, encashments, delegations, blackout periods
- **Attendance** - punches, shifts, workweeks, alternate Saturdays, supervisor flows, regularisation, overtime
- **Policies** - leave policies, applicability rules, level restrictions, holidays, location-aware rules
- **Access control** - OpenFGA-based relationship and field-level permissions
- **Notifications** - email and SMS dispatch with local fallbacks
- **Slack** - login and optional leave notifications
- **Multi-tenancy** - every request is scoped by `orgId`

The open core is meant to be useful by itself. It is not a demo repo.
