## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v24
- pnpm v12
- PostgreSQL v18

We recommend using [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage your Node.js and pnpm versions.

### Installation

- `pnpm install` to install dependencies for all apps and packages
- Check out the [@zoonk/db package README](./packages/db/README.md) for database setup instructions
- Check out the [main app README](./apps/main/README.md) for app-specific setup instructions

### Local Development

- `pnpm dev` to start every app through Portless. Routes include the clone name, such as `http://main.zoonk.localhost:1355`, and linked worktrees also receive a branch prefix
- `pnpm dev:lan` when testing from a phone or another device on the same trusted network. It prints the `.local` Main URL to open on that device, such as `http://main.zoonk.local:1356`
- `pnpm dev:direct` to bypass Portless and use the original fixed localhost ports
- `pnpm dev:prune` to let Portless remove orphaned servers left by crashed sessions. Stop active development stacks from the terminal where they are running
- `pnpm build` to create a production build
- `pnpm lint` to run linting
- `pnpm typecheck` to run TypeScript type checking
- `pnpm knip --production` to check for unused code
- `pnpm test` to run tests with Vitest
- `pnpm e2e` to run end-to-end tests with Playwright
- `pnpm i18n:lint` to run i18n linting
- `pnpm i18n` to translate missing i18n keys

### Working with Git worktrees

Codex runs `pnpm worktree:setup` automatically when creating a worktree. For other tools, run it once in the new worktree after `git worktree add`. It installs dependencies, generates Prisma, and prepares isolated development, test, and E2E databases when the primary checkout has a local `zoonk` database. Keep using `pnpm dev`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm e2e` normally.

See [worktree database setup](./packages/db/README.md#worktree-databases) for prerequisites, cleanup, and recovery.
